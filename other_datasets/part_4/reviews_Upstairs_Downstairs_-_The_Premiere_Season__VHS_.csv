0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AA9ZSOIWYST12	2CV	Not the caliber of Downton Abby, but none-the-less entertaining!  Most of the actors did a fine job and made the characters very believable. Season 2 was also just as good.  I think I will re-watch the original series from the 70s as it has been so many years.	4.0	Entertaining!	2013-05-14	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2E1EFNIZL2FVA	&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;	I stumbled onto this wonderful period series recently, never knowing or remembering that the masterpiece production dates back to the early 70s.  The show, however, takes place in the early 1900s in posh London.  It is truly a first class operation, fine acting, beautiful sets, superb period costumes, enthralling storylines, and just plain fun to watch; yes there is a share of humor.The premise of the show is the upperclass extremely wealthy family of four, parents and their two adult children. The adult children make their presence periodically, and the servants have their share of dramatic escapades in the lower part of the mansion.The characters are all memorable, engaging, and quite entertaining to absorb.  What makes this such an addictive series to watch is what you learn about how the wealthy and servants behave, perform,  and communicate.  The episodes take you several places without one getting over exposed by the same sets.  It is a wonderful lesson on historical periods.What's good is that you may need to use the subtitles, due to the accents, and just to learn so many new phrases and words that cover interesting topics that one is no familiar with.  The subtitles for Season One are very good, no gaps, and correct titles.Plus, the episodes are fast-paced, nothing drags, content is filled with dialogue.Once you start this, you just keep going into more and more.... I call it addicting.... Love it!  Rizzo.	5.0	Definitely a masterpiece!  How refreshing	2012-11-28	0	0	0

It covers that pre-war era very nicely in terms of behaviours and ignorance.  I can't get away from Edward Fox as Edward in Edward and Mrs Simpson in my mind so there was some personal conflict in watching the Mrs Simpson bit but overall not bad at all - certainly worth a watch	4.0	a new era of Upstairs Downstairs	2013-04-09	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A39E6ALXB9OARI	A Marine	I began watching Upstairs because I enjoy Dowton Abbey so much.  Judging from the first episode Upstairs it is lacking.The production values and the depth of the characters are Dowton 'lite&#34;.  In fairness the latter may improve with further episodes.  However, the characters in Dowton hooked me in episode 1.  In Upstairs I came away with no interest in what happened to the characters.I also believe that Amazon is trying to profit from Upstairs on the coat tails of Dowton.  While I watched the first three seasons of Dowton on Amazon Prime instant video, Amazon is charging $2 for each episode of Upstairs.  That's like giving you a great, free strawberry shortcake, and the next time charging you for just the bowl.I'm not buying the bowl.	3.0	It isn't Dowton Abbey	2013-10-11	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AOOCHD8YC7P9F	Amazon Customer	I am so glad I persevered through Season 1 Eps 1-4, for years I have heard of the greatness of Upstairs Downstairs so I had high expectations, I found Episodes 1-4 not very interesting don't let these episodes deter you, starting with Episode 5 the series picks up steam and just keeps going. I just finished Season Five and totally enjoyed the journey. Excellent characters: Mr Hudson, Mrs Bridges (my favorite), Rose, Edward, Ruby, Sir Bellamy and more interesting characters to come in future seasons. I give the series in its entirety five stars. I enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs just as much as I enjoy Downton Abbey.	5.0	Excellent Series - Don't Let Eps 1-4 Deter You.	2013-07-02	0	0	0

These days perfect plastic actors and actresses, big expensive sets, etc. dominate our media.  Yet there are very few programs that have a soul.  If you like Downton Abbey and have some patience/tolerance for an older show that is a little dated in terms of its look, then I cannot recommend this show more highly.  It is really a wonderful gem of a program.  I end up watching it again every few years and probably always will.

If you watched the original 'Upstairs, Downstairs' you'll enjoy this shorter version, but you'll find yourself hoping to see Mr Hudson, or Mrs. Bridges!

At first it felt very strange seeing a new family in 165 Eaton Place and 1930's interiors but the impeccable cast started to grow on us and realizing this is definitely a sequel, not a remake, made us embrace it fully.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3IRBCCB3I5PPD	"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile"""	The English class system is endlessly fascinating, especially when contrasting the difference between those in the drawing room and those behind the green baize door. This is why Upstairs Downstairs, both the original and the update, Manor House and Gosford Park have been so popular. Viewers can put themselves in the shoes of those both up and down.The new Upstairs Downstairs seeks to update a beloved classic and does a good job. Indeed, my only complaint is that this series was only three episodes long and we didn't get enough complexity in the stories. The story begins with aristocratic newlyweds moving into the family mansion on Eaton Place. The house is re-decorated in the moderne style and that and the costumes are worth the price of admission, especially to lovers of deco. The family is rounded out by relatives who come to stay, in this case, the husband's overbearing mother and the wife's trouble-making sister. German fascists were courting the English aristocracy throughout the thirties and into the forties and the English flirtation with fascism makes an appearance in the person of German Ambassador Ribbentrop and the attendance of the sister and chauffeur at fascist meetings. Jewish refugees come to the household in the form of a university professor turned upstairs maid and her daughter. The class system that will be completely swept away by the end of the war is examined from every perspective. The infamous Mrs. Simpson makes a delightful appearance and English ambivalence to her person and her role is well-played here.All of the elements of a great story are here, but the series is just too short. Episodes need to be longer and stories need to be further developed. Everything felt rushed. Comparison with the superior Downton Abbey are inevitable, but I think this has the potential to be just as good, provided the second season expands on the groundwork laid here.High marks to the costumer and set designer.	4.0	Good Update of a Classic	2012-01-03	2	1	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1AYNQ4Q8AZ0X	anonymous	"If you like ""Downton Abbey,"" you'll probably like this show because it's another serialized costume drama set in the early 20th century.  I prefer the characters and stories on ""Downton,"" but this show is entertaining in its own right.  Season 1 is very short (just 3 episodes).  Season 2 is twice as long and by the end I was pumped for a third season as Britain was on the brink of WWII.  Sadly, there won't be a Season 3.  I never saw the original ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" so I can't compare this to that one.  It wasn't until I was finished watching Season 2 that I learned two of the actors from the original series were a part of this updated version.  (I'm not sure if this series is a reboot or a continuation of the original series, but either way it was enjoyable.)

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2CM7LKTVEG77L	"Apollorising63 ""Apollorising63"""	While I am disappointed the series will not have a third season the plot development and believability took a nosedive when Jean Marsh sadly had to drop out of most of the second season as she suffered a stroke.  It became an entirely different series without her.  I read that the series was not sure if she would recover and be able to participate in the second season and they attempted to hold her spot open. It definitely suffered without her or a good script to bridge the gap.  It lost credibility especially in the last three episodes.  The ending was wholly unfortunate and unbelievable.  In the end I think Jean Marsh was only able to participate briefly in two episodes.  I would have liked to have seen a third season but while the ratings took a nose dive in the UK they remained steady in the USA.  I believe the decision to cancel was made before the second season was released in the USA and I wonder if they don't have regrets as it did well in the US market.  I have ambivalent feelings reviewing this series as I watched the original as a young boy and have very special memories of the original.  It probably deserves two starts but I can't find a way to do that to such a great cast and to the memory or the original series.  Watch it for yourself and decide.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AXSH6O4OP5L4M	"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen"""	"I'm sort of glad I started with the fifth season, because while I still enjoy the characters in their first season form, I have a greater appreciation for their incredible development as people over the course of the series.  Having seen the beloved cook Mrs. Bridges in her final form in Season Five, it was positively shocking to see her sell some of the household's food for her own personal gain.  I know that it was done at the time--it may well have been expected and accepted by employers--but I could hardly have imagined her doing so!  Had I watched the series from beginning to end as most people do, I would have missed this sense of personal growth and integrity, because I would already have forgotten the passing event by the end of the series.  That would have been sad.In Season One, the viewer is introduced to all the main characters.  Their edges are ""raw"" here, because they have yet to undergo the smoothing and sorting process that occurs among members of the same household.  The era is the very early 1900's and the costumes, manners and technology produce a sense of ambiance that is almost like being there.  The social inequities of the period are the central focus of this season, probably because it is the aspect of early twentieth century England most likely to come to mind to writers wanting to create a ""real"" experience for viewers.  Certainly to anyone steeped in Dickens as most of the contributers probably were, this would be the easiest theme to begin with for a new program.  This would also have been a good point to pick during the turbulant 1970s, when everything about society was (again) being questioned by the young of the time.Most of the season deals with the realities of being a poor person dependent upon a wealthy household for his or her well being.  The steep fall from the safety of a domestic position to destitution is made very clear.  The sacrifice of personal dignity or even physical integrity in order to avoid the crushing poverty of urban England is made abundantly clear by the events in the life of the house maid Sarah, the scullery maid Emily, and the footman Albert.  Much of the action seems to be seen from the perspective of the upper parlor maid, Rose, who throughout the seasons takes a very leading role in events both upstairs and downstairs. By using her as their foil, the writers manage to make the realities of the more unfortunate characters much more realistic.  Rose sees the rise and fall of many individuals in the household and clings tenaciously to the safety of her role in the house.  She is also witness to the frustrations of those above stairs, especially the younger members of the household who have a foot in both the old world of their elders and the new one that is being technologically forced on them.Above stairs, the social mores of the upper class reveal the extent to which they are also hamstrung by expectations and demands.  James Belamy is unable to find satisfaction in his role as heir.  The acceptable careers open to him are limited and framed by expectations.  Elizabeth, his sister, having acheived a level of education and social awareness that is not generally allowed in upper class women, struggles unsuccessfully with the social ills of her time, only to find she is not taken seriously and that she is completely unprepared for the realities of the poor or to make any effective changes in their condition.  She can only give them food and clothing, a bandaid on a situation that obviously requires major surgery!  Lady Marjorie--and indirectly her mother--a woman who has the mind and abilities of a man but who must work politically through her husband leads a pampered but rather boring life, waiting to host influential parties for her husband.  Her husband Richard, is a man of common origins made 1st viscount Bellamy.  His upbringing as a middle class person--son of a minister--puts his values and his actions often at odds, creating a marvelous dramatic dissonance.  His decisions, while noble, are not always realistic or wise given the situations in which he finds himself, making him the very illustration of a man whose good intentions lead so often to disaster or at least unpleasantness.  Married to an aristocrat whose money finances his political career and lifestyle, he is often unable to do what his conscience dictates but must dance to the tune played by his in-laws.What stands out most, especially after viewing the final season, is how the sometimes tragic events of the lives of these people brings them closer and closer together.  Their consideration of and feelings for one another over the course of the 5 seasons is heartwarming.  Even while we realize that the social ills of the time in which the characters lived were unpleasant, we can't help but feel it is from this type of caring that individuals survived and improved their world, and it gives us hope for our own.A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama."	5.0	A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.	2010-08-21	0	0	0

However there are at least 7 episodes, i believe, slated for 2012! If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you will hopefully find this entertaining. Downton is unmatched, but this fills a loss when Downton is on hiatus! The casting is quite stellar, especially Eileen Atkins and Anne Reid, two of my favorites. The series harbors on the political aspects of England in the 1930's, a few bits on the fascist movement, however there was enough drama that did NOT include politics to make it worth while. It's a young husband and wife starting their life anew and adapting to society around them. The house is absolutely beautiful too! I thought the casting was great and there was no one character that you ""love to hate"", which i thought was kind of nice for a change.

There cannot be the depth of character, the slow unraveling of plotlines, or the in-depth exploration of the political and social mores of the times in just three one-hour episodes! Instead, it's a quicker paced, more superficial glance at the doings at 165 Eaton Place, with a background that's painted in broad strokes. More of an impressionist painting than an old world masterpiece.BUT ... that's not to stay it isn't a wonderful show!  IT IS! There is top quality acting, writing, set design, costume -- everything we've come to expect from the best of British period dramas. Taken on its own, it would have garnered far more positive reviews. It is only when the inevitable comparisons are made to the original that this ""Up-Down-Lite"" suffers.It's true.

This series delves into the lives of both. The acting is Superb, as well as the costumes and the Home itself. I enjoyed how BOTH classes were protrayed realistically, both in heart and spirit. I watched every show available on my Kindle Fire, and enjoyed the writing as well.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A10561PYHPGXHW	Bill	I admit I was led to U/D by Downton Abbey which I was also somewhat late to discover. I remember seeing parts of this series when I was younger but, as a restless youth more interested in rock concerts, I never really gave it a close watch. Now after reading Thackery and much Dickens, I appreciate more the subtle rebellion in such a rigid class-based society. And while DA has the edge with set, costumes, and film quality, I agree with Emma that U/D has both better writing and acting as well as excellent camera work. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy DA but it seems that they always need a death to move the plot along. U/D is more artful in that regard. Both series however do have interesting plot twists. For DA fans waiting for the next installment, give this series a try. You may well be disappointed after the first episode but will be hooked by the third. Don't be put off by the black and white episodes. That was not an artistic call but the result of a technicians strike in 1971. Give it a go old chap. It will help you understand why our friends across the pond are so constrained yet clever. It may also help us recover such manners as these cultural cousins claim we never possessed.	5.0	Great Series Rediscovered	2013-04-18	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"Savour the wonderful premiere series of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS in this great DVD box set.The saga of the Bellamy family and their lively, loyal servants at 165 Eaton Place went on to span 5 series and countless awards.  In the legendary first series we are introduced to politician Richard Bellamy (David Langton), his beautiful wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  Downstairs, their staff, Hudson the butler (Gordon Jackson), Mrs Bridges the cook (Angela Baddeley), Rose the maid (Jean Marsh) and Emily the scullery maid (Evin Crowley) attempt to uphold their own values whilst coming to grips with an ever-changing world.Originally-devised by actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, the series explored the day-to-day life of servant and master in the Edwardian period, a time of great political and social upheaval. The series later took the Bellamy family into the First World War (Series 4, regarded by most as the greatest), the 1920s flapper period and the impending Stock Market crash (Series 5).As the series opens, it is the year 1903, and great changes are afoot for the Bellamy family.""On Trial"" - Into the structured Bellamy household whirls the unconventional free-spirit Clemence Delise (Pauline Collins) who is applying for the new position of parlourmaid.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she is quickly inducted into the residence, but it soon becomes clear that Sarah's true calling isn't in domestic service.""The Mistress and the Maids"" - Lady Marjorie sits for an important society painter, but it's Sarah who enflames his creative talents.""Board Wages"" - When the Bellamy's leave London for the weekend, Sarah and the servants are left to their own devices.  But when James unexpectedly returns home early, Sarah is thrown into a dilemma which could see her walk away from Eaton Place.""The Path of Duty"" - Elizabeth returns home from a German finishing school, but her stubborn, willful streak is still very much intact.  When she must make her formal society debut, Elizabeth exposes her parents to a huge scandal by running away.""A Suitable Marriage"" - The visiting Baron von Rimmer seems the perfect prospective husband for Elizabeth...or is he?""A Cry for Help"" - Richard becomes entangled in scandal when the new maid appeals for his assistance in a delicate private matter.""Magic Casements"" - Lady Marjorie enjoys a tender but brief affair with one of James' military friends.""I Dies from Love"" - Emily becomes infatuated with a footman, leading to dire consequences when her affections are not returned.""Why Was Her Door Locked?"" - An emotionally-distraught Mrs Bridges plunges the Bellamy family into disgrace when she kidnaps a baby.""A Voice from the Past"" - Whilst helping in a soup kitchen, James and Elizabeth stumble onto a homeless Sarah, and decide to take her back to Eaton Place.  The situation becomes complicated when Elizabeth learns of James' affair with Sarah during her previous employment at the house.""The Swedish Tiger"" - Sarah becomes a pawn in a plan to rob the Bellamy's of priceless antiques.""The Key of the Door"" - Elizabeth comes of age, but her headstrong attitude once again causes friction with her parents, when she befriends Evelin Larkin and her group of socialists.""For Love of Love"" - Elizabeth finally marries poet Lawrence Kirbridge at the request of her parents, and James rekindles his affair with Sarah, who is now a music-hall singer.Due to a technician's strike in 1971, the first six episodes were taped in black-and-white, and an alternate colour version of the first episode was filmed later on, for broadcasters who didn't wish to screen the black and white episodes.  In the colour broadcasts, Sarah leaves at the end of the first episode ""On Trial"", but the complete B&W;/colour inclusive series has her leave at the end of ""Board Wages"".  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS is still often aired without the crucial black and white episodes, but the DVD edition includes the complete story arc with no omissions and both versions of the ""On Trial"" episode."	5.0	top drama series	2006-02-26	16	16	0

I'm sure I missed episodes because there were no such things as DVR's back then. It's lovely to be able to watch a whole season of shows back to back. Now we have Downton Abbey, but there is nothing quite like the original Upstairs, Downstairs, in my book for all the drama between the servants and the upper class. I especially enjoyed all Sarah's shenanigans. Seems they are always either cooking or having tea.	5.0	Fondest Memories	2014-03-08	1	0	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A29QUWEY7D5AQ4	Cate P	Jean March and the writers and producers of this sequel should be ashamed of themselves.  It's awful!  It falls to the level of a bad soap opera and lacks the nuance of the earlier series.  I got the feeling that it was trying to compete with Downton Abbey as many of the plot elements were almost identical but not nearly as well done.  If bad soaps are your thing, you'll have a blast with this but personally, I turned it off half way through the 2nd episode.  Not worth the money.	1.0	Pales in Comparison	2013-08-23	1	0	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AKHNTRZDH67XX	Cathy Young	This show was recommended to me by a friend, and I was not disappointed.  The production values may seem low to the modern eye, but who cares -- this show has intelligent writing, fine acting, and memorable characters and storylines that pull you in from the beginning.  Vastly superior to the overpraised &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; (which is based on a similar concept) in character nuance, believability, and subtlety of presentation.  Gordon Jackson is a standout as the head butler Mr. Hudson, as is Eileen Watkins as Rose.  The only weak episode of the entire season is &#34;The Swedish Tiger.&#34;  On the other hand, I'd be hard pressed to pick the best, with so many contenders!  &#34;I Dies for Love,&#34; &#34;A Cry for Help,&#34; &#34;The Mistress and the Maids,&#34; and the last two episodes -- &#34;The Key of the Door&#34; and &#34;For Love of Love&#34; are among my favorites.	5.0	Masterpiece theater, indeed	2013-09-22	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1ILI7DZ4K26YQ	Clarity	Although I really, REALLY wanted to like this, it was just too fast and exaggerated to find even remotely believable.There are three episodes.  The first episode was quite nice.  I was very touched to once again have Jean Marsh (Rose) with me.  I replayed her return to 165 Eaton Place several times just to watch her smile.  But the reverence she engenders comes not from the current story but rather from my memory of her from decades ago.  I also found the butler very endearing - a worthy replacement to Mr. Hudson.  But most of the others were just cartoons unsuccessfully designed to elicit emotional responses from the viewers.  It doesn't work.  The mute child who kept rolling symbolic marbles was a cardboard contrivance.  Agnes's annoying younger sister was way over the top.  Agnes herself was too overbearing and her mother-in-law was way too quick-witted and clever to be believable.  The all-wise Indian man with his monkey was just another glittery ornament to hang on the tree.  Speaking of tree, in the last scene it suddenly becomes winter so everybody can inexplicably come together around the Christmas tree for a happy ending.  Bizarre.	2.0	Contrived	2011-04-30	21	18	3

It is 6 years after the original has ended; rich people (not related to the Bellamys) reinstate the house which is found in shambles; servants are hired for downstairs as rich folk begin to populate upstairs. One common thread: Rose, the ladies maid/housekeeper from the original series, returns as a woman running a business providing servants employment (then moves into the mansion as head servant). So it doesn't work to compare. On its own, this series is good, but it ain't no Downton Abbey.	4.0	don't compare it to the original	2013-06-14	0	0	0

Now after I've seen it (all three episodes....jeez, we wait our whole lives for THREE episodes?) I have to say this: the ""new"" Upstairs Downstairs has charm, it's likable, and above all it has huge potential to be a great program. I have no idea if additional episodes are planned but by all rights there ought to be more soon since they'd sure be welcomed around the world. The cast in this revival was terrific, the era of its setting has much for writers to work with, and I for one loved seeing so much more of the house (really a cast member in itself) than we ever did in the first Upstairs Downstairs. The revival isn't perfect, of course, but though I'm a purist I'm not here to complain about this second chapter in the legacy of 165 Eaton Place, instead I'm confident that if we ever have the glorious opportunity to see more of this modern series, it'll get better and better as it unfolds. To Rose and 165 itself, I say WELCOME back! To Lady Agnes and Sir Hallam, to Mr. Pritchard, Mr. Amanjit, the charming new cook and the firecracker housemaid, I say HURRY back!"	5.0	Welcome Back!

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1YMBPL58U3USQ	DallasJulie	I am a fan of Downton Abbey and period stories based in England. Where Downton Abbey is based in a rural castle/estate and community, Upstairs Downstairs looks at wealth and privilege (upstairs) vs servants and hired help (downstairs) in London proper. Good character development, with a lot of personalities and issues in the mix, along with faster moving story lines. More seems to happen on and in-between episodes with Upstairs Downstairs vs Downton Abbey.

What is compelling about the story of the family of 135 Eaton Place is that the everyday family conflicts are relevant in today's time though they supposedly take place 100 years earlier.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3LC52PBBXTHLG	Diana Bauer	Much like Downton Abbey, but made in the 1970s and a much smaller household, this series shows the difference between the lavish upper class and the humble lower class. Wonderful story lines. It seems the lower class pays for their mistakes , but when the upper class lapses in judgement like when the lady has an affair and is blackmailed, or the son gets a servant pregnant, or the daughter gets pregnant by someone other than her husband, some money passes under the table, someone is sent away, and everything is forgotten. This series is riveting, brings home how unjust the class system was in the last century. Excellent acting.	5.0	Pre Downton Abbey	2014-03-09	0	0	0

I'm very happy that I had the chance to immediately compare the two.I'm sorry I spent the money and wasted my time on this set.  The original Up/Down was terrific.  This one is a DUD.  The characters aren't well developed nor are they nearly as endearing as the original cast.  The Downstairs servants (with the exception of Rose) for the most part are immoral and vulgar and very easy to dislike (exception are Rachel and the man from India).My recommendation is not to purchase this one."	1.0	If You Loved The Original - Don't Bother With This One!	2011-07-05	18	15	3

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	APC019EFEX12R	drdebs	I pre-ordered this set when it appeared on the website and recently received my copy to get me through the summer re-runs.  I was so thrilled to see the superb boxed set, and was doubly impressed at the quality of the  recording both visually and in terms of sound.Upstairs, Downstairs is  the saga of the Bellamy family and their household staff in the early 20th  century.  Throughout the series their lives, loves, tragedies and triumphs  are portrayed.  This set of 13 episodes includes the COMPLETE first season  as seen in Britain, including some black and white episodes never seen on  tv in the US.  In the first episode we are introduced to the colorful Sarah  (Pauline Collins), in the second (B&amp;W episode) Lady Marjorie has her  portrait painted only to discover at the Royal Academy Show that the artist  has also painted two half-naked maids in an attic room (possibly Bellamy  maids?).  In episodes 3 and 4 (B&amp;W) we are introduced to the children,  James and Elizabeth Bellamy.  Episodes 5 and 6 show us the romance between  Elizabeth Bellamy and a German Baron (and it's dark underside), and the  pregnancy of the new maid, Mary.  More familiar episodes to the US audience  come in #7 and #8, Lady Marjorie is spellbound with a young army captain  who is friends with her son James, and Emily (the annoying kitchen maid)  falls for a neighboring family's footman, with disastrous results.  Episodes 9 and 10 have Mrs. Bridges, the cook, behaving in a most improper  way and stealing a baby, and the erstwhile Sarah returns with a new plan to  improve her social standing.  The two penultimate episodes in this set  include the further adventures of Sarah the housemaid with a Swedish valet,  and the further adventures of the Bellamy's daughter, Elizabeth, with a  group of young Socialists.  Finally we are left with the now estranged  Elizabeth Bellamy and her relationship with a leftist poet, Lawrence  Kirbridge--and a great eagerness to own the next 13 episodes, now also  available.Upstairs, Downstairs is the classic &quot;Masterpiece  Theater&quot; series, with costumes, drama, comedy, and riveting characters  that we take to our hearts.  If you are a fan of more recent costume dramas  on A&amp;E and PBS, you will very much enjoy this early series which holds  up remarkably well, after nearly two decades.  Treat yourself--you won't  regret it.  And, the set is very reasonably priced here at Amazon.com (I  saw the same thing in a catalogue for $149.99)	5.0	An old favorite returns--beautifully	2000-07-07	53	49	4
0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	ALBYN6ZDZCXZ5	Dr Mike C	This DVD is the first season of the new Upstairs, Downstairs.  It is only 3 hours long, which, frankly, does not justify the price being charged.  Despite this, I would like to note: (i) I enjoyed the series very much; (ii) I cried at the end of the third episode; (iii) Eileen Atkins' character is great; (iv) the DVD appears to contain the full BBC version of the series (not the stripped down PBS version sans 30 minutes); and (v) next year there will be six more episodes.  I hope that PBS shows all of them next year, and does not hold some back for the following year (which was the case for Poirot and Miss Marple).  Personally, I would hold off buying the DVD until the price comes down.	5.0	New Upstairs, Downstairs	2011-04-15	10	8	2

When television was reaching for the stars this series which lasted 5 years was like a rocketship in the anals of entertainment. Thirty years later it is still totally absorbing, sophisticated, and fun to watch. It is a classic that my husband and I re-visited recently over a period of several months. If you missed Upstairs Downstairs in the '70's don't miss it now if you can help it. A combination of a British soap opera, classical drama and comedy, we got totally involved in the family upstairs, and the second family of servants, downstairs.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3RP9VLIQYM8CH	Dr. S. I. Gabb	"The Revived Upstairs, Downstairs:Entertainment as Ruling Class Propagandaby Sean GabbOn Boxing Night and the two next evenings, the BBC broadcast three episodes of a revived Upstairs, Downstairs. For those not aware of it, this was originally a costume drama made by London Weekend Television and shown between 1971 and 1975. Set in a grand London house, it showed the linked but separate lives of both the family ""upstairs"" and of the servants ""downstairs"" through the Edwardian age, the Great War, and then through the 1920s. Though made on the cheap, it has been generally regarded, on account of its writing and acting, as either the best or one of the best things of its kind ever made. It has been rebroadcast many times. It inspired at least one other series, Thomas and Sarah. Because it ends in 1930, and its world continued another nine years, room was left for a continuation, and many have always hoped that one would be made.The problem, though, with sequels to a classic is that they will be judged with unreasonable harshness. I admit that most sequels are worthless in themselves, and only come to notice because of what they follow. But many have real merits that are overlooked in recollections of the original. I mention Thomas and Sarah again. This was no worse than many other light costume dramas. I think it sank so utterly and without lament because it was too closely identified with a classic that it could never match. It is with this in mind that I have waited a week before reviewing the revived Upstairs, Downstairs. Different actors playing different characters, the different tone of the late 1930s, different production values from those of the original - these and much else must be taken into account. The revival must be judged both in terms of what it continues and in its own terms.I have done my best to be just. I have waited seven days. I have kept all the above in mind. I have made every possible allowance. But I am still forced to say that the revived Upstairs, Downstairs is very nearly as bad as it could possibly be. It is dull. It is badly written and over-acted. It is technically incompetent. Its whole purpose appears to have been to serve as legitimation propaganda for the present order of things.In making this last charge, I think it will help to distinguish propaganda from bias. All historical fiction - all art, indeed - is biased one way or another. Materials must be selected. They must be arranged. Selection and arrangement will reflect a particular vision of the past, which is connected with the values of the writer. The bias of the original Upstairs, Downstairs is broadly whiggish. The past is admitted to have been a jolly enough time upstairs, and life downstairs often had its advantages. The overall message, though, is that the disintegration of the old order that accelerated after 1914 is not to be regretted. But, if I do not share this optimistic view of our modern history, I cannot denounce it as propaganda. It is a bias, but the resulting vision is honest enough to allow more than one perspective. Certainly, it has no visible bearing on how the characters are developed.The most central character in the series is Hudson, the butler. He ties together the two different worlds of the household. He is an extreme conservative - indeed, a convinced and eloquent reactionary - always ready to call on God Almighty in defence of the established order. But he is never shown as unpleasant or as more ludicrous than everyone occasionally is. He can always be relied on to do the right thing. Or there is Lady Marjorie. So far as she understands its promise, she hates the twentieth century, and makes her opinion plain in episode after episode. She too is never shown as other than decent; and she is given a very noble death on The Titanic. In contrast, her daughter, Elizabeth, becomes a socialist and a suffragette, and she and her friends talk much about equality. This does not save her from becoming a sad and ultimately a pathetic character. We are invited to share the whiggish view of life in and around 165 Eaton Place. At no point are we presented with a choice between accepting that vision in full and switching channel.It is different with the revived Upstairs. Downstairs. This is nothing but propaganda. It lays down the view that the 1930s were an evil time, and that they were redeemed only by the ""Good War"" that followed them - the war that is the foundation myth for the politically correct managerial state of the present. No departure from this view is possible. No considerations of honesty or common sense are allowed to stand in its way. Characters are developed and judged according to how they might, after 1939, have welcomed or deplored the emergence of the new order. Moral notions that emerged only recently, and that are maintained as the consensus largely by threats of punishment, are projected backwards. And this is a significant achievement. Contemporary drama - Eastenders for example, or The Bill and most other police serials - have long since been co-opted to the work of revolutionary change through cultural hegemony. Costume drama, though, has generally been left alone. It is not allowed to be openly conservative in spirit. But, so far as a different state of affairs from that of the present must be shown, it is often implicitly conservative. Taking control of a classic like Upstairs, Downstairs is far more important than - say - giving us another black woman police chief, or another exploration of paedophile cannibalism among the self-employed. By showing that what the ruling class would have us believe was accepted by men of good will in earlier ages, another escape has been closed off from the hegemonic discourse. To quote George Orwell, ""He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future.""Look at the characters in this revival. We now have a Sikh servant in the house. Of course, if not very often, Indian servants had been coming here with their employers for about two centuries. And one of the characters has lived in India. But a Sikh menial who can type and play the piano, and who is fluent in German, and whose regard for his employer's interests goes beyond mere obedience to her instructions? Is this really an attempt to entertain and inform? Or are the producers pushing against the outer limits of the cultural revolution?We also have a Jewish parlour maid. Again, I have no doubt that Jews have become servants in gentile households - even German Jewish refugees in the 1930s who had, back home, been university lecturers. And fully assimilated German Jews, married to Communists, might still have a total aversion to pork. This character is a little more likely than our turbaned Renaissance Man, but not much more so. Her only function is to remind us why all the nice characters are already set on war with Germany. She is there to make anti-Nazi speeches and scream abuse at the Mosleyite chauffer, and then to shamble with the Sikh round the edges of the Cable Street riot. Once she has done all this, she is surplus to requirements. There is no need to explore any depths to her character, or give her any further part in the action. After about twenty minutes in the second episode, she is allowed to fall down dead in an asthma attack.She leaves a secret daughter behind her. Though the girl has never been a member of the household, I have no doubt that Lady Marjorie would have had her brought in, so she could be jollied along with kind words and a pat on the head, and then sent off to be taught needlework and other duties befitting her mother's last occupation. In this Upstairs, Downstairs, she is brought into the house to live above stairs, and much of the third episode is taken up with competing efforts to settle her future. Unlike her mother's contribution to the plot, this does lead somewhere. It allows the gentleman of the house to learn that he has a mongol sister shut away in an asylum - and this lets the producers tick another politically correct box.A box yet to be ticked is the butler. He is almost certainly a homosexual. I did think for a while that he would try for a pass at the pretty footman. But, while some regard was apparent by the third episode, the full sharpness of Cupid's arrow may have been reserved for a future episode. Instead, he delivers his employer's baby in a lavatory while everyone else is listening to Edward VIII's abdication speech. The cook does nothing very reprehensible in the episodes shown last week. But she is a chain smoker, and this surely means that she has to turn nasty in due course - perhaps she will inform on the butler when he tries to kiss the footman.Staying with the butler and his accomplishments, there is an oddity about his past. He says that he spent 27 years working for Cunard. He then says that he drove an ambulance on the Western Front. Leave aside what gynaecological skills he might have picked up in France - what was he doing there? One of my grandfathers worked in the 1930s on the cross-Channel ferries. On the outbreak of war, he and all his fit colleagues transferred as a matter of course to the Royal Navy. I find it unlikely that any seaman would have served out the Great War on land. This may be an oddity that will drive a future episode. I suspect it is merely evidence of poor character mapping by the writers.None of the characters is either attractive or credible. Their motivations for what they do are at best too slightly given for us to care one way or the other. We can guess why the chauffer becomes a Mosleyite. We are not properly told why he stops being one. The young lady upstairs is given some motivation for joining him as a fascist. Her jump from here to running off to Berlin to worship Hitler is not explained. Why does Rose - the one surviving character from the original - stop running what looks like a profitable business to go back into service? Does she sell the business? Does she install a manager? Is her salary as housekeeper suitable compensation? We are never told.Nor, except for advance echoes of the Good War, is there any overall theme to draw all the minor plotlines together. There is a crude attempt at using the Abdication Crisis to do this. But it only involves the family upstairs. And it is very crude. One test of quality for historical fiction is knowing how much information to give out and how much to assume in the audience. The original Upstairs, Downstairs invariably got this balance right. Recall, for example, the approach of the Great War. Most people in the 1970s could be expected to know something of the July Crisis. Therefore, we are given a few passing references to the shootings in Sarajevo and the diplomatic chaos that followed. Otherwise, the various characters continue about their own business in a deepening gloom that they fail to understand. The most telling scene is a card game on an oppressively hot evening in July. No one mentions politics. Instead, we are given an image of a whole civilisation passing out its time between sentence and execution in a mood of grim triviality.In the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, the characters bob in about out with news like messengers in a Greek tragedy. Anyone who knows about the Abdication is told far too much. When I put everything I did know out of mind, though, I found that all the laboured asides and sobbing telephone conversations did not make a coherent narrative. Matters are hardly clarified by the claim that Mrs Simpson is cheating on Edward with the German Ambassador. If this had allowed us to see more of Herr von Ribbentrop, it might have been an improvement, as he is portrayed as a fine pantomime villain. Sadly, the claim is made only as a crude attempt to centralise every plot round the approaching Redemption by Blood. Needless to say, the Abdication, when it finally does come, falls flat. Because they need to vary the scene with a sudden childbirth - which also lacks human interest - the producers are probably aware of their failure.In the original Upstairs, Downstairs, the servants' hall is made into a close community. This allows much light relief, and throws much additional light on the individual characters and how they relate to one another. It also enables moments of great drama. I think, for example, of the episode after Lady Marjorie has died on The Titanic. The household is still in shock. Suddenly one evening, Roberts, who had been presumed lost with her mistress, finds her way back to the house and is taken into the servants' hall. What follows is something that can be watched over and again without losing its impact. It takes first class writing and first class ensemble acting for those tears and pauses, and the words and images natural to someone of limited understanding, to create a more thrilling account of the sinking than any of the film versions.In the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, the servants are shown a few times listening together to the wireless. There are a few rows. Beyond this, there are probably more revealing exchanges between shift workers in a branch of McDonald's. There is no creation of background for future drama. There is no commentary on or counterpoint to whatever is happening upstairs.Indeed, several of the characters could be lifted out of the action for much of the time without any loss to the plot. The most obvious case of this redundancy is the housekeeper Rose, played once again by Jean Marsh. After the first twenty minutes are out of the way, she could be removed from every scene in which she appears without loss. Her only function, it is apparent, is to keep telling the viewers: ""Look, everyone - I am Rose. Therefore, this really is Upstairs, Downstairs."" I hope Miss Marsh earned a lot from her appearance. I only wish she had insisted on better actors and more competent writers.Yes, the writers are incompetent. I say that the original was made on the cheap. You can see this from fluffed lines and actors sometimes plainly lost on set. You can see it in anachronisms of street furniture in all the outside filming. You can also see it in the strange immunity from ageing that all the main characters enjoy during the 27 years covered. These flaws are wholly overbalanced by the quality of the writing and the acting. In the revival, money has been thrown in every direction but the writing of authentic dialogue.Now, since I have had to give thought to this, I might as well say what I think about dialogue in historical fiction. If, like my friend Richard Blake, you are setting stories in the seventh century, there is no need to try for authenticity of words or speech patterns. The idea is that the narrator is writing in Greek, and the reader has been given a good translation from Greek. Ideas and words derived from the words of our technological civilisation must always be avoided. Therefore, no one should say that the temperature has fallen, or that his anger was fuelled by drink. Nor should he be too specific about times of day, or say that things happened so many seconds apart. No one before the seventeenth century could have used such language. But modern slang and obscenities are appropriate. One of Mr Blake's reviewers accused him of incompetence for using the word ""shite"", which is a moderately recent word. The reviewer misses the point. As said, the idea is that the reader has been given a translation from Greek. This means that whatever effect was created in the original must be so far as possible repeated in the translation.It is the same with stories set in England before about 1500. The language of the characters would have been English - but a fairly remote English, and the pretence can be kept up of a translation. It is harder with stories set here during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Care must now be taken to avoid attempts at pastiche, which will probably fail, and might annoy an audience, but also to avoid obvious anachronisms of language. You can say, for example, that something was turned off, but not that it was switched off. I am not sure if you can say that a plot is discovered, since this word, though much used, had a slightly different meaning before the nineteenth century. And, though you will see it commonly used in The State Trials, you will only confuse if you describe someone with dark hair as a black man. Peter Greenaway breaks this rule in his film The Draughtsman's Contract. The dialogue is often authentic. I think I even recall a reference, never clarified for the viewers, to the Darien project. But I believe that one of the purposes of this film is to show the past as remote and largely incomprehensible. Mr Greenaway breaks the rules for a specific purpose. He does not change them.Again, in my own Churchill Memorandum, I sometimes use anachronistic words and forms of address. But this is a fantasy set in an alternative 1959, and the anachronisms are deliberate.For the periods covered by either version of Upstairs, Downstairs, the guiding principle is clear. References to things and persons now obscure, or disused euphemisms - earnest for homosexual, for example, or gay for a prostitute, even perhaps Unionist instead of Conservative - should be avoided. Otherwise, the words and speech patterns of the day should be reproduced as faithfully as possible. And there is hardly anything in the language of the 1930s that can perplex a modern audience.Yet, in the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, I noticed these anachronisms:""Everyone will touch their toes."" The use of ""their"" as a neuter singular pronoun may have a longish history, but it only became widespread after the 1970s. I do not recall hearing it as a very young child. I do not believe it would have been used in this manner in the 1930s.""British Establishment."" This is a phrase that came into use at the end of the 1950s. Anyone in the 1930s who might have used it must be understood to be talking about some aspect of Church government.""Workload."" This is an Americanism that was first recorded in 1946.""Ideology."" This word would not have been used by an Englishmen of ordinary education until the Cold War.""Under surveillance."" This is another Americanism. I am not sure when it was first used in native English, but I doubt if this was much before the 1980s.""Resolve the situation."" This is a circumlocution that I do not think was in general use before the 1970s.I do not think I am being pedantic. The rules I have given are sound. Following them should be a matter of professional pride. Producers who seem to have spent lavishly on getting the frocks right should have insisted on reasonable care about language. Then again, though money was obviously spent, I am not sure how much care was taken with anything. I looked several times at the high quality recording that I made of the series. I am convinced that, in the final episode, I saw three BS1363 power sockets. These were only introduced in 1947. Mrs Gabb is also sure that one of the light fittings contained an energy-saving bulb. Again, in one scene, characters are shown listening to We'll Gather Lilacs in the Spring Again, by Ivor Novello - a song written in 1945!I might comment on what, apart from three seconds of men in skullcaps when the dead parlour maid is collected, is the total absence of religion from an age when this was still both important and prominent. But I think I have said enough. The revived Upstairs, Downstairs is not just unworthy of the original - it is an artistic disgrace in its own right. It even gives a bad name to propaganda. It shows the sort of contempt for the public that I like to think would have driven Stalin to distraction. That the BBC made it one of the high points of its Christmas coverage is further evidence of the cultural war it is waging against the English people and of how little it regards our intelligence.I have not read any other reviews. But I hope they are equally hostile. I hope, furthermore, that the three episodes shown last week will have so displeased the viewing public that no more will be made. Beyond this, I will do no more than call once again for the BBC to be shut down on day one of a patriotic government, for its records to be burned, its copyrights disclaimed, and for all those working for it to be kicked into the street without pensions. It is the least these people deserve."	1.0	Entertainment as Ruling Class Propaganda	2012-02-07	29	13	16

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"I haven't actually watched the old ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" but it's pretty much become the standard of historical dramas where we see both the aristocrats and the servants.So I was deeply intrigued by the news that the BBC was reviving the show for a new three-episode miniseries, serving as a sequel to the original series. It's a sleek, glittering affair with lots of actual historical figures and events, but the story never forgets that the real focus is on the people both upstairs and downstairs.The year is 1936. George V has just died, his feckless son is involved with Mrs. Simpson, and Hitler is on the rise. Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) move into 165 Eaton Place, intending to turn the ""mausoleum"" into a livable house. So they employ Rose Buck (Jean Marsh), who was once a maid at their house, to find them some suitable servants.Soon the house has plenty of new inhabitants. Downstairs: fussy but kind butler Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), snobby cook Mrs.Thackeray (Anne Reid), hot-tempered footman Johnny (Nico Mirallegro), and others. Upstairs: Agnes' snotty fascist sister Persie (Claire Foy), and Sir Hallam's bossy globe-trotting mother Maud (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her warmhearted secretary Amanjit (Art Malik).And while Lady Agnes hoped to have the ""perfect"" home, 165 Eaton Place is soon rocked by a series of problems -- an arrest, dabblings in fascism, a pregnancy, a birth, a death, constant friction between Maud and Agnes, and the discovery of secret children upstairs and down.Technically the new ""Upstairs Downstairs"" is a sequel to the old one, but it's not necessary to have seen the older ""Upstairs Downstairs"" to understand what's going on. There are some nods and references -- particularly the presence of housemaid-turned-housekeeper Rose -- but it's mostly a self-contained story.The writers do a great job of packing a whole season's worth of drama, sorrow, joy and soap-opera mayhem into just three hours, but somehow it never feels rushed. And they also do an adept job at weaving the story of 165 Eaton Place together with real-life events -- Ribbentrop and Simpson make cameos, Persie becomes involved with fascism, and Hallam is good friends with the Duke of York (later the king).And it has a talented cast of well-respected actors (Keeley Hawes, Dame Aileen Atkins, the weirdly stiff Ed Stoppard, Adrian Scarborough, Art Malik and of course Jean Marsh), as well as a few newbies (Nico Mirallegro, Ellie Kendrick). The only problematic character is Claire Foy's -- Persephone is such a selfish, repulsive character that it's pretty much impossible to care what happens to her.""Upstairs Downstairs"" is a solid miniseries that stands on its own merits, but leaves the door open just in case. Juicy, dramatic and very entertaining."	4.0	New era upstairs/downstairs	2011-03-09	236	218	18

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO	E. Hornaday	This British series is in a &quot;class&quot; by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s. The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family &quot;Upstairs&quot; and their servants &quot;Downstairs,&quot; but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen. The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath. This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging saga is not to be missed. I genuinely rejoice that such a remarkable treasure is finally available on DVD.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB	F. S. L'hoir	"One the biggest Masterpiece Mysteries is why the producers released the new ""Upstairs Downstairs"" in the same season as ""Downton Abbey"" to which it simply cannot compare.The sets and constumes are elegant; the actors are excellent--Eileen Atkins as the Countess is superb; and Jean Marsh is her same delightful self as Rose, who is now the Housekeeper--but it is as if the producers/writers have crammed too many ideas into too short a time. Three not-quite one-hour episodes are not enough. The story is choppy. Instead of being developed, the characters have been served to us in a narrative shorthand: the brittle haughty wife; the nobly motivated husband; the perversely promiscuous sister; the equally promiscuous but good-hearted maid; the footman, who is a barking fascist in one episode but then, in the next episode, has a sudden unexplained change of heart. All have been set against a sketchy historical background of social and political problems of the '30s: the problem of members of the upper classes who supported the fascists; the problem of European refugees; the problem of what to do with mentally challenged relatives of the aristocracy; the problems of class and race.Various notable personages drift in and out of the house briefly: foreign minister Anthony Eden; German ambassador von Ribbentrop; Mrs. Simpson; the Duke of Kent (presumably Bertie was occupied in another film with his speech lessons); society photographer Cecil Beaton (in a scene with the cook that would have been delightful had it not been hastily imposed onto the narrative without much point). Furthermore, the historical element has been inserted into the story so perfunctorily that unless one is thoroughly familiar with it (as one should be, ideally), the viewer might wonder who this Anthony person is, who keeps bossing Lord Hallam about.There are lots of excellent possibilities in respect to this series, but they need to be developed over time: six or seven one-and-a-half hour episodes, are recommended."	3.0	Downton Abbey Lite	2011-04-25	81	69	12

Oswald Mosley was a member of the Labour Party and was an avowed 'Lefty' and member of the Socialist Fabian Society.  The conflict between fascists and communists in pre-WWII England was really a squabble among the various factions of the British LEFT wing.  Try to remember that fascism during Hitler's rise was essentially 'bossy socialism' with all the assorted accoutrements of history's other left wing totalitarian movements like controlled economies and autocratic rule.The constant re-writing of history in the media is disturbing and guarantees we will repeat the same mistakes."	3.0	Get the history right.	2012-12-05	1	1	0

In this 2010 Masterpiece Theater miniseries in 3 episodes on 2 discs, it's 1936 (pre World War II) and we have new upstairs and downstairs inhabitants because the Bellamays sold the property many years before.  A newly married couple along with the husband's overbearing mother (brilliantly acted by Eileen Atkins--she is wonderful) to wait on the upstairs folks we, of course, get a ""new"" crop of servants that are now ""under"" Rose, the parlor maid to the Bellamays that's been promoted in this miniseries to head housekeeper.  This lavish and greatly acted production gives the audience a peek at the very rich and their servants after World War I along with the political and underclass upheavals in England during the 1930s while Hitler and his forces were gaining strength in Germany.  I was well entertained and really enjoyed visiting 165 Eaton Place in its new guise."	4.0	After the Bellamay Family	2011-04-27	2	1	1

First off, it can't be as good as the original is in my head because they had several seasons and storylines to remember. My first impression of the original show was not pleasant because the production values were awful and the acting a bit stiff....go back and watch.This new offering has a lot of promise with a proven writer and gifted cast.  The main problem is it's too short.  You can almost see the action being telescoped as motives go missing and they don't let scenes breathe much, but they are definitely on to something here.The writers and producer did a great job of introducing characters but you don't really get to know anyone well...yet. You get first impressions, hints, and towards the end, you finally warm to the Upstairs folks.  Their secrets are revealed and you end up rooting for them all.I'm curious to see where they go with this as they have set up the continued series nicely.  The time frame is chock full of good stories and I fear for Lady Persie's life.  Yes, her character is a brat and unpleasant but so was Ms. Mitford (on whom she was based.)Stoppard is a bit stiff but that is the character...he does melt nicely on a few occasions.  Atkins and Hawes are terrific, not always appealing, but terrific.  Of the downstairs crew, Scarborough as Pritchard steals the show.More please!	5.0	Solid Continuation but needs to breathe more	2011-04-25	7	6	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AO1Z0TQWCRGL4	"Harold Wolf ""Doc"""	"Here's the old and new UP/Down info. After airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes (alas only 3) advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh who is in both the old and new) and also now including Atkins as Maud. You get the same house, same music, same title. After ""Upstairs Downstairs"" the pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Elliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own ""complete collection.""No disappointment from me or my wife with the 2010 3 episode addition compared to the older TV blockbuster series. The new cast keeps up the believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house (+ music) gives the old lovers the flavor of the past, even if the interior has been redecorated to 1936. It takes only the 1st episode to fall in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165. Excellent cast. With the long bonus feature, there is a hint at more. For me...like handing a fat man a box of chocolates and asking, ""Do you want more?"" YES!Interesting that they had the ""to be King Geo VI"" in the show, prior to the abdication of his King brother, and he did not stutter. After the success of ""The King's Speech"" about the same time as this series release, that bit of trivia is evident.As for the original ""Upstairs Downstairs"" series. It is 27-year span epic winning 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. Since it's period drama it never goes out of style. It's a British TV saga classic.Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless. I strongly recommend you get the 40th Collection and see it while waiting for the new 21st century produced episodes DVD to be released.This newest release (40th Anniversary Collection) provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE! Compare that to the new release with only 3 episodes.SUBTITLES-Anniversary set OFFERS SUBTITLES,like the new episodes. Helpful for some of us. A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.And YES, I bought the new 3 episodes to go with the older episodes. And hoping for more."	5.0	I have seen the COMPLETE original series and recommend all-old & new	2011-03-21	102	90	12

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1XIDKCJ7SOVXP	Jackal	Enjoyable if you like period drama (early 1930s), but sadly not very good.Everyone has modern values once the surface has been scratched. This modernisation makes all viewers identify with most characters. I don't think this is a good thing, because the chance to better understand the views of people living 80 years ago is totally lost.As always with the BBC, the casting and interior designs are stellar.Sadly, the second season is totally unwatchable. A lot of the actors have left the series. Furthermore, the script is written with the benefit of hindsight. People look ridiculous when they correctly forecast what Hitler is going to do. This is really pathetic writing. In addition everyone really cares a lot for the Jews. This is transparently just so that BBC can recoup part of the cost by selling the show to the US. Not everyone was concerned with the Jews in London in 1938. But off course the show makes the Brits look very nice. The second season of the show is just one star, and the first season three stars.Advice: Watch season 1 if you love period drama. Avoid season 2 irrespective of your love.	3.0	Enjoyable but sadly not any good.	2014-01-07	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AWJOPA63RZXFH	Jake10865	Finally Upstairs Downstairs appears on DVD - I had been putting off buying the VHS versions for ages, hoping for a DVD release.Now I am wondering if it was worth waiting for.Of course the episodes are marvellous - A great drama series about life in early 20th century London which, after more than 30 years, still holds up well. It is a shame however that the quality of the prints used by A&amp;E are (in places) quite bad.It seems that A&amp;E have used old video masters for these DVD's, probably some that were sourced in the 80's for a video release or a re-broadcast on PBS. There has been no apparent restoration on these prints so you still have all of the usual video tape interference - It's just that now you are able to see that interference in full digital quality ! The episode 'A voice from the past' was particularly bad.All of this may not be apparent to the casual viewer but if you have an eye for quality - something we have started to expect from DVD, then you will be disappointed by the picture (and sound)quality of some of the material on this DVD.I have yet to purchase season 2 as I notice similar problems being reported with that set also.Come on now A&amp;E - You were doing so well with your early DVD releases. Don't let the quality slip now that you have started to release some truly classic examples of TV at it's best.	3.0	Great Programme - Shame about the DVD quality	2002-02-10	22	20	2

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A40GN7YLZ16S1	"Jeff Cohen ""Vitaphone@aol.com"""	If you're reading this you don't need to be convinced as to the quality and worth of this series.  However, you do need to be told that both the picture and sound quality of this new DVD release are EXCELLENT, and a marked improvement over both the previous A&amp;E video release and syndication copies which have aired on various PBS stations over the years.  While a previous review printed here mentions queer &quot;green tints&quot; and audio problems, NOTHING of the sort was in evidence in the copy I viewed. Quite simply, a beautiful job was done in remastering the original video elements for this DVD presentation, and you're likely to see and hear many details that have previously gone unnoticed. Don't hesitate to purchase this fine set for a moment, and let's hope that the remaining four seasons will follow shortly. Ruby would be proud!	5.0	Magic Casements	2001-09-27	8	8	0
0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3F15664ORQJSY	Jeff Levine	I am going to wait and find out from others if Season 4 and 5 are as poorly transfered as Season 1,2, and 3.  I am not sure what &quot;bmd&quot; June 9 2002 is talking about. All 3 Seasons have masking, freezing and sounds of the cameras churning and the Dolly moving around the room. These are priceless and should have been handled in a better way. Recently I purchased Brideshead Revisited, on the DVD they said the original copy was in poor quality. They spent months getting the quality up to speed for those of us that watch DVD format as a superior viewing experience. But  &quot;bmd&quot; is right about one thing, the stories are wonderful and even though I don't get a fluid viewing experience I will make due till A/E either cleans these previous DVD's up, then I will re-purchase them. This applies to DVD ONLY. 4 Stars for story, minus 1 for horrible, tacky, poorly executed video transfer to DVD.	4.0	Excellent Series- Terible Transfer to DVD	2002-08-14	17	15	2

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1C9V816MIGKLI	Jerry D. Clarke	Saw this series when it originally aired and was surprised at how much I had forgotten and how much meaningful it is now that I have matured a bit.  Their way of life has past in most parts of the world and there are more opportunities.  But it is surprising how timeless some of the issues are.One subject dealt with in the first season is pregnancy of an unmarried girl.  Then it was a scandal first and how would she and the baby survive/ secondly (if at all).  Now there is not so much scandal about an unwed pregnancy, but I don't think it's much easier for a a young woman with no skills and not finished growing up herself to raise a child on her own.  Interesting since this is a series about historical class issues, how little really changes.  Can you imagine if Prince William  had fallen in love with the Palace cook instead of Kate Middleton?  I think the issues raised in the series are still timely.	4.0	Beautifully written and talented acting	2014-02-22	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1X1CEGHTHMBL1	jjceo	This is an excellent British television drama that is almost a soap opera style of show.  The show is about an aristocrat Sir Hallam Holland and his wife Lady Agnes moving back into the London home of his father.  Upstairs Downstairs stands for the different life styles and cultures that existed in the home between the servants downstairs and the rich and highly connected owners living upstairs. Eaton Place 165 has a new generation living in the home but the head of the household maid is the same lady who worked in the house when she was a young maid.New staff is hired and some have to be properly trained and they have to get to know each other and learn to work together.  Meanwhile Hallam's mother Maud moves in and there is almost instant friction between Hallam, Lady Agnes and the mother-in-law living in the home.  In addition Lady Agnes' sister moves in and she is a socialist/fascist want-to-be who causes a lot of problems for Hallam and Agnes.This show contains a lot of drama, tension, personal conflict and it all is brought to the surface perfectly by the excellent cast of the show.  The storyline is well done and the writers have done well writing a story that is interesting and fun to watch.  I find it interesting to watch the British interpretation of historical characters like Mrs. Simpson, the woman who married the King, Herr Ribbentrop a Nazi leader working in England and the new King of England when he takes over after his brother abdicates his rank as King to marry Mrs. Simpson.The servants also play a major role in keeping the house running properly but also bringing in their own personal problems into the house.  This first season sets a lot of ground work for the coming season and the building tensions between Germany and the rest of Europe right before WW II.One character who plays a major role in Season One and Two is Persephone who is the sister of Agnes.  She is the sultry, sexy and troublemaking girl whom you will learn to hate.  Her selfish and one sided nature is overwhelming and evil and you will either love her or hate her.This is an excellent show and my wife and I loved it.  We rated it as a 5 star program.	5.0	Excellent cast in a very good British drama/soap opera that you will enjoy!	2013-03-04	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1IU7S4HCK1XK0	Joanna Daneman	The story of 165 Eaton Place continues in the early 30's. The house has been inherited by Lord Hallam Holland and he moves in with his wife Lady Agnes. Rose Buck, who now runs a small domestic hiring service, staffs the downstairs and becomes housekeeper. The upstairs dramas include a tyrannical and eccentric mother (Eileen Atkins), an out-of-control sister and glimpses into the life of a foreign office diplomat. Downstairs, there are quite as many intrigues, and when the upstairs and downstairs mix, there are the predictable problems.The scenery is lush, each character is cast with care; in particular, Ed Stoppard (son of dramatist Tom Stoppard) is mesmerizing as the stiff-upper-lip husband and diplomat. But every cast member has plenty of lines and a back story, which makes this an engaging series. The second season, on the cusp of World War II, is even better.It's a shame that Jean Marsh's illness and disagreements about the direction of the scripts (that Eileen Atkins was consulting on, as one of the original developers of Upstairs, Downstairs) ended up with the series cancelled after the second season. The last episode of Season 2 had many threads hanging that could have made a long and satisfying drama series. We'll just have to imagine them. But even though this is a brief series, it is produced with fastidious care and it's a worthy successor to the original.	5.0	Another great British tv drama	2013-08-15	3	3	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2TUA4VWCMNXI	John D. Cofield	This is the first series of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.  The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place.	5.0	A Great Beginning to a Great Series	2002-09-22	30	30	0

It was a little sad to see her sitting in her employment agency selecting the staff that would ultimately replace the characters that we've all come to love, but the new lady of the house finally comes to the correct decision to utilize the best asset she has at her disposal and hires Rose as Housekeeper.Rose seems a little rusty in getting back into the swing of things but soon after a few tricky situations, we see that she has learned quite a lot from Mr. Hudson and the standards of 165 are in good hands.All in all, it's a brief mixture of nostalgia and a larger portion of time marching on into the troubling times of World War II.There's plenty of political intrigue and we're reminded of the importance of this beautiful home whose inhabitants have been involved in many historic events.Now that we're in between seasons of Downton Abbey, again, this is a great substitute for getting your English soap opera fix.	4.0	It's not the original, but it's damn good	2014-02-27	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A311626XD2C4T2	JordanJasper	One has to assume that the producers and writers and other industry executives who participated in a contemporary remake of the legendary 1970s U/D realized they would never surpass the original. Yes, there is a great deal of value (both artistic and nostalgic) in having the magnificent Jean Marsh return to 165 Eaton Place as now-elderly housekeeper Rose Buck, providing viewers with a bridge strong and authentic enough to span almost any gap in credibility between the series' two incarnations. Despite the uniformly competent acting, lavish sets, and fine camera-work, however, the new U/D is merely quaint as a stand-alone project, and not nearly as compelling as its predecessor, much less its contemporaneous rival, Downton Abbey.That being said, &#34;quaint&#34; is hardly a thing to sniff-at in a television landscape littered with mountains of garbage, so in this respect the series is satisfying, in a visual &#34;comfort-food&#34; sort of way. The plot is essentially the same as it always was, though there's a whole new family of quasi-aristocrats in Belgravia. These are largely stock characterizations. Testy and eccentric mother-in-law? Check. Brooding Lord of the manor? Check. Insecure wife? Check. Troublesome, sexy ingenue? Yep. Downstairs we find the same lovably predictable types: proud, moralizing butler; crotchety old cook; flirty, common-as-muck parlor maid, etc. The storylines are crisp, economic, and convincing, if utterly derivative, and the proceedings are helped immensely by the pre-WWII historical setting. The folks above and below benefit by sharing a common anxiety on the eve of ruin, one that drives and underpins these six episodes, which might otherwise have gone completely off the boil.If you like English period dramas, sitting-room contretemps dramas, and the like, put some popcorn in the microwave, get in your jammies, and watch Series One in its entirety on some rainy Sunday. You could do a lot worse, entertainment-wise. Special kudos go to Eileen Atkins, co-creator of the original series, in her savvy turn as the meddling Mother-in-Law, and to see Jean Marsh in any scene here is nothing short of pure joy. In fact, her participation is worth the price of admission all by itself.	3.0	A Fitting -- If Creatively Inferior -- Reboot	2014-06-19	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3SLA4ADDSYZJ2	Josh Hitchens	This is the first season of UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, possibly the best loved drama series ever made. The quality of this boxed set is wonderful, and the first thirteen episodes do a first rate job in setting up the plots and  characters. We see the Bellamy family and their loyal servants from  November 1903 to June 1909 in all their triumphs and tragedies. Of the 13  episodes, my personal favorites are THE MISTRESS AND THE MAIDS, BOARD  WAGES, and A CRY FOR HELP. Ironically, these are of the five black and  white episodes that have never been shown on American television. The  Second and Third seasons are also on video, and I highly recommend them.  Unfortunately, the Fourth season that dealt with World War One, and the  Fifth Season, which was the last, are not yet available. I hope they come  out soon. Finally, Upstairs Downstairs: The Premiere Season is excellent,  collect the whole series!	5.0	Upstairs Downstairs: The Premiere Season	1999-12-12	29	28	1

The character development and acting was superb.However, the new version is a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and don't make me care about them at all. Even Rose, the excellent parlor-maid in the original series, is a disappointment. Her acting is stiff and her character is just plain uninteresting.

I first started watching this in honor of my mother who watched it in the 1970s, when I was busy with school and, perhaps, too young for it. Now, in my middle years, I find it fascinating. The first season begins more lightly, but as it develops, the series touches on so many important historical events, making them very personal. There's women's suffrage, the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, promiscuity, children born out of wedlock, miscarriage... all seen through the eyes of those who live downstairs, the servant class, and those who live upstairs, the privileged.  No one is a stereotype, for as the times change, the people either change with them, or stay stuck in the past, or run toward the future. I don't know how long it goes on, but I hope to watch it all, and I'll certainly regret it when it ends.	5.0	Series Develops with Depth and Much Thought	2012-10-23	0	0	0

Some of the cast is over acting and campy.  Having watched and loved Downton Abbey I thought this might be a good one to watch too, but I found it disappointing.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A27H9DOUGY9FOS	"K. Harris ""Film aficionado"""	"A staunch supporter of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" I was more than a little intrigued when an updating was announced. A true piece of television history for five seasons of groundbreaking drama, the modernization certainly had a lot to live up to. So I was very surprised that this promised series only had three episodes--and it was actually a sequel of sorts as opposed to a re-imagining. Well, the truth of the matter is--this version definitely lacks the bite and complexity of the original series. But with such a limited running time, I suppose that was to be expected. However, the resultant product (while perhaps not the stuff of TV legend) is a fitfully entertaining confection in its own right. Glossy, well produced, well acted--this version may be slightly superficial, but it sure is likable enough.Set several years after 165 Eaton Place closed it doors, the current series is set in 1936 at the precipice of world conflict. New inhabitants (Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes) move onto the premises and must rebuild the house to its former glory. Hawes enlists the aid of an employment specialist (Jean Marsh reprising the infamous role of Rose, but with a bit less pluck) to staff the quarters. Complicating matters, the indomitable Eileen Atkins (cue expected Emmy nomination) is on hand as the free spirited, but strong willed mother in law. The introductory episode plays largely to comedic conventions as Hawes and Atkins engage in subtle warfare. Each episode gets progressively darker, with the rise of fascism playing as the predominant plot point in the second show. And for the finale, things wrap up pretty conveniently for everyone. This is not meant to be a dark historical treatment--the unpleasant backdrop is really secondary to the antics of the cast. It's entertaining soap opera mayhem against the backdrop of history.Again, forty years from now, this won't be considered the enduring classic that its predecessor is. But that's really not its intent. The cast is fun and engaging--there isn't quite the pronounced distinction between Upstairs and Downstairs that helped define the original. Funny and touching, it's hard not to be enchanted by this show even with its more fluffy approach. I thought everyone was great--but once again, Atkins takes the prize for most valuable player. Haughty, hysterical, and surprisingly down to earth--she will be what I remember most about this contemporary visit to the legendary 165 Eaton Place. And if you haven't seen the original, do so.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2BHCB7G39GE16	K. MacV	"Perhaps the original series is a tough act to follow as this was a total waste of time. Perhaps the fact that it aired on PBS right on the heels of the awesome ""Downton Abbey"" made this production an even bigger letdown. Hard to say but I had higher expectations for this and you too will be disappointed. Not much of a sequel really even though one or two of the characters in the original appear here. The two series are really not connected in my book. The story just seems all over the place and felt like it needed a few more episodes to bring the story lines all together. When I actually was done forcing myself to watch the final episode I just became more anxious for Season 2 of ""Downton Abby."" Sadly, I think PBS blew it by not rerunning the original to refresh folks' memories beforehand. Showing a sequel to a show that aired 40 years earlier without any real refresher or info for those that never got to see the original series was a big mistake. Unless you recently rented the original, this ""sequel"" won't make much sense."	1.0	Falls far short.  Title is misleading in a way	2011-12-05	7	6	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2XNGRYF4FBSDH	Larry Moskowitz	Why do we Americans love British period pieces so much? Maybe because they transport us to a world we know very little about, a world that appears to have order and decorum -- at least on the surface. But beneath the surface -- downstairs, if you will -- there's conflict and pain and confusion and drama due primarily to the changing times. I think the latest version of U.D. does a great job of bringing the original up to date, to the mid to late 30s.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2ULDDL3MLJPUR	"Laura G. Carter ""Castlebreaker"""	I'd never seen this series before - it came highly recommended to me by my husband, who really wanted to own the set.  Needless to say, he got it for Christmas this year but I confess a certain self-serving motivation for giving it to him:  I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, being a huge fan of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; for years.We completed the First Season last night and I'm hooked.  The writing is terrific and all the performances are enchanting.  My particular favorites are Mr. Hudson, the butler, and Rose, played by the gifted and gorgeous Jean Marsh.The print quality of the videos is excellent overall, but I know that I shall be buying the series again when it comes out on DVD, as I'm sure some jerking of the picture (mostly in the credits, never in the performance itself) and other flaws will be removed as far as possible.The social structures of both the wealthy class and the servant class are jarring, especially to an early 21st-century viewer.  We have come quite a long way from that time when a servant must &quot;know his place&quot;.  Yet, it wasn't just they who had to know who they were and what place they occupied in the world:  in many ways, the wealthy were just as trapped in their positions - if not moreso - than the servants who ran their lives.  And make no mistake - the servants DID run things if this series is to be believed.This is a series the whole family will enjoy and one which can provide a wonderful introduction to social customs and structures of early 20th century England.  Well worth the financial investment.We start the Second Season in our house tonight!	4.0	First season excellent	2000-12-28	9	8	1

I highly enjoyed Downton Abbey, which I'd heard had the same feel- showcasing the family as well as the servants of the house, I absolutely adore Claire Foy, and it looked great in all the teasers I saw. Unfortunately, I thought it was a disappointment.I don't know if it's because it had the misfortune to be aired so soon after Downton Abbey or what, but I couldn't help comparing the two. I just felt this one paled in comparison. Honestly, it was pretty good...but not great. I don't know if I would think more highly of it if I saw it first or not. I'm inclined to think not, but I'm really not sure.I'll say one thing I loved about the show- the look. It was gorgeous- the sets, the costumes, the production values were all top-notch. Claire Foy has always been beautiful (and looks great in period clothing) but I have a soft spot for '30s fashions (my favorite part of the 2005 King Kong was the costumes and scenery as well!) and she really shined more than ever in them. I found myself so envious at times and wishing I could look just like her...silly I know. Her character wasn't very nice, but she sure was pretty.The main point against this show was the lack of likable characters. Jean Marsh was pretty forgettable, which I found surprising, given her history with the show and her performance as Mrs. Ferrars in Sense and Sensibility. I've never been a big fan of Keeley Hawes and she gave the usual blah performance here. It's not that everybody was bad or anything, but most of the decent characters were simply not very memorable.The other big problem was the storytelling itself. There were a good bit of nice moments throughout, but the whole was less than the sum of its parts here. Everything seemed to move too fast- the character development and everything just didn't seem believable to me. One minute a man and woman are fighting, the next they're in bed, the next they've broken up. A new character is introduced, given a backstory, and killed off in the same episode. Everybody's got all these issues but then at the end everything gets all wrapped up with no explanation. It was just like they tried to cram too many storylines in too little time.Maybe with a new screenwriter, the next season could be an improvement? I dunno. It wasn't terrible. It had some nice moments and was a beautiful production. Unfortunately, it's not good for the sets and costumes to outshine the actors.	3.0	Crammed too much in	2011-05-02	9	8	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2AH26MQJKJI5X	lidz	It may be difficult to rate Season 1 of &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; fairly in the aftermath of so much progress in television production since it first aired.  In one aspect of retrospect, it is almost hard to see how it was renewed for a second season.  The first season is relatively flat, has technical flaws, and only by the barest of margins does it begin to sow seeds or lay the bricks of an engrossing story line and character development to come.  If one did not know the future of this program, and thus be encouraged to continue viewing it beyond Season 1, one would probably not tune in for subsequent Seasons.  Season 1 basically boils down to the dysfunction of both the upper and lower classes of civilization.  We have the exact same dysfunction in the 21st Century.  &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; probably survived the 1970's because we had not seen anything quite like it before; it was the &#34;new kid&#34; on the block and of course coming from Britain it was thought to have a leg up on any American sense of sophisticated television.	3.0	LOOKING BACK	2013-08-26	2	0	2

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AUHCT99R5J1L	Lisa H	I watched this set over the Christmas holiday in a 3 day mini-marathon (having just watched the 5th and final series in a 4 day marathon a few days before). I was surprised to learn how few of the first season episodes I'd actually seen and how long it took for the children, James and Elizabeth, to be introduced and developed as characters. And if you 've always wondered why James ended up getting parlor maid Sarah pregnant, the beginning of their relationship is here. If you're an Upstairs Downstairs fan, this shouldn't be missed.  If you've never seen the series, but enjoy British drama and/or Masterpiece Theatre on PBS, this set (and the entire series) is an absolute must. And you simply have to buy it to see the episodes that were never shown in the U.S. (a couple of these were absolutely brilliant!)Even though these will soon be 30 years old (the series debuted in 1971), they're still better than most things on television today.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2VF25F0XZHXMW	London Fog	Not being familiar with the original series this was based on, I had no idea what to expect from BBC's remake of Upstairs/Downstairs - even so, that did not prevent me from being so completely surprised as to the depth with which I would enjoy it. This turned out to be a wonderfully done period drama that, instead of choosing to romanticize the era, took it on headlong and approached such topics as the evolving political scene and how it directly affected the lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place with depth, while still being tactful. In other words, the story did not deflate from the inclusion of such a sensitive topic, rather, gave the series a more believable dimension.Another thing I was impressed by was how there was not a single extraneous character, how all the different story lines came together so artfully. In particular, Adrian Scarborough's portrayal of Warwick Pritchard, the Butler, was absolutely delightful - he stole every scene he was in and I found myself disappointed that Pritchard didn't have more time on screen. If I wasn't hopelessly enamoured with Upstairs/Downstairs already, his stepping in to deliver Lady Agnes' baby would have sealed the deal for me.I will say that this did suffer a bit from the time constraints. Three hour long episodes were not really enough, and there were instances where elements of the plot felt rushed - even a little choppy - although that could very well be from PBS' habit of cutting out several minutes worth of often pivotal scenes when UK programs air on Masterpiece. Overall, however, despite my complaints about the length, it was inspiring, enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in British drama.	5.0	An Instant Favorite	2011-04-27	1	1	0

The acting is superb and the dialogues between the characters are fascinating in the emotional highs and lows that are transmitted in each episode.My advise for the potential viewer is to view the series from episode 1 in order to fully appreciate how the characters develop and mature. There are some that grow and others that decay over time, but very interesting to see the dynamics of it.Hudson, the buttler, for me is the best, with it's total devotion to the old order and his place in the social structure prevalent at the time, he seems to signify the DOWNSTAIRS. I imagine that is how the real buttlers acted at the beginning of the past century.Finally, Lady Marjorie's character is exquisite in her representantion of the quintesential high class lady (UPSTAIRS) she is serene, classy and totally controlled in her behavior and emotions (altought sometimes she lets go letting us know that she is human after all).Definite classic....	5.0	Master Piece Theather in true form indeed....	2004-06-10	5	4	1

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3M88XKMFRWOU2	Marcia L. Vogel	A wonderful period piece that stays true to the early 1900s. The upstairs Bellamys are elegant and oh so socially correct. The downstairs staff, led by the proper butler, are tireless in tending to their duties yet charming in their interactions with one another.  A truly entertaining series. It is easy to understand why this was such a popular PBS series in the early 1970s.	5.0	Positively charming	2014-02-04	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A28V8XJMS2T89Z	Marilyn Parker	I love the original Upstairs Downstairs and prefer the serveants comings and goings to the rich people. This continuation is sort of odd, as it is suppossed to be 1936..6 years after the original ended. So, Why does Rose look at least 30 years older than when the original ended? I also did not like that there was no mention of the original serveants. Did they all die in 6 years? Might have been possible for Mr. Bellamy, Hudson and Kate..but Edward and Daisy were still young and so was Virginia lots younger than her husband. I am sure Rose would have kept in contact with them all. I wish they would have made a spin-off of all the servenats deciding to go where Hudson and Kate were. I know the one who  played Hudson really died and so did Kate.Overall..I found this season and the 2nd season not that interesting. The serveants, besides Rose were dull and lackluster. There was no bond as in the original series as to the serveants being a Family. As to the couple who bought the house, they were dull and uninteresting and the stories were not that interesting. It should have been someone related to The Bellamys that bought the house...It also looked so odd to see the house different colors and different furniture. If they were going to make a sequel, it should have involved the original cast and been in the same atmosphere. As i stated, I would have loved a series based on just the serveants, as they were much more interesting.	3.0	Not As Good	2014-01-25	0	0	0
0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AT1ZKU981AOPC	Marion	This program was very well made and has a beautiful look to it. As ever, the Brits reign supreme when it comes to costuming and period productions in general. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the lack of effort to explain the history and historical persons in dialogue. Everyone in the scene knows what's going on, so you either have to know yourself what they're talking about, or look it up. It makes me want to re-read my copy of Sir Martin Gilbert's &#34;The Appeasers&#34;. Having said that, it is missing some of the dramatic tensions that make Downton Abby, the King's Speech, and Gosford Park so compelling/sexy. (And the AMPAS should give David Seidler another Oscar this year just on general principle, he is so incredibly talented.) Big ups to Julian Fellowes for artfully lighting the cultural fuse on the important history surrounding World War I, and the cultural implications of its fallout.	4.0	"I Did Like it, But it Lacks Intense ""Specialness"""	2013-02-20	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	ADVXMTW3921KO	Martha Robbins	I have enjoyed noting the parallels in the series of Upstairs, Downstairs with the series of Downton Abbey.  I don't want to spoil it for others so will not identify the parallels.  The episodes in Upstairs, Downstairs are fairly well self contained and do not necessarily spill over into the next episode.  In Downton Abbey, however, each episode usually sets up a situation or a twist in a character that surprises and creates an eager anticipation for the next episode.  That being said, the individual episodes in Upstairs, Downstairs create episodes of fascinating events and characters that create a sense of the initmate history of the family household.	4.0	Parellels to Downton Abbey	2013-02-10	1	1	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	ADBAJLF1ZJ0TB	Mikey	Having been cajoled into watching the first series of Downton Abbey, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I thought I'd see what the recent BBC Upstairs Downstairs series was like. Having never seen LWT's original version on the UK's ITV in the 1970s, this was something new to me.The three episodes are fantastic. The period detail seemed excellent. I particularly enjoyed the Fascist storyline in the show and the appearance of Mrs Simpson and the discussion of the possibility of an Abdication which certainly held my attention, attaching the fictional storylines in the show to actual events occuring at the time.A wonderful cast where every member performs equally well, I was particulary impressed with Neil Jackson as chauffeur Henry Spargo.Looking forward to the next series!	5.0	Enjoyable modern version of a classic show now set in the Thirties	2012-03-26	1	1	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AUNTJWCBWFY2G	Mister Mash	I recall watching this series back in the Seventies, but missed the first couple of seasons.  With the all madness for &#34;Downton Place&#34;, it seemed a natural thing to retrieve and watch the &#34;original&#34;.  To me several of the first shows are kinda clunky and the production values not great (several are black and white).  But, as the season progresses, the shows are either better or just growing on me.  We are now in season three and are addicted.  A great show definately worth watching again or for the first time.	4.0	Just Getting On Its Feet	2013-03-20	1	1	0

The story is interesting, the setting is lovely, and the characters are fun. With only three episodes the characters are barely developed so the whole thing has a rushed and lurching feel to it.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3EPHBMU07LZ50	Mysterious Reviewer	Upstairs Downstairs is a high class soap opera beautifully written and acted. The series shows the doings between the Bellamy family (the folks upstairs) and their servants (the folks downstairs) and how they interact. Woven into the soap opera is British history during Edwardian times up until the mid 1900s. During one show King Edward comes to dinner at the Bellamy residence leading to much cleaning and cooking. Along the way comes a big surprise for both the king and the Bellamy family.The show covered a wide range of sensitive topics including homosexuality, suicide, war and the effects thereof.This is one of the best British television series produced and while made in the 70s is timeless.Recommend.	5.0	High class soap opera beautifully done	2011-08-23	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2A8J1N23BUM70	New Yorker	I guess I should say right off that I didn't enjoy what I saw of the originalseries. But this sequel caught me from the first moments. It seems to have amuch wider range of personalities than the first series did, including a RoyalHighness and a Nazi bigwig. There's a very strange, comic, but also scaryepisode where the new tenant at the famous house needs to get the Nazi out ofa fancy party and the only thing they can think of is to have one of thefootmen drop a tray of drinks on him. Did they ever get that crazy in theolder Upstairs, Downstairs? And they really struck gold in letting Eileen Atkinsplay one of those meddling, decadent society dames who, oddly enough, alwaysmakes more sense than everyone else, in her dryly sarcastic way. The only problemwith this series is that it's too short. I could really have used an endlessmini-series approach. In short: witty, adventurous, and a trifle odd.	5.0	Classy, Fast-Moving, Fascinating	2012-01-13	0	0	0

I very much enjoyed the series and am disappointed that this was the end.  It was an excellent filler for me in between seasons of Downton Abbey.I am happy to say though that with the end, it didn't really leave you with any cliff-hangers... it just left you with the option to make your own ending for each of the characters.	5.0	Don't get hooked!	2013-05-07	0	0	0

The original producers expent much effort on historical detail, regional accents, and such things, and the acting is superb. Really, it's a joy to have these episodes on tap in DVD form. But the Arts and &amp; Entertainment Television Network did very little work past transfering these shows to disk - there are no subtitles or chapter divisions, so you might as well be watching them on VCR.	5.0	(no title)	2002-05-23	3	3	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1OJ4DT82V6EJ9	Organgrinder1010	This season offered quite a few changes from the original. The acting &#8212; for the most part &#8212; is very good. The sets are lavish and slavishly of the period represented. It appears that no expense was too great for the producers. The plots, however, are the weakest link, implausible and rather off-the-wall. As soon as I began to care for a character some twist rolled in that strained credulity to the breaking point, destroying the totally-involved mood I enjoy with truly great dramatic productions. Nonetheless I like the series enough to have watched it twice &#8212; the second time a binge-watch of the entire production over the time span of two evenings. And I may yet return for a third visit, at least to some episodes.	4.0	Distinctly different from the earlier series	2014-06-05	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	AL6C1XUKLN80F	Peggy	Upstairs, Downstairs is the saga of the Bellamy family and their household staff in the early 20th century. Throughout the series their lives, loves, tragedies and triumphs are portrayed. This set of 13 episodes includes the COMPLETE first season as seen in Britain, including some black and white episodes never seen on tv in the US. In the first episode we are introduced to the colorful Sarah (Pauline Collins), in the second (B&amp;W episode) Lady Marjorie has her portrait painted only to discover at the Royal Academy Show that the artist has also painted two half-naked maids in an attic room (possibly Bellamy maids?). In episodes 3 and 4 (B&amp;W) we are introduced to the children, James and Elizabeth Bellamy. Episodes 5 and 6 show us the romance between Elizabeth Bellamy and a German Baron (and it's dark underside), and the pregnancy of the new maid, Mary. More familiar episodes to the US audience come in #7 and #8, Lady Marjorie is spellbound with a young army captain who is friends with her son James, and Emily (the annoying kitchen maid) falls for a neighboring family's footman, with disastrous results. Episodes 9 and 10 have Mrs. Bridges, the cook, behaving in a most improper way and stealing a baby, and the erstwhile Sarah returns with a new plan to improve her social standing. The two penultimate episodes in this set include the further adventures of Sarah the housemaid with a Swedish valet, and the further adventures of the Bellamy's daughter, Elizabeth, with a group of young Socialists. Finally we are left with the now estranged Elizabeth Bellamy and her relationship with a leftist poet, Lawrence Kirbridge--and a great eagerness to own the next 13 episodes, now also available.Upstairs, Downstairs is the classic &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; series, with costumes, drama, comedy, and riveting characters that we take to our hearts. If you are a fan of more recent costume dramas on A&amp;E and PBS, you will very much enjoy this early series which holds up remarkably well, after nearly two decades.We completed the First Season last night and I'm hooked. The writing is terrific and all the performances are enchanting. My particular favorites are Mr. Hudson, the butler, and Rose, played by the gifted and gorgeous Jean Marsh.The print quality of the videos is excellent overall, but I know that I shall be buying the series again when it comes out on DVD, as I'm sure some jerking of the picture (mostly in the credits, never in the performance itself) and other flaws will be removed as far as possible.The social structures of both the wealthy class and the servant class are jarring, especially to an early 21st-century viewer. We have come quite a long way from that time when a servant must &quot;know his place&quot;. Yet, it wasn't just they who had to know who they were and what place they occupied in the world: in many ways, the wealthy were just as trapped in their positions - if not moreso - than the servants who ran their lives. And make no mistake - the servants DID run things if this series is to be believed.	5.0	The best ever made	2004-11-01	10	10	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2G2MP8VLLATOR	"Peter Lake ""Mustache Pete"""	Clearly a sequel years later to the original Upstairs Downstairs was going to face a formidably heavy lift to match the class and addictive absorption of viewers to the life of the Bellamys above and below stairs. Another problem was the number of viewers who actually remembered the seventies series and came to love it who are still around and who would compare it to the original vs. the new viewers who had no prior knowledge of the series. And thats why I think it was a great effort by the producers to take both audiences into consideration. By making Rose the fulcrum of the story they had the connective tissue to the original.And Jane Marsh was great as usual. The young Bellamys and the turbulent /30's were all a wise choice. Acting great, sets remarkable, intrusions of the drums of war and torment for Britain very well integrated. Most of all terrific entertainment which had much of the addictive qualities of the original. Strongly recommend.	4.0	A worthy follow up	2014-06-12	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A11HB3LYLIQNZP	"PhiloX ""PhiloX"""	"Through the years I have watched PBS Masterpiece Theatre for its remakes of Classic Novels, but British TV didn't interest me because I normally don't watch ""Typical TV"" until I got married & started watching romantic movie comedies with my wife. Some of our favorites: ""You-re Got Mail"" & ""Sleepless in Seattle"" always had references to older Romantic classic movies or novels. Therefore we found ourselves watching & loving many Jean Austin remakes including several A&E DVD's. This lead to a British invasion within our house starting with ""Darling Buds of May"" & ""All Creatures Great & Small"". ""Darling Buds of May"" was a little racy for our taste & ""All Creatures Great & Small"" started out rather slow, but in the end we have been watching these 2 British TV Classics over & over. I then told my wife about ""Upstairs Downstairs"" & we decided not to buy the whole series, but to test out the first season. The series is rather racy for our tastes (as was ""Darling Buds of May""), normally at a PG level, but at times travels up to a R rating & just when you think it will go too far, it jumps back to PG just in time. We were both surprise to see Pauline Collins of ""No, Honesty"" as a maid named Sarah in the first Black & White series. For my review, I will not write about the plots & characters because other people before me have done a great job & we need not repeat them here. As a professional photographer (wedding photographer for 15 years) & owner of a better than avg 5.1 audio video system (NHT 5.1) the Black & White series has better photography & sound: all very clean & clear. The color series on the other hand, is a wreak both sight & sound. There are at times late 1960ish TV lines that invaded the screen that throw off the timing of the sound. This must be a straight no edited copy that has no value as a piece of photography art, but a run through just to get the product out. In fact, there is a VHS hum throughout, something I never experienced with a DVD. As a British TV series with the actors & plot, I would rate this as a 4, but as a DVD a 2, therefore the avg out is 3. Both me & my wife will not continue with the series because there were no moral outcomes within the first season. Maybe this is not the place to start the series, but then again, where does one start if not the beginning?"	3.0	High Class - Low Tech	2003-06-19	20	5	15

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1AISB4FU33CNY	Price Grisham	This production seemed much more realistic in its plotline than Downton--no devastatingly handsome Turkish ambassador attempting to rape a titled young woman and then kicking the bucket inconveniently in her bed, to start with. It does a good job of showing how the servant situation had changed in 20 years--much more difficult to get domestic assistance as qualified as that before the first war. But Rose does her best with what she has, and the result is a huge help for a struggling young diplomat. (Though the aging sequence is still tricky--when the first series closes in 1930, she should be late 40's or 50, but still looks 30-35; when the new series opens in 1936, she def. looks well over 60; but that problem existed with the Bellamy father and son, too, when they looked more like brothers as the first series neared its close.)These episodes, however, although beautifully produced, lacked development, which the earlier series of UpDown displayed so beautifully; of course, the notoriously short attention-span of the modern viewer, and the expense of such a production, were probably prohibative, but we really did not have quite enough time to grow attached to the characters--except perhaps for the Jewish lady, a refugee who becomes a maid. Jean Marsh was wonderful, as was Eileen Atkins; and the ambassador's wife did show some character development, I thought, but her sister seemed hopeless, a puzzling lack of compassion in someone so young. I did think her brother-in-law, the diplomat himself, was very well done--it is difficult in this day and age to play a noble character convincingly, and he did; the ship steward/new butler was also a very endearing character, and the young maid, too.So much preferred it to Downtown--far less soap-opera like, but could have been fleshed out for a superior product; a continuation to see if 165 Eaton Place survives WWII would be very interesting.	4.0	Great potential; edges over Downtown soap-opera, just.	2011-04-26	4	2	2

Very glad I chose this series! I really enjoyed references to real people and found myself pausing the show to look people up! Got myself a history lesson! Well, the second season really had a bit of a progressive story line with adultery,  abortion, and same sex relationships.  I was sorry the series wasn't renewed and had to imagine the resolution of the story on my own.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3FB4EI67Q4XHZ	"R. Germov ""Roz Germov"""	As an avid fan of the original Upstairs Downstairs series, I was interested to see how this new miniseries would continue the story.  As most of the main characters of the original series are either dead or are now too old to continue in their roles, this would have been quite a challenge.  The only member of the original cast was Jean Marsh who played Rose Buck.  Eileen Atkins, a co-creator of the original series with Marsh, has a major part in the series as the Dowager Countess.  There is no other continuation of the original story other than the musical score and some schmaltzy mementos such as Hudson's key tag that cause Rose to smile wistfully in fond remembrance.  The characters are rather one dimensional and not particularly convincing.  The script lacked finesse and subtlety.  The set design was lavish but this did not make up for the banality of the script which seemed to be based on Barbara Cartland style pot boilers.  Some of the story lines could have been very interesting such as the flirtation by the English upper classes with fascism but these were never fully developed.  It is watchable but only just.  The reference to Upstairs Downstairs is rather misleading as it bears little relation to the original series.	2.0	Disappointing schmaltz with no real connection with the Original Series	2011-07-03	8	6	2

I decided to try it now, since I knew it had a similar premise to DA. It wasn't ""love at first sight,"" but by the third episode I was hooked. DA is still my favorite, but I do find UD very entertaining and look forward to each new episode. I have just started Season 2.Of course, it is true that it's not the lavish production that DA is. As some other reviewers mentioned, it is set up more like a play with limited sets, and I find the characters on DA more attractive and likeable, but the characters in UD have grown on me the more I watch. There are some similarities where I think DA may have copied UD.I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said there should be subtitles/closed captioning. I always use the subtitle option when available, esp. when watching something where the actors have an accent. There's nothing wrong with my hearing, but I don't think anyone catches every single word of every single movie, and subtitles do help in this regard. The British accent can sometimes be hard to decipher, esp when the actors talk faster or more quietly. I'm sure the Brits feel the same way about American actors! ;-)The way I see it, now I have TWO great miniseries to look forward to watching! Still waiting for the new season of ""Mad Men."" Is there any series past or present that is similar to MM that I should check out?In summary, I think that if you love Abbey you would probably like Upstairs, Downstairs. Don't overthink it or compare too much. Just sit back and enjoy it!"	5.0	Addictive!	2014-01-29	0	0	0

Having seen and thoroughly enjoyed the story of the Bellamy family when it was first aired, I wished for more than the 3 hours. There wasn't enough time to learn to care about any of the characters as the story line barely brushed over them and hurriedly wrapped up to a disappointing ending leaving too many loose ends.	3.0	Three Hours -- too short a time to develop the story	2011-04-25	8	6	2

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3UUZSGN8C9AEG	Shela Simpson	Purchased both seasons of this continuing story of '165' while I am waiting for the next season of Downton Abby.  I have never seen the original series so I was not certain if jumping in now would be confusing, but it is not, the story does a nice job of looping back to explain any references to the original series making it easy on viewers like me.  I cannot compare this series to the original, but that might be a good thing, allowing this series to stand on its own merits.  The characters are easy to warm up to, and the story line moves along at a nice pace.  This is proving to be a nice filler and I am going to be sorry to see it end so quickly.  If you are looking for some enjoyable viewing similar to Downton then you will most likely find this series fits the bill nicely.	5.0	Quite Good	2013-04-06	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A27EHOS8ITBKSC	Stan Gottlieb	Although my wife and I had the pleasure of revisiting the Bellamys, their friends, and their servants in the early 1990s when KQED replayed all five seasons, this was our first opportunity to see the black and white episodes  that were only shown in Great Britain, as well as the rest of the first  season.  It was a memorable experience, being able to view the tapes at our  leisure, and reliving the lives of so many wonderful characters.  Their  growth through pleasant and trying experiences, their interaction above and  below stairs, the shared historic moments that covered political, social,  and technological changes only served to whet our appetites for the second  year's videos.  The characters are memorable and seem to become part of the  viewers family, the writing is genuine, moving, and witty.  The sets are  authentic, the action is real, and the stories are universal.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A3ZXQMKTSBK7S	Steven	Always entertaining to watch fashionable British snobbery.

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A360DT9HML3C6M	sweet teas	I must first give full disclosure, I turned tho this series after watching all of Downton Abbey, casting about for something else to fill the time.  Since this was recommended on Amazon as a &#34;people also viewed&#34; I thought I would give it a chance.  It takes a while to warm up and I was a bit disappointed that many of the plot lines were not really resolved.  I love Rose, Jean Marsh's character, but found the upstairs personalities to be a bit shallow the downstairs ones a bit flat in some cases.  That being said, I did watch the first series through and enjoyed it.  Elizabeth is a fun character and so is Sarah.  It would be great for some of the men to be as enchanting...in any case, a decent watch but not as good as Downton or a good book.	4.0	Wanted to love it, and liked it but didn't love it.	2013-08-18	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2PCU5760KTRYJ	Thirteen	As a fan of the 1st Upstairs, Downstairs when it was first shown, I looked forward to this one . I only got around to seeing it after watching all of the fabulous Downton Abbey. I found the first season (3 episodes) engrossing enough to go to the second and last season (6 ep.), but was saddened in seeing a very aged Rose (jean Marsh, the original Rose from the 1st show). I did think (spoiler alert) that they killed off one of the best and sympathetic characters way too soon, and preceded the same philosophy in the second season. The second season became a true soap opera with most characters being unworthy of empathy and saddled with a convoluted plot that focused on a little too much political minutia.I think they tried too hard to outdo Downton as a soap opera, and rather than creating a solid story	3.0	It Tried Too Hard	2013-06-30	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A2Z13QAST1E7Q9	"Tiggah ""the Anglophile"""	"It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced; in fact, it is the yardstick against which all other period dramas have been measured ever since.  Five series were produced in total (on five boxed sets), and the entire series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, the Roaring 20s, and finally concluding with 1929`s stock market crash).The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery.  The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents).  I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away.  Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household.  First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord.  Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges.  Other memorable characters to whom we are introduced in the first series include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer.  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs ""family"" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.The first through fourth boxed sets cover series one through four respectively, and each set contains thirteen 50-minute episodes on seven tapes.  The final boxed set (series five) contains sixteen 50-minute episodes on eight tapes.Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910.  There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite.  Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI.  Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed.  Series five covers the twenties.In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama.  But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  I usually recommend buying the first boxed set and then, if you like it, buying the rest.  This is one series about which I have no hesitation in recommending that you go ahead and purchase the lot; you won't regret it--it's simply THAT good!  And those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs, will surely enjoy The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).

The first season is only 3 episodes and I thought in the first 15 mins that it might not catch me as strongly as did Downton.  I was wrong - good story line and a fun watch.  This is a more relatable family than Downton in many ways.

While the initial episode tries to cull forth the emotions and remembrances of times past, with the hiring of the former maid, your dissatisfaction with the series will be as culpable as hers was with the new household. The focus isn't on staff/employer relations as much as it is about the plight of the Jews and the rise of fascism. Did we really need Upstairs, Downstairs to feature such a well-worn subject?  What a wasted opportunity. Also, the series is mortally tainted with political correctness, like everything on PBS nowadays. Historical accuracy is sacrificed once again to serve a social agenda.	1.0	Nothing like the old series	2011-05-07	34	27	7

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A151T9C99W0AA	Walter P. Sheppard	"When the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" series was in development in the 1970s, script editor Alfred Shaughnessy provided guidelines for the writers.  This one was pivotal: ""Television is electronic theatre and not second-rate film.""  The new series also called - minus the comma - ""Upstairs Downstairs"" ignores this guideline.  The result is an indifferent second-rate film that would not get more than a passing glance if it were not for the title, which is a fraudulent attempt to sell itself by connecting with the wildly successful original.It is also tries to make the connection by taking us to 165 Eaton Place, the Bellamy townhouse in the original Up/Down, left in 1930 and vacant ever since.  When we arrive at 165 with the new owners in 1936, the very first shot shows clearly that it is not the same townhouse - the pillars framing the portico are fluted rather than plain and a double door opens into the hall, where the original had a single front door.  Inside, the hall is dominated by a chandelier that was not there before.  The door leading to the servants' area has changed color in the six years the house was unoccupied, and a small diamond-shaped window has appeared in it.  The new owners order extensive renovations, but the lavish result would not have fit inside the original townhouse.  This 165 Eaton Place would require the dimensions of a mansion to accommodate the upstairs changes.  Downstairs, the servants' quarters also bear no resemblance to the original before or after renovation.The original Up/Down rarely left the townhouse.  It focused on the characters and their development and interactions, sometimes influenced by events in the real world.  Each episode tended to be centered on only one or two characters, and scenes ran for the five or ten or twenty minutes needed to create ""theatre.""  Watching them, you got to know and become interested in the achievements and problems of the characters as people.  Music was used in a scene only when it came from an on-screen source - a phonograph, an off-screen band, etc.The new Up/Down has a short attention span.  It jumps all over the house and London, and it's very involved with events in the real world.  By concentrating on those events, the scripts are too superficial to make you care what happens to the characters.  And this Up/Down is cursed with virtually continuous background music that is frequently intrusive and often loud enough to interfere with the dialogue.The original Up/Down was conceived by Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, who provide another tenuous connection to it by appearing in this sad reincarnation.  We know that they are splendid actresses from their work elsewhere.  Here Marsh is wasted as the colorless housekeeper and Atkins's character has only one note, sarcastic bossiness.  There is no way to judge the acting abilities of the rest of the cast, which often seems to be on automatic pilot.The BBC has commissioned another six episodes of the new Up/Down.  That's fewer than half of a usual series and suggests the Beeb is not completely happy with the first series.  It could encourage the new episodes to be electronic theatre by limiting the production to three or four locations inside 165 Eaton Place to force the writer, Heidi Thomas, to populate her scripts with real characters and their relationships with each other, whether upstairs or downstairs, and having only minimal connection to real world events.I always looked forward to seeing each episode of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" in its broadcasts from my local PBS station and still do now in repeats from DVDs.The new incarnation has nothing to make me want to watch it again.  I can't give it no stars, so I give it one star for effrontery.Addition, August 23, 2011: a BBC press release posted on the Upstairs Downstairs website says that Eileen Atkins has left the cast of the new episodes.  She ""is reportedly unhappy with the direction the new scripts are taking."""	1.0	Fraudulent	2011-05-26	41	32	9

Moreover, I fell in love with the characters.  Jean Marsh's Rose Buck, along with the house, 165 Eaton Place,* is the link to the original series.Eileen Atkins as the dowager Lady Maud Holland is a treasure.  All the characters are fully rendered and each is significant in their own right.  While it might be thought boring, the family and the servants are all lovable.  With the expected friction of living with people, they treat one another with respect and affection.Like the original, this series is historical fiction.  It aspires to authenticity, rather than mere accuracy, but, like most such drama, it is the story, the art, that we enjoy.  Like the original, this  series was all too short.  The original started awkwardly as a comedy but grew into an epic drama.  It was still too short.  This one was designed as a whole, ended on a high, and left us wanting more.Update.  After writing the review above, I went to check for any news about a second season.  Indeed, there will be one and it is generating a lot of coverage in the British broadsheets and tabloids.  The difference in the coverage is enough to generate a review or two all by itself.Jean Marsh, my age, suffered a minor stroke and so has been written into a tuberculosis sanitarium for the first episode but will appear later.  Jean Marsh is so identified in my mind with Rose that when I see her in other roles I often do not recognize her.Eileen Atkins, who was so good as Lady Maud Holland, has been written out altogether.  Lady Maud will be replaced in the household by her younger half-sister, Dr. Blanche Mottershead, played by Alex Kingston.  I confess I am saddened.  The series cannot be quite the same without these two grand dames who created it.  Most of the great Downstairs cast will return and be joined by a few fresh faces.I do not like previews, but if you are interested, you can find one at [...]*Eaton Place exists, in Belgravia, but 165 is fictional.  ""London's Belgravia serves as the well-heeled setting for most of the action in Upstairs Downstairs, but the exterior shots of 165 Eaton Place are filmed at an elegant terrace of Georgian townhouses in Clarendon Square, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire."" It seems that the traffic on the real Eaton place is so heavy and London so noisy that a quieter local had to be found.  Fortunately the same architect had created a suitable site. If anything, it is even more elegant."	5.0	Fan of the Original	2012-02-13	4	4	0

It tracks the history of the Bellamy family through several decades, tying them in to historical events such as the sinking of the Titanic, wars, and changing social values.  It is produced in excellent fashion.  One of the best attributes  is that the episodes don't necessarily need to be watched in order.  Although they are produced in chronilogical order, each episode's story stands alone.We look forward to watching the entire series again, for the third time since seeing it new in the Eighties!A side note: we purchased the sequel DVD, and while it was &#34;good&#34; it did not live up to the high standards of the original series.	5.0	Classic TV series of excellent quality.	2013-03-09	0	0	0

There where some holes in the plot, and spotty points. I guess why it wasn't renewed for a third season.	4.0	Not Coming Back...	2013-06-16	0	0	0

I knew British society had high expectations of the aristocracy class but it was sad that the lower class promoting low expectations for themselves.	3.0	informative show	2014-03-05	0	0	0

Frankly I forgot about it. It is a good concept and a different era then Downington Abby, but you have to have the characters in order to continue to pull that off.	4.0	Good, but not great!	2013-06-14	0	0	0

0767002652	Upstairs Downstairs - The Premiere Season [VHS]	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	I admit I was not familiar with the original Upstairs, Downstairs show from the 1970s until very recently, and have since watched all five seasons of the original. I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2, one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I'll take what I can get!The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (on film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland's, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam's eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played the upper house parlour maid, and later ladies' maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank). There's also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law's wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance. She also develops an interest in right-wing activities involving the fascist movement in Britain, a thread that was unfortunately rushed through during the course of the three episodes. Another thread explored this season was the relationship between Wallis Simpson with Edward VIII and the abdication crisis.I liked this first season, but would have liked to see more time spent on developing the main characters. It all seemed a bit rushed, as if the writers and producers were trying to cram as much as they could into the three episodes. I hope to see more time being spent on plot and character development next season.	4.0	Still prefer the original, but this updated version has excellent production qualities	2012-03-28	0	0	0
