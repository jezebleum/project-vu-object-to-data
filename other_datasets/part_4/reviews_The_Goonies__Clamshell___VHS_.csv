En cuanto a este DVD, pues nada, excelente calidad, Audio en ingles con sus respectivos subtitulos en espa&ntilde;ol. Lamentablemente las caracteristicas especiales del mismo no tienen ningun tipo de traduccion, solo audio en ingles. Sinceramente nunca jamas entendere como es posible que a estas productoras les cueste tanto trabajo colocarle un simple subtitulo a todas las caracteristicas de un disco, sabiendo que esto no le resta absolutamente nada a la calidad del producto en vista a que un subtitulo solo pesa unos cuantos kb. Cuando sera que se daran cuenta que en los estados unidos hay un mercado gigantesco a ser explotado de habla hispana. Nunca lo entendere.	4.0	Inafaltable en una coleccion	2012-04-15	0	0	0

Donner and Spielberg create a classic for kids of all ages in each new generation.  I original bought this on VHS for my son and he became a Goonie. Now it is time to buy the DVD for my Grandson so he can become a Goonie too.  I love this film... but it makes me feel a bit sad for kids today.  They rarely get a chance at adventure that does not have a video game involved. Thankfully in 1985 kids didn't have cell phones and they used their imaginations.

A few months after that I found a ""What Goonie are you?"" quiz on a site and decided right away I wanted to get the movie so I could see it all. I bought the VHS and when that didn't work in any VCR I was pretty upset. I returned it and about 3 days later I found the DVD ... so I *had* to get it. I ADORE the scene with the Truffle Shuffle and Mouth in Spanish. Heh, gotta love Corey Feldman :). The commentary is great! I loved seeing all the actors as they are now! Too bad Sean left in the middle of it. The deleted scenes are terrific, I actually saw the octopus scene on the Disney channel, I didn't know it was cut from the original movie. Hopefully they will put Goonies back in theaters one day, then I shall ...drag all my friends along when I go see it >:). I annoy them every day by quoting Mouth or by talking about my favorite scenes. I even memorised the Goonies Oath. Well, all in all, The Goonies is a GREAT, timeless movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime... or they can watch it everyday like I do. :)"	5.0	The Goonies shall NEVER DIE!	2002-10-13	3	2	1

At the movie theater, the octopus scene, the snack and shop scene, and more funnier, quirkier scenes with Sloth &amp; Chunk were included, making it the best movie I ever saw...until 1997 when TITANIC came along.  ;o)When I was given the video a couple of years ago, I was disappointed to see that they had cut out the more &quot;daring&quot; shots, making it into a PG film, instead of the PG-13 it really was. The DVD version I hear has it all, including the &quot;missing&quot; scenes!!!!  I am so excited and can't wait to get a hold of it...to watch it over and over and over again! I had a HUGE crush on Sean Astin (Mikey) after watching the movie (braces, asthma and all!) and then Ke Huey Quan (Data - Mr. Double &quot;O&quot; negative).

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A4PCG6ZN4QMJ3	alsq	Spielberg's take of a PG-rated treausre hunt.  The idea is laudable, the execution may be OK for juveniles with a short attention span, but not so much for grown-up tastes.  A weak plot, mostly loud and boring characters make for a tedious show made up by a sequence of poorly threaded 'whoa!' moments.  The wonder factor for me vanished way too soon into the movie; after that becoming 'so what?'  On the redeeming side, Sean Austin (later Sam Gamgee of Lord of the Ring fame) brings a reprieve to a listless early example of shock-driven emptiness.  This may have been one of the movies that started that trend...	2.0	hard to believe spielberg did this one	2014-03-28	1	0	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A9TX7L1HNM37V	"Amazon Customer ""A Strange Hero to a Select Few"""	Despite the appearance of the lackluster cardboard case, The Goonies DVD is a must for any fan of this classic family adventure film. The high points of this edition are an inventive and colorful selection menu, the excellent transfer print of the film used, and the feature-length audio commentary, which reunites the entire child-star cast of the film! They've even gone so far as to include both parts of the promotional Cindy Lauper &quot;Its Good Enough&quot; video that ran its course back in the good-old days, when MTV played music videos.The DVD is far from perfect, however, and there are a few minor disappointments. First, the audio commentary occasional switches from the movie to an in-studio shot of the actors discussing the film, which I personally found a bit distracting, although others may disagree. And while they take great pains to show the cast members talking, there are no filmographies or bios included in the Cast &amp; Crew section, an excellent opportunity for a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; moment. Finally, while some deleted scenes are included with the extras, the cast invariably makes mention throughout the commentary of numerous scenes filmed that are not shown, even in rough form. Its always a let-down when a seven-hour rough cut is alluded to, yet only five minutes worth of deleted scenes (and no outtakes) make it onto the disc.But these are all minor complaints, and in no way detract from one of the greatest kid's films ever made! Even if this DVD were a bare-bones release, it would still be worth picking up!	5.0	A Great Presentation of a classic family film!	2001-09-06	12	11	1

I have now disowned them as relatives and we're no longer on speaking terms.  This movie, flaws and all, was a spectacular classic.  They simply don't make kids movies like they used to, what with all this Hunger Games and Harry Potter nonsense.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AUJEF31CXWTCQ	Amazon Customer	Not a bad kid's movie, but you have been warned, the swearing in this flick is a little overboard for a family film. The only word missing is the F-bomb. There is also a scene in which a child mentions sexual torture, a fake hanging scene, and some talk about sex.Again, a good movie, but not for younger kids.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3D09U6608TYHG	Amazon Customer	"First of all, let me say that I love The Goonies movie. This review is not about the movie.The copy of the movie that is being offered here is not a Region 1 (USA) copy. It is a Region 2 (Europe) copy. It is not a 1080p version of the movie either, which is easy enough to see when you view it. There weren't any previews, copyright protection notices, chapters or any menus on the disc either. Once the movie starts to play it can only be paused, stopped, fast forwarded or rewound, no skipping to the next chapter (it wasn't encoded with chapters). This disc doesn't have any extras, menus, commentaries or anything.I have lived all over the world and have movies from all over the world in my collection. However, this copy looks and feels like an illegal copy that you can pick up for a couple of dollars at any Southeast Asia Electronics market. If this is an illegal copy, it would be the first Blu-ray copy that I have seen; maybe the bootleg market has caught up to Blu-ray already, but I hope not. The ""shrink wrap"" on this movie was not a factory shrink wrap either, again, it was the type of wrapping you find on illegal bootleg copies; it looks like its sealed by a peel and stick type of wrapper.As a comparison, I watched my DVD version, up-converted by my BD Player. The DVD version was of a higher quality and I had all of the menus and chapters.In short, don't be scammed by this bad bootleg copy."	1.0	Not a Real Blu-Ray Copy....

Its one of my all time favorites and it's a classic.Its about a group of kids who find a treasure map and go looking for the treasure. Pretty simple but throw in the booby traps, 3 wanted killers, a deformed giant and you still arent even coming close to describing this hit.All I can say is its a must have for any movie library. I bought a copy for my 5 year old son (warning there is a bit of cursing but hey, I grew up with it so can he)  He loves it and watches it over and over again.

There's a reason The Goonies is beloved by people from my generation; while funny and kid-centered, the writers/directors clearly respected their young audience enough to produce a film that was true to the real joys and fears of childhood, never resorting to crude humor along the way. The Goonies is the ultimate family film, and a fond reminder for kids from the 80s of how great movies used to be.	5.0	Classic!	2014-03-25	0	0	0

Don't get me wrong it rocks, but the new DVD that has the ""deleted scenes"" is a total rip-off.  Those scenes were never deleted they were actual scenes from the original which have since been cut.  I have an old copy and the octopus scene has always been in the movie.  They re-released the movie after cutting out several crucial scenes like the one when they figure out that the coin is actually a map of their own coastline- I mean when you cut that out, how did they ever discover where to look?  Dumb luck?  And if the octopus scene wasn't originally in it, then they did a bad cutting job because at the end when they are all reunited on the beach why are people yelling ""And the giant octopus...!""

Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton (and all of the child actors, really) all bring their A-game to make this a perfect treasure-hunt-meets-coming-of-age film.  Director Richard Donner, writer-producer Stephen Spielberg, and screenwriter Chris Columbus all came together to create a true classic full of memorable scenes, quotable quotes, and phenomenal acting on all parts--adults and their child co-stars.Sadly, the initial driving point of the plot (kids going on a treasure hunt to prevent their homes from being foreclosed) is all too familiar to kids these days, who will relate to the desire to find purportedly mythical treasure to keep their homes and neighborhoods safe.The only thing I would caution parents about is the language (lots of ""s***"" and some inappropriate things said in espa&ntilde;ol)  and scary situations, which I believe would earn The Goonies a PG-13 rating if it were to be released today."	5.0	a classic!	2013-04-13	0	0	0

It starts with a close-knit band of friends spending a last morning together. Their neighborhood is about to be demolished, scattering the families that inhabit it. When they discover an old pirate map, though, they decide to follow it in hopes of finding treasure and saving their homes. What follows is a fast-paced adventure with caverns, crooks, skeletons, booby-traps, and a old pirate ship. There is also a liberal sprinkling of funny lines to go with all the thrills and chills.While this is a fine movie, and great fun to watch, it is not a long-lost Hollywood classic. It doesn't have the action of the Errol Flynn version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, the drama of Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot;, or the classic humor of &quot;Arsenic And Old Lace&quot;. All the five-star ratings here would suggest that this is a movie of classic proportions. It isn't. It's great fun, and I recommend it for family viewing.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1J4NBHCPFBQ82	Arahath	"I grew up with this movie, and I've been in love with it since I first saw it way back when. Just about everything was done exactly right; the casting was perfect, the acting was great, the comedy was hilarious but not overdone, the script and directing and even the music choices were all spot on. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, and all kids. Yes, there are a few swear words used and some typical young teen ""boy"" humor, but I wouldn't consider that a problem for child viewers. Believe me, they hear way worse listening to the real life teens and adults in this world.This movie is about friendship and hope in the face of disaster. It's about optimism and the power of determination and courage, regardless of age. It encourages us to believe that nothing is impossible, the miracles can happen, and that fortune favors the bold. An all around feel-good family friendly and funny movie that still, after all these years, counts among my top 5 favorite movies ever. Want to remember what it was like to be a kid? This is the movie."	5.0	Best of the 80's (and still fantastic today)	2013-09-06	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A11VSS1TVVWOI9	"""armyamy"""	Like a lot of Eightie's kids I grew up watching The Goonies. There's so much nostalgia in it for me. One summer I watched this movie every other day, it seems. It was on the Disney Channel, and my parents taped it, and get this: it had the deleted scenes, in their proper placement! When I heard other Goonies fans talk about the deleted octopus scene and convenience store scene, I was confused, because I always saw the movie with them in it. Weird, huh? In fact, who decided to take them out?Anyway, there's no denying that this movie is still funny and adventure-filled without seeming too out-dated. Don't let the 1985 date fool you: it's as good and fun as the Indiana Jones movies. The special effects look great, even without fancy computer animation. Kids will stay entertained with its fast-paced story, and those of us that are older will appreciate lines like: &quot;'1632, is that a date or something?' 'No, it's your top score on Pole Position.'&quot; and the irony of &quot;Mikey, I'm gonna hit you so hard, when you wake up, your clothes will be outta style!&quot; Maybe the clothes really will be back in style someday.The DVD release promises to be perfect for every true Goonies fan. It Includes commentary by the whole cast, those deleted scenes, and Cyndi Lauper's music video. If you're interested in a movie with good character dynamics, a Steven Spielberg story, and something that's appropriate for the whole family, you should already own this movie. If not, I'm telling you, this is first-rate family entertainment. You won't be dissappointed.	5.0	Growing Up with the Goonies	2002-06-24	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	"This is the kind of stuff every kid dreams about. Having an adventure with your best friends that includes treasure, being chased by bad guys, avoiding the booby traps, and all the while having a massive blast. The Goonies is wickedly fun, includes all the above mentioned, and more. The story is built around such solid characters, characters that you see yourself in, your friends in, your family in. These everyday people are thrust into a wild adventure.Mikey (Sean Astin-- look at how little he is!!) and his brother Bran (Josh Brolin) live in Astoria, where their house is being forclosed on by men who want to build a country club over it. Mikey dreams of finding a buried treasure, ""rich stuff,"" to save his house and the houses of all his friends, who are also being forclosed on. His father works in a museum and has kept priceless artifacts in the attic, where Mikey, Bran, and their gaggle of friends find a treasure map. Mikey can't resist. He has to find this treasure and find out if the stories his father told him about the legendary pirate One Eyed Willy are true.Joining Mikey are his hilarious friends-- Chunk, a clutsy eating machine; Mouth, the joking talker; and Data, the inventor. Andy the cheerleader and her friend Steph tag along too, mostly so Andy can schmooze with Bran. And of course, they are being chased by three inept, money hungry criminals. It's such a whirlwind adventure, so much fun, an Indiana Jones flick of sorts. There aren't that many great adventure films.

Mike, Sean Astin Sam .;'The movie is so much fun to watch on it's own. But watch it with commentary. When it says ` Commentary with hidden treasures', there not kidding.Not only do you get to listin about behind the scenes but all ( if not most ) of the actors and actresses can be seen during the commentary.Even Donner the director is there and it's quiet wonderful and fun to watch.The Goonies is a good funny family film to watch. The acting is kind of goofy but totally worth watching though.Seriously though every DVD in the world should be made like this, or something like this.You get so much entertainment on one DVD.

A friend bought this movie for our kids and we were watching it with her. From the start my husband and I were uncomfortable with the sexual-themed language and 4-letter words, but we kept watching for a little while out of courtesy to our friend. But 10 minutes into the film she began to exchange glances with us, and we all agreed it was totally inappropriate for our kids' ages, and switched to another more appropriate film. I'm not sure that kind of gratuitous language is ever appropriate, but definitely not for the PG crowd. I wish filmmakers didn't think 4-letter words and adult themes were appropriate in kids' movies. Filmmakers must live in a different world than most Americans do. Sure, there are some parents who are okay with this kind of material, but those are the parents that are okay with PG-13 or older material.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"It was the summer of 1985. A summer that will leave a life lasting impression on this little 6 year old kid. I went into the theater and saw The Goonies. What a ride. What a summer. I saw it in the theater 2 or times. I would of seen it again if my dad hadn't persuaded me to try another new movie that just came out. A certain Zemeckis movie about a teenage boy who goes back in time and see his parents when they were his age. Like I said, what a summer!. The Goonies is a special and magical film for all those who were lucky enough to witness it in it's original release. How many of us have had our group of childhood friends who would play, pretend, and just be kids?. How many of us would dream and fantasize of being a superhero, or a pirate, or going on great adventures?. Well, with The Goonies, it's all there. It hits close to home for me not just because of the times and how nostalgic it was, but because it spoke to me. I could of been a Goonie. The film follows a group of Oregon kids(The Goonies) who stumble upon an old treasure map leading to the treasure of pirate One Eye Willie. The kids see it as a way of possibly saving their homes from destruction. From then on, our fearless kids begin their search that leads them thru tunnels, face to face with gun toting criminals, and trying to survive deadly booby traps. It's a wonderful adventure for everyone. The cast is phenomenal. From Sean Astin to Corey Feldman to Jeff Cohen, these are real kids. They seem to really be friends. They all have their own quirks and personalities, and the kids are so talented to pull it all off. The dialogue is sharp and funny, and it always sounds genuine and just ""right"". What is also great about the film is that it has an ""edge"" to it. A certain darkness just underneath that doesn't make it 100% squeaky clean. Some curse words and a corpse helping. The bad guys, The Fratellis, are an interesting bunch. Both seriously menacing and cartoonish at the same time. And really, who didn't want a Sloth of their own after seeing the film?. Some people and critics complain that nostalgic kids from the 80's make the movie out to be better than it is. Maybe, but the movie IS good. Sometimes the hype from it's life long fans are justified. This is one of them. It's funny, it's wild, it has engaging and relatable characters, and it's just...magic. The commentary has all the kids and director Richard Donner, and what's great is that the film will go to a box in the corner and actually show the entire cast sitting there watching while they record the commentary. Outstanding!. They all look great too. A vintage 1985 special and a Cyndi Lauper video round out the package. No bones about it, The Goonies is one of those special gems that lives up to it's legacy. I can still watch this movie and feel like I am 6 years old again sitting in the darkened room at North Division Cinemas. Very few films can do that for me.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	It's incredibly hard to believe, but I seriously think a couple days ago was actually the very first time I ever watched the Goonies. Some of the scenes looked familiar like I'd seen bits and pieces of the film in the past, but I don't think I ever sat down and actually watched it the entire way through.  This is hard to believe considering I spent my entire childhood in the 80's.Well, for the most part it's a family/adventure type film involving a group of troublemaker kids around 10-years old and going on an enormous adventure.  It's funny whenever the kids think they're doing something they'll be grounded for, it's actually mild compared to things kids do in reality.As you can tell, adventure movies came a long way since the Goonies- just look at Harry Potter for example. Two completely different films perhaps, but both putting heavy emphasis on the adventurous aspect of the storytelling.Anyway, this movie aged somewhat well. You can definitely tell it was released in the mid 80's, and my goodness, Anne Ramsey is one of the scariest women of all time! I mean that as a compliment- she'd immediately scare *any* troublemaker child straight just by looking at them with that mean expression on her face!  I remember her fondly throughout the 80's- rest in peace.  A terrific actress she was.This is a pretty good film. I'm surprised it's popular enough to have received 500 reviews here on amazon, but I guess it's easy to see why- it's a fun flick.  Perhaps the Goonies is more important than I'm giving it credit for and it's considered either a perfect timepiece of the 80's, or I'm just underrating its overall popularity, or maybe it's a major influence on something.  Whatever the case, I'm glad I watched it.	5.0	adventurous to the max	2010-07-07	1	1	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2PMQH87R1H3QU	Benjamin Kidman	"Every generation has certain movies that will always transport them back to childhood. ""The Goonies"" does that for alot of people in my generation. The cool thing about this flick is, not only does it take you back, but, once there, it captures so wonderfully what the best moments of being a kid felt like. Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family. ""Stand By Me"" is the only other film that has so accurate a portrait of adolescent boys interacting with each other. The cast had such an amazing chemistry. Great direction by Richard Donner, and this is Spielberg magic in it's prime. This fantastic DVD presentation does the film justice. Some may think this movie is way too 80's, but to me ""The Goonies"" is an essential classic."	5.0	BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD!!! AHHhh... MEMORIES..	2008-09-14	1	0	1
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2JJSCIGPZDWHI	BENJAMIN MILER	I might not be the biggest '80s nostalgia buff, although I did grow up in the 1980s, and I was 12 years old when The Goonies hit the theaters in mid 1985. The movie was a Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg production, which was set in Oregon (in Astoria and Cannon Beach, both on the north coast). I was still living in Oregon then, but in Eugene. Wonderful adventure of a bunch of middle school kids in search of pirate treasure, the pirate being One-Eyed Willy. They did this since their home was to be destroyed by greedy land developers who wants to build a golf course. The kids solve many puzzles and avoid mobsters (one of the Fratellis was played by Anne Ramsey, who two years later starred with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal on Throw Momma From the Train) as they reach the treasure. Great film that certainly reminds me of my childhood, and I highly recommend it.	5.0	One of my all-time favorite '80s kids adventure movies	2004-10-04	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AB0GGIQBNB36Q	Ben Milton	ahh the Goonies, this movie came out in '85. One year after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, now you may ask why that's so important, because steven spielberg thought that Temple of Doom was too violent. And asked that ratings board to come up with a rating between PG and R, thus PG-13 was born. Goonies is PG, I won't go through the plot since that's been done a thousand times. This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and now that I'm married with a child on the way. I hope this movie becomes one of her favorites, who didn't dream of finding a pirate treasure map, following it. Going through all those traps, and finding the ship at the end, with all that gold. Priceless, considering it's directed by the same man who directed Superman The movie. Dick Donner himself, I would give this movie more stars if i could. Would I sit my two year old, or three old in front of it, no. But i would sit my seven year old in front of it. This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy day, it gets the imagination going. I can say nothing but good things about this movie. Plus Lyle Alzado is in it as Sloth.	5.0	HEY YOU GUYS	2012-01-25	1	1	0

On this DVD, they have included several deleted scenes and one of them is the octopus scene.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2ZP19WHWQ6P5W	Bev	I recently ordered this movie to watch with my 7 yr. old grandson.  I barely remembered seeing it when it first came out with my son, who was at the time 12 yrs old.  I recalled it being somewhat of an adventure/mystery, which it is.  However, the kids swear throughout the movie and in one scene, one of the boys is taunting another telling him about seeing his mother naked, taking pictures, etc.  All totally unnecessary for the story line, but I guess Spielberg felt it made it more real.  I shut the movie off before finishing--It is still a good story, but if you try to avoid foul language situations for your kids, this is not going to be ok, especially for younger kids.	2.0	Too much swearing for a kid movie	2012-09-25	8	4	4
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1Q6AYG4U2KFW6	B. Garland	This is a wonderful movie, but the newly released blu-ray version doesn't do it justice. Surely they could have done a better transfer than this. It is extremely grainy in parts, almost like VHS (no I'm not kidding). Blade Runner, which was filmed a couple years before The Goonies, looks much better on blu-ray as does Back to the Future (which was filmed a couple years after). I really don't understand why such a widely loved classic movie got such a so-so treatment when transferred to blu-ray. Bummer.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1YB29BIDULEYE	"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch"""	"What makes this movie so great is not only the great stories, but the lovable and believable characters.The story starts actually quite sad in that some friends are going to have to leave their homes, which of course also means leaving each other. We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: ""That's right.""An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: ""I'm starting to like this kid.""While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3S5WYWYKSAI9C	Bradley Olin	"Adventure, Pirates, Treasure, Heroics...and children?It's easy to see why this film has become a ""Cult Classic"" amongst Gen X-ers and Y-ers: it's entertaining on many levels.  While it still feels distinctly like an 80's film, it definitely has withstood the test of time.  A group of children are placed in a situation whereby they encounter a variety of ""grown-up"" experiences and have to adapt.  Humorous and awkward situations unfold, and the story stays compelling throughout.  I still enjoy this film as much as I did when I was a kid, and have gone out of my way to see it at midnight showings downtown, etc.  The commentary and other features are nice bonuses, and make the DVD all the more worthy of adding to your collection.The bottom line: This is a great adventure film that will please kids and adults alike!"	5.0	Timeless Children's Adventure	2006-12-20	1	1	0

It's about a tightly-knit group of friends who are trying to find a way to  spend their last weekend together. Because of a greedy company their  neighborhood is about to be turned into a golf course. While exploring the  attic they find an authentic 17th century treasure map, deciding to find  the gold and save the neighborhood they set out to a sumtarrenan cavern  full of booby-traps and skelatons. You've got to see this film, there are a  few jokes not meant for younger kids like the breaking of a certain part on  the famous statue David and one character Mouth mis-translating packing  instructions to a Spanish housekeeper.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AK2AQIULQDFS5	Bradley Tobin	"Mikey and Brand, Data and Mouth, Andy and Stef, and last but not least, Chunk. Who could Possibly forget the Adventures of ""The Goonies?"" A Film that shaped Many a Childhood, including mine, and Still holds the title of the Best Kid's Adventure film Ever.The amount of Big name Talent behind the scenes is Phenomenal. Richard Donner is in the Directors Chair; Steven Spielberg came up with the Story and Produced it while Chris Columbus wrote the Screenplay. Rarely is a film in Such Good Hands.My Favourite Scenes are Too Numerous to List, but I Will Anyway. Firstly we have the Spectacular opening Prison Escape and Car Chase, then the ""Truffle Shuffle"" scene (I Think that's how you Pronounce it), Mouth showing Rosalita around the house, the gang escaping from Brand (Data: ""Hey Brand, how far can you stretch that?), Mouth causing Chunk to open the door of the Restaurant, the gangs first ""Sloth"" encounter (Chunk: ""Sounds like Kong""), the Fertelli's picking up Chunk (Chunk: ""In Third grade I cheated on my History exam, In Forth grade..."").

So Please Mr. Donner think about it, you already have done a special edition of your other films like Superman. So why not this Classic? it would'nt be much work to restore the scenes anyway. You could do a Special edition package with  both discs of both versions in it. just thought from a fan.P.S.  anyone else reading this if you get a chance to visit where the  Goonies were filmed it's a blast such a nice town too.  visit imdb  for the locations. Goonie Rock and Mikey's House are Awsome to see!Highly Recommended Film.Heyyyy-- You Guys!! a quote. i could'nt help myself.	5.0	A Note To Richard Donner And Warners From a Goonies Fan.	2007-04-25	4	3	1

Now, 16 years after first seeing it, I now have the Goonies on DVD, and I must say it is a great disc.First off the deleted scenes. I have been waiting forever to see the infamous octopus scene. Well it sucked, but only through this great DVD was I able to finally see it. Most of the cut scenes were cut for a reason (they were bad) but it is fun to see them anyways, and some of them fill in some of the gaps found when watching the finished movie.The great thing about this disc is the commentary. Instead of just a audio commentary with a director and a few actors, the makers of the disc got all the original Goonies, and director Richard Donner, to do a video commentary. So while you watch the movie, you also see all the Goonies, all grown up, talk about the film and have fun while they relive the time they spent together while they were filming it. I just wish Corey ""Mouth"" Feldman could have shut up for at least two seconds during it!All in all a great DVD for a classic movie. Buy it already! Oh and you get the Cindy Lauper music video too!

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2HZ2J6HVKG1CP	Brian Clifton	"The Goonies is a classic 80s movie that is a part of many people's childhood.  I have seen the movie over 200 times since I was around 7 years old (and I'm 26 now).  This movie is in my top 5 of all times.  Cyndi Lauper's ""Goonies R Good Enough"" song makes the movie even better.The main character, Mikey (Sean Austin), was also Sam in Lord of the Rings but I always think of him as Mikey from Goonies.  And Short Round from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom makes an appearance as ""Data"".Astoria is a great place to visit!  You can even go see the Goonies house in person among the other places in the movie shot in Astoria.  I haven't been since I was younger but I plan to visit Astoria again and go to all of the major places from the movie.I seriously doubt any new movies will ever stand up to the quality and timelessness of this movie.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Brainchild of cinematic genius Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is a thrilling fantasy adventure film for younger audiences - although adults will find it enjoyable as well. Foreshadowing the success of the Harry Potter films, The Goonies involves a series of tests and obstacles that a group of young kids must overcome in order to save the day. In a lot of ways, the film is like an Indiana Jones for kids - produced in such a way that kids can envision or fantasize about being in just such a situation.The film follows the exploits of a neighborhood group of kids who call themselves The Goonies. Upset that they will soon have to part ways because of the forced commercial development of their neighborhood, the kids are enjoying what they believe will be one of their last meetings together.But while Mikey, Chunk, Mouth, and Data (the nicknames of the Goonies respectively) are exploring Mikey's attic, they find a treasure map hidden in the back of an old picture frame. Purportedly, the map leads to the long lost treasure of the famous pirate ""One-Eyed"" Willy. Banding together with Mikey's older brother Brandon and two neighborhood girls, Andy and Stef, the group sets out to uncover the pirate's vast riches and thus save their homes from the wrath of the wrecking ball.But a small problem stands in their way. The treasure map's starting point rests underneath an old abandoned house used as a hideout by the notorious Fratelli crime family. Brothers Jake and Francis, coupled with their deformed yet gentle brother and mean Mama Fratelli, are quite an intimidating force. When the Goonies manage to uncover the entrance to the cave that harbors their treasure, Chunk is left behind. The Fratelli's viciously interrogate the boy in an effort to find out what happened to his friends. But it takes a freak accident (spilled water falling down the hole in the fireplace) before they find One-Eyed Willy's secret passage.With the Fratelli family hot on their heals, the Goonies must pass through a series of mental and physical obstacles set up centuries before by pirates intent on keeping undesirables away from their precious bounty. Interspersed in the action is a number of clever and humorous one-liners that add to the overall audience enjoyment of the film.In the end, the kids discover One-Eyed Willy's monstrous treasure. But can they stave off the greedy ambitions of the Fratelli family? Will they manage to save their neighborhood with the newfound treasure? You'll have to watch to find out, and trust me, this movie is a lot of fun...Each of the stars contributes to the film in his own way. Chunk provides many moments of comic relief with his endless whining, and Data's constant deployment of quirky homemade inventions, although stretching the limits of reality, are a welcome addition to a fantasy adventure film tailored for a young audience.With the introduction of The Goonies DVD, an entirely new generation can discover the thrill and wonder of this instant cinema classic. Given its wide range of appeal to audiences of all ages and the exciting quest for hidden treasure, The Goonies passes the test as a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it, or even worse - if your children have been deprived of seeing it - then I highly recommend renting this one...The DVD Report"	5.0	Indiana Jones for kids...	2005-04-19	2	2	0

It made me sad that the mean lady was mean to him on the boat just because his face is different than hers. She is an ugly, mean lady.My favorite parts are about the camera belt and the oily shoes that squirt oil on the log. How come I wish i had some of those so I could use them on my little sister when she is anoying me.One question I still have is I wonder if they will ever fix his face with the money from the buried treasures?

The DVD has extra footage and the Goonies music video (in it's entirety, part 1 and part 2). This is one of the all time greatest family films.There aren't many other films like this - I'd like to say it's an Indiana Jones for kids, but it's not. It doesn't dumb any thing up and even has some adult style humor (but nothing to shy kids away from).Full of one liners and quotes I still use to this day, ""This one, this one right here - this was my dream, my wish, and it didn't come true, so I'm taking it back.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2TAF3IYQKM5H2	"Chad Moore ""p3jedi"""	"This has always been one of my very favorite movies. The DVD is one of the best with its cool 3D option screens. I loved seeing ""The Goonies"" pristine, in surround sound, and--best of all--in widescreen. The extras were fab; especially the hilarious feature-length commentary reuniting all the kids from the film. It was worth the price of the DVD alone. (Although I do wonder why the remarkable Sean Astin disappears halfway through.) It was also cool to see the Cyndi Lauper music video again after all these years.The only thing that really disappointed me was that the three deleted scenes were not added back into the film. You can only view them separately which, quite frankly, bites. What's so strange about ""The Goonies"" deleted scenes is that many years ago, Disney Channel aired the film with all the deletions reinstated! I actually have this version on a video tape and I was hoping the DVD would be the complete film.All in all, an excellent DVD."	5.0	The Goonies Rock!	2001-12-26	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1Q329PGKOGLDD	Chad Spivak	I remember watching THE GOONIES as a child and loving it.  Now, I can share in the enjoyment of watching it with my children.  This is probably the most complete DVD available today.THE GOONIES is a wonderful story of a bunch of friends that experience the magical ties and bonds of their friendships.  It is a classic story of good vs. evil, and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful writing it.A group of friends are out in search of &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie's hidden treasure in the hopes of stopping a land developer from taking their homes.  Once they find the pirate's map in their attic, the wild fun begins as the group is put through many rigorously challanging tasks in their quest.The film moves along at a rapid pace, with excellent acting, witty dialogue, and a nice, cohesive storyline that is fun and easy to follow.  You can't help but cheer for the Goonies to succeed in their search.Besides the entertaining film, the DVD is loaded with some super extras.  A Cyndi Lauper music video, three never-seen-before scenes, and some excellent commentary by some of the actors are just a few of the perks of the DVD.This movie is nothing but fun, and with the help of a super, colorful cast of actors, THE GOONIES is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a pleasure to watch the magic unfold on the screen.  This is a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by everyone, especially people with children.	5.0	&quot;Hey You Guys!&quot;  This DVD Rocks!	2001-09-10	9	7	2

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2H44WVZS59KKT	"Cheryl Stout ""broiderqueen - army mama"""	"Watching ""The Goonies"" again brought back many good memories of watching it when it first came out in 1985 with my oldest son.  We both loved this movie and I am quite sure my son imagined himself being a Goonie, having this wonderful gang of friends, treasure hunting.I think the movie has held up well even though 26 years have gone by since it first came out.  Yes, there are some dated parts of the movie: hair styles, clothes, glasses, bicycles - but overall this is a movie that even in another 26 years, young and old will still enjoy.There is big business vs. small property owner; escaped convicts; young love; bullies; friendship; treasure hunting; pirates; a giant; puzzles to figure out; brotherly competition; and good winning out over evil.  These are all pretty timeless themes.These young actors got a good start in this movie.  Most have gone on to much bigger things. Sean Astin - Samwise Gamgee in the Lord of the Rings trilogy plus many other roles in movies; Josh Brolin - many distinguished roles on TV and movies including ""No Country For Old Men"", ""Milk"", and the remake of ""True Grit""; Jeff Cohen became an entertainment attorney with his own law firm in Beverly Hills; Corey Feldman continued acting on TV, movies, and stage, also is involved in music and is an environmental activist; Kerri Green continued acting on TV and movies, co-founded a movie production company and writes screenplays; Jonathan Ke Quan has continued acting on TV and movies and has worked as a stunt choreographer; Martha Plimpton has been nominated for an Emmy and three Tonys, has continued acting on TV (I still remember the amazing episode of Law and Order: SVU she received the Emmy nomination for and she is currently starring in the FOX sitcom ""Raising Hope""), in movies, in plays,she sings and is considered to be one of the hardest working actors in show business.  With this talented bunch of young talent, is it any wonder that ""The Goonies"" is still standing the test of time and keeping us entertained? Plus Steven Spielberg wrote the story.  Talk about a no-brainer.One note - John Matuszak, ex-NFL Oakland Raiders football player that played ""Sloth"" in the movie, died in 1989 at 38 years old of heart failure caused by drugs and possibly pneumonia.  Tooz lived hard and partied hard but he'll live on in this movie as the scary looking but loving Sloth, friend to Chunk and the rest of the Goonies."	5.0	"""Sloth love Chunk."""	2011-01-13	2	1	1

The characters and dialog are real-- kids don't always take turns when they talk (and groups of boys don't always use language that their parents would approve of)! Some &#34;mild&#34; cuss words, some &#34;mildy&#34; scary parts for the younger or more sensitive viewers.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3ND9IE3518YIS	Christina	The Goonies has to be hands down, the BEST movie to ever come out of the 80's. I was only a year old when it came out in the theaters, but I saw for the first time when I was very little, and to this day I still love it! This movie has some of the funniest and best lines I have ever heard..and whats even better is watching it on DVD. It looks like new now that it has been digitally enhanced, as well as the sound being enhanced. Its also in widescreen, so you get to see what was probably cut out of the background. And as for being the un-cut version, thats even better. It sux when they play it on tv, and they leave out the &quot;Mouth en Espanol&quot; scene (one of my favorites).  The Cyndi Lauper music video in the 'Special Features' section is hilarious..it was nice to see the video in its entirety (since I never saw the whole thing, lol). Also, the outtakes feature is cool, because you get to see scenes that were originally cut out of the movie. Theres the quicky mart scene, the ever-so-talked-about octopus scene (now we know what Data means about the huge octopus at the end), a small scene with Sloth and Chunk (which they SHOULD HAVE left in, it was soooo funny!!) and theres another outtake that I am probably leaving out, but those are just a few! You can also watch the Commentary (which is kinda boring, but at least you get to see the actors all grown up). Then theres the usual foriegn language settings, and the theatrical trailer. And if you havent seen this movie before (shame on you! j/k) I hope you enjoy it!! :-)	5.0	Still the best!! Goonies deserves 10 stars....	2001-12-30	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1FC4WISC65NMI	Christmas Movie Buff	"There are so many reviews about this movie so I'll cut to the chase.  It is a movie about kids being kids!  So there is a bad  word from time to time - they are on a pirates treasure hunt and the conditions for that are not usually pretty sky's and chirping birds.  One turn of events lead to another and it keeps you on your seat, and at most times pretty funny.  All the characters fit their parts and the acting for the age group is better than most adult movies I see these days.I have a slew of movies that family go through when they visit and I have had more comments about having the Goonies movie than any.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A129PHJ3YO5JH7	Cicero	No idea why others enjoy it so much, and I have no idea why it would be PG. I certainly didn't consider some of the subject references (e.g.: sexual torture chambers, using the rear view mirror to look down her shirt, ...) something I thought my young kids were ready to be hearing, though I guess it passed over their heads. I thought the humor was generally unsophisticated and slightly vulgar (not too bad, but not too good either) and I can see why teen kids would like it but not parents nor younger kids. I turned it off after about an hour and my kids did not object at all.I watched it on prime and the sound quality was poor and hard to understand, but I'm not sure if that was prime or the movie, as this was the first prime film I had watched.	1.0	Bored and somewhat annoyed	2013-12-02	15	1	14

Her songs are, basically, a reflection whenever they are played.I admit that I bought this movie because of the story and the music, but the soundtrack is something that pushed me to buy it.This movie has a intelligent storyline and great writing.  The acting and the directing are not bad, at all.But, to put it quickly, the story is about destiny, and, pretty much, the destiny of 7 children in a small town of this movie.Big developers move in to try to take over this town, but these kids find a unique and different way to fight back.'Great adventure.If you've seen the film, it's good to watch over again.If not, try renting from Netflix first.	5.0	' Great fun, especially for those of the Gen X, 80's crowd.	2007-09-26	0	0	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A186AQVVKCANL5	clwinter	The Goonies is one of my all-time favorite movies from when I was a kid in the '80s. Honestly, what 10 year old wouldn't want to be a Goonie, running around your neighborhood looking for lost treasure and trying to escape from the Fratelli gang who are after you and your treasure?This DVD is a pretty good one when it comes to feaurettes and extras. There is an outtake montage scene which is  not nearly long enough but that is a negative I find on a lot of DVDs. The Cyndi Lauper music video could have definitely been left out but the extra scenes and the commentary more than make up for it.This is a rare look at the early career of Sean Astin as well, who has gone on to star in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has said that he has very fond memories of making this movie (his first) and it is no wonder. Being on a set with a bunch of other kids with that great pirate ship and waterfall to go down, who wouldn't.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a little adventure and a little fun. This is a movie that's been around a while which attests to its staying power. After all Goonies never say die!	4.0	Goonies Never Say Die	2004-07-29	3	3	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	In 1985, Steven Spielberg (the Indiana Jones filmsandE.T.) served as an executive producer on the Goonies, an adventure film based on a story by Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner (Superman). Since the film's release, it's become a cult classic of sorts, as well as being a favorite film for nostalgic teens and adults.The story follows a group of outcast kids growing up in Oregon, who call themselves the Goonies, as they spend their last weekend together before their parents are forced to sell their homes to make way for a golf course. Mikey, the youngest and most precocious of the Goonies, finds a pirate's treasure map in his attic and realizes that if the Goonies can find the treasure then their parents won't have to sell their homes. Mikey and his good friends, Chunk, Mouth, and Data begin following the clues that will lead to the treasure and they're eventually joined by Mikey's older brother, Brand and two high school girls, Andy and Stef. But things become complicated when a family of second-rate criminals, the Fratellis, catch Chunk and find out about the treasure. Jake and Francis Fratelli lock Chunk up in a room with their deformed brother, Sloth. Sloth may be fearsome in appearance but his grotesque exterior hides a heart of gold, and he and Chunk become fast friends. Meanwhile the other Goonies make their way through a series of underground tunnels, all the way avoiding booby traps and following the clues. Little do they know that the Fratellis, lead by Mama Fratelli, are in hot pursuit. But can the Goonies find the pirates' treasure and save their homes, and can they outsmart the Fratellis?Like many of Spielberg's own films, The Goonies follows a specific formula. The kids, like those in E.T., swear frequently and use vulgar language, so parents be warned. There's also some risqu&eacute; humor and comic violence, but most of which is simply too funny to be offensive. When inspected closely, the story unravels due to numerous plot holes, continuity errors, and a general lack of realism. But that's all part of the charm of The Goonies.The ensemble cast is terrific especially Sean Astin as Mikey, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Ke Huy Quan as Data, Josh Brolin as Brand, Martha Plimpton as Stef, Kerri Green as Andy, John Matuszak as Sloth, Robert Davi as Jake Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis Fratelli, and Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.The excellent DVD includes outtakes (features the infamous missing octopus scene), The Making of The Goonies vintage featurette, a ridiculously silly 12-minute Cyndi Lauper music video, theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary (with video commentary by Richard Donner, Sean Astin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Ke Huy Quan, Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green). This audio/video commentary is perhaps the most entertaining feature I've ever seen on a DVD and alone makes this a worthy purchase.Also recommended:GremlinsBack to the Future - The Complete TrilogyExplorersFlight of the NavigatorThe Monster SquadHome AloneThe Sandlot	4.0	"""Goonies Never Say Die!"""	2008-09-24	2	1	1

A likable crew of misfits always appeals to me, and this movie's got them.  The childish goofiness is funny, Mikey's dreamy optimism is touching, and the adventure the goonies go on is exciting.  The acting is decent for such young kids.  The sets are cool, and the creepy gangsters are both menacing and funny.  The cut-scenes on the DVD aren't that great, though.  It's easy to see why they were cut.  The Cyndi Lauper video is amusing, featuring many 80's wrestling stars.  All in all, a good addition to the collection of any child of the 80's.	5.0	Make me feel like a woman!	2001-10-25	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A27BF3YQB9N8AH	Darth Rater	This is a kids adventure film, apparently written for the young teen.  A small group of kids, whose families are about to be evicted for lack of funds, search for a mythical pirate's supposed burried treasure.  As a sub-plot, they tangle with a family of outlaws who don't want the authorities to know their whereabouts.  Most of the time the kids are screaming one thing or another.  Of course, what teen flick would be complete without the characters experimenting with love?  Some rather contrived circumstances allow for this experimentation in the midst of searching for treasure while being pursued by outlaws.  Over all, this is a pretty poor film.	1.0	Goonies is for Lunies	2014-01-15	17	0	17
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	ADVX0P3EIKWBK	Darth Wader	"Goonies, the greatest 80's movie of all times, is one of those movies that doesn't ever get old to me.  I remember loving this movie as a kid, and as an adult, well, some things never change!  I can still quote most lines from this movie, and although that annoys some people, other people love to quote it right back at me.  The Goonies is an adventure from the get-go and it keeps you rooting for the Goonies the entire time while hating the Fratelli's.  Donner and Spielberg have created a timeless movie with all of the pure 80's goodness.  Let's face it: the hair, the outfits, the music, the sayings.  It's all outdated.  But the story and characters are timeless, and the movie is bursting with energy.  Sean Astin is gold in this movie, and I was glad to see him get his career back on track after The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  And can I say that I had the biggest crush on Kerri Green?!  Wow!  She was great in ""Lucas"" as well.  Corey Feldman, is well, he's Corey Feldman, and he's extremely annoying in the DVD commentary (so much so that his constant interrupting sends Sean Astin to leave and not come back!).  Chunk does a great Truffle Shuffle and other characters round out this wildly entertaining adventure.  And there are funny little mistakes in the movie (like Sean Astin calling Josh Brolin ""Josh"" instead of by his character's name ""Brand"" when they are in the basement), but the deleted scenes help answer some of those mistakes (like the octopus being scary).  Watching the deleted scenes makes you feel like it was the right decision that they were deleted because most of them DID NOT look good!  I am actually pretty happy that there never was a sequel as I think it probably wouldn't have been that good and that our expectations would be too high, and ultimately, all of us who loved the original would have been disappointed.  And I do agree that this movie is actually more like a PG-13 movie.  Too much unnecessary language that shouldn't have been there in the first place."	5.0	Down here, it's our time.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3I4MKL0XER255	David	About 10 years ago, i saw The Goonies for the first time.  I was in awe at the complex characters and their personalities, and especially at the concept of the pirate ship filled with gold and jewels beneath an italian resturant.  I liked the chinese kid, I cant remember his name right now, and his kool gadgets.  I was kinda freaked out by that monster that is chained up under the italian resturant though, he was kinda scary at first, but then i kinda warmed up to him cause i saw he was nice.  Although it may seem farfetched to someone else, i overall think the Goonies is a great movie and a little getaway everytime i find the time to sit down and relive my childhood.	4.0	Goonies great!	2001-04-20	1	1	0

But, the Goonies was mostly dark and very hard to see. My kids couldn't see the picture so they were hard to sit still and they are older than 10. They now hate the Goonies movie. Next time we will plan ahead and visit our local store and buy one and watch it on the tv. Plus the movie was a wide screen style and we couldn't figure how to get it as full screen. If we wanted to listen to a movie we would have bought a book on cd! If you can fix it to show full screen and fix the dark screen we mite rent a one that shows up brighter.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Part preteen mystery novel, part shiver-me-timbers adventure trek, &quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic example of crowd-pleasing entertainment that needs no logic in order to tell its story. Director Richard Donner seems to have gathered this seek-and-find journey from the childhood fantasies of every child in the world a dozen times over, and the result is pure, unrelenting fun from beginning to end!The plot is the simplest one imaginable: Mikey, Mouth, Data, and Chunk, a group of friends who call themselves The Goonies, stumble across a centuries-old map of the upper West Coast, near their homes, where there is a treasure believed to be buried somewhere along the shoreline. Despite the disagreement of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, they leave in search of the treasure, in hopes that their newfound riches will save their homes from a greedy developer.Their hopes are somewhat thwarted when the path to the treasure lands them face-to-face with the Fratellis, a mother-son crime team who begin tracking the kids once they realize that there is money at stake. As they all make their way deeper and deeper into the caverns leading to the pirate ship, they encounter dangers that will keep kids on the edge of their seats.This is all done with a high level of laughter, lightheartedness, and surprising enjoyment. Each character is given a certain demeanor, different from others. Mikey is crippled by a speech impediment, while Chunk, like his name, is husky and clumsy; Data has a pseudo-James Bond fascination about him, and Mouth is outspoken and crude. All of their personalities combine with hilarious results, a special part of the film's magical charm.The cast also seems to be having a tremendous amount of fun with the movie. To scrutinize their performances is completely cynical, for their is little that can be criticized. The dialogue is corny from the start, but everyone takes it all in stride, and together, they polish off each moment with comedic joy and humor.As a child, I enjoyed this movie immensely, and as I look back on it, the adventure was quite suspenseful, due to my age and experience with movies. The journey through the underground caverns, the booby traps, the children at the hands of the not-so-cunning crooks... all of this is pure magic for a kid, without being overly frightening. Now, as an adult, the movie has a much different effect on me, allowing me to recall my childhood fantasies, and the vast enjoyment I had for this film.&quot;The Goonies&quot; is a classic adventure that appeals to many, kids and adults alike. It's got a charm and sense of humor that grow on you, and its indulgence in its own corniness is, in its own way, appealing. For those who experienced it as a child, to watch it now is to recapture a pleasurable memory from childhood; for those new to the experience, it recalls your own fantasies and beliefs as a kid, and leaves you smiling with satisfaction.	5.0	A child fantasy masterpiece!	2001-10-03	6	5	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"The first thing I was thinking when ""Goonies"" really kicked into gear was: This is the daydream of an adventure-loving preadolescent boy, full of pirates, bloodthirsty villains, and exotic twists and turns in an underground maze full of booby traps. It's sort of ""Indiana Jones"" for the kids as well as the adults.The Goonies (a band of young boys) are spending their last weekend hanging around their hometown, before it's razed for yuppie developers. Then Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) uncovers a treasure map hidden in an old painting, and becomes obsessed with finding the lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willie. With that treasure, they could save their town.But the hunt for treasure sends the Goonies, Mikey's long-suffering teenage brother (Josh Brolin), and a pair of teenage girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) into dangerous proximity to the murderous fugitives, the Fratellis. With the Fratellis on their tail, the Goonies are determinedly navigating the underground, booby-trap-infested tunnels that lead to the treasure -- or to a very nasty demise.The stolidly mature among you may scoff at the improbability of the story, but who cares? This is obviously a fantasy story, harkening back to pirate treasure and childhood adventures, thwarting the evil guys. The classic formulae are what makes it so fun. ""Goonies"" is like ""Indiana Jones"" in the sense that it's action-filled, with nasty villains, elaborate booby-traps, and a plotline that is wonderfully improbable. This is just fun. The sets are amazingly complex, full of stone tunnels and enormous waterfalls full of money, thin little bridges and a bone piano that causes the floor to collapse.Sean Astin (yes, this is THAT Sean Astin, the guy currently starring as Samwise Gamgee in ""Lord of the Rings"") is endearing and very convincing as Mikey, the gutsy boy that could. Josh Brolin is also good as his overbearing but nice brother; the other Goonies include the incredibly funny Corey Feldman as ""Mouth"" (the scene where he weirds out the cleaning lady is priceless), comic relief Jeff Cohen as ""Chunk"" who bumbles from one misadventure to another, and Jonathan Ke Quan (who was also in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") as gadget-obsessed ""Data,"" a kid riddled all over with homemade inventions that occasionally save the heroes' behinds.Though this film was made in the 1980s, it's aged extremely well -- now there is affection on top of the original liking for it. It's a funny, entertaining thrillride with pirates, villains, treasure and a band of quirky heroes. Great fun."	5.0	Fun ride	2003-02-17	62	51	11
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A138826JMC0J3T	E. Batica	The Goonies to this day is still one of my avorites! This is just an awesome movie! It starts out that Mikey (a young Sean Astin) finds out that they have to move because a rich man is buying up their house and putting a golf course down in it's place.While haning out with his friends Mouth (Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Quan) and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), they find a map of their town and on the map it says there is buried treasure. Mikey then gets the idea that if they found the treasure, they wouldn't have to leave! In a wild and crazy adventure from hiding from the criminal family the Fratelli's, who want that treasure too, to dodging booby traps to some good old laughs, this is a great family comedy movie that will entertain the entire family.Now there is some swearing and sexual humor in this movie but it's very minute compared to some of the things these days. It's almost a timeless classic that you'll never get bored of. Pick up this movie and enjoy!	5.0	The Goonies	2002-12-24	3	3	0

"This movie was little more than your typical 80's ""Teen angst"" movie, starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin and (we hope) a sober and drug free Corey Feldman. A search for pirate treasure, a trio of bad guys who keep their deformed brother locked in a basement and an Indiana Jones-like trek through tunnels, caves and booby traps takes this from a campy 80's kid flick to an enjoyable Richard Donner film.I just watched it again this past weekend with my 9 year old. He sat wide-eyed at the tense parts, laughed his toosh off at the funny parts and raised a freaked out brow at the first sighting of Sloth...And when it was all over, he asked me a very simple question... ""When's part two coming out?""I didn't know what to tell him. After 20 years, if they haven't made one by now, they're not likely to make one.

It's a rare person of a certain age who wouldn't immediately know what you were talking about if you said the words ""One Eyed Willie"" to them.In these days of CGI special effects, increasing violence, and sadly, decreasing innocence in children, a film like The Goonies is a real gem.  It's a classic Good-versus-Evil yarn, where even the Evil isn't really all that bad.  And what's more, it showed us that a bunch of goofy kids like us could take on big business & organised crime, and win.In the Goonies we join Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk and Co. on an adventure to find the lost treasure of the pirate One Eyed Willie, which, bless 'em, they want so that they can rescue their home town from being razed to the ground by greedy developers.  This film is more or less an Indiana Jones for kids, with some brilliant ""booby twaps"" and many genuinely funny moments.This DVD isn't avilable in Region 2 encoding until Septemer (2002), and I'm just short of marking off the days on my calendar til it's released."	5.0	Hey you Guys!	2002-08-19	0	0	0

But how wonderful it was for those of us in the pre teen years, who saw this when it first came out. How magical the ride was.I mean Speilberg, Donner and Chris Columbus. I mean the cream of the incessant crop.""Goonies"" is quintessential Speilberg. When a film, not in the era of CGI, and computer animated everything, can just grip you with an amazing score, a slew of talented kids, and a storyline that is gripping, flowing and totally fun, you feel so great about yourself over and over again. I can be down in the dumps to the extreme, and throw Goonies in, and it takes my through a rough day with smiles and enticing childlike splendor.How many of us wanted to be part of that group? How many of us dreamt, in those wee hours, before slept crept in, when we saw Goonies for the first time, or the 90th time, and dreamt such amazing things: to find hidden treasure, to climb down wells and discover hidden caves, to dig through canals and taverns in our backyards and find our own One Eyed Willie, eye mattey, ehhhhhh, yes, the magic of the Gonnies so transformed my youth and brought me to that magical place of make believe, which only the brilliance of Speilberg can do producing. Pirates of the Carribean doesn't touch Goonies for sentimentality or the like.I will never forget seeing this when I was 9 or 10 or so, and getting all red with my mother when they kiss in the dark. I was learning about life then, and Goonies certainly helped me realize the wonderous things I was to look forward to.Not to mention that the character actress Anne Ramsey is impeccably sinister and perfect in her role as Mom Fratelli.One of my favorite films in the world as a child, and totally up there even by today's standards.Chunk, Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, and the hilarious performance by Corey Feldman.Thank you."	4.0	what a magical, wonderous joyride	2007-07-06	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A30IPSAE3DIHEI	Ella	One of the best kids movies ever made. It's fun and fast-paced but has a great deal of heart. The entire cast looks like they're having a blast from start to finish. And to all the helicopter parents complaining about the language? LMAO! What century are you people in? The kids in the movie are all 12+ and the f-bomb isn't used once. It's sad that today's kids movies are totally watered down because of all you stifling prudes.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	I don't think I've ever seen a movie so corny yet so cute at the same time. Despite the 1980s special effects and acting, there's a certain charm toThe Goonies. It's largely from the energy of the kids - led byThe Lord Of The Rings's Sean Astin. The kids are loud - sometimes too loud - but they're also adorable. The movie follows them along on their quest for lost treasure - and maturity. This is a great adventure movie for kids (although Sloth might be a bit scary).	4.0	Corny in a cute sort of way	2010-06-25	0	0	0

It was VERY reasonably priced, and had a lot of extras even a game. The first moment I got it, i pulled back the wrapping and placed it in my Blu-Ray player, and played it a couple of times. My kids loved it, and even played the game that came with it. We took sorry out of game nights and added the goonied board game. I am very satistfied with my purchase.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A146D2LYLICNLS	eric_f	What can I say about this super-cool excellent movie that hasn't already been said? Not much, other than it's one of the classic &quot;fun&quot; movies from the 80's that's just as enjoyable today as it was when it was first released. You got everything here: action, adventure, romance, thrills, chills and most of all, a lot of FUN. Is it somewhat silly? Perhaps. Does one need to suspend their disbelief? Absolutely. But that's all part of the fun, and what makes it so great to watch. They just don't make movies like this anymore.I'm really glad to see that this great movie has gotten the DVD treatment it deserves, full of extras. My favorite has to be the Cyndi Lauper video of &quot;The Goonies 'R' Good Enough.&quot; I just love the 80's &quot;cheese&quot; factor of it; what a guilty pleasure. A must-have movie for anyone who likes to just sit back and enjoy the ride. What a fun time those 80's were.	5.0	Absolute classic from the 80's, enough said	2004-06-11	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK	"Eric James Cooper ""ejames43"""	"Growing up in the 80's - The Goonies was one of the most incredible movies for me. It captures all of the childhood joy and want of adventure and excitement that a normal day just doesn't bring. This movie, while it is clearly an ""80's"" flick, does not appear dated in any way. It still has that spark that gave it life nearly 20 years ago.That said, here's what you get with this DVD and here's why you should buy it today:The movie itself is enough however...The deleted scenes are a lot of fun. We finally get to see the ever-fabled ""Octopus"" scene. For years, I would scratch my head when Data said ""The Octopus was really scary!"" Huh? What Octopus? Well, he's in this DVD. You also realize why the scene was cut out. Let's just say the animatronics weren't all that great.Those old music videos starring Cyndi Lauper and various classic WWF wrestlers are here too. Remember Rock ""n"" Wrestling? I found myself saying ""oh yeah....I remember that!"" Watch for a cameo of Susanna Hoffs from the Bangles in the video!The DVD commentary is a lot of fun! While almost every new DVD has a commentary in place, it almost always bores one to tears with the director or a star just kind of droning their way through the movie. Often, the major stars don't even do the commentary (great example is Rocky - where the commentary features everyone but Stallone himself!) This commentary has all of the original Goonie stars plus Richard Donner. There's a lot of joking around and the stories they tell are funny and don't go off the subject. Note: Sean Astin disappears about halfway through the flick. Also, beware Corey Feldman who talk over everyone to further perpetuate that he is the biggest glory hog in show business.Enough already. This is such a great movie and the special features are ones that you'll actually watch more than once! Buy the DVD already!"	5.0	Pinchers of peril!!!

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1PEKEZTSDJAVH	Eric San Juan	One of the 1980s' most enjoyable romps, this fun adventure throws together a group of kids spending their last days with one another into a quest for hidden treasure, all with escaped criminals on their tail. What follows is a movie filled with spills, chills, chases, action, awesome set pieces and obstacles, and plenty of humor. All very predictable, and all very fun. Think The Little Rascals in the world of Indiana Jones and you have the right idea.Take note before buying this for kids: Some of the humor from the 80s is probably more risqu&eacute; than would be expected. This would probably get a PG-13 were it released today. The kids joke about sexuality and drugs in a way that many might be surprised about. Parents with small children, proceed with caution. That said, the movie remains kid friendly enough that it should be fine for most kids over 10.This DVD looks very good; while not state-of-the-art, it is an improvement over the VHS versions that have kicked around for years. Great sound, good picture. All very nice.The extras really stand out here. We have a Making Of documentary that covers all the bases, with plenty of on set footage and interviews. Informative and well done. An array of deleted scenes was surprisingly good - some of this footage is excellent - though not complete. Finally, the DVD commentary brings the cast back together for a very funny gathering as they swap stories from way back when. Good viewing for longtime fans.The only downer on this DVD is that it comes in one of those awful Warner's snapcases. This reviewer hates those cases; if you have no such hatred, then there is nothing to worry about. A nice buy for the price.	5.0	Some 80s fun in a nice DVD release	2004-06-01	2	2	0

Flight of the Navigator, Milo & Otis, Casper, and now The Goonies are just some of the family films that I remember watching when I was a little kid. I sure had a good time watching them either alone or with the entire family. The Goonies  I particularly remember very well for the underground adventures, and the characters Chunk & Sloth. They make a great duo, don't they? The booby traps and the ""keys"" to the hidden treasure were a bit frightening back then, but now they're pretty imaginative. This, along with the other family films that I've mentioned above never gets tedious. Of course, they don't! We loved them when we were kids, and it's not such a bad thing when you're looking for some childhood nostalgia. Although I slightly prefer Milo & Otis and others, The Goonies is still a great one."	5.0	Pirates of the state of Oregon	2009-05-27	1	1	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3PBUG67LBHA2J	ERIC SMITH	I saw this movie years ago and thought it was ok, but nothing extraordinary.  I was just out of high school and more into the Schwarzenegger and Stallone action movies.  My wife and I just rented it for our 3 young girls because my wife loved it as a kid.Wow!!! the 1980's were a lot different.  The &#34;S&#34; word is said over 20 times.  There were adult themed jokes, shots of the guys looking up the girls skirt and seeing her underwear, etc.  I know a lot of people love this movie, and it appears to have been intended for kids, but there are a lot of swear words and some adult situations.  PG-13 wasn't around back then, but that's probably what it would be rated now.  It's not for the younger kids.	2.0	Adult language	2014-06-14	0	0	0

But the middle plastic part of the case that holds the DVD in place was missing some of it's teeth, so it won't even hold the DVD.

My son (8) wanted to see the goonies he searched on demand, Netflix, crackle, vudu, and Prime. When I realized I could buy it for $5 it made little sense to rent for half that. So we purchased through amazon and got to watch it that night. The DVD comes tomorrow and he'll be able to watch it any time.	4.0	Classic	2013-04-04	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1X4P6CN08U57A	FicktionPhotography	A group of kids in Astoria, Oregon are faced with their last weekend together as a group before a major corporation headed by the typical jerk businessman buys up their properties and kicks them out.  It goes without being said that they have grown up together and have been best friends since the moment they met.  Along for the ride is the older brother of the ringleader, Mike, his romantic interest and her friend.  The main four, Mike, Data, Chunk, and Mouth are adventurous, smart, and full of childish curiosity that brings them to Mikey's attic where they find the tale of One Eyed Willy and his hidden treasure.  The adventure that follows is in pursuit of that treasure, which also gets them entangled with known murderers, the Fratelli's and their gentle, if not different, brother Sloth.The tale is ripe with booby traps, pirate tales, gunshots, hilarity, and adventure that is now considered a timeless classic.  It's about friendship, loyalty, respect, the abolition of greed and judgment, and about the importance of family, life, and love.  You can easily watch this film as a kid and well into adulthood with relish and excitement.  To me, personally, it's an instant spirit-lifter and reminds me of a time when the world was full of adventures around every corner!	5.0	The Classic Tale of Adventure	2013-04-23	0	0	0

I saw this when I was a teenager and remembered it being a great movie with lots of adventure, laughs and greats sets, which it is.  However, in the interim from childhood to when I showed it to my seven- and eight-year-old children, I somehow purged any memories of the movie's extensive profanity.  My wife and I winced as various characters used the ""S"" word throughout the film (okay, it was probably less than ten times, but still).  Seems rather unnecessary to have all the ""S"" bombs in there along with the ""damn"" and ""hell"" variations.  Next time, we'll preview some of the fondly remembered oldies before showing them to the children, unless they come with the safe ""G"" rating.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3LLAEQ6KIXNXS	"Gerald Mahoney ""robotmonsterman"""	Watching THE GOONIES again today, sixteen years after its initial release, I realize it's not the greatest movie ever made.  The dialogue is sometimes goofy, the jokes are corny, the set pieces are occasionally a little simplistic (come on -- the piano scene?  The waterslide?!?!).  But still, I love THE GOONIES.  I love it!  And as easy as it is to see its flaws, it's even easier to see why it's so much fun...- The actors.  The cast is enormously appealing, from the incomparable Martha Plimpton to the sweet Kerri Green to the adorably self-deprecating Jeff B. Cohen.  Even Corey Haim -- oops, I mean Feldman -- does a great job.  Plus, Anne Ramsey, Jon Matuszak and on and on and on.  Not a weak link in the whole cast.- The premise.  GOONIES is perfect escapist fun for kids.  While it's clearly not in the same league as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it tries to be the same kind of stunt-filled adventure movie for a younger audience.  It's great fun for kids, because in this movie, a group of adolescents get to save the day.And mostly...- This package.  Clearly a lot of care and love went into making this DVD.  When the entire cast (plus the director) of any film can be reassembled after sixteen years, you know everyone involved has a great fondness in their hearts for the project.  And that fondness is evident on screen.  This DVD has TONS of extras, including one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard (and, in this case, seen!) and some fun outtakes.If you're at all a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.  And, if the internet rumors are to be believed, there's the possibility of a sequel sometime in the future.  What better way to convince Warner Brothers to greenlight GOONIES 2 than to scoop up a copy of this DVD ASAP?  The better this sells, the better our chance of getting more GOONIES.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A33CSAZV1PMVTX	"Gift Card ""New Godzilla"""	There are very few films that really stick with you from childhood on until today.  See when I was a kid and I first saw Goonies it was like a little adventure you were preparing for.  You had your blanket it was dark you had your friends over watching the film made you yourself go on an adventure.  Why anyone would give this film anything below a 4 star rating is beyond me.I dont have to tell you the story line of this film because chances are you saw it already if not then you must be somewhere under 27 or 28 because this film was really for the late 20 early 30's individual before surround sound, and HD was even considered as a movie format.

When I told my dad once, oh, about 1987, that my goal in life was to have a real &quot;Goonie&quot; adventure, his reply was &quot;You watch too much TV.&quot; That may have been true, but I think, partly because of this film, I've retained that child-like sense of adventure well into my...Oh okay, my mid 20's! But I still remember childhood fondly whenever I watch this movie. From about the age of 7 until around 13, I was always on the lookout, on some rainy day, for a lost magical amulet or eerie looking cave. And in many ways, I still am.  I hate to get political with this, but I think that many Americans have this kind of feeling snuffed out of them once they get past 25 or so. Sure, daily American life can be draining, but this film is one of the things that inspired me to love adventure and learn to live life to the fullest.

Watching it as a dad, now, with my 11 and 9 year olds - it held up wonderfully, but I forgot how much cursing the kids did, and the adult double entendres had completely gone over my head when I was younger! My kids giggled at the kids cursing, knowing that is verboten by kids, and were scared at the right times, relieved and happy for them at the end.Joe Donner did a nice job with this movie.	4.0	Good flick, held up over time	2013-09-08	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3RKFHBRBAG79P	"Graham Swearingen ""Graham1138"""	I pre-ordered this off of Amazon. Why it doesn't show that I purchased it is beyond me. Anyhow, the packaging is great. I wish more movies got this kind of treatment for their Blu-Ray release, Ghostbusters, Big Trouble In Little China and Die Hard really should have gotten this kind of treatment. The box for the 25th anniversary of The Goonies is great, the inside cover has the map to the treasure of One Eyed Willie, there is a board game it comes with, a press release kit recreation that was shrunk down and some other goodies. The overall presentation of this is stellar. They really couldn't have done a better job. I have heard some complaints about the transfer but I think it looks borderline immaculate. There is no DNR, not too many soft edges, no muddy images, it looks sharp and crisp and retains a lot of the original film grain. There's a decent amount of special features and I am really glad I got this, it's well worth the price. If you grew up with this movie and are a fan, you need this. Thankfully they still haven't made a sequel to this like they have talked about. Sequels suck folks, If you don't believe me, look at what those Hollywood Dougs did with Ghostbusters, because Ghostbusters 2 is one of the worst sequels ever. It completely undermines the first film (which is a modern masterpiece of cinema) and isn't a good movie in any way, shape or form. I just hope they don't try and squeeze more money out of the Goonies by making some crappy, forced sequel. This movie is one of the best ever made, they won't ever make a better kids movie that plays up the magic that all kids movies should have without going too overboard. You need to own this on Blu-Ray.	5.0	One of my favorite movies, one of the best movies ever	2012-10-10	1	1	0

I used to come home everyday from school and watch it with my next door neighbor!  People who have given it a &quot;bad&quot; rating have looked at it from &quot;serious&quot; perspective, not how the movie was meant to be looked at!  It is a classic children's (but also for adults!) movie containing action, adventure, comedy, and good'ol fashion fun.  The characters are based upon a gang of kids who at any point could have been you when you were younger.  There is the classic problem: trying to save the house, the classic solution: One Eyed Willie's Map and the classic bad guys trying to foil their plan: the Fratelli's.  Overall, this is one movie that anyone who saw as a kid can't help but love it now; even if you did not see it as a kid it is one that you must rent, buy or borrow from a friend because of its long lasting &quot;movie durability!&quot;  Can't wait for the DVD version!	5.0	One of the best movies made for my generation!	2001-04-25	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A13TO5TU4A68LD	Gryphonisle	I've seen several films shot in Astoria, Oregon, since this one, and yet whenever I go there, I never find the picturesque qualities seen in the films!I had not seen &#34;The Goonies&#34; since it came out, and had confused it---due to the title, with some other film. (&#34;Gremlins&#34;, maybe?).  I'd think of it from time to time, and thus it stayed fresh in my mind; so imagine my &#34;shock&#34; to realize how old it was.  I mean, Dated.  Like a Shirley Temple film.  &#34;You Are Here&#34; says the galaxy map of time and space, and it's 1985.  That isn't necessarily a good thing, unless you like the 'eighties, and a lot of people do---as States Evidence I point to the fact that this film has its own website fan group.For the Record, this Astoria, in Oregon, is on the West Coast.  The movie starts off rather shakily with manic over-acting on the part of the kids, with half of them playing adult, Jersey Shore roles.  The girls in particular, when they show up, are right out of Big Hair East Coast 'Eighties (watch &#34;Moonstruck&#34;) something I never saw when I was passing through this area, regularly, in the day.  But Hollywood has deep Astoria, NY connections so I understand.In any case, within 30 minutes or so, the cast settles down and the story takes off.  From this point on, it's a pretty entertaining film.  Of course, times have changed and today the film seems like the basis for a Disneyland theme ride that never was, probably thanks to the &#34;Raiders...&#34; movies that produced one that is.  But the sets, especially inside the cliff, are quite imaginative and visually appealing.  The bad guys are bad enough, but still funny.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say it has a happy ending----only a clod couldn't figure that out.  But it was the very-very ending that I didn't like when I saw it, and saying what that was would be a spoiler, and probably why I never saw it again---the very last part could have been done better.Given that this is a Family Film, we have to note the abundant foul language.  By this point, Spielberg had come to be seen as the Modern Disney, producing saccharine sweet stories heavily tinted with nostalgia, and to protect himself from associations with the post-Walt, Disney crap that Eisner was just beginning to wrench that studio out of, Spielberg decided to use foul language and sexual references by kids to give a realistic edge.  A stupid and utterly unnecessary decision, especially given the lens of time.What's amusing is the Product Placement, which was just taking off---along with Corporate Naming, having been ushered in by the 1984 Olympics, Los Angeles--which made them profitable for the first time in decades, but left us with a legacy of baseball parks and theaters named for Corporations.  Here it's fairly tame, a couple of Pepsi cans and a Pizza Hut box too obviously &#34;placed&#34; in the frame.Some folks can't leave their youth behind---you see them at state fairs dancing to 1970s Disco hits with their kids, mindless of the often blatant sexual references;  those folks book DIsney cruises to Disney Parks and Disney Islands, and join &#34;The Goonies&#34; and &#34;The Christmas Story&#34; fan clubs.  Good for them.  It is not a disease, it certainly isn't contageous.  You can watch this film without catching it.  And, if the kids you know keep insisting you watch one of their miserable cartoons or films that you've seen over and over again, this might be old enough that they aren't aware of it, which would allow you to watch something with them that they will probably enjoy, without having to fear cramps and muscle aches from ninety minutes in permanent cringe mode.Go for it!	3.0	Sweet, Vintage 'Eighties Spielberg-Produced Film.

I love this film and take any opportunity  to watch it. My friend's are now used to my frequent quoting of this film,  my most regular phrase being: 'come on, come on- where are u? You are in  the clouds, and we are in a basement' But I can also quote many others!  This film is funny from the opening scenes, right to the end. I found sloth  (heeeyyyy u guys) funny, but i do have friends who found him terrifying and  refuse to watch the film!  Howeveer I'd recommend this film to everyone. I  really want to see these missing scenes and so I'll have a look for them on  the net. You think it's bad missing those scenes- you should try watching  the edited version that is shown on Brittish TV!  No Spanish translation,  no dead guy..........it's *so* bad!

Glad to have this set in my collection.I think the only one little gripe I would have to say is that I was sort of expecting a better copy of the Blu-Ray in this sset...maybe some kind of limited edition casing and/or inserts or something.  However, that's a small deal and this set is still pretty awesome!  My wife and I play a lot of board games, and we'll probably enjoy playing the board game together.  I waited to get this for a while because, let's be real, $50 in my opinion is a bit much to spend on a single movie, even a cool set like this.  However, waiting paid off because I wound up scoring it brand new down the road for only $30.  Not bad.If you're a big Goonies fan like I am, this is a really cool collector's set to own, and I would say it's worth it to add this beauty to your collection.  They have both DVD and Blu-Ray sets, whichever capabilities you happen to have.  This set is awesome!	5.0	Great Collector's Set!	2012-08-22	0	0	0

The Goonies is about a group of young friends who is on a search to find a hidden pirate treasure, and trying to outwit a family of career crimnals. The special features includes a video commentary by director Richard Donner and the cast of The Goonies as well as the now-classic 1985 Cyndi Lauper music video. Watching The Goonies has brought back a lot of fun memories for me. the movie is perfect for rainy day weekends or for the kids to watch. :)	5.0	My Review Of The Goonies	2010-06-03	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1ON3YTCRAKY9S	hershy	"This movie has to be one of the all time great kids movies.  Highly recommended and worth buying, especially if you have kids under the age of 12.  This movie was the original Pirates of the Carribean (with Johnny Depp).  If you, or your kids liked that then you will like this, guaranteed.  Usually child actors screw up movies in my opinion but in this they actually make the movie.  Corey Feldman plays ""Mouth"" masterfully and Sean Astin is great as Mikey.  And...of course Chunk.  Probably that kid's best role of his life if he ever did anything after the Goonies.NOTE:  to all the Goonie faithful...supposedly there is a Goonies 2 in development.  Let's hope it can live up to the original."	5.0	My favorite movie as a kid and still a classic	2005-06-09	5	5	0

I always wondered what it would be like to have  these sort of adventures, and this film encapsulated this for me as a  child. I don't know if it still has appeal for kids (I'm waiting til my  nephew is old enough before I buy it for me...er, him) but I'm willing to  bet that it still has appeal for a lot of young adults who remember it  first time around.

Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys.""Shut up!I honestly cannot fathom the universal adoration that the masses have for The Goonies. It's one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen in my life. Only the Von Trap children and the brats Spielberg cast as the Lost Boys in Hook have irritated me more than The Goonies (with the exception of Chunk). Before I get into the movie I'll give you a run down of the cast.Sean Astin as Mikey: seems as if he is phonetically reading off cue cards (a-la Peanuts) rather than fully understanding what he is saying.Josh Brolin as Brand: a constant damper on the adventure as he does nothing but attempt to diffuse the fun with his constant 'grown-up' perspective.Short Round as Data: so lovable in Temple of Doom, in the space of one year he managed to become the most annoying characters in movie history. Very little he says can be understood. His inventions are cartoonish, out of place, contribute nothing, and spoil many scenes. Whenever he opens his mouth I just want to grit my teeth down to the gums.Corey Feldman as Mouth: would be tolerable if he stopped screaming so much. This applies to the whole cast, but especially Mouth. Is better when he's serious instead of sarcastic, which isn't often unfortunately.Kerri Green as Andy: again, she would be bearable is she just shut up. Her random petrified rant about looking after her body is completely un-called-for and spoils the scene.Martha Plimpton as Stef: likable, but doesn't have much to do or serve any purpose.Jeff Cohen as Chunk: adorable, and the best (and youngest) actor of the bunch by far. Cohen's talent is infectious and it's a shame that the rest of the child cast undo his effort. In the scene where he confesses his previous misbehavior you can see that Robert Davi is loving it and cannot hold in his laughter.John Matuszak as Sloth: also adorable, but his ""Hey, you guys"" moment spoils everything.The Goonies was the second of three films in a row that Chris Columbus wrote for Amblin. If it had the shades of darkness and horror of Gremlins before it, or Young Sherlock Holmes after it, then it may well have been a true classic. Richard Donner (a loud, monstrous director who I really like) even used darkness to great effect in Scrooged a few years later, but here he seems to be really distracted by the fact that he's laughing at the antics off-camera and unable to see that, as a finished film, it's not as funny as he thinks it is. I mean what teenage kid, in the 80s, played with marbles or pretended to be James Bond? He directs these kids as if they were 7 or 8 instead of 13-ish. A film depicting more realistic teenagers would have won me over right away.The titular gang themselves live in Astoria, Oregon and are failing to enjoy their last weekend together before the rich folks tear down their houses to build a golf course. That is until Mikey suddenly remembers the treasure map up in the loft. So off they go to find the treasure of pirate captain One-Eyed Willie against the wishes of downer big brother Brand. They soon discover that the entrance to the subterranean world where Willie lies waiting begins underneath an abandoned restaurant used as a hideout by the Fratelli crime family. They only just barely manage to sneak into tunnels without being noticed, leaving Chunk behind to have his own sideshow adventure. Once inside the tunnels they encounter a gauntlet of traps set by Willie to prevent anyone getting his loot.Sound good right? And it would be if handled by a different director, or was scored by someone other than Dave Gruisin, who turns in a fully generic effort with no standout themes or melodies. Silvestri and Goldsmith were very busy in 1985, but nobody Gruisin, who I have never heard of before or since, was the wrong choice. I fully believe that Columbus' script was worthy, as I have read the novelization and it's far superior to the film, but for above listed reasons it doesn't work for me as a film.A lot of The Goonies has been rudely forced into pop-culture too. How exactly is 'The Truffle Shuffle' funny? Why do people fondly remember this? It's...nothing. Why do people always quote Sloth's ""Hey, you guys!"" as if it's hilarious. It isn't. It is absolutely not funny at all. By the end Donner allows the action to become campy and farcical, disrespecting the story and pathos. There are moments towards the climax where I honestly feel like switching the movie off.Stick with the novelization, and be thankful a sequel was never made.The Blu Ray features an above-average 2.40:1 1080p picture with Dolby TrueHD sound.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AQNYGIYW2W6O	jarredbyitall	The Goonies still rock!  My jaw dropped when I saw the pirate ship set again.  They really do not make films like this anymore. CGI should stand for (Cashcows Gone Insane), because what was done on this film with just a modest budget far surpasses most $100million epics from the past decade...  Kids deserve entertainment that widens the avenue of the imagination, not weakens it. Parents take note: If this film was made today it would have received a PG-13 rating.  You tell me if that's a good thing. I for one don't.  This is how kids really act and really sound.  If you deny that, you deny reality. Fantasy should highlight reality, not glaze over it.	5.0	Still Goony After All These Years	2001-08-30	0	0	0

They discover a family that escapes from jail and gets away because the family drove into a local race. The authorities  lost them a they stay in the house that was a restaurant that was abandoned.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AGJO3OIJJZATC	Jason Lilly	Whoever dislikes this movie needs to recheck their childhood a little. This movie became quite a phenomenon for me and a lot of my friends in the 1980s. It was so influential, in fact, that I went cave-hunting for months in the woods near my house, until my grandfather finally took me to some caves in Kentucky and I spent the whole time pretending we were treasure hunters.Likewise, my friends and I used to hide stuff, draw up fake treasure maps wander around the back yard looking for the treasures. I think one of my braver friends even tried to set a few boobie traps.My point: This is what good films do. They stay with us long after we watch them. Only those who have followed me longer after earn five stars. This is one of the best.	5.0	A Childhood and Adulthood Favorite	2008-08-18	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A38ZM2B2SSXSAF	Jennifer	"The Goonies is one of those special films that no matter how old you get, it never loses its magic and wonder. I remember seeing The Goonies back in 1987, when I was a young kid, and gosh, it was probably the most entertaining and fun movie I've ever seen in my few years of living.Now that I've grown up, I'd thought I'd watch the film again to see if that magic and excitment of a great and humorous adventure movie would still be there. Surely it was, to an even greater extent than when I was a kid. Though Sean Austin and Josh Brolin have all grown up now, I still think their best movie is ""The Goonies."" And the Cindy Laupier song is more catchier than ever. Even the long video is awesome!"	5.0	I may age with time, but not this movie	2009-04-16	1	1	0

This will be a movie that lives on for many many generations. My long term boyfriend had never seen this moving growing up so I had to buy it cause I hadn't seen it myself in years. We watched it online while waiting for it to come in the mail (cause of course I need to own it but couldn't wait for it to come). I remembered just how much I loved it. He really enjoyed it too.

I perceive myself to be a popular guy in most crowds, I have meet people my age that are awkward as hell, so the first question I ask is have you seen the goonies, 99.9% of the time those people say no. If your awkward as hell, and haven't seen the movie it's to late, but if you have children and they're at least 4 years old, get them to watch it they will love it and they will be awesome people.	5.0	You kiddin me, duh!	2014-01-14	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2EBLL2OYEQJN9	Jessica Lux	The Goonies is every bit as powerful as it was upon its original release twenty years ago.  Is there really a need to recount the plot?  (A group of misfit kids embark on a treasure hunt for a lost pirate ship, battling some really bad guys along the way.)If only modern movies had plots as well-crafted as this movie!  I would label this as a family movie with the caveat that the children are a little older than 8 or so.  There is some foul language, but nothing that hasn't been overheard by little ears before.  The action (and the deformed chained-up beast Sloth) can be a bit terrifying to younger children, so this should be watched by the entire family, parents included.The Goonies is a movie about friendship, family, and the triumph of hard work when you really apply yourself to a goal.  It's the realization of every kid's fantasy.  Everyone will find one of the Goonies to identify with.  This is a must-own DVD.	5.0	Timeless adventure tale for kids of all ages	2005-12-28	2	1	1

This is a Spielberg movie for those of you that don't know so there is quality in it. It's a fun little ride, beware there are some elements in the movie that are probably not suited for kids ages 11 and under. But that all depends on your child and how you choose to parent. The elements I speak of are language from a few of the kids, a kissing scene, and one of the characters is disfigured which I guess to some can be scary.	5.0	Good movie!	2013-10-16	0	0	0

If you havent seen or heard about the Goonies, you must have been living in a cave. This is a great childrens' adventure story about a group of kids known as the Goonies who want to save their homes and go on a treasure hunt to get the money needed. Along the way they meet up with criminals and a series of booby traps. This dvd is great because the commentary is terrific. The commentary was made very recently because Sean Astin was doing one of the Lord of the Rings movies. Its great to see what they look like now and all the little quirks that went into making the movie. Plus it features Cyndi Lauper's video &quot; Goonies are good enough&quot;.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A7N23UHI2N8CY	jjjjjjj	Great movie by Spielberg. He should be proud of his great career in directing and producing. How he's the main man at it!! Best I've seen and he shows it with this which is one of his best along with Jaws, ET, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indian Jones, Jurassic Park, and much much more of his best. I don't know. His movies of today are kind of becoming a little bit of a blunder, like War of the Worlds, and The Terminal. But they were great at some scenes, but still they're not his best. Steven might be going a little downhill with his movies, because probably he's running low on ideas and most of them have already been done. But, PLEASE!!! Everyone Do not attempt to remake any of his classics. They are meant to be done once and be the best forever. Like if Jaws is done again it will be a load of garbage. I know it!!!Anyway this movie is great!! I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to relive the retro 80's and for anyone especially who grew up on this movie and hasn't seen it for such a long time. Watch it!! It will bring you back to the 80's. FLASHBACK!!!	5.0	Michael Jackson did not come over to my house to use my bathroom, but his sister did!!	2007-04-21	0	0	0

A Classic Richard Donner film. I love every minute of it. I got tired of Amazon and Netflix yanking this movie off their respective Instant Streaming Services, So I went ahead and Bought the Blu-ray. The visual quality is awesome for a movie almost 30 years old. I think it's the cleanest version ever, Some scenes I now see stuff that I couldn't ever see on the old VHS. I grew up watching this movie, and God willing, I will let my Kids do the same. I basically, also got this because the Digital versions always has a problem skipping frames. I can't stand missing frames. This version is as smooth as can possibly be. They would have to time warp back to the 80's and shoot the film with a Modern 3-D camera to make it look any better.	5.0	Classic Movie, Will Never get old.	2013-06-09	0	0	0

Their beloved neighborhood is going to be a major golf course, so they go on an adventure into finding the lost buried treasure so they can all help out in protecting their beloved neighborhood. Unfortunately three ghastly criminals Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) with her sons Jake (Robert Davi) and Francis (Joe Pantoliano) are also after the treasure.One of the 80's most beloved adventure movies! Director Richard Donner whom made such classics like ""Superman 1 & 2"", ""The Omen"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" and executive producer Steven Spielburg has created a hilarious and entertaining flick for everyone to enjoy. The film co-stars the beautiful Kerri Green as hottie Andi, John Matsuzak as Sloth the lovable  deformed man and Josh Brolin as Brand, Mike's big tough brother and the acting especially by the kids are very well done. It's one of the best movies of it's time and still appeals to kids, teens and adults alike in this must see movie.This DVD contains great picture and sound with good extras like video/audio commentary by the cast and crew, trailer, Featurette, Outtakes, and ""Goonies R Good Enough"" music video by Cyndi Lapher."	5.0	An 80's masterpiece!	2008-02-26	9	7	2

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	Like many before me, I grew up with The Goonies. I ran around my house as a young one, trying to act like Mouth, or doing the Truffle Shuffle to entertain friends (I lacked on the truffle, but I could do the shuffle).The Goonies holds something that every kid should find magical, even though the only magic in the movie is the magic of friendship. Steven Spielberg wrote the story about a group of friends who are about to lose their houses so a country club can be built where they leave. They come upon a treasure map that supposedly has a legend behind it, and leads to a great treasure. Mikey and his colorful bunch of friends set up to go in search of the treasure not knowing the villianist trio, the Fratellis, are also out for the treasure. Along the way, chaos ensues, friendships go stronger, and they meet a creature who has nothing but love to share and Baby Ruths to eat.The characters are all likable . . . are all lovable, and the actors who portray them made them all that they were. The Fratellis are even, in some ways, likable throughout the movie, but in the end, they get what they were asking for. The directing, of course, is awesome. None like it actually. And the sets are amazing. Especially the pirate ship set. That was too awesome, and enough to satisfy any adventure lover.The DVD should satisfy any Goonies fan with the word of all the extras to be on it. And I'm ready to see the infamous deleted octopus scene. I hope it's on there. I believe I read somewhere that some of the cast had gotten together to do a commentary. Now there's wishful hoping that that did happen!&quot;SLOTH LOVE CHUNK!&quot; And Josh loves this movie.	5.0	Nothing Will Never Surpass The Goonies!	2001-06-28	194	156	38

The adventures in the movie took place 25 years ago, but are just as relevant to anyone today.  The anniversary addition has the bonus features of map, etc. to make it more interactive.  I understand there is going to be a reunion movie coming out soon for the 25th anniversay, so my grandson will be familiar with the story when he goes to see the new movie.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1QWPXR6HJ003X	"J. Saners ""linguist"""	"If you (like me) grew up in the 80's, you've probably already seen Goonies (many times!), and don't need to read a review about it. 5 stars for children of the 80's. For us this was a real coming-of-age story, about kids learning independence (and the value of friends and parents, too--what a great reunion scene at the end!), maturity, responsibility, acceptance of others, and doing ""the right thing"". Oh, and of course a great adventure too!If you grew up in the 90's or are still in the process now, the movie of course still has all those things, but it's a little dated and not quite as ""glamorous"" and flashy as many movies made today. (But as another reviewer noted, I do believe it holds up pretty well, better than many 80's movies.) Still, it is partly with this in mind that I give it only 4 stars.The other reason for ""4"" instead of ""5"" is the inappropriacy of the PG rating. Even as a pre-teen at the time I thought the scene with the nude statue on which a certain piece breaks off and the boys glue it on upside down was too much--I remember being pretty embarrassed sitting next to adult friends in the theater! For those moms and others who've just recently discovered Goonies and this odd rating, you might like to know that, at least if I recall correctly from back then, Goonies is the very movie which led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. It was clearly not an R movie, but was a bit too much for PG, and many unsuspecting moms were pretty upset when they took their 6-year-olds to this movie! So, for those undecided about the movie because of this issue, keep in mind that although the rating is officially PG, the content is absolutely PG-13, and would be rated as such if made today."	4.0	An 80's classic and cultural impact too!	2005-09-27	6	5	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	APTHEACJV9FVO	"J. Snodgrass ""JeffGraphx"""	I watched this DVD and laughed hysterically.  Not only does the movie look great (especially in 2.35:1 aspect ratio widescreen format), but it sounds great.  Definately the best part of this edition aside from the actual movie is the Richard Donner and cast commentary.  All, and I mean all of the original Goonies are together for a full commentary that runs through the entire film. It is so funny because they talk about how much fun it was to make the movie and how hard it was too. One of the things I loved about it was that they made fun of some of the same things my friends and I used to make fun of.  It's a very nostalgic trip because if you loved this movie as a kid you will fall for it again.  Martha Plimpton's comments are priceless, she is so funny.  I could have done without some of Corey Feldman's lame &quot;I did this... and I did that in the movie..&quot; comments.  He makes joke after joke, but no one really seems to be paying a lot of attention to him.  Jeff Cohen (Chunk) is slimmed down and is now a lawyer.  He supplies a lot of funny moments in the commentary as well.  In conclusion, the gang's all here and any fan of this movie must have this great DVD.  Not too shabby including the cheesy as hell Cyndi Lauper video either.  Good job Donner and Co.	4.0	Goonies DVD is &quot;Good Enough&quot;	2001-08-23	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AWAXS66YMHMNW	"J. Thomason ""Movie Family"""	"The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score: 300 of 300!!  Wahoo - a perfect score :]  Good stuff for sure - at the time of this review only a small handful of movies can boast they got a perfect Bowling for Movies Score - The Big Lebowski, Popeye, and A Clockwork Orange.  A prestigious honor (if I do say so myself) and an incredibly small list considering the hundreds of movies I've seen.But wait - what is this whole Bowling For Movies score anyway (you may very well be asking yourself)?  Well, let me tell you ladies and jellyspoons, I watch movies - LOTS and LOTS of movies.  In a typical week I can watch a dozen or more movies.  I own hundreds of movies - some are 3D, some Blu Rays, many DVDs, heck - I even own a few streaming on Amazon.  It occurred to me that my great love of movies (and collecting) has resulted in a unique problem - I had no way of knowing which were my favorites and then a brain-flower was born which blossomed into Bowling for Movies - just an average dude's way of ranking movies using a scoring system which literally has NOTHING to do with bowling!  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea.  I know what you're likely thinking - what a great use of quasi/pseudo-science!  And I'd agree :]Ok, Movie Dude - if its so great what's it about??Set in and about the Oregonian coastal town of Astoria, a group of pre-teen rejects (The Goonies) set out on the adventure of a lifetime to find the fabled treasure of the dread pirate One-Eyed Willie in order to save their homes which are slated for repossession and destruction to make way for a golf course.  Lead by the iron-willed asthmatic Mickey Walsh (a young Sean Astin) and armed with a treasure map the band of misfit friends brave subterranean labyrinths, dangerous booby traps, and hardcore, despicable criminals in their bid for all that shiny swag.Wonderfully shot, creatively crafted - The Goonies is a true gem of an 80's movie.  To top the entire movie experience off the flick features a top notch soundtrack with some of the decade's most memorable artists such as Cyndi Lauper, REO Speedwagon,  and The Bangles.  This movie was more than Goon-enough for me when I was 14 and now that I'm 42 it's even better as I share the Goonies experience with my little Goonies (Little Miss Movie Dude).What went right:&lt; > Um, like everything - great story, great cinematography, great jokes, great adventure... what can I tell you - it's just a wonderful time.What went wrong:&lt; > Um, like nothing - great movie for kids, teens, or simply the young at heart.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it."	5.0	The Goonies Bowling for Movies Score!	2013-10-04	1	1	0

They have to find the treasure thus saving their town, all the while solving an age old local myth about a pirate captain named ""One-Eyed"" Willie and the disappearance of a man named Chester Copperpot and out running a family of criminals called the Fratellis. Aside from all the cussing and swearing, and one of the worst blue screen shots in motion picture history, This is a good side splitter for the whole family. It also has a cool theme song called ""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough"" performed by Cyndi Lauper who was one of the most impressive and daring female singers of her time. And remember ""Goonies Never Say Die!""."	5.0	Hey You GUYS!!!	2005-11-04	2	2	0

The Goonies are a band of kids not unlike the summer clubs we used to form in my neighborhood. Their summertime adventure begins with one of the members' home being threatened, and it doesn't end until they find the treasure that permits the kid's father to do what is necessary to save his house.  It's the in between part, the real story, you'll want to watch over and over again.  ""Real life"" beasties, fantastic adventure: This movie goes a long way to satisfy the explorer in each of us.

Now that over 20 years have gone by and my boys are grown, I occasionally watch it on DVD and in retrospect, I am a little surprised at some of the lines. I know this film is a cult movie and it probably deserves it, but really didn't see the need for some of the language, like ""Oh Sh-t"" from Chunk, and so on.My kids really enjoyed this film and wound up being ""influenced"" by the flick in a few ways.  My wife and I bought a pirates map on fake parchment for them which we had framed and placed in their room which we called a Goonies Map.  For a period, my younger boy was interested in pirates, pirate ships and coins, and the family even wound up staying at Pirates Cove (a hotel which featured a full size pirates ship) on a trip indirectly because of this darn film.That being said, when I screen this old movie with subtitles on I am surprised at some of the things the Goonies say in the course of the entertaining racket. Just an observation, that's all. All in all, a great film and I would still vote it five full stars."	5.0	The Goonies (1985)-Loved it in 1985 and so did my kids!	2009-07-29	0	0	0

The archetypal adventure storyline that included the map and &#34;keys&#34; to unlock the location of the &#34;treasure&#34; was engaging. The &#34;adventurers&#34; were on a &#34;quest&#34; of a lifetime to save their way of life. The frailest character turned out to be the strongest. The perspective of &#34;time&#34; and whose &#34;time&#34; it was continues to ring true. The interwoven humor along with the tension of &#34;the chase&#34; of the &#34;bad guys&#34; kept me cheering for the &#34;good guys&#34; throughout the film. Good triumphed over evil, the boy won the girl's heart, and the outcasts accepted another outcast and taught us to look beyond physical appearances to the &#34;heart&#34; of a person. The cinematography was inspiring. Well done!	5.0	Goonies Forever!	2012-12-28	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Combining swashbuckling, mystery, murder, pre-teen wonder and teen angst, ""The Goonies,"" is a wonderful film about two brothers and their friends who are about to lose their homes but wind up on an amazing journey that just might save them all.  When the Walsh brothers and their friends find a map in the family attic, the ""Goonies"" set out on one last adventure before having to say goodbye to each other.What they find is a trail leading to the treasure of the infamous One-Eyed Willie, a pirate who literally protected his gold to his death.  The gang has to get past a number of booby traps, including a piano of death, in order to get Willie's treasure.  They also have to deal with a rich high school bully and the murderous Fratelli family.This film is fun from the beginning.  Steven Spielberg story and Chris Columbus' screenplay fit well on the screen.  Director Richard Donner blends humor, adventure, and a touch of romance into the tale that prevents the story from ever getting boring.  Cyndi Lauper's ""The Goonies R' Good Enough"" sets the musical tone for the film.The cast features a number of (at the time) up-and-coming actors.  Sean Astin plays the younger Walsh son, Mikey.  Josh Brolin plays Brandon Walsh.  Indie princess Martha Plimpton plays Stef Steinbrenner.  Future fight choreographer (and also ""Short Round"" in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") Ke Huy Quan plays Data.  Jeff Cohen portrays Chunk.  Kerri Green plays Andy Carmichael and future ""Two Coreys"" star Corey Feldman rounds out the Goonies as Mouth.The Fratelli clan is filled with the wonderful Anne Ramsey as Ma Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis, Robert Davi as Jake and John Matuszak as the legendary Sloth.Be warned that their is quite a bit of strong language in this film.  It pre-dates the PG-13 era, and probably would have received that rating if it had been around.  The rest of the tale is family friendly, with only mild peril and one murder.For a solid afternoon or evening of family fun, I highly recommend ""The Goonies.""  It's one of Spielberg's best projects."	4.0	They Really Are Good Enough	2008-11-30	3	1	2

I had seen this movie back in the 80's and thought it was really funny, but guess that was before I watched it with kids! The children in the movie are the ones that use the inappropriate words, not really want I wanted my kids hearing. This will not be a movie that I keep on the shelf for them to have access to.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A11HDNT6I77T8Q	Kiersten Stone	Suspenseful music builds, as light from the flashlights of dangerous and angry pursuers grows brighter from the underground tunnel. The last Goonie is yet to cross the monstrous log connecting the tunnel containing the pursuers to the tunnel that will provide an escape. With the intimidating body of murky water underneath the log, the followers growing closer, and the yells from the other five Goonies to &#8220;hurry up&#8221; getting louder, the pressured Goonie thinks on his feet (literally). Staying true to his role as the inventive one of the bunch, Data uses his slick shoes to cover the log&#8217;s service he has already made past with a slippery tar-like substance. Action music now takes the place of the suspenseful music as Data makes it to the safe tunnel with the others in time for the three fugitives behind the flashlights to appear and fall right into the trap, allowing the Goonies to make their escape! This scene is one of many exciting scenes that makes The Goonies fun to watch.The 1985 American adventure-comedy, directed by Richard Donner, is almost thirty years old and still manages to be a crowd favorite. The majority of today&#8217;s popular films such as &#8220;The Hangover,&#8221; &#8220;Olympus Has Fallen,&#8221; &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook,&#8221; &#8220;Twilight,&#8221; and many others, are centered on drugs, alcohol, world issues, mental problems, or science fiction. Today&#8217;s movies take millions of dollars to produce mind-blowing five-star scenery, sound effects, and cast. They are very focused on detail and accuracy, which may sometimes become overwhelming. The Goonies, on the other hand, is very refreshing from these overwhelming movies. Although it only took half of what today&#8217;s movies take to create, The Goonies&#8217; enjoyable story line makes it five-star worthy. It is very simple and easy to follow.The Goonies are a group of friends living in a neighborhood known as the &#34;Goon Docks.&#34; Unfortunately, their houses are being foreclosed due to an expanding country club. It is their last weekend together and while searching through the attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and a map with a pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Seeing this as the only opportunity to save their houses and childhoods, the Goonies head out to take one last adventure in hopes of finding the famous pirate One-Eyed Willie&#8217;s treasure. After a rocky start, the Goonies are on their way. With nasty villains in their pursuit, they travel through the complex underground pathways maneuvering through One-Eyed Willie&#8217;s booby-traps and desperately trying to beat the clock of foreclosure.This movie is enjoyable for all age groups. Although it is clearly a fantasy story, adults are able to relive some childhood memories. It takes them to the days they were young kids going on adventures with friends. It&#8217;s pirate treasure theme appeals to kids and teenagers, capturing their interest for the duration of the movie. The movie is rated PG, however, due to some foul language used, it is not recommended for children under the age of eleven.One key attribute to the movie&#8217;s popularity is the characters. Each character is likeable in a unique way. The motley crew consists of adventurous Mikey, wise guy Mouth, food lover Chunk, and gadget inventor Data. Viewers are able to identify with these kids and feel as though they are on the journey with them. They want to protect them, they laugh at their jokes, and cheer when they have a brilliant plan. The characters pull each viewer into the treasure hunt with them.The sets for each scene are incredibly ornate. They vary from a creepy abandoned restaurant, to musty stone tunnels, to immense waterfalls, to bone pianos and collapsing floors. The fascinating part of it all is that these sights are all within an every day town in Oregon. Therefore, the viewer gets an aspect of the everyday world as well as the fantasy world.This adventure movie continues to prevail almost thirty years after it was created because it still connects to people today. Situations that occur in the movie, such as foreclosure, are common. In today&#8217;s poor economy many people lose their homes. Therefore many people can emotionally connect to the characters and feel a sense of hope throughout the journey.Along with personal situations, the film also connects with personal relationships. The bond within the close-knit group of young boys is what would today be known as a &#8220;bromance.&#8221; The boys have such a diverse group of friends, it makes it comical to watch them interact.  They joke around almost the same way boys joke around in today&#8217;s generation. The love-hate relationship between Mikey and Brand is also seen amongst siblings today. They joke around with each other, and beat up on each other, but will always look out and care for each other.Although the dialog for the movie was created in the eighties, humor is humor.  One of the most comical dances still commonly joked about is Chunk&#8217;s truffle shuffle. People also still make harmless jokes with their friends just as the boys messed with Data for his extravagant gadgets or Brand for his obsession with bodybuilding. These simple jokes and dances are appreciated by viewers and are quoted and reenacted whenever the movie is brought up. Some humor never gets old. In order to understand the Goonie jokes, one must watch the movie.The Goonies is a time machine that takes adults back to their childhood. It not only allows them to go back and relive some joys and thrills of senseless adventure, it allows them to bring their own children of this generation with them for the ride as well. The film teaches important lessons on relationships, hard times, and humor. It also provides a bond between two very different generations. Big differences are seen in the 80&#8217;s generation and today&#8217;s generation. The Goonies allows the two to sit down and genuinely enjoy a movie that will forever be a classic.	5.0	The movie you will love for life!	2013-10-23	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR	"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl"""	The Goonies.. What can I say? The Goonies was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid. It had everything - adventure, danger, treasure, cool gizmos, and bumbling bad guys. This, in my books, is the best kids adventure movie ever made. What's more, it is still great to watch as an adult - there are numerous gags that would just go straight over the heads of kids that now make so much more sense.The Goondocks, in Astoria, are being demolished to make way for a golf course and resort. A local bunch of kids, who have affectionately named themselves The Goonies, are not taking the news too kindly as this is their favourite place in the whole wide world. On a rainy day before the Goondocks were due to be demolished Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin), Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin), Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Johnathon Ke Quan) are bumming around the Walsh house feeling very depressed. On a whim they decide to go rummaging through the attic, out-of-bounds to all mind you, and 'stumble' across an ancient treasure map and doubloon depicting the whereabouts of One-Eyed Willie and his treasure.Needless to say The Goonies see this as a great adventure, not to mention a chance to pay off foreclosing banks! Along the way they get mixed up with the Fratellis, some of the most bumbling 'evil' criminals ever to grace the silver screen. Ma Fratelli (Anne Ramsey) is the matriach with a firm controlling hand on Jake (Robert Davi), and Francis (Joe Pantoliano). Boy, is Ma one scary lady! The Goonies also come across Andy (Kerri Green) and Stef (Martha Plimpton). These two join the swelling ranks of The Goonies and help wend their way through the caves and booby traps laid by One-Eyed Willie centuries ago.Throw into this movie mix the enigmatic, and gigantically huge, Sloth (John Matuszak), booby traps, high adventure, a blender, a few bats, an octopus (almost!), incredible treasure, a one-eyed pirate, falling boulders, the most amazing waterslide, a few skeletons, and a buccaneer fight aboard an ancient pirate sloop - what more do you want? This is a great movie that I am very pleased to have in my collection.	5.0	Goonies Never Say Die!	2004-12-28	1	1	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"Richard Donner's madcap kids adventure was a big hit in it's own little way back in the 80s, and it's not hard to see why. It's filled with memorable lines and wacky humour that appealed to kids back then. But is it actually that good? Well, some of it is a bit grinding sometimes, where the film starts to verge on ""screaming"" humour, which we all know, ain't funny at all. But the bunch of weirdos who go off in search of 'One-eyed Willie's treasure proves for some good-natured fun and innocent adventure.The standout performance in the film is Jonathan Ke Quan (INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), where we find out, that HEY, Some kids CAN act! It's fun to spot all the young kiddies who went on to bigger things like Josh Brolin and Sean Astin. And of course, Jeff Cohen as the wimpy 'Chunk' who keeps coming across corpses, providing some halarious moments. The fact that Donner helmed this small-scale adventure seems strange, given that he went on to do things like THE OMEN and the LETHAL WEAPON films, but it's handled well, and dosn't get TOO far-fetched. You have to have bad guys of course, and this one has Robert Davi (From A VIEW TO A KILL) and THE MATRIX's Joe Pantoliano as the bumbling Fratelli brothers chasing after the ""Goonies"". And of course Dave Grusin's memorable theme tune. THE GOONIES is one of those cute little films that Hollywood should do more often."	4.0	The gOoNiEs!	2002-08-04	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3GYVMUS7SSDFW	Kyle Tolle	This movie here is a sterling example of how you can make your imagination come alive and create a world of fun, intrigue, surprise and adventure.We have 7 likeable kids living in a small community with close ties and lots of history and memories.  Coming along to spoil the show, we have a wealthy land developer with his brat of a son as a sidekick who want to raze the town and turn it into a golf resort.Not willing to be uprooted from their beloved town, the industrious kids (with the help of a found treasure map and a local pirate legend) stumble upon a passage that could possibly lead them to treasure.Getting to this point was only half the fun.  Now we're really in for a good time!  Enter the danger, adventure and all out pursuit of treasure.  We follow the 7 youngsters through booby traps, dark caverns, perilous near misses, and exciting exploits that is sure to grab the imagination of adults and children alike.  And all this while being chased by 3 bumbling but quite funny counterfeiters who add a great touch to the plot.Moving right along, while avoiding all the pitfalls that might trip up most people (but not these young Indian Jones proteges), they discover the ultimate prize in the form of a long hidden Pirate ship located in a lagoon enclosed by a mammoth cave.Upon searching the ship (and dodging more inventive booby traps to boot), the pirates treasure is found which is a means to an end to pay off the land developer to save the town.Not so fast!  No easy getaway for these bunch of resourceful and rambunctious little ones.  Along comes those dastardly counterfeiters destined to spoil the show.  A little walking the plank, some sword fighting, and a whole lot of fun and the baddies are put out of business.  The exit from the cave is no walk in the park either being that the cave itself was booby trapped (yep, another booby trap and a good one).  With the help of a lovable monster and a whole lot of strength, the kids leave the cavern as fast as you please.Believing that upon leaving the cavern that the treasure was lost in the lagoon, alas, we have one of the seven heroes who spirited away several gemstones from the Pirate ship that will save the day for the future of the town!Now, who do we have to thank for this excellent adventure?  Well, let's first look at one of the executive producers.  Steven Spielberg.  Arguably the best movie director who has ever been associated with the silver screen and motion pictures.  Almost every piece of work that Spielberg has ever done has turned to gold and he is a master of exceptional movie making.Next, we have director Richard Donner who is behind the blockbuster Lethal Weapon movies and many more greats too numerous to list. He has done an excellent job of making a movie that audiences can count on time and again to enthrall them and make them feel great.This is absolutely 5 stars of fun and excitement all the way and is a sure winner anytime, anywhere.  Highly recommended all around.  Enjoy!	5.0	A touch of magic and fantasy wrapped with a bow	2001-11-14	0	0	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3VY6T3HYARQK3	"Ladd Wendelin ""laddman@hotmail.com"""	If you were a child of the '80's, like I was (and proud to be), then nothing capitalized on that youthful sense of adventure than that quaint little movie that ran almost annually on NBC called 'The Goonies'.'The Goonies' was far more than just a movie about some kids who go treasure hunting. It was all about that inquisitive, youthful sense of adventure into the unknown, not knowing what we would accomplish or discover, and best of all, being there with our friends for the ride. 'The Goonies' embodies such a personal feeling for those who view it, and still carry it in our hearts to this day.The thing that always made me wonder was the fact that there were pirates of the Spanish Main that made it to the Oregon coast line? Hmmmmm.....Oh well! The movie isn't perfect, but will remain a staple of every Child of the '80's heart! A youthful classic!	5.0	'THE GOONIES' will ALWAYS be good enough!	2001-08-22	0	0	0

Imagine that, a movie with an all-child cast that's actually likeable and who actually talk/behave like children!

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1XYADEC7TLTSP	"Liz ""LoftyKitten"""	The Goonies is one of the purest examples of what makes childhood worth while.  Every element of this movie is reminicent of the make-believe games that we spent entire weekends playing.One of the many things that makes this movie work so well, is that they don't spend a lot of time creating a back story.  We simply accept that The Goonies are real kids who existed before we came along, and will exist long after we're gone, and it creates a very comfortable and familiar atmosphere.As a child of the 80s, this movie holds a particular nostalgia, but it's will hold its own through all generations; after all, what kid doesn't know what it feels like to be a Goonie?  We've all gone through that uncomfortable stage where everything about you seems awkward, and all you can really do to make it through is surround yourself with a support group that's everybit as weird as you are.  We've all know the helpless feeling you get when your parents have a problem to big for you to solve.. unless you find a pirate's treasure!The adventure gets underway quickly with the finding of a treasure map in the attic, and the witnessing of certain criminal acts.  The gang of outcasts is soon joined by a damsel to put in distress, and they form a fantastic bond as they help each other solve problems and puzzles to make it through numerous life threatening situations, and we see their bond stick when they're offered an easy out, but decide to see things through, so that they can stay together.I've seen this movie countless times over the years, but I still get that thrill of excitement and adventurous spirit every time that music starts playing and there's another narrow escape!	5.0	This Is What Being a Kid Is All About	2005-01-30	1	1	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A27N04GDPG1P1N	ljg765	I'm not going to review the movie-it speaks for itself. Plus, if you're spending the extra movie to buy this 25th Anniversary Edition, you've already watched and love the movie.I'm going to review the 25th Ann. Edition set. The box it comes in is great. The coloring, 3D effects, and the subject matter all work well together. When you open it up to reveal the inside, the map from the movie is shown along with the metal &#34;skull key&#34; from the movie. The items all slide out towards the middle of the box. The storyboard cards are interesting to look at and come in a protective envelope. The other two inserts-the magazine replica and the article reprint are kept next to them as well, sandwiched between the game and the movie. The movie is a bit shorter than everything else, so they've put a cardboard insert to keep it from sliding around.The magazine and article are in fairly small typing, but are fun to look through.The game itself is kept in a box, then a plastic case and is all shrink wrapped. The cards, game pieces and board are individually shrink wrapped as well. The board is fairly heavy duty. I'd say it's made just like a normal game board, just a bit smaller. Folds out larger than expected-didn't measure but at least 12x18. It's big enough to easily play and sturdy enough you're not going to need to be super careful with it either.The movie is a BR. The one negative is that they don't include the DVD as well-as this is the Anniversary Edition, it'd be nice to have both. I was able to insert my old DVD and call it a day, though.If you're a big fan of the movie-this edition is the way to go!	5.0	Awesome packaging for a great movie!	2013-11-19	1	1	0

While you may remember all the parts that make this movie a true cult classic, and your kids may enjoy the one liners and action involved, an adult may look at you like you've lost your mind.That being said, I still LOVE this movie and will continue to quote lines from it until I am 80 years old.	4.0	Nostalgia required	2012-12-13	0	0	0

As every goonie fan should know that has seen this movie a hundred times like I have knows that this movie is shot mostly in dimlit areas such as  the hide out and the caverns, so you will not really see very much jawdropping detail. Now as far as the beginning where you see the prison scene, there you will get some detail but here is the big problem....after the prison scene it starts getting dark ""flickering"" effects around the sides of the picture due to ""I guess"" (DVD defect). maybe I got a bad disc but it could possibly be a defect in all but I will return the disc and let you guys know as soon as I get a new one. But this is NOT one to own for a Blu Ray collection being the Standard DVD version looks the same. I am a huge goonies fan and this was a BIG letdown for me. If you still prefer to buy this anyway, go to Amazon.Co.uk. you get a better deal for this Blu Ray there because Amazon.co.uk ships it to the USA and this version on here is a UK version as well I believe and thats why its so expensive being its an import but I got it on the UK site for around 20.00 us Dollars"	1.0	This is the worst Blu Ray release!

It comes with a board game, movie storyboards, a magazine and an article with cast photos. That is an impressive amount of stuff. The picture and audio quality are fairly good. Oddly, the bonus content on the disc is less than 30 minutes (which was ported over from the 2001 DVD). It also contains an audio commentary. On the one hand it is loaded with goodies but the lack of video supplements is disappointing. The longest featurette is only 13 minutes and that's a music video. ""The Making of the Goonies"" documentary is only 7 minutes long. Ultimately, this is a set for diehard fans only since Goonies is now available separately on Blu-ray without the board game. Overall I rate the film 4 stars and this set gets 3 stars. The 25th Anniversary Edition has been able to hold its value.Special Features:Cast commentary with director and all seven actorsThe Making of the Goonies documentaryCyndi Lauper music video ""The Goonies 'R Good Enough""OuttakesIncludes new board game, original movie storyboard reproductions, 1985 souvenir magazine reprint, and reprint of 2009 Empire Magazine article with cast photos and updates"	3.0	Goonies Fans Will Enjoy Goodies	2013-09-04	1	1	0

I guess I didn't really look at what was included in this product before it arrived, but suffice it to say, all I really needed was the movie. This thing comes in a pretty big box, with a number of items I will probably never use (such as the board game?!?). Regardless, The Goonies is still a great movie, and I'm satisfied with this purchase.	5.0	Great Movie!	2011-09-23	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AF6F75AJK0N7P	mark .s	The Goonies (1985) Dir,Richard Donner Starring, Josh Brolin,Corey Feldman,Sean Astin , Martha Plimpton , Keri Green. A group of goons attempt to enjoy ,what could be their last adventure together. They find a treasure  map , and investigate in what  could be hidden treasure from the Spanish  Armada, but there is one crucial flaw, The  Frattelis' a family of  ex-cons,who discover their plan and attmept to claim the treasure for their  own. This movie definitely epitomizes teen life in the 80's and will  hopefully grab the attention of a new audience.Definitely not  dated,spectacular sets,effects,backdrops.A bit to much yelling  though! but  thats the goons for you !  Recomendations Indiana Jones 1,2,3. (1980-89)  Stand By Me (1986) Masters of the Universe (1985) Hook (1993) Star Wars  (1977-00) Just to name a few.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3R6O17A6X0TXB	"""marlalandsman"""	Imagine that you are on a treasure hunt.  Your house is about to be wrecked, and you are afraid of being separated from your friends. Therefore, you have to find this treasure to pay for your house and tobe able to stay.  You're feeling a little depressed, but brave.  You will have to take an adventure to find the treasure and save the day. This what you will see if you watch &quot;The Goonies&quot;.In &quot;The Goonies&quot;, the super plot had lots of action.  The plot's obstacles were exciting.  The plot development made sense. Each time they escaped a new obstacle, they got another clue about the way to the treasure.  The climax was very awesome.  The denouement made the movie stop at a fantastic ending.  There were a lot of props and they were kind of scary, but in a good way.  A lot of the props were used as obstacles, and it made the movie more enjoyable.  The movie was humorous, too.  The characters did lots of funny things.  Overall, there was much to like about &quot;The Goonies&quot;.Even though we really enjoyed &quot;The Goonies&quot;, it had some flaws.  It had some words that were not appropriate and not really necessary.  There were a few small plot holes, although they weren't that noticeable.  Some scenes of the movie were pretty scary.  This movie would not be a good choice for children below the age of six.We recommend &quot;The Goonies&quot; for kids and adults.  Although there were flaws, it was a very good and exciting movie.  We hope you think &quot;The Goonies&quot; was a great movie, too.	4.0	&quot;Goonies&quot; Review from 3rd-5th graders	2002-06-24	1	0	1

I am not sure why I feel that way.  The Goonies is a great blend of action, adventure, comedy, romance, swashbuckling, and sprinkled on top is a some great 80's music.  I mentioned seeing this type of movie as a kid because I just do not think an adult could enjoy it as much unless they had the experience of watching it as a kid.  Brings you back to your childhood I guess is a good way to put it.	5.0	Pretty much a perfect movie...	2011-03-20	0	0	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A12YCWLBM7F066	"""matthew_lew"""	&quot;The Goonies&quot; is the kind of film that comes around only once in a lifetime. It's a movie that a whole generation of kids experienced. It's by no means a &quot;serious&quot; movie but rather a fun, action-packed adventure which you will enjoy time after time. Basically the plot consists of a group of kids going on a treasure hunt but the plot is not as important as the adventures that take place.  Things that should be noted is the fact that the movie was scripted by steven Spielberg, but more importantly features Joe Pantoliano of Matrix fame (Cypher).  The DVD itself should be an absoulted gem containg such features as a video commentary consisting of a large number of the cast as well as the director. Other features include a &quot;making of&quot; and deleted scenes.  This should make a classic dvd which you will enjoy watching time after time, and if you have kids, it's time to introduce the goonies to a new generation.	5.0	The Goonies - Unforgettable Masterpiece	2001-04-20	2	2	0

Its great to see all of the actors, especially those that have sort of dropped from public view through the years (i.e. Data, Chunk, and the girls).  Also, its really cool to finally see the deleted octapus scene (which is so corny its good they deleted it), and others.  The Cyndi Lauper video is also a nice touch.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2F8R40Z2OMIJM	"Matt Howe ""outloud98"""	I've always loved THE GOONIES. It's arch villains (the Fratelli's and their Mama with her tatoos) are inspired casting!  The film has an innocent, Hardy Boys sense of adventure that is hard to resist.  I've always enjoyed the hyper-active line readings in the film. You can tell that director Richard Donner created an ad-lib atmosphere on the set. Some of the lines are hilarious and I always hear something new during repeated viewings.The DVD has a great bonus:  The commentary is a screen within the film of the reunited actors.  They got everybody back!  Check out how the child actors have grown up!  Some of the commentary is hilarious.  Martha Plimpton has some particularly enjoyable memories and a ferocious laugh.The cut scenes (including the famous Octopus scene) are disappointing.  The Octopus looks really fake.  No wonder they cut it!  The digital revolution of the 90's really changed filmaking.  Today, the Octopus would be CGI.Also, it was fun to see the second part of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Goonies&quot; video.  I used to watch MTV all the time, trying to catch part two!  I never saw it.  It seemed like they only played part one.  This video, with its campy wrestling stars and lovely, kooky Cyndi, is a hoot!As the Cyndi Lauper song goes: THE GOONIES &quot;are good enough for me&quot;.	4.0	GOONIES Are Good Enough For Me	2001-05-26	3	3	0

I would in no way call this a family film.  I know children will hear foul language from time to time but this show seemed to open with pointlessly foul and ugly humor; the kind I don't enjoy hearing from a child.  The references to sex toys and drugs serve no real family entertainment purposes.  While I found the adventure to be appealing, I could have done without the low class, tasteless humor of the spanish interpreter.	2.0	Goonies are not good for this family	2005-12-28	41	14	27

If you ever want to try and understand a generation of  kids, watch this movie.  It embodies the longing for adventure and combines  it with friendship to produce an entertaining movie that was, in a bizarre  way, a reachable dream.  These were normal kids with normal problems and  they go on a fun and exciting adventures and become heroes.  How can you  not like this movie?  Putting good and bad aside, it's just fun to watch.	5.0	It's Goonies	2000-09-08	1	1	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A26N961045YLCI	melissa	Let me begin by saying that &quot;Goonies&quot; is by far one of the best movie of all time. It is appealing to all generations. It is every kids dream to break away from their parents and pursue their dreams, however far fetched.  Every young boy dreams of running away, fighting pirates and being the hero. This movie has it all.  It shows life from the view of a normal kid having the courage to do what all kids wish they could.  In the midst of murders and hidden treasure when all the kids get scared and what to go home, Mikey (Sean Austin) reminds them that &quot;this is our time, down here, no parents...,&quot;. The Goonies will be popular for generations to come.  Although the plot is a complete fantasy, there is a lesson to be learned.  It teaches kids to follow their dreams and do what they know in their hearts is the right thing.  It also teaches parents that just because kids are young and inexperienced, doesn't mean what they have to say isn't important.  Adults sometimes have a hard time admitting that their kids may be right and they may be wrong.  I won't tell what happens in the end, but if you haven't seen it, it's a must!!	5.0	&quot;Hey you guys!!!&quot;	2001-05-16	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1	Melissa	I have loved this movie the first time I saw it on television I think maybe on HBO. I can only imagine how fun this would be watching it for the first time in the theater, must have been incredable for those who got the chance to. The movie is great the film is by the amazing Richard Donner. The story and every thing is done by the amazing Steven Spielberg who has a way with children and looking through the eyes of the adventure. The screen play is written by Chris Columbus! I mean what more can you ask for with those great men in Hollywood? How about an amazing cast just staring out you have the youngsters like Corey Feldmen who plays the loud mouth &quot;Mouth,&quot; Sean Astin as the kid who leads them on the journey to save their home town, Josh Brolin who plays the older brother and helps keep them out of trouble and other noticable faces. Not only was this movie full of comedy but it leads to a spectacular adventure we can only dream about as kids. With spectacular senery, and great special effects.The DVD is amazing buy, the commentary by the entire cast is worth it to buy from but more on that later. The graphic's of the DVD is outstanding. It leads you through a cave like senery like in the movie with voice over's from the cast. The full length Cindy Lauper video that aired on MTV and was a number one hit &quot;The Goonie's Are Good Enough.&quot; Some cut scene's with the octopus scene, and a scene that was cut out where they are in a 7/11 type store and so on. And a short but sweet Making of the Movie with talk from Richard Donner, some of the cast, and a young Steven himself.As for the commentary that alone is worth the buy. Everyone showed up. However, Sean Astin for reason's unknown walked out in the middle of the commentary and Richard Donner can't remember half of what had happened during the commentary of his own movie. However, a lot of it was saved by Corey Feldman and  and Martha P. You'll hear interesting tid bits like maybe the hat from Indiana Jones was taken for the movie from the last Steven picture at the time :), The Jackson's hung out around the set, funny and memerable moments from the rest of the cast. It's truly amazing and I have fun watching it over and over. Even though they seem to be stepping over each other a lot it's just really fun to hear what happened during the making it.It's great for children maybe over 13 and great for adults to relive the adventure!	5.0	Relive the Adventure!!	2002-01-09	4	4	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3D15H6EX3POW7	Meriby Sweet	If you want to see the early start of actors Sean Astin and Josh Brolin, this is an amusing glimpse. Spielberg's fantastic adventure tale, however, underlines why directors don't like working with children and animals. Every line is delivered at top volume, every pratfall exaggerated, every character stereotyped. The plot is entirely predictable: greedy developers are ruining our town and foreclosures are rife, so what shall our pre-teen heroes do? Find a treasure map, ride their bicycles to a forbidden place, break in, find the secret tunnel that leads to the pirate cave, discover the hidden treasure, use it to spring dad from foreclosure and save the town -- all while being pursued by an evil, greedy family with a violent past.Brolin can't act now, so why we would expect acting from him then is unlikely; Astin shows glimpses of the reasons we liked him as Rudy and Sam, but that's about it. The adults in this film are irrelevant, which is probably why my 10-year old liked it . . . that and the skulls and skeletons.	2.0	A Look at Some Early Years of Child Actors -- and a Young Director	2014-03-14	1	0	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3AKRQEIX40VWT	Michael B.	As a kid growing up in the 80's the world was pretty boring.  I'd drag my friends on contrived, half-imaginary adventures looking for treasure, causing mischief, or doing whatnot.  In between exploring storm drains and  climbing on rooftops I happened to catch the goonies when I was about ten.  Immediately I loved it, and still do.  For anybody who gets tired of the  humdrum of daily life watch the goonies and remember what life was like  before the world crushed your creative energy, imagination, and reckless  exuberance.  Unfortunately no real adventure similiarly to the Goonies has  happened to me yet, but as I still continue to drag friends on my  adventures I can still hope!IMPORTANT: at least five or six scenes, one  of which is crucial to really understanding the movie, were edited out.  You can download these off the net.  They are worth doing.Also, in the  credits a Curtis Hanson is listed as playing Mr. Perkins.  Anybody know if  this is the same curtis hanson who worked on l.a. confidential and payback  some ten years later?	5.0	Fabulous.	2000-01-17	4	3	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	"By now, we all know the story of ""The Goonies:""  A band of young kids are in the final hours of hope as their houses will soon be torn down to make way for a country club owned by the ""Richest man in Astoria.""  Then, as if by divine intervention, Mike(y) Walsh (Sean Astin) finds a treasure map in his parent's attic, and bands together with his friends, his older brother, and two girls, to find the treasure and save the ""Goondocks.""This DVD release was carefully planned and masterminded by someone rather skillfully.  If it hadn't been for those who knew the potential this DVD had for the many loyal fans, we may have been stuck with nothing more than 2 different language subtitles and the theatrical trailer.  This DVD delivers in the realm of several interesting areas:1)Audio/Video commentary by the cast: Probably one of the most innovative ways for comentary, as we see and hear Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jonathan Ke Quan, and even director Richard Donner give their views.  And even with the comentary, Corey Feldman still embodies the spirit of his character ""Mouth"": the fact is that he seems to never shut up throught the entire commentary.  Some interesting articles get covered up in some areas as some people try to say things but give up when someone else intervenes.2)""The Goonies R Good Enough"" music video by Cyndi Lauper.  Yep, Cyndi Lauper in all her colored haired glory, this time acting in quite a nutty take as her Mom and Pop's gas station is going to be overtaken by greedy corporate types, until she uncovers a secret cave, where she meets the Goonies, and a number of crazies (pirates, a green-faced witch, etc) all search for an ancient treasure.  Steven Spielberg even makes a brief cameo.3)Making of the Goonies-a 7 minute segment on the film, shot back in 1985, very brief, but does show interesting scenes, such as filming inside a ""Snack-shop,"" and a police car chase shot that was omitted.4)Outtakes-this title is misleading, as you may think it was the kids flubbing their lines.  Actually, it contains 3 scenes, including the deleted snack-shop sequence, a further dissection of One-Eyed Willy's treasure map, and then the gang's encounter with a giant octopus.5)Page layout: the main screen looks like the caverns, and really captures the movie instead of a static image, any direction you go will cause something on the menu to happen.Even with 5 stars, there will always be things that we, the fans of the Goonies, will always wish to see.  Talked about on the commentary was the possible fact of an extended police chase, and gorillas getting loose in the film.  But still, the film holds up much better in today's world of terribly bad PG-rated features."	5.0	One of the best DVD releases Warner Bros. has put together!	2001-09-06	2	2	0

A town under threat of beeing bought out by a company who want to make it a golf coarse seem to have lost the battle and are about to pack up, untill a group of kids who call them selves gooneis find a tresure map and go hunting for pirate gold!Along the way they meet some bad guys and recruit some members of various ages and is filled with comedy, suspence and wont leave your bored out of your brain!The bonus features are pretty good, tho mind you, i'm not a fan of Cindy Laupher, and her video clip seems to go forever filled with not just the actors of the movie, but a bunch of 80's pro wrestlers as well! IF you have never seen this movie before, then i recomend buying it! If you have seen it and dont have it on DVD, you wont regret buying it if you liked it!It would be nice to have a directoers cut that showed the deleted scenes within vewing of the movie like on some TV showing of the film, but there still there as a bonus feature on there own!	5.0	Great Family Movie for the young and old!	2004-03-19	0	0	0

You get at least a few moments with each character, develop a feel for them, and come to like them all.  You really want to see them succeed, and the suspense of whether they will or not is constant.  This movie is good for all ages, and is rated PG.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg team up to bring us &quot;The Goonies.&quot; The Goonies are a group of kids that love to go on crazy adventures and have a &quot;never say die&quot; attitude. They are being forced out of their homes by a local land developer that wants to build a country club. The only way to save their homes is to come up with enough money to pay off all the back taxes their families owe. Unfortunately, it is a feat that is practically impossible to accomplish. However, The Goonies discover a map that is supposed to lead to the buried treasure of the legendary &quot;One-Eyed&quot; Willie. Determined to keep their homes, the group sets off on a quest to find the rich stuff. Little do they know, that the beginning of the hunt leads to the basement of the local crime family The Fratelis. Now with the Fratelis hot on their tails, they must overcome numerous obstacles and booby traps to find the loot.Sean Astin who is known for his role as Sam in the Lord of the Ring films, offers an outstanding performance as Mikey - the leader of the Goonies. He is the believer of the group and has always loved pirates - especially &quot;One - Eyed&quot; Willie. Johnathan Key Quan plays Data, who is the creative one of the group. He is obsessed with making wacky inventions and none of them work. Corey Feldman is great as Mouth. Mouth is a smart aleck whose mouth always gets the group in trouble. Jeff Cohen probably offers the film's best performance with his portrayal of Chunk. He is the main reason why the film has become such a fan favorite. Chunk is the most entertaining character by far. His constant whining, food cravings, and &quot;truffle shuffle&quot; will have you laughing for the majority of the film. Mikey's older brother Brand ( Josh Brolin), his girlfriend Andi ( Keri Green), and her best friend Stef ( Martha Plimpton) are also great as they come along for the ride. Troy Perkins ( Steve Antin) is the rich and spoiled bully that makes it his mission to terrorize the Goonies. He also has a thing for Andi and is in constant battle with Brand for her affection. The Frateli crime family is great. Mama Frateli (Anne Ramsey) will give you the creeps. Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi play the Frateli brothers Francis and Jake. Their constant bickering and other antics will make you laugh. Then there is Sloth. Sloth is their brother that is disfigured and possesses superhuman strength. They keep him chained in the basement. Sloth however is my favorite character and has a heart that matches the size of his love for Baby Ruth's! The relationship between him and Chunk is very touching.The Goonies is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it maybe a dozen times, and I still love it just as much. Richard Donner does an excellent job directing the vast array of talent in the film. Steven Spielberg crafts an amazing tale of friendship and determination set in extraordinary circumstances. The characters that pave the road for the story are by far the best thing about the film. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done. The underground caverns, the booby traps, the pirate ship, and the treasure all give the film a sense of authenticity when dealing with the pirate genre.The DVD is outstanding. It contains deleted scenes that include a hilarious convienient store scene and the infamous octopus scene. The commentary is the best feature. It brings back all the Goonies and shows them in the booth. You get to see Data, Chunk, Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Stef, and Andi all grown up. It is great to hear what they have to say about working with each other, the characters that they played, and the movie in general. The movie itself and the amazing DVD make it a must own!	5.0	Fun filled family adventure	2003-10-07	7	6	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	ADOSOJ9HJAHDU	"M.M. ""Muppet Fan"""	I still remember how I felt when I first went to see this film, and I still love it as much today.  It is an Indiana Jones film for children, the story of a group of friends who come together to say goodbye.  Their homes  are being torn down to make way for new developments, and the kids are  desperate to try to save them.  But where to get the money?  The answer  comes in the form of a treasure map that is locked in the attic of one of  the kid's homes.  From then on, it's one great adventure after another, as  the misfits avoid traps, crooks and many other obstacles to do what no  grown up could ever do before....find the legendary pirate 'One Eyed  Willie's&quot; lost treasure.  A great family film, one you will want to  watch over and over, with or without your children. No home should be  without it.	5.0	A great film that stands the test of time.	2000-01-16	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A228JH8V9Y700G	MortensOrchid	The Citizen Kane of kids' movies!  I loved Goonies when it came out.  It had enough teen appeal, adventure, kids saving the day and overcoming the fetid stench of corporate corruption to keep us coming back over and over.  A bunch of kids from the Goon Docks, a middle class coastal town, are to enjoy their last Goonie weekend together before the wealthiest man in town sells it all off to put a golf course in where their houses were.  Miracle of miracles, as well as in an effort to save their home, the Goonies discover a treasure map and decide to go off looking for pirate treasure rumored to be burried in the town.This is ridiculous, as we all know, but to believe in hope and crave adventure brought us together for this wonderful children's classic.  The humor is silly and insulting, the way kids are.  This was just before the politically correct 90s, where we would not be allowed to use fat jokes (Chunk's truffle shuffle), making fun of the physically or mentally disabled (the disfigured Sloth being locked in the basement by his ashamed family), or racial sterotypes (Data).What really made this a great DVD was the special features commentary.  Bringing back the original cast to comment on it together made it a truly wonderful experience, as those kids are all about my age, and I lived it once again through their eyes.  They all went different directions - lawyers, actors, stunt coordinators, and Corey Feldman - but it was wonderful to be back again.	5.0	An adventure story that will echo through the ages	2005-09-09	5	4	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	Everybody of a certain age (23-26 or so) will have seen this film at the cinema, or on television already. One of those Steven Speilberg films that wasn't actually directed by him (see also: 'Gremlins', 'Poltergeist', and  so forth), it features a gang of kids who shout constantly until you want  to torture them to death. And Corey Feldman (not Haim), too.It's not as  good as you remember - action-wise, it doesn't get into gear until about  half-way through, and the kids are really, really irritating. It resembles  a less-expensive version of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', and  that was always the lesser of the Indy films.Still, it passes a wet  boxing day well, and it's horrifying to think that, in a decade from now, a  futuristic version of me will only have 'Pokemon: The First Movie' to write  about.	4.0	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH	2000-05-16	8	0	8

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A15W70BFY26KIA	Mr Ghostface	&quot;The Goonies&quot;Okay, we all love The Goonies. If you haven't seen it (what?!), the other 100+ review already written will tell you why you should. Normally I try to write balanced and analytic reviews, but this is THE GOONIES! So here's why the DVD is just so cool...One. The deleted scenes. Most of us, myself included, wanted to see the long-mooted Octopus scene, referred to by Data but never seen in the film. Well, it's here, along with some other stuff which you should like.Two. The Cyndi Lauper video. It's nearly 12 minutes long! I never saw it the first time around, and it's the cheesiest, corniest 80s pop video you'll ever see, complete with a few WWF wrestlers of the time (including Rowdy Roddy Piper!) and all of the kids except Kerry Green.Three. This is the best surprise of the whole lot. The commentary, listed as only featuring director Richard Donner, actually features ALL SEVEN of the kids together. And what's better, we SEE them. The commentary was recorded sometime around February 2001, and the whole thing was filmed. Let me tell you, it is SO cool to see the kids together, all grown up and reflecting on the making of the film with Richard Donner sitting in the middle like 'dad'. It's just great. And they all seem to be as excited as I was (although Sean Astin disappears halfway through for some reason!). But I can't recommend this enough.Just buy it, you'll see what I mean. Ah, what a classic movie.	5.0	Details of the DVD release.	2001-09-18	2	2	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AOY9J6AS0WTND	Mr Greenjeans	As if another review is needed, but feeling compelled is its own reason I suppose.I enjoyed this movie as a kid. Watching it as an adult imparted to me the revelation that this is likely the best overall kids movie ever made. It excels in storytelling, humor, compelling adventure that bridges the real and fantastical, and therefore succeeds in taking kids (and adults) along for the Goonies ride. You identify with the Goonies, want to be one, and are one for the length of the movie.The isn't much else to be said that hasn't been.	5.0	Likely the Best Overall Kids Movie Ever Made that wasn't Animation	2014-07-10	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A22RNTQJRST11B	Mr. K	This one brought back the memories.  I remember seeing this movie when I was younger.  For an older movie, it's worth re-watching especially if you have kids now.  It is rated PG so it may not be something you want your younger kids to watch (minor cussing, some  adult humor).  I watched this with my son and he thought it was a good movie.  He laughed at various parts, watched with wide eyes at the suspenseful parts, looked away just slightly during scenes he thought might be scary (which fortunately turned out not to be), and was happy with the ending.

It was never designed to be a high quality epic, so if you are a Lucas fanboy, maybe some of the best parts will go right over your head.A great movie for kids as the humor is dorky kid stuff and nothing vulgar or really offensive, my 6 year old has been watching this for years.A movie about ordinary kids, the rejects i fact, who stumble on the adventure of a lifetime!

They all seem to have pretty good chemistry as well. I have seen little differences however in this movie. The one I usually see there's no octopus around the ship scene I believe, although they mention at the end that, 'The octopus was really scary!' I didn't see any scene with an octopus until watching it on regular TV once. I had this movie on VHS and that wasn't part of it. Don't know why that is but its always been that way. I remember seeing it in the theater and certainly don't remember that part. Why am I paying so much attention to this little detail you may ask? Bc I'm anal like that. If I expect something it had better be there!Other than that minor issue I love it! Love Data, Chunk, Mouth and Mikey. Haven't seen anything that beats the Truffle Shuffle either!	5.0	Enjoyed immensely!!!	2014-03-28	0	0	0

I own this movie on VHS/DVD/BluRay - and watch it on my Kindle when the weather is gloomy and I want to stay in bed. My 6 year old loves watching this movie as well - it is &#34;our movie&#34; where we can snuggle up and be carefree for a time.Great adventure movie, the characters are all lovable, the score is perfect - and the added bonus? You get Cyndi Lauper! ;) The music video included on the DVD/BluRay is cheesy - but who doesn't love a great 80s music vid with a story line, wrestlers from the time and the cast of the Goonies? Enjoy it - I think you'll love it!	5.0	For Young and Old	2014-01-07	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3STVEXTBJ981T	Nick Valle 22	"Written by Steven Spielberg and Chris Columbus, and directed by Richard Donner who is widely known for the Lethal Weapon series, The Goonies was released June 7, 1985. The story follows a group of kids who call themselves ""The Goonies"" through an adventure to try and save their neighborhood that is being foreclosed and turned into a golf course. Mikey, played by Sean Astin known for his star roles in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, is the unofficial leader of the group that starts him and his friends on a quest to obtain the riches of an infamous pirate known as One-eyed Willie. With only one day left for Mikey's father to come up with the money to save the neighborhood, the Goonies are losing hope and decide to scavenge what they can from the attic and discover the treasure map of One-eyed Willie and decide to go on one last adventure and search for the rich stuff. Mikey's older brother Brand, played by Josh Brolin known for his part in No Country for Old Men and the 2010 version of Wall Street, tries to stop Mikey from continuing this endeavor but is tied in when the group crosses paths with a family of outlaws known as the Fratellis, Anne Ramsey as the mom and her two sons played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano. When the Fratellis learn of the treasure, it turns into a foot race for the treasure with deadly consequences if the Goonies can't find a way to come out on top. This is an adventure comedy that is a must see. The story addresses the difficulties of being a teenager and shows how a group of kids with different background and personalities can work together to overcome the obstacles placed before and beat the odds. The Goonies is a good family film to watch that will keep you entertained with the variety of themes and characters displayed."	5.0	Awesome Movie.	2013-10-22	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	ARMPZSE04MK7P	"Nissantwa ""Nissantwa"""	"I never felt this film got the commercial exposure at the box office it should have because so many confused it with 'Ghoulies', which had been released the year before.  No Comparison!!.  I've read some of the other reviews and they're all pretty good, so I'll just add some personal trivia.  The house in the movie is in Astoria, Oregon. Thats the same town where they filmed Kindergarden Cops. Some of the scenes on the beach were near Haystack rock in the Cannon Beach, Oregon neighborhood. When Chunk says he saw the Jeep full of bullet holes and calls it an ORV, that was the slang (off road vehicle) before not so off road products were named SUV's.  Reminiscent of The Little Rascals that Spielberg watched when he was in  school, it's an appealing adventure story, a sort of 'Young, Young, Indiana Jones plot"". Amazing how Steven Spielberg went from filming a color  silent film of 1965 senior sneak day at Saratoga High School in California to blockbuster mega-mogul film Director, producer et al.  Part of his success was in thinking big.  Although Goonies did not appeal to a broad age group, he didn't cut any corners, spending money on blowing up boats and creating a giant octopus, scenes that hit the cutting room floor.  (but can be viewed on the DVD)  In fact, I think the pirate ship was the largest indoor set ever built>(at that time)  And so Ghoulies faded into history while Goonies speaks to generation after generation, igniting a sense of wonder, speaking to the child in all of us."	5.0	Not to be confused with 'Ghoulies'	2007-04-13	3	2	1

Like Twain, Steven Spielberg understands a specific kind of half-earthy, half-magical kids' world that many of us never quite abandon, nor want to.  The Goonies is one of the top films ever in that genre.  I would compare it to Stand By Me and, more recently, Moonrise Kingdom.	5.0	Spielberg meets Mark Twain	2012-11-27	0	0	0

I do not get the cult love for this horrible excuse for entertainment.I would rank this as the worst movie I have ever been subjected to recurring snippets of and quotes from. Once through of this would be worse than watching ""walk tall"" 8 times in a row. Worse even than watching the home shopping network for 24 hrs with your eyes forced open and unable to turn your head away, while being force fed a blended mixture of spam, Strawberry Torani Syrup and Wintergreen tic-tacs.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3JR3G20VE434P	Only The Best	I'm 35 and a little younger than many of the hardened Goonies fans. I will say this, it's my favorite movie and has a lot of meaning to me. I almost bought the house the movie was filmed in, in 2002. The house was sold and turned into a bed and breakfast for a little while. I go to Astoria, Oregon for all of the movie get togethers. I'm about as hardcore of a Gonnie fan as you can get. I find it very sad that so many of the cast that made this a childhood classic, have passed away. Sloth, Mama Fratelli, Mickey's dad and recently the maid are the main characters that have passed on. Yes, I do know everyones real name, but, for the sake of the movie, I won't list them. On a final note, I'm the absolute worst person to watch this movie with, because I have to say all of the lines right before the actors do. Yes, I'm a Goonies fan boy, and proud of it!!!	5.0	My favorite movie of all time	2013-08-25	0	0	0

I first saw this when I was 5 (hey, I heard plenty of bad language my whole childhood through, and it didn't turn me into a depraved, immoral individual), and while I can understand a lot of parent's concerns about their children seening a movie with ""bad words,"" please don't overlook this movie for that purpose (c'mon, your kids have heard it, probably from your own mouth while driving). The cast is enigmatic, has wonderful chemistry and the imagination used to make this movie inspires TO THIS DAY. Although I dissent from the review that says that the magic is the friendship, I think the magic in this movie was definitely imagination. Mikey's imagination and his belief in his imagination and support form his friends saved the neighborhood.Besides, there are too many giggle-worthy moments in this movie. I could sit here, give a recap and list them, but that would be beside the point."	5.0	A Five- Star MUST!!	2006-02-09	3	1	2

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1OVJ0QM9WF8DB	Owlzindabarn	Director Richard Donner has gone into his wine cellar, retrieved this vintage flick, and poured it out for today's kids who might enjoy it along with a serving of Spy Kids and Harry Potter.Now, what is a goony, they might ask? Well, in this case, it's one of seven kids who find themselves searching for buried pirate loot, and running from the villainous Fratelli family. It's Saturday-matinee serial redux; SEE the Goonies escape from Steven Spielberg death-traps and Rube Goldberg booby traps! LAUGH at the unforgettable 'Truffle Shuffle!' APPLAUD as our heroes save the day, and WISH they'd made a sequel.Donner's wine has improved with age. The rapid pacing, the unraveling mystery, the over-lapping dialogue...and the incomparable Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli. Ahhhh, what a great actress. She scared the lice off of me as a kid, and can still do it, sixteen years later. And Sloth, cousin to the Incredible Hulk. How much can one love a misunderstood movie mutant? And Jeff Cohen as Chunk, possibly the greatest juvenile scene-stealer in motion picture history, (although, unlike most kid actors, you WANT him to do it).OVER 21 ALERT: It's not just a kids' movie! Oh, no! There's plenty for the big kids, really! This DVD has for example, several deleted scenes, including the infamous and mysterious 'octopus' scene, subject of much discussion and speculation. Well, now you can see for yourself why it was cut...We have here also the complete two-part Cyndi Lauper &quot;Goonies R Good Enough&quot; music video, guest-starring the Goonies cast, the Bangles as lady pirates, the hibachi chefs, the professional wrestlers, the plastic cow, Dave and Wendy and...(drum roll)...Andre the Giant! Yes, it's all here...the 12-minute video that was almost long enough (and funny enough) to be Goonies II.But never mind all this. What the grown-ups REALLY want to see is the Director's Commentary. That's right, SEE. This special edition DVD occasionally allows you to see the stars and director chat and reminisce about the picture, and...WOW. ALL SEVEN Goonies are here! Chatting, bickering, laughing, remembering. And I KNOW you all want to see how well the Goonies aged over 16 years. Very well, actually. And it's funny to note that Corey Feldman's character was called &quot;Mouth,&quot; as he blabs away, hogging most of the commentary himself, (with Martha Plimpton in second place for the Chatterbox award). Interestingly, Sean Astin simply gets up and walks out halfway through the movie. Why? No one could say. Perhaps that will someday be as big a mystery as the 'octopus' scene...	5.0	The Goonies R Still Good Enough	2001-08-28	112	102	10

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A264LUV87CVAWQ	"Patrick D. Mayo ""Drum Nut"""	Steven Spielberg has been able to remain in touch with his inner child and he obviously has been able to find a simpatico match with others, as evidenced by most of the reviews for this movie.I must admit I'm slightly prejudiced because I only live 35 miles from Astoria and have seen most all of the places where the movie was filmed many times. Knowing that, it isn't &quot;just a movie&quot;. Like so many others, I dreamed of fighting pirates and bad guys when I was a kid, and this movie spoke to that child in me who still exists. Every time I drive by Goonie house, I almost expect to see someone sliding across a wire from one house to the next, or old lady Fratelli breaking her boys from the jail. (It's still there for all to see.)That's the fun part about movies. Was it really real? Who cares. It was fun, wasn't it? That's all that counts. I'm really looking forward to seeing this on DVD. I'm sure my boys (who are both adults now) will too. Maybe I'll have them and their kids over that weekend and we'll relive the fun anew with the grandkids.	5.0	Astoria Goonies	2001-05-13	6	5	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3T6CVYTVIYHZ5	"Patrick McDonald ""Patrick"""	I have not seen or purchased this new 25th Anniversary version of the Goonies being released on DVD and Blu-Ray. I do however know alot about it from the Digital Bits. First off, I am a Goonie Fanatic. It is my favorite movie of all time and I even took the time to visit Astoria Oregon and went the goonie house and other locales when I was on the west coast a while back. To say I wore out the special edition DVD release is an understatement. So when I heard about this new version I was beyond euphoric. I was crushed though when I read what Warner Bros is prepping for said 25th year version. They are basically repackaging the DVD we all have with a new remaster and adding a board game(beyond lame), some promotional magazines(I will take those) and I think a few trading cards or trinkets If I can remember, that's it. Nothing more. Come on Warner Bros, where are the rumored deleted scenes such as the goonies oath scene, the second store visit, the data intimidator scene, the leech scene, the gorilla scene, and extra dialogue. Also how about seamless branching so we can watch the goonies with the existing deleted scenes back into the movie. And it wouldn't hurt either Warner Bros to throw in a new commentary or documentary. The goonies has one of the most rabid fan bases of any movie in history and I feel this is shameless double dipping. I'll probably cave in the end only for the new Blu ray transfer but I'm confident writing this review which is way before release that they dropped the ball big time on this one. 5 stars for the movie (ok 10 stars if Amazon would let me) 2 stars mostly for the yet unseen transfer and extras.  PS, sorry for the bad spelling and grammar.	3.0	Read Before Buying 25th Anniversary Goonie Fans!!!	2010-08-05	23	13	10
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3I4EX7TBWUT1U	"""patrick_mcknight"""	"Really I should know better than to enjoy this film that was so obviously made with kids in mind. Yet there was something about this film that I couldn't help but respond to. Maybe it was the fact that I, like the kids in this film grew up in a northwest climate during the eightees. Or maybe it was the fact that I too dreamed of pirates and finding buried treasure as a kid.Anyway, I really did enjoy watching this film. It has suspenseful moments, exciting action sequences, and incredible sets. The kids were all quite likable, indeed I remember kids like the goonies while I was growing up. I think all of us have met people like Chunk at some point, a worrisome, glutinous, but good natured kid. Steven Spielberg wrote the story for this film, and his influence can certainly be felt throughout. Interestingly, the climax of the film foreshadows Spielberg's ""Hook"" which he would make a few years later. I guess making that film was always at the back of his mind.  Richard Donner was the director.  Donner also directed ""Superman"" and adds an amusing little reference to that film.The DVD is well worth purchasing as it allows the film to be shown in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The Goonies was shot as a widescreen film, as a result the pan & scan VHS cuts out a lot of the image making it difficult to see what is going on."	4.0	Guilty pleasure time.	2002-07-25	0	0	0

But one thing I really hated about the DVD was the fact that not all the deleted scenes are on it. Everyone says they are most likely lost but then again you see them turn up on Disney and all the bootlegs in good quality. Also for all you fans out there, the snack and shop scene is not the full thing. It stops right in the middle of Brand yelling at Mikey. On Disney and the bootlegs it shows Mouth steal the map from Brand's pocket again and then the kids run off. So all in all, the DVD isn't all that great. The only good thing is pretty much the commentary.	3.0	A Little Disappointed!	2002-07-20	29	24	5

You won't find fantastic special effects in this movie, just typical fun and adventure any kid can dream of. If you miss your childhood days (which I do), I bet you will enjoy this movie very much! One of the magic of this movie is the memory of my childhood years that returns while I was watching it.As for the DVD itself, you will find loads of extras. There's the MTV, deleted scences, etc. I just love the commentary by the director and the then kid actors who have all grown into fine adults. The commentary will tell you both the fun and hardship the actors went through while shooting Goonies.If you like simple adventure movies, I recommend this one to you.	5.0	Best extras award for the Goonies!	2001-09-15	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A17C9DUSZAFJQY	Paul	The Goonies is such an excellent movie and all but the DVD was a disappointment. The picture and sound is fantastic but it's just that not all the deleted scenes are here. There are only 4 deleted scenes and they are the Stop'N Snack, the Data binocular part, the octopus, and the scene where Chunk and Sloth come to the cave with spikes. We are still missing the Steph and Mouth plank scene, the leech/oath scene, the scene where Mikey and Mouth save Data as he slips on the log, and the scene where Data blows up. The second disappointing this is that the deleted scenes that are on the DVD aren't even in the movie. They are sperate which is bad cause when you view them it starts off just from there so it's hard to know what part of the movie they originally were in.	2.0	This DVD COULD be ALOT better........	2001-08-21	19	8	11

The kids in the movie  have complex characters, and work together to solve an age long mystery about the Pirate One-Eyed Willy and his ship of gold and jewels.

I was maybe 22 or 23 when this movie came out, but I never saw it (nor really knew too much about it for that matter). Finally, at 49-years-old, and after reading all the hype about The Goonies, a couple night ago I sat down and watched it with my wife (who loves this movie). Well, I was stunned! I couldn't believe how bad this movie was . . . I couldn't see past the ""cuteness"" - it was just plain STUPID!; not to mention annoying at times. The little fat kid ""Chunk"" was so annoying for the first 30 minutes or so of the film, that it was all I could do not to get up and leave the room. I normally like adventure movies and can usually suspend my disbelief in order to digest a movie for what it's supposed to be; but from an adult's perspective, ""The Goonies"" is a real turkey. Yes, it would probably be enjoyable for ages 6 to 12 (although there's probably inappropriate content for ages 6 to 10, so that really doesn't leave too much of a viable audience).Just for comparison's sake, a couple months ago I also watched ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (a film from the same era) for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I also love ""The Sandlot"", and ""Holes"" was pretty good too from what I remember."	2.0	Wow - I couldn't believe how bad this was with all the hype	2013-09-14	4	0	4

With a family hit men called the Fratiellis after them the Goonies have to survive a system of deadly booby traps while avoiding the crooks.The film has a few mistakes like at the end when the James Bond wannabe talks of the octopus, actually the octopus was edited out of the script.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2K3XHROUUCZB0	Phoebe	When my sister and I were introduced to THE GOONIES about 10 years ago, by our dad, we fell in love with it. My sister and I have watched this movie literally 100 times, and no matter how many times we've seen it, we still continue to get captured into the excitement, adventure and fun the movie holds. For Christimas this year, we got the movie on DVD and its better then ever. Including the original movie, it has a commentary with the cast of the movie, a music video the cast did with Cyndi Lauper, outtakes, the orginial trailer and a look at the making of the goonies. Whenever our friends come over, we ask them, &quot;Have you ever seen 'the goonies'?&quot; And if they hadn't, we introduce them to our favorite movie.When Mikey (Sean Astin) and his friends, the goonies, encounter a treasure map, they embark on the adventure of a lifetime. With characters like Mouth,(Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Kuan), Chunk (Jeff Cohen) and Mikey's older brother, Brand (Josh Brolin), and the girl goonies, Andy(Kerri Green) and Stef(Martha Plimpton) the jokes are endless. As they out run the bad guys, dodge the booby traps, and find the treasure of One-eyed-Willy, its a thrill a minute adventure that will capture the hearts of young and old for generations to come.	5.0	best movie!	2003-04-05	6	5	1

While I did find it exciting, I also was scared stiff when I saw the severely deformed man/monster thing that was part of the Fratelli family. I can't think of his name right now. I develped a crush on both ""Mikey"" and ""Mouth"", the cute 11 year olds. I think this film appeals to any kid who likes a good adventure story. The kids try to locate an old pirate treasure in order to come up with the money to save their homes, so that they don't have to leave the goon docks. I don't think parents should let their young kids (those under 9) watch this film. It may scare them a bit, and also there is a lot of foul language."	4.0	great film for kids and adults	2005-12-16	2	2	0

Despite some silly jokes, I found myself almost crying at the end (don't laugh!) and thinking ""Oh my God! I want to be a child again!"". This is a great movie, especially for the ones that, like me, had their childhood at the 80's. If you like CGI-based movies like Harry Potter, then this movie is not for you. ""The Goonies"" relies on real acting (like Sloth, I love Chunk). I think it is very well-succeeded in trying to create a childhood atmosphere.  The music also helps to create that atmosphere.The two things that I didn't like on this DVD is some rough editing towards the end of the movie, which I didn't remember and the commentary feature, featuring a very sarcastic Corey Feldman. I don't know how Donner let this stay on the DVD."	4.0	This movie has magic!	2004-12-10	4	3	1

Because I grew up watching this movie, I can only see it through those eyes.  If you aren't familiar with the movie already, all I can say is at least go rent it.  If you are familiar with the movie, I highly recommend this DVD.I had only seen this movie in the chopped-up Pan-n-Scan format, and seeing the complete film in all its Widescreen glory is great.  The picture quality is amazing compared to my VHS copy recorded off HBO!  :)  Of course the sound is great, too.The extras list indicates ""Outtakes"", which are really Deleted Scenes.  I wanted to clarify this because sometimes they use the word ""outtakes"" to refer to Bloopers/Gag Reel.  These Deleted Scenes were very interesting to see.  There's one that's several minutes long and involves the gang stopping by a convenience store and being harrassed by Troy's bunch.  It was also great to finally get to see the octopus scene I had heard so much about.  Fun stuff!I did not remember the Cyndi Lauper music video, but if you remember it I'm sure this will hold some nostalgic value for you.  Otherwise, it's probably something you will only watch once.The ""making of"" documentary is not new...it was produced around the time of the film's release.  There are some slow spots where the plot is explained for people who haven't seen the movie.  However, there was quite a bit of behind the scenes footage, and the impromptu interviews with Richard Donner and the cast are fun to watch.The best of the extras is the VIDEO commentary with Donner and the gang.  Corey Feldman is really annoying, but if you can stomach his antics, the commentary is really enjoyable.  The group has a good comradery and it's great to hear them reminiscing about the film.  Best of all, you get to SEE them doing the commentary.  It's great to see what the cast looks like fifteen years later.  This is a GREAT feature that I wish more DVDs included.Donner; the man responsible for ""The Omen"", ""Maverick"", ""Scrooged"", ""Conspiracy Theory"", ""Superman: The Movie"", and the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies; put together a movie here that's great fun to watch, even twenty years later.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3H0L7YV89M6FX	"R. Castaneda ""movie guy"""	This is one of those rare movies that you never get tired of watching, I have lost count on how many times I have seen it but it must be somewhere around 15 times.  The Goonies is about a group of kids that find a map that leads to a lost treasure ship, along the way they encounter a series of booby traps and pursued be a group of criminals (a mother and her two sons). But I don't know why I am explaining the movie I mean seriously who has never seen The Goonies.  If you are one of the unfortunate people that have never seen it trust me you will not me disappointed.	5.0	best film ever	2005-03-22	2	2	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3T70E9O6P0JXB	R. Chambers	Obviously the woman from Japan who rated this a less than one star doesn't realize the effect this movie had on kids that grew up around the time it came out. For our generation, this is like sushi is to Japan. You can't take the Goonies away. Sure if I saw this as an adult for the first time I probably wouldn't like it, but considering this was a movie I grew up with and have enjoyed since childhood, it will always remain a 5 star on my list. I bought the DVD so I could watch it again and again. This poor lady's child who hated the movie will grow up very sheltered and when the child hits the streets of Tokyo as a teen and has no clue about anything in life and is a loner, it will be because of things like this where this woman won't let her child hear some mild language when she's probably cussing him out at home every day.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1N0W0P2W56P19	"R. Chang ""mr_coldcutts"""	The Goonies was perhaps my favorite movie as a child of the 80's.  Watching the movie again brings back fantastic memories.  This is a movie that the entire family will enjoy.  Nothing like a search for pirate treasure while avoiding an infamous family of criminals to get your heart pumping!  To top it all off, the cast of mostly then-unknown-now-renown stars succeeds in bringing out the kid in all of thisThe DVD is fantastic!  The crowning feature is undoubtedly the cast and director commentary.  This is how commentary was meant to be done!  The screen shows the entire cast along with director Richard Donner sitting at a table with microphones while simultaneously showing the actual movie in the corner of the screen, so you can see both what the actors are commenting about and exactly what their reactions are.  Through the commentary you definitely get the sense that The Goonies was as much a joy to make as it is to watch.	5.0	great movie to relive childhood	2001-09-06	2	2	0

I frankly caught it on cable, but was already a preteen I think, so not quite under its spell.  However, it is sophisticated swashbuckling entertainment and just so integrated into the first half of the 80s that I think everyone in their teens even saw it on HBO.  It has talentless teen stars like one of the 'Coreys', has Cyndi Lauper music and Capt. Lou., and a classic Donner/Spielberg feel like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Close Encounters.Trully a classic defining that era that is overlooked vs ""the breakfast club"" and others, because it aimed at a younger audience."	5.0	are good enough	2006-05-23	1	1	0

I think every kid wanted to do what the Goonies did and go through adventures to find all that lost treasure.  So, I can't say its bad.  Most people ordering it have probably already seen it.  I just wanted it for my library.  The DVD also included commentary from the stars of the movie intermittently showing you their faces in present time as they talk.  It also includes the making of Goonies and deleted scenes.	5.0	Goonies DVD	2007-11-25	2	2	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3609VTOMWMV5Y	ricareydog	We do not watch horror films, so this is the closest that we will come to a scary movie with our 8 year old.  He set his popcorn aside, eyes big during the scary scenes, and actually held our hand.  He was happy with the ending, and wanted to watch it again and again over the next few weeks.Warning: there is some language that I wish was not included, some silly efforts at teenage kissing, and a dead body that keeps falling in the arms of the children, but in fairness, nothing outside the realm of a well-rounded pirates story.  We discussed the film afterwards with our son, and actually enjoyed the &#34;learning moments.&#34;  If you are extremely protective of your children, this may not be the film for you.  If you supervise your children through classic literature, science fiction, novels and history, then this may be an enjoyable vacation into the fantastic.	5.0	Good scary fun for the family.	2013-06-14	0	0	0

I still remember watching this in the theatres when it came out and getting this DVD brings those memories back alive.The story is about a group of middle class families and their kids who live near the boon docks of the citybut now the families homes face foreclosure.The kids who don't want to leave find a map hidden in one of the kids home attic to a pirates treasure hidden somewhere near the town and deciding to have at least on adventure or as they call it a last Goonie adventure to try and find the treasure.Along the way they will have a run in with an escaped family of criminals who have hidden out in the towns abandoned shack near the ocean and unfortunately the entrance to the pirates cave the Goonies need to get into.This is one of the great 80's movie I loved,grew up with,and still remember lovingly to this day for those who grew up in the 80's definitelybuy this and for those who are looking for a great family,funny,action adventure movie highly recommended...	5.0	Great 80's Nostalgic Movie	2007-08-11	0	0	0

If you haven't seen this (and I don't know how that could have happened) share it with the kids or grandkids cause it's great fun with a wonderfull cast that Donner really knew how to draw out!  Anne Ramsey hit the jackpot late in life with this and Throw Mama From The Train...and then passed on...so this and Mama are the only two roles you can really share her with your family from.  With Spielberg producing, Chris Columbus writing and Richard Donner directing it really is quintessentialfamily entertainment and features some child actors you may have heard of: Josh Brolin, Sean Astin and Corey Feldman among others.  It's coming out the same week as the fourth Pirates movie so get them both and make a double feature out of it.

The video commentary with the stars of the film as adults is worth the price of admission on it's own.  Better still you get a beautiful widescreen transfer of a great 80's film.  The Goonies is a great adventure movie that didn't find it's audience until video - so this edition allows for something more akin to the theatrical experience than most have had before.

It is a mini movie about 15 minutes long and not included in her Video collection DVD.  It has all the old wrestlers like Captain Lou Albano , Andre the Giant, Iron Sheak, and Roudy Rod Piper.  It is very comical ond you see her personality break out.  Besides the hard to find video.  I was surpised to see a great movie which everyone knows is a classic.

I re-watched it now with my kids, and it is reminiscent of Indiana Jones or possibly National Treasure, but with kids as the protagonists.  It is rated PG for some juvenile humor at the beginning (which mostly went over the kids heads), and a couple of scary places.  It was still enjoyable for me, and the kids all gave it a thumbs up.	5.0	Goonies	2008-06-26	2	1	1

The music is great.  The plot is (though not realistic) superior to most treasure hunt movies.  The characters are fun and involving.  Great directing, great booby traps Indiana Jones would have a hard time escaping.  A fantastic film.If you're looking for an exciting, action packed adventure movie anyone who is or ever was 12 years old would love, this is it.  I used to have it on tape when I was a kid, but it was played over and over so many times that it had to be thrown away.  Ah, but that will never happen with the DVD.	5.0	Finally!	2001-08-22	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	"""The Goonies"" has everything--drama and comedy--that will appeal to everyone--child and adult. The performances by Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, et al., are as professional as those by the adult actors, and that is much to director Donner's credit. In the extras on the dvd, the now-grown actors comfortably and with a good deal of comeraderie discuss their experiences making the film. This bond must have been there three decades ago for Donner to have elicited such performances from the kids. As you can tell, for me, the pleasure of ""The Goonies"" is watching a group of child actors enjoy themselves as they perform.The other 800+ reviews will tell you about the plot which I won't mention. Well, okay, that's not entirely true. There are individual scenes that will forever be with me: Chunk's confession, Data's entry into the film, the body in the freezer, etc. The parts are as good as the whole, and that's a rare achievement.Beside the commentary by the actors and Donner, the Cyndi Lauper videos are a hoot.

Those who own the video version should buy the DVD, you are missing out.  Of course there are deleted scenes, including the convenience store and octopus scene, all of which I had never seen but heard about for years and they are great.  There's also a very cool commentary with Dick Donner and all of the Goonie kids, which thumbnails the movie and shows all of them together at various point in the movie.  It's strange seeing how different they look, yet still the same.  There is also the Cindy Lauper music video &quot;Good Enough&quot; with the Goonies, Steven Spielberg, and several old WWF wrestlers (Capt. Lou Albano, Roddy Piper, Iron Shiek, Nikoli Volkoff, Fred Blassie, and Andre the Giant) as well as the theatrical trailer and original behind-the-scenes documentary, all of which I had  never seen before.  The picture is finally widescreen (anamorphic, woohoo!) and the 5.1 sound is very good.  All in all, this DVD is a great addition to any library and a must for nay Goonie fan.	5.0	Junior Jerk Alert!	2001-08-23	2	1	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A22DQQX59DPKKY	Ryan R Nothnagel	Anybody who was growing up in the 80's understands the greatness of this movie.  Who could forget Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Chunk, Data, Sloth, and the Fratelli's.  I think the one thing that makes this movie the most memorable is the great music.  Let's get serious, Cyndi Lauper was a poster child for the 80's and even though overall her music bites, it fit perfectly into the movie.  Although the movie does have some of it's cheesy moments, overall it is a good representation of that era.(...)This DVD brings back all of the memories of seeing the movie in the theater, especially with the cutscenes and the unforgetable octopus scene.  The only real disappointment is that Spielberg didn't integrate the cutscenes right into the movie like they did with Superman.  Oh well, it is better than nothing. If you have a DVD player but not this movie, get it.  You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Relive the 80's with this classic hit	2001-10-22	0	0	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A13OMT8D4GPIBV	Ryan Rogers	The Goonies, written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner, is a wonderful adventure story.  If you haven't seen it I won't go into it too far, but it's about four friends, accompanied by one's brother and his friends on a trip to find a Pirate's gold.Quite wonderful.  This andStand By Me (Special Edition)are the essential children's 80's movies that everone should see.  Magical.As this is only a rerelease of the earlier version the features are the same.Highly recommended.	5.0	An Absolute Treasure	2007-10-08	0	0	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A37S3ACL57LN62	"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra"""	"Before I had a DVD player, I heard about the release of this excellent film on DVD. I had to have it when I discovered it included a commentary featuring all of the Goonies with the director. I begged and pleaded with my parents to get a DVD player so I could see it, and finally, my wish was granted.How could I be disappointed? The movie is fabulous. It is an adventure story and a teen movie mixed into one; it covers the coming of age theme and finding buried treasure at the same time. I know what you're thinking: ""Rubies, and emeralds... and diamonds?"" Yes! A group of kids who call themselve ""The Goonies"" are facing their last days in Astoria, Oregon. Their homes are being taken from them by a rich family who wants to extend their country club over the properties. Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brandon Walsh (Josh Brolin) are brooding in their home when Mouth (Corey Feldman), Chunk (Jeff Cohen), and Data (Ke Huy Quan) drop by. In their boredom, they decide to explore Mikey's dad's attic where he keeps all of the rejected museum items. There, they find a map showing where the kids can find pirate One Eyed Willie's buried treasure on the coast. Fueled by boredom and a need for money, the kids set out to find it. Brand tries to stop the boys, but consents to go along on the adventure when they meet up with Andie (Kerri Green) and Steph (Martha Plimpton). However, they run into trouble when they find that the place where the treasure is buried is also the hideout of the Fratellis, a group of murderous criminals. Filled with great scenes and great lines, (""I smell ice cream,"" ""That's my mom's most favorite piece,"" ""I'm setting booty traps!"") you'll find yourself quoting this film and talking about it with everyone. It appeals to young and old alike.The extra features are great. Besides the commentary which adds a lot of insight into the hijinx behind the scenes, there are both parts of the Cindi Lauper ""Goonies R Good Enough"" music video, a short featurette with behind the scenes information, and three deleted scenes including the famed octopus scene. Even the main menu is beautifully done.I paid significantly more for this DVD than it is being listed for here, and it was worth what I paid for it and more. Why not take advantage of a great movie with great extras for a great price? You'd be dumb if you didn't!"	5.0	Goonies on DVD!	2007-10-21	24	21	3

I thought I was too old for kiddy films anymore, but after seeing this, I'm rethinking that thought! The Goonies is a hilarious, cute, and attention-grabbing movie. The plot is an age old story: a few hardy boy type kids on a treasure hunt. Incorporated into the film is a little bit of romance, a little bit of terror, and a whole lot of adventure! After seeing this film i wanted to be a goony too and go on adventures with Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, Brand, Andy, and Stef.

The story is a typical kids save the day looking for lost treasure.  The acting is good and the story is well presented, but it is the gimmicks and the eye candy which draw me into the tale.

More than that I'm obsessed with Special Edition DVDs - especially ones with Making of Featurettes.  Even further, the Goonies is awesome.  On to the reviewing.  On this DVD you will find a fabulous cast commentary.  The reason it is fabulous is because the ENTIRE cast is there (along with Dick Donner) and they're all spectacularly grown up.  Corey Feldman is loud and obnoxious and Sean Astin never gets his message out to Cyndi Lauper, but that's why I love them.  Also included is a Making of featurette from the eighties.  There's behind the scenes stuff and it is absolutely fantastic.  Last but not least the *entire* Cyndi Lauper video for 'Goonies R Good Enough' is on there.  All 11 minutes.  I highly suggest you go buy this DVD - RIGHT NOW.	5.0	This DVD is awesome.	2002-03-13	0	0	0

When neighborhood friends smart aleck Mouth (COREY FELDMAN), complusive eater Chunk (JEFF COHEN) and gadget inventor Data (KE HUY QUAN), dedide to drop in for a visit they take a little stroll up in Mr. Walsh's attic and discover a three hundred year old treasure map made by a legendary pirate known as &quot;One Eyed&quot; Willie. Mikey knows the story so well he even recities about the events that led to a battle a long time ago.From there this group called &quot;THE GOONIES&quot; later joined by Cheerleader Andy (KERRI GREEN)and Fishergirl Stef (MARTHA PLIMPTON) set out to Cannon Beach and embark on an adventure beyond their wildest imagination: their quest to find hidden treasure in need to save thier neighborhood and buy back their homes to stop a foreclosure from demolishing not only thier houses, but the Goondocks as well.But it won't be easy, they're are two things that stand in their way which are: The Deadly Booby Traps and The Villianous Criminal Family trio called &quot;The Fratellis&quot; (ANNE RAMSEY, ROBERT DAVI and JOE PANTOLIANO). So now The Goonies must make it past the traps, solve the riddles and outwit The Fratellis in a game of Cats and Mouses in a race against time to save the Goondocks.I have no memory of how I first fell in love with this classic, but I do know that it's the best Story from Steven Spielberg ever seen.P.S.

The action will keep you on the edge of your seat as the Goonies try and escape the silly evil criminals, the Fatelli's.  This great dvd also includes the music video with Cyndi Lauper, which is an adventure in itself because all the Goonies appear in this great little video too.  Also if you are the fan of the robotice octopus, well you will be watching it over and over 'cause it is just one of the three missing edited scenes that you will get.  The only downside is that you can't watch the whole movie with the edited scenes, but other than that, this movie should be a part of your collection! :0)	5.0	Goonies to their entirety!	2001-09-22	1	1	0

As an adult, I was very disappointed in the awful language in this movie.  I don't want my kids watching this.  Also, one of the brothers taunts the other by calling him ""adopted"" (which he isn't).  It's just meant as an insult, which is a really terrible thing to be showing to children.

This is one of the best kids movies of all time because for one thing it doesnt talk down to it's audience the way so many other kids movies do.  It has a fun plot to it as well as Corey Feldman.  I have introduced my niece and my nephews to this movie and they just love even though the movie is nearly twenty years old.  I also loved the extras that came with this DVD as well.  It had the classic Cyndi Lauper music video which is a fun one to watch if you are a wrestling fan.  I also loved the fact that it also show the kids all grown up.

It is rated PG, but that rating from the mid-1980sdoesn't compare to PG movies these days. In 2005, this movie would be rated PG-13,with clarifications about the language, among other elements where parental guidance would be suggested. I remember the movie fondly when I saw it myself in the theaterwhen I was 27 years old. But I would not want to hear kids (meaning those in the basicgrade-school age) talking with this kind of language."	2.0	Goonies - a parent review - not for kids	2005-12-29	38	12	26

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1CJ2SOEBZTGG7	Special Features Specialist	(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to the DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary:  Good, if perhaps a little too crowded.  You have Donner along with all of the kids, and the presentation is a bit odd as well:  every now and then the film shrinks and the cast appears in a small box as they make their comments.  Fun to see them all grown up, but it's a bit chaotic, with Feldman fancying himself a comedian (at one point calling himself Corey HAIM), and He Quan utters maybe ten words through the whole thing.Deleted Scenes:  A number to choose from, but only for rabid fans looking for ANYTHING new to savor.  Otherwise needless moments that deserved to be axed.Behind the Scenes:  Nice featurette of on-set antics is fun.Music Video:  Cyndi Lw-ah-puh's silly contribution to the film features nothing from the film but wrestlers(??) and other nonsense instead.Overall:  Longtime fans should not go away hungry after the decent amount of work put into this.	4.0	Plenty to chew on.............	2003-10-18	2	1	1

This will be shown to my grandkids, and I will enjoy it then. For those who do not like this movie for its' content...you have that right...but still, I feel sorry for you. Where is the kid in you? Peace be with you always. THE GOONIES ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5.0	WOW!	2011-02-07	1	1	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A21XBPZCLM2JJU	Steve Feldman	Mean-spirited flop of what should have been an enjoyable adventure movie.  Too many screaming adolescents running in no apparent direction other than to annoy.  I didn't care about any of the characters, their home situation, or the adventure. Too many sexual references for what I thought was a children's movie, I mean really, &#34;one eyed willie&#34;.  Who was this film for?  Definitely not for me and I cannot recommend to others.	2.0	Expected more from Spielberg	2013-12-17	2	0	2
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2ARRAMXWT83PT	Steven Adam Renkovish	"This has always been one of my favorite movies! It is a true classic, and I have seen it so many times that I have lost count. A bunch of kids go on a treasure hunt, with a bunch of bad guys on their tails. Great action-adventure film for all ages! If you haven't seen it, see it soon. I cannot wait for the DVD release, which contains deleted scenes, and a music video of the Cyndi Lauper song, ""Goonies R Good Enough"". It also contains a commentary track featuring a majority of the cast members! Goodie, goodie."	5.0	My childhood favorite!	2001-09-01	0	0	0
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3QPHD1P6TY7JE	Steven C Isaac	Aside from being one of my personal favorite movies of all time, this blu ray box set adds to the awesomeness that is The Goonies! The classic movie comes boxed with some really cool stuff so I'll discuss each item.The Goonies [Blu Ray] - Picture quality is amazing. Looks just as good as newer movies shot with HD cameras. None of that weird grainy looking snow that sometimes shows up (all depends on the film stock used in production). The sound isn't too shabby either. I don't notice a huge improvement with the audio from the dvd version, however it seems a little cleaner.The Goonies Board Game - Haven't played it but I opened the pieces and studied the rules a bit. Seems like a fun to-do on a rainy day kind of game.Empire Magazine 2oth Anniversary Article - Nifty little reprint simply updating what the original cast has been up to since the film was made.The Goonies Souvenir Magazine - 150 pages telling the story of how the movie was made, cast profiles, and lots of other fun stuff.Storyboards - Original Story board mini copies. Pretty neat to compare the boards to what eventually would come to screen.My only gripe is that the Blu Ray itself really has no new bonus features from that of the DVD. However, this set is a must have for any collection.	4.0	A Cinematic Treasure	2011-01-08	10	10	0

Just to see the truffle-shuffle is enough to buy this movie.  I'd give this movie a 5 stars, but I do have one problem  with it.  I think that there is a part missing.  Ok...I remember when the  Goonies were underground, Data had to fight a squid.  He fell through the  ground and found this squid.  But this tape does not have that part.  (just  to prove that the squid exists) In the end of the movie when the police  were questioning the kids, Data made a remark about &quot;the squid.&quot;  If this tape had that part, it'd get a 5.  Other then that, Goonies is  great	4.0	This is a classic 80's movie	2000-03-10	1	0	1
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2LHJMZMU374OV	"""stiv_rex"""	It's about time they released this to DVD. I've watched my VHS tape so many times it looks like the whole movie is set in a cloud.  Other reviews have mentioned the octopus scene, which they MUST include as a special feature, but there were 2 other scenes that didn't make it to the final cut.  There is a scene based in a local/corner/grocery store with mouth, data, mikey, chunk and I think thats it, (only seen it once).  There is another version of the introduction also, which is longer, and shows more car chase and more of the locals, i.e. cheerleaders, football team, mikey, chunk, data, mouth...  These two additions and the octopus were only shown on fox, when goonies made it's T.V. debut, and subsequent tv showings have not included the scenes, (?) I don't have any idea why not. I'm a huge fan of this movie, it has never failed to entertain me. I expect that they will include lots of fun special features, despite the fact that this is a warner brothers release. *W.Bro's usually don't include any special features on their older movies, from the mid 80's or earlier. But whatever the case, this is a must have, good for EVERYONE.	5.0	Its About Time!	2001-05-28	8	7	1

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A26CKSAHLJAKK4	Stuart E. Brinkley	Many people think of the Goonies with nostalgic memories of the 80s.  This movie really is more than that, though it is unmistakably a product of that decade.  This movie does stand the test of time.  It is a fun adventure.  The kind we all wished we could have had when we were kids.  The filming location in Oregon depicts the lush lands of the Pacific Northwest and sets a great starting point for the burgeoning young adults on a mission to save their homes.  The young actors do a good job of making their characters three dimensional and the adult actors (particularly the Fratellis) really round out the ensemble.  You may even recognize the main character Mikey as Sean Astin from The Lord of the Rings films or Rudy and Josh Brolin from No Country for Old Men.  This is a great one for family movie night.  One note, that though the film is rated PG, there is a quick slip of language at one point in the film and some younger children might find one of the characters a little scary.	4.0	Family Fun	2013-05-25	0	0	0

Heck, I continue to love it even to this day.  It's about a group of kids that find a treasure map in an attic full of old pirate antiques.  A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts.  The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail.  The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film."	5.0	Indiana Jones for Kids	2007-01-12	0	0	0

The first of their problems was that the (Statue) and the Rosalita (Mouth speaking spanish) scenes were too vulgar for a kids movie!  KIDS HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT SOMETIMES YOU DUMMIES!  Atleast their is genuine comedy in this film.  If you don't like it then go and watch Pokemon and a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen film and be enlightened by all their cheesiness!THE 2ND Thing people critisized was the fact that any kid would have ditched out on the adventure once that they saw that there was a way out through the well.  DIDN'T YOU PEOPLE EVEN WATCH THE FILM!  MIKE QUOTES, &quot;THE NEXT TIME YOU TAKE A TEST IT WILL BE IN SOME OTHER SCHOOL, THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE SKY IT WILL BE OVER A DIFFERENT TOWN, DOWN HERE IT'S OUR TIME!!!&quot;  THESE KIDS WERE HEROES, if any of you viewers would have bailed out in that situation then I KNOW that you PROBABLY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AT MANY THINGS IN LIFE DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SCARED!The last thing is the fact that Data  mentions the Octopuss scene even after it was cut out of the film!  DO YOU THINK RICHARD DONNER, SPEILBERG, AND CHRIS COLUMBUS ARE THAT STUPID!  They knew they had a cult hit on their hands when they put out this film, and they knew everyone would be wondering about the octopuss, and they knew that everyone would pay more money one day to see the deleted scenes because of that (Hence the DVD VERSION, and previously when it was released on the Disney Channel in '87 with the deleted scenes).  THE GOONIES R NOT JUST GOOD ENOUGH, THEY WERE THE BEST.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A2SAD76VXXUXO5	"the_goonies_attic ""the_goonies_attic"""	"""The Goonies"" is my favorite movie of all time. I have to bite my tongue whenever I watch it with anybody because I can literally quote the movie verbatim. I've considered doing a one person stage screen play, but I just can't seem to get that Truffel Shuffel move down. hehe  Ever since I saw this movie as a kid, it has taken ahold of my imagination and never let go. I have lost count of how many times I've seen The Goonies now, but somehow, I NEVER get tired of watching the film. It still amazes me how this '80s movie has stood the test of time; albeit the imagination and sheer genius of Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg. Did you know that there was a 20th Anniversary celebration gathering of fans from all over the world back in 2005? They all met in Astoria, Oregon; where The Goonies was filmed back in 1985. Jeff Cohen (Chunk) and Sean Astin (Mikey/Frodo) even showed up for the event. Correy Feldman showed up a few days after the official event was over as well. It has been long rumored that the sequal to The Goonies is in the works, but unfortunatly, it seems that Warner Brothers has killed all hopes and will not relinquish the rights to Donner and Speilberg! Talk about a huge mistake- JERK ALERT; seems that WB has ridden up Troy's Bucket. I could go on and on about this movie, but instead I will elaborate on another Goonies film subject.. the pop soundtrack and the film score.....""The Goonies"" pop soundtrack capures the fun-loving decade of the '80s and listening to these songs makes various scenes from the movie come to mind in vivid detail. My favorite track off the CD is probably REO Speedwagon's ""Wherever You're Goin' (It's Alright)"". I also quite like Philip Bailey's ""Love Is Alive"" because that song played during the part in the movie where Troy catapults Brand off the side of the cliff in that little girl's, pink, training bike. Classic! Who could forget Cyndi Lauper's ""The Goonies 'R Good Enough"" track; not me. I love this song as well, and it brings back some incredible memories of the '80s and from this movie specifically.NOW.. to address the film score controversy.. There is some debate to whether or not the entire film score was ever released the UNITED STATES. Many say it was simply a bootleg that got around in small circles. (Go to soundtrack.com to learn more about the film score.) That said, I DO know, however, that the film score WAS recorded as a 'world premier recording' on the CD, ""The Best Of Adventure"". I have this cd, and the Goonies score on it is, quite simply, AMAZING! I'm not kidding, when I played it for the first time, I actually teared up. So nostalgic and beautiful. The recording on this CD is almost 19 minutes long; it was recorded by the City of Prague Philharmonic. This is the ONLY legitimate cd that the entire Goonies film score was ever released on; the booklet in this CD, ""Best of Adventure"" also confirms that the recording is a 'world premier' for the Dave Grusin Goonies film score.There are bootlegs being circulated with The Goonies film score on it on eBay. Some of these pirated CD's have so called 'previously unreleased' tracks from the film. These eBay sellers blatantly lie and trick and try to pass these cd's off as original 'imports' from Japan etc. Some people will believe anything, so I am here to set the record straight and tell you the truth. I have even found that one eBay seller from California has gone as far as changing his user ID three times to try to get away with selling a slick looking bootleg. This particular pirated CD is a 2 'gold' CD Goonies Dave Grusin film score that also has a so called gold coin prop replica and two bumper sticker decals along with the pirated music. I am keeping a record of what he has been up to. As an AVID official Goonies collector, eBay seller and also a professional Graphic Designer, I hate to see people getting ripped off by greedy liars who know Photoshop too well and who visit Knikos too often. I could go on about exactly how these bootlegs were constructed and believe me I could whip up an exact repliac within a day.. yup, even down to the printed on gold discs, 'high quality' decals, 'unreleased tracks', photo booklet and the gold coin replica. Anyways, consider this information as a buyer beware, word to the wise, warning. All cd's other than Best of Adventure with The Goonies film score are pirated. So there is no confusion, there IS a legitimate Japanese POP soundtrack import, which you can see from the Amazon picture above, but there is NO such thing as a Japanese film score CD or any other film score CD other than ""Best Of Adventure"".Who knows if the entire score will ever officially be released in the USA as well, but, in my opinion, to have found the ""Best Of Adventure"" cd is even better than finding One Eyed Willie's rich stuff. While I think of it, who knows whether Warner Brothers will FINALLY let Richard Donner and Steven Spielberg make an amazing sequal to The Goonies. All of the stars are up for it as well, but NOOO, Warner Brothers had to go and screw it up! (Okay, enough stealing Mouth's lines). haha.I really feel that, in order to get the film score released officially in the USA, and also in order to get the sequal made (before everybody starts looking like One Eyed Willie) is THE PEOPLE. The people like us who love this movie and who dream BIG. Like Mikey said, it's OUR time down here; so start writing, Warner Brothers, people; let your voices be heard. It's our time..

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1GS3PS6SPZGQX	"The Voice of Reason ""the-voice-of-reason"""	but this movie was way too corny for my tastes. This movie managed to use every single clich&eacute; that ever existed. This ranges from the group of misfits going on an adventure to save their home from evil corporate rich people to mobsters with guns to a pirate treasure cave filled with booby traps to a fat kid who saves the day to a disfigured grotesque monster suddenly gaining human knowledge and capabilities and rebelling against it's owners to love between two 13 year olds. The reason that I gave this movie two stars is because there are worse films than this one and one scene was funny.

If your kids don't read that fast, then you won't have a problem with one of the boys talking about sex toys being in the attic - he says it in Spanish, but it is close-captioned on the bottom of the screen.  There is also some other references to sex and some cursing.  So, if you can handle all of that (and fast-forward when appropriate), you can enjoy the rest of the movie.

They're never worth the extra cost. I didn't look hard at this Blu-ray release for that reason.Imagine my surprise when I got a huge box (beautiful & solidly made) with a mini magazine (that is actually interesting), a ""Where are they now?"" pamphlet, story boards (with corresponding photos from the movie, and a board game (I'll probably never even open), all for less than $20. Of course the day after I get it & watch it, Amazon posts for the pre-release of the disc-only version I would have bought (still happy with my purchase).The only thing that matters to me is the video & sound quality (not perfect, but some of the best for its age), but the rest will be a great bonus for collectors that love that kind of stuff. At least it stores everything in a box that looks good on my DVD shelf. It's a little over-sized, so it may not fit upright on shelves with little clearance over regular DVDs.If you like the Goonies, you should get this Blu-ray as it's never looked better. If you like all the collectibles, you'll hate missing out on this set.My favorite bonus on the disc is the Cindy Lauper music video. I love when the 'cliff-hanger' mentions MTV.

It's a timeless piece and stirs  up a whole range of emotions, running from family relationships, friends,  love, trust, loyalty and the discovery of what's to come in life.  It  renews parental beliefs in simple childhood dreams and reminds us to always  believe in each other.  &quot;Goonies never give up&quot;.....I am  purchasing another copy of this video since we seem to have lost our  original copy.

The actors do a reasonable job. It paces o.k. The sets were good to very good.The problems that make it average? Richard Donner's direction was average (it all seemed too cropped), the cinematography was poor, especially given the potential of the sets, the editing abysmal, and the sound/dialog was crap. If you're going to tell the story via action and dialog versus paced exposition, you might want the dialog to be front and center in the sound mix. When half the dialog is garbled, and no exposition, you're lost pretty quick, and the events that follow make little or no sense.In all the production was second rate considering the involvement of Donner and Spielberg. Basically what could have been a movie on the scale of a Back to the Future sunk to B-movie level. It was only saved by the story itself, and reasonably good acting. As it stands, I like the idea much more than the execution.	3.0	Passes a Sunday reasonably well....	2007-04-23	3	2	1

Sometimes all you need is a giant drooling man to really put things into perspective for you. While the world upstairs is dealing with the day to day rig-a-ma-roll, it's good to know that it's our time down here; where slick shoes and girly bikes are socially acceptable ways of transportation.

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	AMB2Z4FMDBWQY	"VIDFAN ""specfellow"""	"I heard great things about this movie, so when I finally saw this I was glad I didn't see in the theater. In fact, I didn't miss anything. The story is predictable and the kids chatter so much it was annoying. The adult villains, as usual, are comic caricatures that nobody could possibly be afraid of. No attempt is made to reflect the reality of real kids' lives, and everything, from the Sloth creature to the treasure hunt, is so rooted in fantasyland that you don't believe that any of it could happen in real life. In other words, the film is nothing more than an amusement park ride or a Rube Goldberg project (which it shows again and again). It operates on a purely superficial level - you suspend disbelief and have to ignore all the ridiculous things in it too make it work.I felt many scenes were forced - all the kids' expressions didn't seem natural, but fake, everything was ""on cue""; their laughter or fearful expressions didn't seem inspired or spontaenous. I believe the curse words were put there in a desperate attempt to make the kids sound real, but they just sounded Hollywoodized.In comparison, take a look at the Disney live action kids films of the 70s, like ""Candleshoe"" and ""Escape to Witch Mountain."" Fewer special effects, a bit dated, no curse words, but genuinely moving as well as exciting and the kids were always believable. As it was, this film left me cold. I think the Chinese kid's bag of gadgets represents what this film is all about - a bunch of gags and tricks, but after the magic act's over, you're bored and want to go home."	2.0	Overrated, cliched and predictable - Disney did it better!	2010-06-20	16	2	14

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1SRVH7M53DYL1	"Vindictive Vinny ""CreepyKookySpooky"""	As with all others from my generation of 80's kids, I Love this movie. This is one of THE most iconic films for both teens and younger kids, and I can only imagine that it will be clear and amazing on Bul-ray. Additionally, all these bonus goodies are fantastic for die-hard collectors, but not really necessary if you simply wish to just let the movie serve as all the awesomeness you need. The one thing I aboslutely must discredit this release for, even in spite of giving it 5 stars (solely for the movie and bonus features, as they are the same as the 2001 release), is the lame cover picture. First off, why is it that studios feel the need to change the original artwork that served as the Theatrical Release poster!? DVD releases make these cheesy cover pictures thinking they are fresh and new marketable ideas that are going to work at selling the movie. Well newsflash, this movie has a cult following (myself included) that will love the movie no matter what, but would prefer that it at least show a picture of the cast. The 2001 release wasn't a drastic deviation of the formula used for the original, but this cover is cheesy and I hate it.Lastly, what would make this release really bitchin', is to include the out-of-print soundtrack. Seems like a no brainer, even if you omit a few songs, just include the best songs. I own the soundtrack personally (actually I own 3, they're still available and cheap in Japan), but I'd like to see other fans get that little something extra instead of a board game many are unlikely to play. I'm just saying.	5.0	Goonies Never Say Die	2010-11-11	5	2	3

It was such a success, that I decided this time around to buy it for my own three year old. I figured he may be a little too young, but sometimes, for my own sake, I need to put on something different than the usual cast of cartoons. Within the first five minutes of the film, I thought I was in trouble when Chunk drops the S-H bomb, and my three year old instantly repeated it. At which point his mother yelled from the other room...  ""did he just say...?""  I quickly dodged that bullet though, and, am pleased to say, that the kid really dug the film.  As for me, I find this film to be as enjoyable now, as I ever have. I don't really know why for sure, but I always feel like I did the first time around (was probably seven or eight) digging this cool adventure, where little Mikey gets to make out with Andi. Oh yeah Andi. She could be part of my group of Goonies anyday...I'd be like ""F*** this inhaler!""The bonus features also include the two part video from Cyndi Lauper, which is absolutely a treat, ...even for the kids. It has a few of Cyndis wrestling buddies, Captain Lou, Roddy Piper, and Andre The Giant, as well as a few other familiar faces, in a fun, two part serial, Cyndi Lauper type twist on the Goonies story. Which, probably could have developed into a popular Saturday Morning cartoon if you ask me... Pretty cool.  I recommend this, again, for a good family viewing... just explain to your kids if they are real young, that Sloth is a good guy, and be sure to cuff the ears when Chunk spills his ICEE during the opening credits...

Watch it alone or watch it with your family, you will love it again and again!	5.0	An 80's classic!	2011-01-03	2	1	1
6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A1S56U8GV9C8F9	Wilson Smith	The Goonies DVD surpassed my expectations. Ranging from its easy-to-navigate 3-D menus to its extra features, this is certainly one of the most well-realized DVD's yet. The bonus features themselves make up for the long delay in its release. The commentary was undoubtedly the best part of the DVD: 17 years down the line, all seven main characters (&quot;Mikey&quot;, Sean Austin; &quot;Brad&quot;, Josh Brolin; &quot;Chunk&quot;, Jeff Cohen; &quot;Mouth&quot;, Cory Feldman; &quot;Andi&quot;, Kerri Green; &quot;Data&quot;, Ke Huy-Quan; &quot;Stef&quot;, Martha Plimpton; and the director &amp; producer of the film, Richard Donner) gather together and all sit viewing the film in a recording studio, reminiscing about their experience along the way. Most of the cast have changed beyond all recognition, as is evident by the brief &quot;hidden video treasures&quot; which are periodically shown throughout the film in its commentary-enabled mode. All four of the deleted scenes which were shown on the Disney Channel airing, but left out in the final cut, are included as &quot;outtakes&quot;, and high-quality ones at that. It would have been great if, as an extra option, they could be incorporated in the film, but perhaps that's asking a little too much. Both parts of Cyndi Lauper's video, directed by none other that Richard Donner, are included. Along with a trailer which conveys absolutely none of the film's sense of adventure and charm. And last but not least, a 7-minute behind-the-scenes &quot;Making of&quot; which is quite interesting. Speaking as a layman, I found the sound &amp; picture quality of the film absolutely extraordinary, given the time period when this film was made. There are very few negative aspects to this DVD; those there are range from the (minor) fact Warner Bros. opted for a cardboard snap case instead of the more traditional full-sleeve plastic case, to the more significant event of Sean Austin's mysterious &quot;walk-out&quot; in the middle of the commentary feature, to the (even more significant) fact that there weren't any bona fide &quot;outtakes&quot;, nor other unearthed scenes, beyond what was included on the uncut Disney Channel's airing. When all's said and done, nothing beyond a 2-Disc Criterion Edition, is good enough for this film.	5.0	The Culmination of All Things 80's	2001-08-23	3	3	0

6303212379	The Goonies (Clamshell) [VHS]	A3OI841P5R6FCH	Zagnorch	Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!'Late	4.0	I'm takin' 'em ALL back!	2002-08-22	5	2	3
