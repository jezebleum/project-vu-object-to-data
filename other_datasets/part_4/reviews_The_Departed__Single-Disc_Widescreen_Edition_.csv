B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZV5NGPANACNI		This is not a movie that I like at all. It having so many top billing actors probably should have been a clue, It made me sad to see some of my favorites looking so uncomfortable in their roles. I will not give names, because I have no intention of being mean. Here it is: For decades Hollywood was able to produce some really cool movies without resorting to such bad language fill-ins. They were able to direct scenes in a way that could keep an audience on the edge of their seat, without filming every little detail as though their prospective audience had no imagination.. They were able to make us laugh without language that seemed totally unnecessary.Of course, times have changed, and I understand this and do watch movies with what I think is unnecessarily fowl, but sometimes funny.  So, I do admit that an expression such as was seemingly the main essence of The Departed can be fitting, and even add something. Yet, such tactics have lost much of the initial affect.When Clark Gable Said that he did not &#34;give a damn,&#34; it created a wave of interest and made us laugh at the boldness of such a word as damn. What is there to surprise us now? Movies like the poorly marketed &#34;Instinct,&#34; the much criticized but enjoyed by many - &#34;A Beautiful Mind,&#34; the tame named  &#34;Heaven Knows Mr. Allison,&#34; or the unusual plot of &#34;Sixth Sense,&#34; held the interest of this writer. I left the theatre smiling. So, maybe I'm too reserved for &#34;The Departed,&#34; but the producer should be pleased that many enjoyed it enough to give it five stars,There was more, I also found this movie very disconnected and excessively violent. I did stop watching after giving it about 40 minutes to capture my interest. So, there you have it.	2.0	Not my favorite	2014-07-14	0	0	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AOS5RZYR5PLG5	1st Ammendment MF	"Upon viewing the film The Departed I was left with one impression;what was all the hype about.Now don't get me wrong it wasn't a bad movie not at all...just over-hyped.Not to draw comparisons to one of Scorcese's best movies but Goodfellas was his baby.Goodfellas was great because you want to see it again immediately after viewing it.The Departed...meh I really couldn't say i would care if I never saw it again.It had it's moments but they were fleeting and the ending fell flat on it's face with contrivances piling up faster than a freeway carwreck.The only scene for me that showed real vision and a bit of the old Scorcese flair was the demise of one of the peripheral character's plummeting off a rooftop right in front of Billy Costigan's(Leonardo DiCaprio's character) viewpoint.Other scenes went nowhere and even one moment of self concious irony occurs when Costigan says to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson in full on eyes V'ed snarling grimace JACK mode)  ""What the f*%& are we talking about"".The script needed tighting up and nowhere is it more apparent than in this revelatory scene.Scenes where Nicholson pours cocaine on two (I'm assuming) prostitutes and tells them to get numb from it just seems overindulgent and pointless.So in closing was the Departed a good film? yeah! Great film? No where close.Oscar for Scorcese? I'm afraid to say it but Goodfellas was his to win.Too bad a little film called The Silence of the Lambs was released the same year(IMHO Scorcese was robbed...while TSOTL might have been the better movie..and that's a stretch...no way was Jonathan Demme's vision even on par with Scorcese's to win the Oscar).Looks like Scorcese will win the lifetime achievement award when he's old and feeble...kinda like when  they shuffled out Robert Altman a year before he croaked.Unless Scorcese can deliver something on par with his greats than it appears the man from little Italy will always be chasing the impossible dream.This movie is not it!"	3.0	definitely not the best picture of the year	2007-02-18	11	3	8

Period.  A movie with old-timers like Sheen, Nicholson and Baldwin and in vogue faces like Damon, Wahlberg and Dicaprio will NOT fail to be well acted.  So hats off to those guys.  Great job, and frankly, I would have expected no less.So why the ""cheap tricks"" title, you ask?  Scorsese's method for manipulating our emotions and jarring his audience is reminiscent of the Hollywood flop ""Deep Blue Sea"" when the only redeeming quality of the movie was suddenly and needlessly snatched from our lives by the jaws of a great white.  [SPOILER FOLLOWS] No duh, Scorsese...if you kill the main character DEAD, the underdog - the guy we've been cheering for the whole time, without even one blood-gurgling last word, you WILL move your audience one way or another; it's no secret formula - it's a cheap trick.  It would have taken more talent..or simply more thought...to move your audience while maintaning some sense of justice, and I'm not talking about street justice or revenge.[END SPOILER]You wanna retell the story of some epic tragedy in history with an epic film?  Fine...make it unjust.  You wanna expose to the world the corruption of some trusted office for our enlightenment that it may never happen again?  Go ahead, make the violence and gore true to life.  But if you just want to entertain me with a movie about a single crooked cop and a crazy old mob leader in Boston, then at least make it just.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"In the mold of other gangster films, like 'Scarface' and 'Goodfellas,' Scorsese delivers more than a feather in his ample directing cap with his brilliant new movie, 'The Departed'.  Featuring an all-star cast, 'The Departed' hits the ground and never stops running.  Jack Nicholson is at his ruthless best as the Irish mafia figurehead, Costello.  Menacingly funny, he delivers one of his most unforgettable performances with the steely subtlety that has made him a legend.  Everyone else puts in their brawling best, especially Di Caprio as the tough, but nervous Billy Costigan, an undercover cop pretending to be Costello's prodigy hitman, and Mark Wahlberg as the tough as nails police administrator, Dignam.  And they deliver this masterpiece without needing any help from Joe Pesci or Robert DiNero.  Amazing!The movie starts us off with the ruthless Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the Italian head of Boston's Irish mafia.  Extorting money anywhere from local greasy spoons to government operations with sensitive weapons' information, Costello makes Don Carleone seem like Mr. Rogers.  We first witness a harrowing extortion scene at a neighborhood Boston restaurant during the sixties.  By sharing the extorted loot with a destitute young neighbor boy, Collin Sullivan, he takes upon him a future prodigy (Matt Damon).  In his pocket at the time of Sullivan's police academy graduation, Costello finds the perfect rat to work undercover in the Boston Police Department.  Sullivan proves to be a savvy informant, brilliantly juggling his responsibilities as a quick, ascending officer, while bailing out the Irish mafia via cell phone.  In the meantime, the police have their own well-disguised rat in Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who convincingly wins Costello over as another promising hitman.  Costigan finds it hard to stomach all the carnage this organized crime unit masters, and it is to everyone's credit that edgy seems to be a trite description for what Costigan witnesses.  (One particularly unnerving scene is when Costello shows Costigan a severed hand from a victim's body bag.)  How both rats tip-toe through their harrowing treason is one of the masterstrokes of playful suspense throughout this clever flick!  Ironically, police chief Oliver Queenan (Martin Mall) is characteristically clueless like most of the leaders when he says, ""We deal in deception. We don't deal in self-deception.""  There's a lot for both sides to figure out in the film's cat and mouse (rat!) equation.  The resolution of this twisty movie should all but satisfy even the hardest core Mafioso movie fans.Nicholson is unrelentingly as the silver-tongued devil, Costello.  And DiCaprio gives an inspired performance as the nerve-wracked, beleaguered Costigan.  Damon and Wahlberg have seldom been better as the tough-as-nails cops.  It is brilliant how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters intersect so long without crossing each other's paths.  Their dating interest is for a woman psychiatrist (Kristen Dalton) who brings both men together.  Not only effective as a plot device, it creates a fascinating tension to the movie.  Ironically, the plot is both complicated, yet easy to follow.  Unlike many similar interlocking plot stories, this one is intricate enough to be fascinating, while seldom taxing its audience.  The editing, which nowadays is taken for granted for slick professionalism, is just perfection.  How Scorsese cuts and focuses, then backs up makes frenetic a lame description.  The dialogue is intelligent: menacing, yet quick and witty.  Without spoiling the movie, the film seems to comment on the excess of rats everywhere, and what seems to be implied by the departed is the body of secrets they take with them to their graves. For all its suspense and hijinx, 'The Departed' is probably the most thoroughly entertaining gangster venue since 'Pulp Fiction'."	5.0	Ruthless and Relentless...You Dirty Rats!...

But this ending went out of it's way to be as unhappy as possible - so much so that it became unrealistic.  Think of the ""Goodfellas"" or ""Blow"" endings only with more dead people.  It almost seems as though there is no message at the end other than ""everyone dies on both sides of the law.""

For me, it's not.  It's more akin to Memento, or even The Sopranos--it holds your interest, a perfectly fine movie, but not likely to be watched repeatedly with pleasure.The acting--great.

I am SO GLAD I saw it!  You couldn't ask for a better cast.  After this, I want to see every movie Leonardo DeCaprio stars in!  I even went to see it a second time and am pre-ordering the DVD (and I very rarely ever buy DVDs!).  Others that I talked to that saw it thought it was gory, but I did not think it was that bad at all - and believe me, I am not one to watch gory movies!

Let me first say that I didn't dislike this movie, but I didn't LOVE it either. I think Mark Wahlberg was outstanding in this movie and hands down my favorite character. The problem that I did have was the fact that certain parts of the plot were not believable. Specifically the fact that Jack Nicholson's character couldn't figure out who the mole was AND the fact that there were numerous moles. I didn't buy it, hence my disappointment. But, if you have some time, I'd say watch it anyway.	3.0	Just good, not great	2007-07-07	6	3	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JIHQXQMSH4AR	A. Hay	If you are in the mood for one of the better crime/mob dramas that I have seen in a long time, then check out The Departed.  In the effort to destroy South Boston's Irish Mafia, the police send in an undercover agent.  Unbeknown to them the mob has infiltrated the police department.  This film, directed by Martin Scorsese was a multiple Oscar-winning crime thriller, and I would agree with them on this one.  Every member of the star-studded cast gives a faultless performance.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the undercover cop at his best, the mob kingpin is Jack Nicholson, and Matt Damon plays a career mob member turned cop.  The plot sounds simple and done that before, but this is a surprising movie with more twists, and suspense than you would expect.	4.0	Not Just Another Mob Film	2008-02-04	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3GI6DS6I474K8	"Alan Draven ""Dark Fiction Author"""	"I kid you not, this one delivers the goods and then some! The Departed is a remake of Infernal Affairs (2002), an excellent Hong Kong crime film. This is one of the rare times where a remake surpasses the original, actually improving on it. I love the way screenwriter Monahan adapted the script for Boston; it flows perfectly and makes all the sense in the world. Nicholson's character, Frank Costello, was modeled after James ""Whitey"" Bulger, the biggest gangster there ever was in Boston (still #2 on the FBI's most wanted list). A lot of what's going on is very plausible; after all, Scorsese is an expert on the subject, having grown in the mean streets of New York as a kid.I won't go over the details of the plot as I'm sure by now you know what the film's about (crook (Damon) graduates from police academy to infiltrate cops and cop (DiCaprio) passes for a crook to infiltrate crooks). Damon and DiCaprio give some of the best performances of their career. Nicholson is awesome as usual, but even better in the sense that he pushes the envelope and plays a character that is more than just Jack being Jack. Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin all turn in stellar performances. If you're a fan of Scorsese, by now you're familiar with his seventies selections for backgroung music; tradition he keeps here (plus a song from the Dropkick Murphys, ""I'm Shipping Up to Boston""). The cinematography is beautiful, as in all other Scorsese films. The editing is tight and the direction, well, it's Scorsese, so it's flawless, what did you expect?As for the special features disc, it kicks butt and takes names. Three very interesting documentaries (including Scorsese on Scorsese, an 85 minute sit-down with the man himself; worth the price of admission alone) and some deleted scenes. So if you're wondering whether you should spend the extra bucks for the 2-disc edition, go for it, it's well worth it.Not since Goodfellas has a Scorsese film been so powerful and so riveting. With its mix of ghoulish humor and excessive violence, The Departed is destined to become a crime classic, joining the ranks of the afore-mentioned Goodfellas, Godfather saga, Scarface, and Heat. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for, laddie? Get yourself a copy of this powerhouse of a movie. Come Oscar time, Marty deserves to get a little statuette at long last!"	5.0	Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!	2007-02-16	5	3	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TUZL12O7X1A9	Alexander G.	He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these &#34;godfathers&#34; is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us.	5.0	Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!	2014-04-08	0	0	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1P7TKDJ3KHLVS	"Alexis Carpio ""Movie Lover"""	*semi-spoiler, no real details about the ending, just the feel of itAnyone who is a fan of Scorsese's films owes it to themself to see this movie.  Nobody does a mob movie like him.  The Departed is excellent.  It's paced well, the acting is great, the violence isn't excessive (in my opinion, a lot of people mention how they don't like the violent ending but come on, its a mob movie).  DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson get top billing but everyone in this movie is wonderful.  It's great watching Nicholson get crazy and play his character a little over the top.  My personal favorite is Alec Baldwin in a small scene during which he's running a stake-out.  And speaking of DiCaprio, I'm not much of a fan of him, but under Scorsese's direction, I saw his character and not the actor.  The story is great, especially since it's set in a more modern time frame rather then back in the mobs heyday (like Goodfellas and Casino).  I could rant and rave for another fifty lines, but I wouldn't do the film justice just by speaking about it.  Scorsese and the film deserved the Oscars they won.	5.0	Classic Scorsese	2007-03-04	4	1	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3C6X0DAM87GN4	Alex Udvary	"After getting some uncalled for flack recently for his films ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" director Martin Scorsese returns to those gritty mean streets he seems to know oh so well. How odd it is then to find out that the film did not come from Scorsese's imagination. Instead it is a remake of the 2004 Hong Kong action/thriller ""Infernal Affairs"". But, that doesn't really matter because Scorsese takes the material and makes it his own.""The Departed"" is going to get some unfair comparisons with ""Infernal Affairs"" from devoted fans of the original. I never like to do that. I also don't like when people compare the book to the movie version. Both pieces of work exist within their own world. They are seperate from each other.Leonardo DiCaprio (the recent favorite of Scorsese, whom in my opinion needs to find a new muse already) plays Billy Costigan, who comes from a poor working class family that mostly consist of family member who were on the wrong side of the law (depending which side of the law you're on). He has managed though to work his way up and become a cop.Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, who appears to be the exact opposite. Sullivan is one of those people who probably got straight ""A's"", stayed at home and studied while you were out playing baseball and was a loner. He too has become a police officer who is well thought of and clearly on a successful path.These two characters never share a great amount of screentime together in ""The Departed"" but their impact on each other is apparent throughout the entire film.Costigan is told by one of his superior officers Oliver Queenam (Martin Sheen) that because of his background he is not really ""police material"". Queenam flat out tells him you will never make it as a cop. So Queenam tells Costigan he has a special assignment for him. He wants Costigan to go undercover and get into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) inner circle where the Boston Police have been trying to arrest him for years.""The Departed"" soon takes on one of Scorsese's favorite themes, childhood loyalty. Sullivan, back in his youth, became very friendly with Costello and now as a cop has turned into a crooker officer. How will the Boston police ever catch Costello?The performances in ""The Departed"" are all pitch perfect. DiCaprio and Damon, who get top billing, are not just the only two worth watching. Even supporting characters like the ones played by Alec Baldwin and just so it's not all all boy's show, Vera Farmiga as Madolyn are both enjoyable to watch. But, perhaps the most memorable performances is the one given by Jack Nicholson. Rarely has an actor relished playing a villian moreso. The sheer exuberance of his performance makes the screen come alive. This isn't the Jack of recent films like ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""About Schmidt"". Jack lets loose here and plays the role with the same spirit he did the Joker in ""Batman"". I would even go as far as saying every performance here deserves to get an Oscar nomination.Some people may ask is this film as good as Scorsese's other films? That's a stupid question. Who cares? It seems, according to the reviews and box-office numbers (this marks Scorsese's highest box-office debut) people are responding well to this film. It is a powerful, well made gangster film that is about more than violence. As I said it is about loyalty and who we choose to give that loyalty to. This is one of the best films of the year! In fact the movie is so good I'm sure Scorsese will lose another Oscar race, just as his best films always do.Bottom-line: One of the year's best films. ""The Departed"" finds Scorsese going back to the gritty mean streets of his past and makes this remake a work of his own. Every performance here deserves to get nominated."	4.0	Not A Departure For Scorsese	2006-10-18	223	165	58

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A288ADHGC6DG36	"Almost Departed ""Bekl"""	I am not a fan of DiCaprio, but I have to admit he was good in this movie; Matt Damon was great as well, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg not so much.I agree with the comment that there are some disturbing anti-black nuances at the start of the movie.The script has so many holes that I do not know where to start.The ending of the movie is pointless and begs a question; did Scorsese see this movie before he unleashed against the world?Can someone please tell me why Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) kill Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) in the end? It can't be vengeance since he is apparently a mole. What happened to the yellow envelope given by Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to the psychologist? How did the third mole know that Billy Costigan was the mole inside the mob and why didn't he tell Costello?I agree that Scorsese made a couple of good movies, but it's been downhill since then.I gave it two stars because I think that someone else may give it a single star and we can added it up.	2.0	Sucky Script!	2007-12-30	6	2	4
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1YWQAPZC9WC78	aloysius0302	I also caught The Departed for the first time on HBO, and, for the first time in my life, find myself feeling disappointed in a Scorsese film. I had read the rave reviews when it was released(and tonight i checked Rotten Tomatoes to  make sure I was recalling the hype correctly), and being a lifelong Scorsese fan, I anticipated a typically absorbing, emotionally involving, and thought provoking film experience. Sadly, the film failed to deliver in even a mild way. It wasn't that the plot was too complex to follow, not at all. The film lacked the verisimilitude and honest emotional core typical of Scorsese's work. At times it felt as if some young gun director was flailing about in a vain attempt to imitate Scorsese. Moreover, and I can't believe I'm writing this, it dragged in spots almost to the point of boredom (I found myself checking the clock several times, another first!!). Some reviewers had diplomatically noted that this was not one of Scorsese's  strongest efforts, and I have to strongly, if reluctantly agree. All in all, a sad day in my film watching career.	2.0	Disappointed	2007-11-10	11	5	6

The last 15 minutes is surprising but it doesn't make up for two hours of pain.  My wife and I watched it and she went to the kitchen several times. When I said I'd pause it she said, no, don't, I can see it from the kitchen.  Then I saw her baking and knew she wasn't interested.As I mentioned, you're not really prepared for the ending.  While a surprise, it also doesn't make a lot of sense.  It seems as if the writers knew the movies was slow going and decided to throw a monkey in the works.

I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung, Li Gong, and Ziyi Zhang. The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.	3.0	Not as good as the original	2007-02-26	13	2	11

It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground)The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.)The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement.The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group).It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off.The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama."	2.0	It was very good, but the ending left me unfulfilled	2007-02-02	3	2	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar the whole world felt he was owed in 2006 when he made this new age crime thriller.  I have never been a huge follower of Scorsese, but I must admit that in recent years I've come to appreciate some of his finer works and have come to see him for far more than just a `gangster' movie maker.  Scorsese actually has a slick resume filled with much more than `GoodFellas' and `Casino'.  While I don't think `The Departed' is his best work (neither is `GoodFellas' or `Casino' for that matter) I can say that I understand why he finally won that directing Oscar and can actually say that his win is justified, despite the fact that sympathy played heavily in his favor.Now, when I sat back to finally review this film I came to a major roadblock.  One of the most rewarding things about `The Departed' is that it is so unpredictable.  Its one biggest flaw (that sloppy ending) is also the films biggest selling point (totally mind blowing in the way it just sneaks up on you) and so reviewing the plot seemed almost pointless.I mean, what can I say without saying too much?Billy Costigan is a cop being placed undercover into crime boss Costello's mob.  Colin is one of Costello's men being placed undercover into the Boston police force.  Neither knows of the other's existence yet almost simultaneously become aware of the other and begin trying to sniff the other out.Along the way lots of people die.Instead of trying to analyze the plot (which I'm sure a lot of you who have yet to see this will thank me for in the long run) I'm going to tell you why this film is worth your time.  Martin Scorsese is a master of the lens and crafts a genuinely intriguing and breakneck paced thriller that never runs too long and never loses you.  Despite everything that gets thrown your way, the film is actually very easy to follow.  It also sports one of the best ensemble casts of that particular year (forget `Little Miss Sunshine').  Everyone involved is really at the top of their game.  Leonardo DiCaprio is stellar here, truly phenomenal, and delivers what may be his finest performance to date.  He is completely aware of what makes Billy so essential to the audience, creating a likable, understandable and identifiable character who is also exciting.  Matt Damon, an actor I am not always sold on, is flawless here.  He doesn't have the same energetic draw that DiCaprio has, but he manages to make his character just as engaging.  Jack Nicholson is `Jack', plain and simple, but who better to play `Jack' than Jack?  As far as the supporting players are concerned, you have wonderfully fleshed out performances from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin; not to mention the glorious Vera Farmiga.Everyone is great.So this brings me to the films drawback; the ending.  I'm not going to divulge anything vital, I promise, but I can't not write about why I can't stand behind this film all the way.  It's a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's exciting and interesting and engaging, but it lacks something crucial as it draws to a close.  The film just kind of falls apart very quickly.  There was so much time spent really fleshing out the films core that little to no attention was spent on fleshing out the films finale.  It just kind of...ends.  The ending appears almost thrown together haphazardly, and then the obviousness of the final shot was cringe inducing (why oh why did you do that Scorsese).  Up until the last ten minutes or so I was actually thinking this Oscar win was deserved, but there was so much more that could have and should have been done with the ending.It's rather sad really.Anyways, I cannot fault the film too much.  It succeeds in doing so much, and like I said, even though the films ending can be rendered a `flaw' it is also a HUGE selling point (you'll never see this one coming) so in the wise words of Benicio Del Toro, ""take the good."""	4.0	Sure, it gets a little sloppy in the end, but it still delivers a major wallop...	2009-06-10	2	1	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	I haven't seen a lot of Martin Scorsese films (there are a lot of crime films I need to go see), so I can't say whether or not this compares to his earlier works.  But I can say that The Departed is a great movie that is a must-see.Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is an Irish mob boss working in Boston.  He has been active for decades, and yet, the FBI and police can't seem to build a sufficient case against him to arrest him.  However, that hasn't stopped them from trying numerous times.  To keep himself safe and have an advantage over the cops, Costello takes one of his young proteges, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and has him enroll in the Massachussetts State Police Academy.  Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardi DiCaprio), a man whose entire family has been linked to crime in one way or another, also enrolls in the Academy so as to separate himself from his family and make a name for himself as a good man.  However, his background makes him perfect for an undercover assignment to infiltrate Costello's organization.The two men each keep their loyalties to their actual employers at great cost to themselves.  It immediately becomes apparent that Costello has a mole within the agency, and when Sullivan is asked to head the investigation into finding out the mole, he has to find the balance between showing progress and not revealing too much about himself.  Meanwhile, Costigan is in danger every day; if he were ever discovered by Costello, he would be killed, but he is also forced to participate in the criminal activities, and if he were arrested, the only two people who know he is actually a cop are his captain (Martin Sheen) and sergent (Mark Whalberg).  His handlers would bail him out, but his cover would be blown.One of the main themes of the film has to do with the duality of Costigan and Sullivan; each are posing as something they are not, and it is interesting to see how they handle their situations.  Sullivan is respected and is paid pretty well, though he is truly a criminal.  Meanwhile, Costigan is viewed as a criminal lowlife, even though he is really a good man sacrificing his life for the cause.  Costigan's situation takes its toll on him mentally, driving him to seek council from Marilyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), a psychologist who is dating Sullivan.Every cylinder is firing in this film; the actors all do a great job, the writing is superb, and the music is great (I love the use of the Dropkick Murphys).  The film deserves all the awards it has received and is nominated for, and hopefully, Scorsese will finally win the Best Director Oscar.	5.0	The Difference Between Cops and Criminals	2007-02-23	6	3	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13SPPHQ4LWP4F	Andrij W. Zip	There are things I liked about Martin Scorcese's The Departed - it's grittiness, the tough, Irish Boston atmosphere, the dialogue, most of the performances (particularly Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, DiCaprio and MATT DAMON) and the plot which, despite some holes, is engaging.  Having said all that, The Departed is good but far from great.  Why?  It's shallow, none of the characters have any real depth to them, it's flabby and bloated, Jack Nicholson is basically on over-the-top , one-dimensional cruise control, and the closing shot of the film with the rat is completely unnecessary and possibly one of the clumsiest attempts at symbolism I've ever seen in a film.  I also think the camera work was good, but wasn't up to par with Scorcese's previous work, and the quick editing bothered me after a while.  I think the most disappointing thing about the Departed is that after you finish it you're entertained but at the same time you're left feeling that the film should and could easily be a lot better than it is. 3 1/2 stars out of five.	4.0	Good but not great	2007-07-04	7	5	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2QHM5HBSIXRL4	Andy Orrock	I went into my viewing of 'The Departed' with more than a bit of cynicism.  Having seen the film 'The Departed' was based upon - the Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' - I was prepared to take a snobbish view that the original was far superior.  Adding to my skepticism was a neat little line I read in the press to the effect that Hollywood had just bestowed upon Martin Scorsese its Best Picture prize for what is, by most opinions, approximately Mr. Scorsese's sixth-best film.  [For instance, 'The Departed' could be the second-coming of the 'The Godfather' and in no way could it surpass the brilliance of Scorsese's 'Goodfellas.'  I hope there's more than a few voters now kicking themselves for casting their votes on 'Dances With Wolves' - a film that hasn't aged well at all, especially given Costner's post-Wolves car wreck of a career vs. Scorsese's decades-long brilliance.]Anyway, surprise, surprise:  'The Departed' is brilliant on its own merits.  It borrows from - but does not copy exactly - Alan Mak and Felix Chong's original conception.  The three things that make the 'The Departed' succeed are:1. Scorsese's uncompromising vision - 'Infernal Affairs' featured some some pulled punches: a fateful fall from a building ends with a bloodless, almost artful landing on a car roof; and the ending seems to have been crafted with a sequel in mind (and, indeed, 'Infernal Affairs' spawned a profitable trilogy).  No such pullback from Scorsese: the same fateful fall results in a shocking splatter of blood; and the film's brutal denouement - which ends quite differently from the original - lays waste to any possibility of a sequel.2. William Monahan's brilliant adaptation - His script mashes up the Mak/Chong 'Affairs' tale with elements of 'The Brothers Bulger.'  The result is a hand-in-glove fit for its Boston setting.  And, as a native Bostonian, I found most of the accents spot-on, led by locals Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon.3. The Damon/DiCaprio/Wahlberg triumvirate - These three guys are outstanding.  Damon continues to choose great roles and perform brilliantly in them.  He's the key to the film, having to sell the covert version himself both to his police superiors and the movie audience.  He goes for the full-out, Southie-bred Bostonian here.  It's an awesome portrayal.  For those who think that's not acting, compare him here vs. takes on Jason Bourne and Tom Ripley.  This guy is a force.  DiCaprio is his equal here, but the surprise here is Wahlberg.  His role simply didn't exist in 'Affairs.' It's a relatively small part, but Wahlberg completely steals every single second he's on the screen.  He deserved that Oscar nomination.	5.0	Scorsese's uncompromising vision; Monahan's brilliant adaptation of 'Infernal Affairs'	2007-04-21	5	4	1

"I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.The Departed takes much too long to get started. The first 45 minutes could be clipped down to 20 to improve pacing. The profanity was stunning. I'm not a prude, but after the first 20 minutes I thought about just turning it off.That's a shame, because the final 20 minutes of the film are fantastic - a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans. The camera work is good, and so is the acting. There were some plot holes that could have been filled had they focused on that, rather than winning the Guinness Book's record for using the ""f"" bomb.Jack Nicholson's character had the BEST lines, though. I got a good laugh out of several of them."	2.0	Lengthy, filled with profanity	2010-10-24	16	0	16

I liked it, my wife hated it. But overall, it is one of the better police action movies I have seen recently. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there were too many Hollywood actors trying on that Boston accent thing which triped me up a little, maybe if it had been filmed in New York or LA it would have been a little more genuine and believable.	4.0	Good action movie, suprising ending	2007-04-06	3	1	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8GPRV61UC71S	"Anita Kaul ""DON"""	In this flick, we have Scorsese going back to his traditional roots. The movie keeps you to the edge of your seat from the very first scene. The antipodal characterization of Costigan and Sullivan, played by Leonardo and Matt Damon, respectively, serves to be the template for the plot of the movie. The setting-up of the characters is very well done, but the real thrill starts when the two lead actors have to find each other out. DiCaprio's magnificent performance, along with equally admirable performances given by Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, and Vera Farmiga, this movie is a must see. Personally, I think it was Matt Damon's performance that had me. Coupled with Scorsese's poignant direction, this is definitely an Oscar contender. I loved it.	5.0	Another jewel in Scorsese's Crown	2007-01-28	3	2	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LKP6WPMP9UKX	Anna V. Carroll	From the number of comments, this obviously was a much-watched film. However, my 'take' on the film comes from a different perspective.  At 70, I am no longer a 'hot shot' reviewer with tons of expertise on what film was based on what other film or book. As I have not seen Infernal Affairs, I can only judge my reactions to what I saw.It is 4:24AM on a Sunday morning and I have just watched The Departed for the umpteenth time. Martin Scorsese's genius is written all over it. The dialog, contrary to another reviewer who says the script sucks, is as entertaining as any I've ever seen.  And, at my age, I've seen my share.The casting is spot-on. This is my all-time favorite Jack Nicholson film. I think Leo DiCaprio could walk through the scene nude and your eyes would stay glued to Jack's face. Well, OK. Maybe not. But he is just mesmerizing in every scene he's in.The photography is beautiful. Some scenes look staged, like Damon's apartment. It doesn't come off looking like a real apartment with the backdrop it has. It looks like a photograph of the area he supposedly lives in. The exteriors are gritty and authentic looking but there is so much action going on who is looking at buildings? The French restaurant scene does look like a back lot set, too.  Who cares?The banter between Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg is priceless. I felt sorry for the lone gal at the table as she listened to them curse each other flawlessly. So funny.You have read from the hundreds of reviews what the film was about, so I won't bore you with another explanation. I just find the story, the actors, and the great music, perfect from start to finish. I judge a film I watch on my computer by how many times I get up to go to the bathroom or to the kitchen. With The Departed I don't move! Even though I have seen it many times I still find something new and fresh every time I watch it.I am so happy I was born around the same time as Mr. Scorsese and was an adult when his first came out. Certainly the greatest mind the film industry has ever produced. Long may he reign.	5.0	NOT A FRAME WASTED	2013-01-06	2	1	1

If you read each and every one of those 1 star reviews, you will easily find 8 out of 10 complain that it is a ""ripoff"".  Just take this movie for what it is:  A remake of another movie.  Don't be close-minded and think this is going to be a shot-by-shot remake.The movie upon its opening starts pulling you in with layered characters, all of which lie or deceive each other in various ways.  From there the movie just flows.  You spend the movie growing and learning to like each character or hate each character for their own reasons.  By the time the movie begins to approach its climax, you believe you see where it's going when suddenly- bam!  The ending takes a twist that few stories would never dare to take.  From the acting of DiCaprio (whom I actually despised prior to watching this gem) to Nicholson to Damon and Wahlberg, all the roles are perfectly cast and acted out from beginning to end.Buy it.  Don't even think about it.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1534MBU6VJXYN	"Anthony Nasti ""Tony"""	"After venturing off into uncharted territories for his previos efforts (""Gangs Of New York"" and ""The Aviator""), legendary Martin Scorsese has returned to the genre that his suits his intense and unique style better than any other: crime.""The Departed"", based on an Asian thriller called ""Infernal Affairs"", is, simply put, a masterpiece. I'm not exagerrating when I say, that in almost all aspects, this is on level quality-wise with ""Goodfellas"".The film centers around an ongoing battle between the Irish mafia, led by the ruthlessly over the top Frank Costello (the one and only Jack Nicholson) and the Boston Police Department. Costello hatches a plan to infiltrate the department and hault their plans to take him down by having his young apprentice Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) pose as an officer. Sullivan will tip Costello off on attempts to bust him, allowing him to elude the law before they can touch him.What Costello and Sullivan don't know is the BPD has a little informant of their own: Billy Costigan (Leonaro DiCaprio), a kid who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks and didn't even finish training. Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the brash, explosive and often hilarious Officer Dignam (a scene stealing Mark Wahlberg) have Costigan go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang.At first, both sides' plans are working well. But soon, things begin to fall apart. Sullivan gets involved in a sensual affair with a smart and beautiful police shrink named Madolyn (the unknown Vera Farmiga, who holds her own incredibly well against such a talented cast, which causes him to question some of Frank's motives, while Costigan is rapidly closer to the edge. He knows Franks suspects that he's the rat, and he can't handle the pressure for much longer. All of these event lead to a shocking climax and an ending that will stay with you long after the movie is over.Overall, the film is a masterpiece. The plot flows seemlessly, never seeming dull or monotonous. The film is well written. The dialogue, which is often laced with profanity as well as hilarious quotes that Tommy DeVito from ""Goodfellas"" would be proud of, is incredibly natural.Scorsese really makes the tension of the film really come alive with the correct camera angles, songs (""Gimme Shelter"" suits the film perfectly) and score. This has always been a trademark of his movies, and he shows his talents with it here.But the main reason to see the film is for the acting. DiCaprio is spellbinding as Costigan, belying the character with a bristling intensity that he uses to great force throughout the film. I would be very surprised if he didn't at least got nominated for his role in this movie. He deserves to win. Damon is also pitch perfect in his portrayal of Sullivan. I never held him in high regard as an actor before this movie, but I left the movie with a greatly different opinion of him as actor. He imbues the character with the right mix of filth and charm. Nicholson portrays Costello as a profane, vile and godless man, leaving no stone unturned in his brutal physical as well as verbal attacks. Nicholson is cleary having a blast playing an over the top charactor that suits his one a of a kind acting talents perfectly. Sheen, Wahlberg (who flat-out deserves the nod for Best Supporting Actor), Anthony Anderson, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin (as an often hilarious profanity spewing head honcho of Damon's division) all deliver impeccable support. Only Scorsese can bring the best out of all these actors. He's easily the greatest living director of today's day and age.Overall, ""The Departed"" is a masterpiece through and through. It is a film I recommend to anyone with half decent taste in cinema, as only someone with the lowest standards of film viewing would not enjoy it."	5.0	Absolutely Incredible.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	"The Premise:The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Chinese film 'Infernal Affairs.' Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a young boy gets sucked into working for Boston Irish Mafia boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When he grows up, he ends up joining the State Police under Frank Costello's direction in order to be an inside man, or a rat, for the boss. Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in-turn, Costello gives Sullivan information to help him solve cases. He promotes quickly and ends up working for the State Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who's sole task is to bring down Frank Costello.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is also a State Policeman, or ""Statey,"" who's troubled past brings him to the attention of Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) who heads up the undercover division of the Boston Police overseen by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). Dignam and Queenan are convinced that Costigan's high intelligence combined with his dubious background make him unsuitable as a traditional cop, so they offer him a job as an off-the-books, deep cover agent meant to infiltrate Costello's gang.Things get hairy when Sullivan, now working for the SIU, learns with certainty that the police have an undercover cop infiltrated into Costello's gang. The police then begin to suspect Costello has a rat inside the force. Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force. The problem is he is the rat. Meanwhile, Costello has another job for Sullivan: find out who the undercover cop is! Dignam and Queenan know the only way they are going to find the rat is through Costigan who's life is becoming more dangerous by the second. Which of each other Sullivan or Costigan find out first is a deadman.Thoughts:The only two real flaws I found in Infernal Affairs were the scene direction and lack of character development. I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story. Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story. You get a much stronger feel for the characters. The story definately moves slower, but you never get bored during any scenes. As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well. Most of the time when a film touts such a list of screen icons, most of them have bit roles and barely make an impact on the film. Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history. Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is. Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him. You may even find yourself talking about his character more than any other after the film.The film is not perfect however. It does tend to feel a bit too long once you reach the third act, but not so much as to sway your overall feelings of the film. I knew and expected the film to be different from it's Chinese counterpart if simply for the fact that these are different societies and cultures we are talking about, however I didn't expect (and didn't approve of) how much The Departed would walk the lines of every idea being so black and white. In The Departed, good cops are good, and the bad cops are bad. Scorsese even makes a strong point never to show Costigan performing any truly bad deeds. Meanwhile Infernal Affairs makes a strong point to show shades of grey where neither cop was truly good and neither was truly bad. Instead, it focused on how each lived in their own hell and how it motivated their actions. The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a ""Hollywood Ending.""The Verdict:The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat. It's everything Miami Vice should have been. Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes. In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception. It may not be perfect, but damn is this one hell of a good film!"	5.0	The best crime drama since Heat!	2006-10-09	6	3	3

With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello.  The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement.Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development.

Everyone has a really, really foul mouth. Also, there's lots of blood. Not a movie you want to let your kids see.Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are two state police officers. One was actually planted in the police by a gangster (Jack Nicholson). The other goes undercover and goes to work for Nicholson. So they are both working for the police (one honestly, one not), and both working for Nicholson (one honestly, one not). They end up sharing a girlfriend, too.Nobody knows who is lying (they all are), nobody knows who is loyal to whom or what, and frankly, it's hard to care. I think it is entirely possible this whole thing was done to display the various uses of a cell phone to cops and criminals. Cell phones everywhere. Cell phones and guns.I give this one star, just for letting me look at two handsome young hunks, and because Jack Nicholson does a bad guy so well.

Is this his best movie in years and years?. I have no clue. Is it one of his best movies?. Couldn't tell you. What can I tell you?. Well, I can tell you that this is a fine, fine film done with such artistry and talent from Marty, as everyone calls him. I am not always an easy sell on crime/mobster type films, but you can't help but be intrigued by the magnitude of talent going into this, and the big acclaim that came upon it's release. The Departed may not be the best film ever made, but it's a great film, and the best film of the year. Surprising, twisty, and unrelentingly violent, It holds you rapt from start to finish. Jack Nicholson is mobster Frank Costello, who plants a mole in the Boston police force. This is up and comer Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon). The ppolice themselves have a mole to plant in Costello's group, Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio). The result is a tense and taut cat and mouse thriller as the two moles try to discover the other's identity. DiCaprio really starts to become an adult movie star here. This is the first time where he seems to not just be a kid. He is grown up, dark, and wonderful in the role. Damon keeps his cool throughout, but he is less showy and impressive. Jack. Where to start?. There is a bit of ""Jack"" here, but that's okay. He is always electrifying with whatever he does, and he takes hold of every scene he's in and doesn't let it, or you the viewer, go. He means business. Wahlberg is great in the role. At first, he is extremely unlikeable, but you like him as time goes on. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone all give stellar supporting performances. It runs on a bit long, and I wasn't totally satisfied with how certain things came to and end, but they are minor quibbles. The film is set in Boston, but I heard it was actually filmed in and around New York. Interesting. People talk about sloppy work here, but I can't find it. The film is done with delicate care and talent. It felt raw. It felt real. It was exciting, and it seems that no one is safe. It keeps you on your toes. The ongoing character development with Leo's character makes him the most interesting out of the bunch. The relationship between Jack and his mole and his new buddy(Leo), makes for some interesting storytelling and twists and turns. The characters are deep and fully fleshed out, the story keeps you interested, and the music used in the film and the score are perfect. All in all, it's a great film. While people continue to voice their thoughts on how this ranks in Scorsesse's roster of films, and how this was(or was not)his best film since whatever, all I can say is that this is a Scorsesse picture. And it's a damn good one."	5.0	Bloody In Beantown	2007-02-25	6	4	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	While I'm a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio as an actor, the main story of the Departed was pretty uninteresting overall (not to mention confusing).  I wasn't sure what was even happening half the time because of how clumsy the story rolled along with quick snapshots of storyline immediately leading into other short scenes.  The whole movie was created this way, almost appearing as a documentary.Furthermore, the Irish accents made it hard to understand what some of the people were even saying.  You have to know the Irish to understand some of the sentences and expressions that were used in this film.  I believe understanding the Irish way of life is extremely important in order to get what the movie is about.  If the story was maybe more focused instead of just going into the same confusing pattern of frequent short scenes all attached together in an attempt to make a BIG story, maybe I would have enjoyed the movie more.  Again, I can't say enough about Leonardo Dicaprio's performance.  He was excellent.  Unfortunately the story wasn't good or presented in an easy to understand manner to keep me interested.	3.0	weak crime thriller	2007-08-26	3	2	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A264Q1VUO96DWY	Ben Dover	I was a little lost at the end after seeing it at the theater, but watching it on DVD cleared up all my confusion. There's a lot of detail which can be a bit tricky the 1st time around. Having said that, it really is an excellent and engrossing and entertaining movie. All the actors did a great job - especially Leo & Damon. I usually can't stand Nicholson's hambone emoting but he was good in this part. His character was a composite of gang bosses Whitey Bulger, Jimmy Coonan and Joe Massino.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A34PAZQ73SL163	"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!"""	Well, I'm a Martin Scorsese fan today, I was one yesterday, and I will be one tomorrow. How astonishing it is that this auteur, so late in his career, continues to direct and create such top shelf productions like The Departed and Gangs of New York. Was Goodfellas his masterpiece? The simple fact is that we won't know until the day he retires.The Departed is both action picture and psychological drama. Damon and DiCaprio play characters who mirror one another yet whose separate, but dependent, interactions fuel the plot. Both actors give inspired performances, but when Jack Nicholson's Francis Costello is onscreen it is hard to focus on anything else. He's spectacular in this role; a role which perhaps he was born to play. One of The Departed's most intriguing sub-issues are the Satanic qualities of Costello who, in one segment, is shot at the theatre with goat-tee, wearing a purple coat, and appearing amidst a reddish background. It's a heckuva shot. The subtext definitely is provocative, but you will probably not think of that the first time you see The Departed. The action is so intense that it is a challenge to get beyond thinking about what will happen next. This film represents more brilliant work from the most brilliant man in Hollywood.	5.0	Scorsese, Genius Unbound.	2007-09-28	7	2	5
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2809U2S14N0K1	BernardZ	I did like the acting. In particular I thought that Jack Nicholson was good.It had many interesting twists. Although I did think that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio looked too close so it was hard to tell them apart. I know it was purposely done  but I think it did cause some confusion.My main criticism was the ending which did not make sense. With everyone dying, I found it hard to believe that Matt Damon could come up with a credible story to get him off the hook. If the police think that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good guy who did the shooting that killed all those people. Then Matt Damon getting shot at the end in a scene that made even less sense.Still it was a decent movie.	4.0	A decent mob movie	2007-03-21	5	2	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3OQZ3XPJJJMHT	"Biletnikoff ""DealyPlaza"""	"This is an entertaining movie but nothing new. I felt like there were two different movies going on at the same time. DiCaprio's and Damon's performances are almost over-rought compared to Nicholson's goofy, almost slapstick one which is distracting at times. Alec Baldwin is over the top as well and everyone sounds like a bad Kennedy impersonator. It makes more sense when you understand that the movie is based on a Hong Kong exploitation film but that ""dumbing down"" of the American form is not something this viewer welcomes. The plot is a simple reworking of that movie ""Face Off"" from a few years ago. Everything and everyone is a blast of machismo and bravado which is ultimately funny because Damon's character turns out to be a ""closeted"" homosexual. There is always the ever present Scorcese signature quick cuts and slo-mo with The Rolling Stones music in the background. As always there is lots of ironic violence and reaction to violence. I don't mind the homage to the silent era of using the opening diaphragm on Damon the ""rat"" linked to the closing on the real rat but it's funny reading some people's reviews on how they don't understand nor appreciate such simple devices. I think it is time for Marty to move on or perhaps a Russian mob movie? No thanks. Watch this movie twice and you will wonder why you did."	2.0	Entertaining but Over-hyped movie.	2007-02-12	13	3	10

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KUEXN9M9FOMH	billy	After watching The Departed I pretty much knew that this was the movie that would finally win Martin Scorcese an Oscar for best director.  The Departed is basically a distillation of all of the themes and techniques that Scorcese has been exploring since the mid 70's.  Honor, loyalty, and crime are all in The Departed.  His quick and creative edits, fast paced dialogue, apt placement of music, and quick burst of violence are also present.So there was a tremendous sense of the familiar when I watched The Departed.  The only thing that was really different is that there are no longer Italian mobsters like in Goodfellas and Casino, but Irish cops and Irish mobsters.  But The Departed is hardly just a rehash.  You can tell that Scorcese's job is making movies, but he definitely loves his job.The Departed follows the exploits of two main characters; Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a cop who has been placed undercover inside of mobster Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) organization, and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who is a mobster that has been placed inside of the Massachusetts State Police to act as informant for Costello.  The two men work against each other at every turn, and they both engage in a cat and mouse game to try and outwit the other.The interaction between the characters is based around the duality of each role.  Costigan is acting like a tough thug even though he is a cop who comes from a decidedly middle class background.  Sullivan is a mobster who has been working for Costello ever since he was a kid but looks and acts like a straight laced, clean cut young cop.  As the movie goes on, both men have a hard time maintaining the roles that they are playing.  Costigan begins to show his vulnerability and have panic attacks and abuse Oxycotin, while Sullivan makes some attempts at being a legitimate citizen.  He gets engaged to a police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), and expresses a desire to start over in a new city and become a lawyer.The performances are uniformly good throughout the movie.  DiCaprio puts in the best performance of his life playing Costigan and was robbed by not being nominated for an Oscar.  The subtlety, paranoia, and desperation DiCaprio puts in to the role have you really feeling for his character.  His performance ranks up there with Pacino's Frank Serpico as desperate and paranoid cop performances.Besides his role in the Talented Mr. Ripley, this is probably the most evil character Damon has ever played.  His performance is no where near as dynamic as DiCaprio's, but he is mostly convincing as Sullivan.  Nicholson mostly hams up his performance as Costello, but it adds some comic relief to the movie.  He had me laughing out loud when he was sniffing around like a rat and when he comes out of a back room with his hands covered in blood.  The dark house of the movie is Farmiga, who's character Madolyn is vulnerable, confused, but strong at the same time.  She is in love with two men who lead false lives, but she tries to stay genuine and authentic throughout.This isn't even mentioning the performances of Mark Wahlberg, who plays the abrasive Sgt. Dingnam, Martin Sheen who plays Captian Queenan, or Alec Baldwin who the quirky and high strung Captain Ellerby.  All three put in great performances as well.The music is also a high point in the movie.  The well placed Dropkick Murphy's tune I'm Shipping Up to Boston adds an interesting sense of dread to the movie.  The rest of the music, even the score is also very effective.This movie is highly recommended and ranks of one of Scorcese's best films.  He may not be breaking any kind of new ground with The Departed, but he keeps refining his craft and is on top of his game.	5.0	I'm Shipping Up to Boston	2007-03-19	5	1	4

I thought the movie was too long, the plot convoluted and the soundtrack distracting.  It used to be cool how Scorsese used rock/pop music to juxtapose violence, now it's just routine.  I also have not noticed anybody mention that Dicaprio and Damon look too similar to give their opposition much flair.  Another problem I had was the way too convenient plot device that puts the therapist in bed with both characters.  It's doubtful to me that a professional therapist would get involved with a patient who starts ranting about suicide and demanding drugs, especially when she has just gotten involved in a committed relationship.  But then again, women are never very smart in Scorsese films.  Finally, the ending just left this viewer empty and wondering why I wasted my time with these sleazebags.	3.0	Scorsese Lite	2007-03-03	14	9	5

Scorsese decides all the main characters have to die a grisly death and ends with a nihilistic image that I suppose perfectly ties together the nihilism of this film.

But departed didn't seem to offer much of anything new.The stories of the respective ""rats"" run absolutely parallel (including the same love interest), so the plot sounded interesting to me.But not even 1/3 into the movie you find yourself wondering how can the cops AND the bad guys be so unbelievably stupid, and then you begin to associate that sentiment to the movie.The Special Investigation cops know they have a spy in their midst, but they never suspect the guy who grew up with the crime boss and who always makes a cell phone call to ""Dad"" Itipping off the crime boss) just before the raid!  The criminals know they have a spy in their midst, but they never suspect the former cop who just recently joined their gang, and who has never really proven his loyalty.The behavior of most of the characters never seems to make much sense (including the women, who seek out unpredictable, ugly and violent men), thus the touch of the surreal/fantasy akin to ""Bill.""

There are so many theories and contradictory explanations that I'm giving up.  Some even suggest Martin Sheen's and/or Mark Wahlberg's characters were in league with the mobsters. I didn't get that impression at all. That people came away with different perceptions illustrates how poorly the plot was executed.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2SSZI7O0WBWEJ	Book Miner	"This movie lacks in cohesion and cinematic poetry compared to the original ""Infernal Affairs"" movie. The music score for the background effect is unparralled in the original. Although casted w/ remarkable, renowned actors, the Departed characters just didn't mix and match well and ""departed"" themselves from dramatic flavor that defines and balances the whole movie. For example, Dicaprio (good mole) and Sheen (his boss) just didn't connect throughout the whole movie. The interaction w/ gang members and police force members seemed dry and disattached. See the original and its bonus feature and you'll know what I'm talking about. As in any good guy, bad guy cop movie or mob movie, there's suppose to be a sense of brotherhood and family in the gang/mob and even in a police unit. Isn't a sense of brotherhood and belonging one of the attraction to Gangs? Granted, there's betrayal or a mole, but that's always the case anyway for great drama. And come on, these are Irish mobs we're dealing w/, there's a reason for St. Patrick's (or I'm proud to be Irish) Day. Family, struggle, and the Church are bonded like DNA. The Asian original is similar, Buddhist outlook, family, honor, and brotherhood. Perhaps I'm missing something Scorcese was trying to deliver in his cinematic style.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2IGYM7K8MFJRC	Bo stergaard Jepsen	"As many reviewers have said before me, Scorsese is indeed one of the great directors of our time. With his adaption of the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"", he once again delivers a solid and entertaining story from a world of gangsters and thugs.You probably read a summary of the story, so I won't bother you with that. The story progresses in pretty much the same way as ""Infernal Affairs"", adding a few elements here and subtracting a few there to make it fit it's new surroundings. The cinematography is, of course, very well. It is very well directed and well edited. Some people have complained that the pacing of the film is too slow. I can't agree really with that. The build-up is necessary to fully apreciate the actions and emotions of the characters later on in the film and it never gets boring seeing that there's always tension and always many things going on at the same time. Also the cast (superstar or not) delivers good performances throughout the film. Especially I think, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon act their parts particularly good. Nicholson as the aging, but still ruthless, Irish gangster boss, is full of flavour and makes his character three dimensional. He basically acts the way you'd expect Jack Nicholson to act and that suits the character he plays just perfectly. The same goes for Matt Damon and his character. Damon seems like a very slick, charming, witty, and ambitious kind of a chap, which incidently is also traits of the character he portrais in this film (which by coincidence is also the case of Liu Dehua who plays Damons role in the original Chinese movie). The rest of the cast, as said, also delivers very good performances, which you might expect seeing that in every other shot you've got yet another star playing a minor role.Even though I'm still slightly biased towards the Chinese version (only because I saw it first, and one shouldn't compare them anyways), I still think this is a very solid film worthy of all the good things being said about it. There are of course scenes that may be a bit far fetched, but then again, it's a film, innit? The extras on this two-disc version are also very interesting. I particularly enjoyed the portrait of Scorsese. Very insightful.Definitely worth watching, highly recommendable."	5.0	Highly recommendable	2007-03-10	0	0	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AWNKEM8DAG8PY	Brian Conway	"Hugely influential and critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese is notorious for his numerous gangster movies, including such time-tested classics as Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The Departed is his latest foray into the crime genre and is well on its way to becoming his best yet, despite the short amount of time it has seen in wide release. Set in Boston, The Departed focuses on the rivalry between Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the Massachusetts State Police by way of the rats that have infiltrated both organizations. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), working for the police and the mob respectively, find themselves in constant struggle to keep their true identities hidden while tipping off their real employers. Before long, both Costigan and Sullivan start expressing suspicions to their superiors of an inside man that's leaking information. This sends both of the protagonists into paranoia overdrive, contributing greatly to the tension in scenes where they are behind enemy lines. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Costigan, whose skill at leading a double life comes from growing up in two very different parts of Boston, is wrought with anxiety and panic attacks induced by the risks he's forced to take on behalf of Queenan and Dignam who are at the head of the undercover operations. This Oscar-worthy performance by DiCaprio becomes the core of the film's anxious pacing and serves as a brilliant constrast to the charismatic charm and shameless ambition of Matt Damon's Sullivan. Jack Nicholson's turn as the completely amoral Costello provides an abundance of genuine laughs and ominous chills and would likely steal the scene every time were it not for the enormous talent working along with him. The plot, in true Shakespearean form, begins to spiral out of control after the climax, which becomes the first of many ""did that just happen?"" moments. Once things start to unravel, the ending becomes anyone's guess and a fantastic breath of fresh air in an era overwhelmed with predicatable and unnecessary twist endings. Audiences everywhere are bound to leave theatres completely exasperated and thrilled by what they've just seen and should they go back for a second viewing will come out just as satisfied as the first time around. The Departed is a film that succeeds on every level, ranking among Scorsese's best work and, like those other works, will undoubtedly be revered by many as a classic of the crime genre for both embracing the genre's traditions and boldly defying its storytelling conventions."	5.0	The Departed (4.5 stars)	2006-11-05	1	1	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	`The Departed' released in '06 is a hard-hitting cops and crooks American version of the wildly successful Chinese film `Infernal Affairs' from '02. Also like the Asian production, this American remake boasts an all-star cast to die for; Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.It's an intense, hard-hitting and bloody drama that starts out like a sure Oscar contender with cutting edge, politically incorrect dialogue delivered in narrative form by Jack Nicholson. I was immediately excited by the prospects ahead and settled in for the gory ride, Good Guys versus Bad Guys, doesn't get any better than that. Unfortunately the storyline slowly begins to lose steam by the midway point of this 2 hour and 32 minute film and despite some brilliant performances, especially DiCaprio and Nicholson, when the conclusion finally arrives you're more than ready for the closing credits to roll by.Definitely worth seeing, but not a classic.	4.0	"When You're Facing A Loaded Gun What's The Difference"" ~ Subtle Nuances Between Cop And Crook, Rat And Mole"	2007-02-21	2	0	2

Fairbanks"""	"Film buffs will likely continue to debate the merits of ""The Departed"" for years. Does the film that finally earned a long overdue Oscar for director Martin Scorsese (as well as the Best Picture prize) rank with his best work? Does it deserve to stand beside ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" or my own choice as Scorsese's greatest films, ""King of Comedy"" and ""Casino""?Does it matter?Not really. ""The Departed"" is a terrific, complex thriller, the first epic cops and robbers flick since Al Pacino faced-off against Robert DeNiro in 1995's ""Heat."" As one cynical critic noted, Martin Scorsese's film is mainly about ""scumbags killing scumbags,"" but though Leonardo DiCaprio's undercover cop has his rough edges, he's a good guy at heart, as is Mark Wahlberg's detective. It's Jack Nicholson as crime boss Frank Costello and Matt Damon as his informer in the Boston police department, who make even the most corrupt characters look angelic in comparison.There are quite a few twists and turns including two shocking deaths, but though it may be more entertainment than art, ""The Departed"" is a worthy addition to Scorsese's filmography, and a perfectly respectable choice with which to honor him with Hollywood's highest honor. The cast is terrific, of course, with Wahlberg stealing every scene he's in and Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin offering fine support.Brian W.

From the openening scene this movie takes you by the throat with both hands and doesn't let go. Its all there like it never left - Scorceses use of tracking shots and slow mo sequences take you back to the movies that made this man great. His use and arrangement of recorded music on his soundtracks is without peer.  Scorcese has put together what is arguably one the best casts in movie history.. at least since Goodfellas. Every actor in this movie finds time to chew the scenery without going over the top Pacino style which is a testament to Scorcese and his directing skills. This is a man who got Paul Newman his 1st elusive Oscar and let Joe Pesci run amok in Goodfellas in what is one of the all time great mafia hood portrayals. All thats left is the icing on the cake - this movie should clean house at the Oscars. For those that disagree I suggest a blanket party with a pillowcase full of Raging Bull and Taxi Driver VHS tapes to knock yourself back into coherence.	5.0	5 Words	2007-02-18	8	6	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A23NZ1HMJOYEMN	Bruno Diaz	"Yes, it won Best Picture and a lot of other awards.  Yes, a lot of critics praised it (although not as enthusiastically you might think).  And many people decry the movie as a lesser-work by Scorsese that the Academy awarded out of guilt, especially since ""Dances with Wolves"" beat ""Goodfellas"" for Best Picture in 1990 (WTF!).  And because a lot of people still don't like Leonardo DiCaprio and all the big Hollywood names attached, they also shrug it off somewhat. Not to mention the fact that it's a remake of a really good movie, ""Infernal Affairs"".There's so many reasons to want to think this is just okay, until you actually watch the movie.  It's unbelievably good, right up there with Scorsese's best work, and although I often disagree with the Academy, I really do believe it was the Best Picture of 2006.  The film is so rich with wonderful, powerful performances across the board, and the script is so entertaining and tense, filled with dynamic, hilarious characters and scenes that just jump out at you.  It's a violent crime film in line with ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" and Scorsese's other greatest hits in a way, but I think on many other levels it's a departure for him.  Stylistically, it's much more of a police procedural along the lines of some of the great television shows out these days like ""The Wire"" and ""The Shield"".  It's also respectful of the source material, offering a different enough take on ""Infernal Affairs"" but staying true to some of the best that film had to offer.I saw this movie three times in the theater.  I haven't done that in a long, long time (probably since ""Goodfellas"").  I bought the DVD, I love it, and I think time will be very good to ""The Departed"" overall.  The Leo-hate will finally be forgotten, as will the politics and the context of the Hollywood A-listers piling on, and we'll just be left with one of the most entertaining crime movies ever made.  And the fact that it's an entertainment and not a grandiose, Oscar-shilling ""important film"" is what makes it all the more successful and truly a great pleasure to watch."	5.0	Underrated in a way	2007-05-17	4	1	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8P8KPVXCWV9R	"Bryan J. Kautzman ""BK"""	I just don't know whether to love Scorcese or to hate him.  Over the years, he has produced some brilliant stuff.  And at the same time, he has produced some not-so-brilliant stuff.  However, he has a few gems that really stand out.  Movies like Raging Bull, Casino, and one of my all time favorites, Goodfellas truly defined Scorcese's career.  But it seems as if Scorcese just can't find a niche.  But perhaps that is his plan all along.The Departed is a true classic in the genre of film noir dramas.  It truly depicts three loners bucking against the system in quite unique ways in order to make names for themselves.  And even though the movie pits these three individuals against each other, as a viewer, I had a hard time deciding which guy to root for.I loved the performances all around.  In particular, though, Jack Nicholson portrayed a crime boss in a way that is slightly different than the way we are used to seeing the crime boss depicted.  That's why I love his character so much.  We are used to seeing mobsters with a sense of morality that they must fulfill but end up being undone in the classic Shakespearean sense because of their own fatal flaws.  However, the true failure in Nicholson's character is the fact that he has no morality, and that is what makes his character so brilliant.  I also love the fact that Scorcese gave Nicholson a great amount of artistic leeway in his scenes in order to truly develop his character.Kudos all around for this one, as I truly think that Scorcese outdid himself.  Only time will tell if I love this movie as much as I still loved Goodfellas ten years later, but rest assured I'll be adding this one to my DVD library.	5.0	A True Film Noir Classic	2011-06-16	4	3	1

So I won't bore you with what you already know.  Rather, I'll tell you how disappointing the extra features were.  For example, the 9 deleted features run from seconds to a few minutes long and after viewing them, you'd wish you never saw them.  It's pretty clear why they were cut out, as the movie was already running quite long and these scenes proved unworthy of being included in the film.  The other features including the short documentary about the inspiration behind Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello were not very refreshing either.  My honest opinion is... save the extra 5 bucks and get the one disk version.	5.0	Movie itself's great..as for the extra features....	2007-02-27	13	9	4

This was a vastly overrated movie, with a mildly interesting subject matter that has been overplayed the last several years.  The Irish mob fascination was at a peak in 2006, particularly in Massachusetts, and several years from now we'll all be scratching our heads about what the appeal was.  Do we really need another mob film, particularly one that arrives via a Hong Kong picture remake?  Is this the best you can do, Hollywood?The acting was awful, particularly from Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon, the supposed authentic ones of the group.  Jack Nicholson is pretty much a joke nowadays, and has been running on fumes as a caricature of his Hollywood image for the last two decades.  I thought Leo's acting was decent enough, although he in particular embodied the difficulty I had with accepting Hollywood pretty boys as street toughs (yeah, yeah, they could all probably beat me up- it doesn't make them believable as hoods and connected guys).  The accents were deplorable, and bested only by the dialogue for least believable aspects of a film in which there's a lot that's tough to swallow.The dialogue was so obscenely difficult to accept as true.  Jack Nicholson spat out one liners at inopportune times of stress and violence that were enough to make fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 80's films cringe.  The indiscriminate use of the F word didn't bother my sensitivities- it offended me that I was sold a bill of goods where curse words were used as such an easy and acceptable crutch for well-scripted and realistic dialogue.  Close your eyes and imagine people speaking like that to one another.  You can't- you get New Jersey bookie wanna-be's, and Joey Buttafucco, instead, right?  I didn't buy this language any more than I thought guys walked around calling one another ""baby"" as shown in Swingers.The same thing with the violence- it didn't offend me as much as insult my intelligence.  How nave and far-removed from reality does a Hollywood type have to be to as a rule substitute six dozen shots when six will do?  Really, the whole picture would have been more credible if the shots fired were divided by 4.  If you'd like to see real violence done in a real way, rent The Proposition.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2VA4WROWMS407	B. Young	`The Departed,` another gangster-related drama from director Martin Scorsese, walked away with four Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards. While clearly a good film, did it deserve Best Picture? A look at the picture means that this review contains spoilers, so you may want to stop reading now.The acting is excellent (with a nod towards DiCaprio) and the script fraught with tension at times. What strikes the viewer-- perhaps even assaults the viewer-- is the overuse of music. Typically Scorsese overwhelms the audience with operatic arias and seventies rock-- instead of choosing key moments to play his musical cards for maximum impact. For the first hour of the film the music never stops! Please, give us some time alone with the characters so we can see development. Music starts, and stops, and re-starts beyond the bounds of good editing. As a result the story sounds like it`s being recycled instead of moving along. However the film`s use of cell phones-- ringtones and sounds as well as as plot devices-- much like the original-- adds greatly to the tension.Furthermore the film jumps about in both the beginning and middle-- there is colorful but highly confusing scene involving copious amounts of cocaine that floats about mid-movie, disconnected completely from the rest of the plot (as we have plenty of evidence of Frank Costello`s evil nature prior to this scene, it serves only to disorient.) Only near the film`s end, when the main plot involving the two-faced nature of three of the main characters becomes clear, do the scenes finally iron themselves out and flow together.Numerous laugh-out-loud moments and solid dialogue show Willam Monahan`s Oscar to be justified (he won for Best Adapted Screenplay.) What really sinks `The Departed` are the far-too-numerous subplots left unresolved. Racism? You got it (as with every gang-related film Scorsese has touched.) It adds some flavor but also some bulk. Sullivan (Matt Damon) spends time recruiting a secret crew within the Special Investigations Unit-- what happens to them? They`re left dangling mid-movie. One scene that did not make the final cut was Mandolyn Madden`s (Vera Farmigan) reading of the secret letter given to her by Costigan (DiCaprio) in the final 20 minutes. That scene too would`ve helped tie it together.All in all, a decent film. But a colossus that pales in comparison to the sleek, driven beast that is `Infernal Affairs` (2002), the film on which it is based. If you want tension and drama in spades, and a story of deception that is stripped bare of non-essentials, rent or buy the Hong Kong original.	3.0	This Heavyweight No Match for its Predecessor	2007-02-26	11	4	7

Warrington	I loved this film!THE DEPARTED is an intense cops and gangsters opera with an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. Jack Nicholson, as sociopathic crime boss Frank Costello, is excellent as always. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, going straight from Cadet to undecover, in my opinion is his  best performance yet. As for Martin Scorsese, this film will stand alongside MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO as the director's best work.Set in modern day South Boston, involving the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts State Police, THE DEPARTED is a tale of two young guys entangled in that old Irish-American dilemma of love and respect for both outlaw and cop, the two often freely intermingling within neighborhoods and families, blurring identities and allegiances.	5.0	This Is What Going To the Movies Is All About	2006-11-03	3	2	1

The issues at hand are the muddled script, the confusing casting and the unacceptable ending.There is little distinction between Matt Damon and Decaprio who sported the same crew-cut, body build, facial expressions and distracting accent. They looked so similar that I constantly had to remind myself who was who. Damon was a bad guy pretending to be a cop. Decaprio was a cop pretending to be a bad guy. At the rolling of the credit I was left wondering who Jack Nicolsen really was. The number of secret FBI informants in this movie is ridiculous and insulting. That fact only becomes evident at the end when heads explode unexpectedly and more bodies pile up, leaving the viewer feeling cheated. It was like watching a bad comedy. You may find yourself screaming ""Are you kidding me?"" at the TV screen.The girlfriend has no reason for being in this film, except to add the element of romance and sex. Her presence did nothing to propel this movie forward.This is a Scorsese film. Expect a lot of swearing, violence and blood and gore. I haven't removed any rating stars because of it.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	"The acting is amazing and the story will never be forgotten. Gritty but alluring. It makes us want to watch how two men that came from the streets of the city are drawn to the state police. We see they have very different ideas about crime even though they come from very similar backgrounds. The action is non-stop and will have some biting their nails as the tension mounts. One cop is dirty while the other pretends to be. Will the pretend criminal or dirty cop be found out? What will happen to them if they are? Superb cast, great sets and camera work, and decent music make it a must see for adults. Fans of cop movies like ""13th Precinct"", ""French Connection"", and ""Serpico"" won't want to miss it.This is one of the best dramas I have seen in years. Scorsese once again shows us what a master he is as a director. Nicholson, Damon, and DiCaprio deserved Oscars let alone nominations at he very least. Although Walberg is great as always, he is not on the screen all that much as the other three in this movie. I'm glad he got a nomination, but the other three were robbed. They make you feel their roles and pull you into this riveting story of how two kids from the streets grow up fighting to make it. Their lives are messy and they try to keep them together the best they can. The complexities of characters here makes for excellent acting. Don't miss this one. I recommend this for buying if you enjoy crime dramas."	4.0	Dearly Departed	2007-02-17	4	3	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A35NFVV9QLIPOB	carnage	"I've seen a number of scornful and disrespectful things over the years, but Martin Scorsese's prophecies really take the cake. It may help if I begin my discussion by relating an innocuous story in order to illustrate my point: A few days ago I was arguing with a particularly possession-obsessed vagabond who was insisting that our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups. I tried to convince this blinkered bohemian that Martin's latest statements have arisen like a phoenix out of the ashes and failures of their disdainful forebears. For proof of this fact, I must point out that every time Martin utters or writes a statement that supports revisionism -- even indirectly -- it sends a message that science is merely a tool invented by the current elite to maintain power. I, for one, decidedly contend we mustn't let him make such statements, partly because he is like a parrot that makes noises for attention without any kind of clue as to what it is saying, but primarily because his hijinks are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, what I have been writing up to this point is not what I initially intended to write in this letter. Instead, I decided it would be far more productive to tell you that Martin wants to become an intellectual without the hardship of study and serious thought. We can therefore extrapolate that the central preconception in Martin's paranoid style is the belief in the existence of a vast, drugged-out, preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network designed to open the floodgates of alarmism. I don't think anyone questions that. But did you know that he slaps his message of inaniloquent deconstructionism on everything that stands still -- newspapers, magazines, billboards, movies, op-eds, and grant proposals? I would much rather mention a bit about dictatorial hippies such as Martin than waste my precious time chastising squalid geeks. I kid you not. No one can claim to know the specific source of his sophistries, but his stories about despotism are particularly ridden with errors and distortions, even leaving aside the concept's initial implausibility.Martin plans to promote promiscuity and obscene language. The result will be an amalgam of deranged Comstockism and unambitious favoritism, if such a monster can be imagined. He has never gotten ahead because of his hard work or innovative ideas. Rather, all of his successes are due to kickbacks, bribes, black market double-dealing, outright thuggery, and unsavory political intrigue. It may seem obvious, but the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior. Your guess is as good as mine as to why Martin wants to influence the attitudes of dominant culture towards any environment or activity that is predominantly headlong. Maybe it's because he plans to further political and social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of criminal law.Martin practically breaks his arm patting himself on the back when he says, ""It takes courage to go down into the muddy trenches and bring ugliness and nastiness into our lives."" As if that were something to be proud of. His sycophants are too lazy to ensure that the values for which we have labored and for which many of us have fought and sacrificed will continue in ascendancy. They just want to sit back, fasten their mouths on the public teats, and casually forget that the acid test for Martin's ""kinder, gentler"" new intimations should be, ""Do they still encourage every sort of indiscipline and degeneracy in the name of freedom?"" If the answer is yes, then we can conclude that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about Martin's self-satisfied behavior, but about the way that Martin insists that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. In the long run, however, he's only fooling himself. Martin would be better off if he just admitted to himself that his ultimata are statism redux. No joke. I have one final message for you before ending this letter: I indubitably gainsay Martin Scorsese's notion that he is a bearer and agent of the Creator's purpose."	1.0	what a flop...	2007-02-27	34	5	29

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1R9391E9V4W4B	Charles Horton	I bought this DVD from Amazon some time ago and just got around to watching for the first time. As an admirer of Mr. Scorsese's past work, I was, frankly, amazed at how universally weak this film was. And to win the Oscar no less. It's clear he got the sympathy vote - well deserved for Good Fellas among others - just not for this mess. All 'tough guys'; no humor; no likable characters; plot holes to drive a truck through (ex.: what are the chances the psychologist would just happen to date both these guys?) There was so much use of cel phones, I was surprised to not find Verizon or AT&T in the producer credits. And hey, I'm no prude, but a profanity in every line? - come on. An average episode of The Sopranos is far more entertaining, and better written, than this. And the coup de grace in the film's last scene: - the rat on the balcony rail. My wife and I howled with laughter! - a laugh of disgust after being dragged through nearly 3 hours of this convoluted nightmare. I was glad all the principals were shot dead, so there could be no sequel.	2.0	A major let-down	2007-07-05	9	4	5
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2O39VY1UEDCKH	Charles Jannuzi	I would give this 2 1/2 stars actually.Scorsese has stunk up the place recently--see 'Gangs of New York', making him, along with Woody Allen, one of America's most over-rated directors (and both are identified with NYC!). This is something like a return to form, but no where near the quality of 'Casino' (which if Scorsese had stopped there would have made him a much-appreciated director).First, neither DiCaprio nor Damon inhabit very believable characters. When you take unbelievable characters and add unbelievable actions and events, you get bad plot, among other things. Second, it's tiring seeing Nicholson in the role of criminal arch villain. What is most memorable about the depiction is the comedy. Third, an elaborate and unbelievable plot based around the idea that Irish and Italians (from Providence) battle it out for the 'mean streets' of Boston but with the main prize being the ability to sell computer chips to Chinese government officials was just way too much.Since TV provides us with cop dramas like 'Homicide', the 'Shield' and the 'Wire', why would anyone need a film like this?Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg turn in the most credible performances in supporting roles--the sort of characters that could be fleshed out and inhabit some of the plot in a longer TV drama. Here they get very little screen time actually.One other dubious distinction: this has to be the most over-acclaimed, most over-rated Boston-based crime movie since Eastwood's, which was also flawed by an unbelievable plot. Neither DiCaprio nor Damon over-act in the Sean Penn way here, but neither of them are very believable as white tough guys from the mean streets either. There is supposed to be some sort of irony in that the DiCaprio character is judged by veteran cops to be incapable of being one, while the Damon character is supposed to the veteran cops' choice as a departmental golden boy. I kept thinking if Damon's slightly better acting skills were put to use in the DiCaprio character (the undercover cop), which is a slightly more important character than the undercover criminal in the police department, the results might have been somewhat more engaging. However, Scorsese seems to be enamored of DiCaprio.	2.0	Not great Scorcese	2009-05-16	7	4	3

Now Million Dollar Baby was good, bur not Best Director worthy. So anyway, ""The Departed"", an excellent film, and really breaks away from Scorses's typical mob film.

But I noticed that the TCM bio of Martin Scorses is missing from the Blu-Ray disk, yet it's on the regular DVD version.

I won't give a plot summary of the film, as it has been done to death, instead I'll let you know the highs and lows for me.There are a lot of great quotes and lines throughout the movie.  One of the first is the one I used as a title for this review, meaning ""I will not serve"" by James Joyce, from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.  Another is ""The Irish are the only people impervious to psychoanalysis"" by Sigmund Freud.  Then there is a scene where Jack Nicholson (Frank) asks a man ""How's your mother?"" The man answers, ""She's on her way out."" Frank then replies ""We all are, act accordingly.""The acting in this movie is extremely well done, with one exception, and the action and suspense is non stop.  If you blink at all during this movie, chances are you'll miss something. It is not a movie for people who don't enjoy violence or have a weak stomach, as there are a few gag worthy moments.One of the main problems I had with the movie was Jack Nicholson(the exception)as Frank; he starts out the movie with an accent, loses it for awhile, then kind slips in and out of it for the rest of the film, it drove me nuts.  I also really hated the ending, of course I can't tell you why, but it was so crazy and ridiculous to me, it resulted in some stunned laughter from both my husband and I.Overall this is a really good film, if not for Jack Nicholson's accent faux pas and the ludicrous ending; it could have easily been a 5 star film.

""Casino"" is one of my all time favorites, so I went into ""The Departed"" with very high expectations. To be honest, the first hour of the movie was too slow. I understand that Scorcese was establishing his characters and slowly massaging the audience to ""feel"" for each character - but it took too much time. I feel like the first hour could have been condensed into 35 minutes without losing any of the ""flavor"" for the individual characters and their development.The second half of the movie was the part that won Scorcese the best picture Oscar. It was brilliantly conceived, brilliantly acted and kept you glued to the screen. The second half was the payoff for the painfully slow first hour. Each character seems to come alive and you really get the sense firsthand of the tension and drama as it builds through the second half of the movie.Jack Nicholson was great, as usual, but I really think that Leonardo diCaprio was the star of ""The Departed"". He's the guy you latch on to from beginning to bitter end. (By Scorcese's design)All in all, without giving away too many plot points, don't judge this movie by its first half. The second hour of the movie is worth the wait. Scorcese delivers again... although better late than never.4 stars"	4.0	As a Scorcese fan, this movie was tough... but worth it.	2007-04-07	3	1	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"At a certain point in Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" Irish crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) asks one of his cronies how his mother is doing. ""She's on her way out,"" the crony replies with a nervous smirk on his face. ""We all are,"" says Costello. ""Act accordingly."" Clearly these lines have darkly humorous undertones that force giggles out of the audience. But by the time the end of the film is reached, they take on a completely different connotation. How appropriate for a film of amazing depth and complexity; one should never take lines like that for granted, especially when they're used for foreshadowing. Likewise, one should never take an entire film for granted. On the surface, ""The Departed"" is nothing more than an obscenely violent gangster flick. But at its core, it's a thought provoking character study, one that purposely and effectively raises questions about identity, loyalty, and trust.As a filmmaker, Scorsese clearly knows how he wants a story to be told. You can tell this is so from the camera angles, editing techniques, dialogue, all of which hint at deeper meaning lying within a shallow facade of blood, bullets, and cruelty. This film makes use of some especially clever storytelling methods, made even better by subtle character development-methods. I don't know whether or not it matters that this is an American remake of ""Mou Gaan Duo (Infernal Affairs),"" the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller directed by Siu Fai Mak. While Scorsese's version pays homage to the original story idea, it still seems as if it were made to stand on its own. And no wonder; such talent, both in front of and behind the camera, made for a truly unique film experience.The opening scenes effectively hide Costello in shadow, as if to metaphorically say that the truth of the story is hidden throughout much of the film. In terms of the characters and their knowledge, this is true; taking place in South Boston, the plot focuses on two moles, each from opposite sides of the law, each planted within their rival's respective organizations. It starts with Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who as a young boy was taken under Costello's wing and raised to be a criminal in the Irish mafia. As an adult, he infiltrates the Massachusetts State Police department as Costello's informer. What an interesting development; the police are desperately trying to catch Costello, but Sullivan's secretive interference foils every attempt. If there's any hope in cracking down on this ruthless crime boss, someone has to infiltrate his organization.Here enters Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young undercover cop whose dedication to the law is the result of terrible family connections. He meets the soft-spoken Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the hard nosed, foulmouthed Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who both assign him to infiltrate the mob syndicate, specifically in an attempt to foil a deal with the Chinese mafia (which involves super high tech computer chips). Costigan is reluctant to be a part of the operation, especially since Dignam didn't exactly welcome him into the department. However, he agrees to take part. In order to convince Costello that Costigan is an actual criminal and not a cop, Costigan intentially serves time in jail. It's only after his sentence is served, and after a series of elaborately planed circumstances, that he joins with Costello. Initially, things go well for the case; Costigan quickly gains Costello's confidence, which in turn gives the police hope that enough evidence can be gathered.Then things start to go downhill. Sullivan, who has yet to be discovered, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. What's worse, the department begins to suspect that a mole may in fact have been assigned as a police officer. Sullivan is told to weed out this mole, an act that understandably creates tension between various members of the department, especially Sullivan and Dignam. It's also creating tension between Sullivan and the police psychiatrist, Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), who have recently started dating. She wants to know more about the man she thinks she loves, yet he continually evades her inquiries with his quick wit and devilish charm. He eventually tells her that certain aspects of his job can't be discussed, a quality she accepts while at the same time finds it troubling.Things aren't going much better for Costigan, who's feeling more and more consumed by the role he's playing (he eventually begins to abuse perscription medications). His frustration goes even deeper when he shows feelings for Madolyn (as part of his job, he's required to meet with her every week). As carefully as he can, he gathers information about the organization he's become a part of, both the plans and the counter-plans. But through a mixture of mob-related events and Sullivan's insider tips for Costello (achieved by faking a phone conversation with his father), the threat of exposure suddenly looms over Costigan. The same threat faces Sullivan, whose involvement with the case makes it more and more difficult to remain on friendly terms with the department. For both men, it ultimately becomes a race to uncover the identity of the other mole.The most fascinating moments in the film occur within the final forty-five minutes; without giving too much away, I can say that that period of time allows for the unveiling of crucial details and for certain characters to make decisions. It's also when a majority of the violence takes place, all of which is quick, brutal, and lacking in drama. The death scenes (and there are quite a few of them) are cold and unceremonious, indelicately accentuated with the sight of blood. I say ""accentuated,"" but in reality, the gore isn't entertaining so much as it's a way of condemning the heartless world of crime, a world the audience knows Frank Costello will never leave. He's pure evil, right down to his graying goatee.Of course, the violence factor is not a reason for recommending ""The Departed."" I want the moviegoing public to experience it for it's humanity, for it's willingness to show that people sometimes make choices for no apparent reason. The plot is a bit convoluted, and I have to admit that it took me a while to sort out all the intricate details. However, it's still something people should go see, if not for the character analysis, then for the strong performances and excellent direction. At last, it would seem that Martin Scorsese has returned to his roots in the crime genre. As far as I'm concerned, it couldn't have come at a better time."	4.0	Crime Truly Doesn't Pay	2006-10-07	3	1	2

I love Jack Nicholson's expressions, they go so well with the roles he plays. He knows just how to get inside any character he portrays. Many scenes are messy, but extremely well done as far as plot and suspense. It wasn't the ending I'd hoped for, but I like the unexpected if it makes sense, and it did. The screenplay is tightly written with all loose ends tied up, which is wonderful because I hate the 'ambiguity' in endings, though there are more and more of them.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	The Departed is a great film. It has no less than 6 terrific performance, a gripping story, fantastic editing, and an engaging score. For just pure entertainment value it never dissapoints. It's not quite up there with Scorese's big three masterpieces--Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Taxi Driver--but I'd put it at the top of the second tier of Scorsese movies just ahead of The Aviator and underapreciated The Last Temptation of Christ.However on special features the two disk set is lacking. The special features probably could have all fit on one disk with the movie pretty easily. There's some deleted scenes and a few very short featuretts. I got through all the special features in a very short time and nothing was very memorable. I've bought other Scorsese two disk sets like Ragining Bull and The Aviator and was definetly satisified with their special features. Those films even had commentary, which The Departed does not. Such a shame better treatmeant wasn't given to the movie that Scorsese finally won an Oscar for.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	Jack Nicholson is a Boston crime boss, Matt Damon is part of his organizatin but is also a cop. DiCaprio is a cop working undercover as a member of Nicholson's gang. DiCaprio gains Nicholson's trust and is instructed to look for a rat in the gang which happens to be himself. The cops know someone among them is working for Nicholson, so Damon is tapped to find him which again happens to be himself. Along the way, they both fall in love with the same woman. And in the end I didn't care about any of it.We've seen this movie before, done better, and by the same director. How many mob movies are too many? If you're going to do one, there has to be something special about it and The Departed is ordinary. I enjoyed it, but I never need to see it again. Nicholson is just playing himself, the movie is at least a half hour too long and was actually dull in spots.	3.0	We've seen this movie before	2007-12-10	17	12	5
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ASU5IH3CM6XXE	ChrisTyrrell	"They should have called this motion picture ""The Retarded,"" because it's wicked retarded, as people from Boston like Marvin Scorcese would say.I haven't seen a lot of Marvin Scorcese movies, because I tend to only watch critically acclaimed or decently directed films, but I do plan on seeing some of his other ones just to see if they're any better than this one.  I hear that ""The Age of Innocence"" is considered his best, but I don't like movies with subtitles so I may just wait for the book for that one.Anyhoo, this movie is very not entertaining mostly because it's about a group of friends, one of whom is the usually excellent Jack Nicholson, who go around trying to make more friends and then they shoot them in the face.  Now, anbody that knows me knows I am firmly against face-shooting, but I love friendship--so this one was a coin toss for me.To sum up, here is what I didn't like about this movie:  Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Donnie Wahlberg's brother, Alec Baldwin, any of the ""dramatic"" scenes, the cinematography, the face-shooting script, the Irish music (pointless!), the editing (choppy at best), the feel-good ending.Here is what I did like: the scene where Martin Sheen flies through the air.  It reminded me of Superman III (the one with Richard Pryor), and Richard Pryor makes me laugh.  If this movie had been more like ""The Toy,"" they may have had something.If you want to see a good movie about friends go rent the first few seasons of ""Friends"" or ""thirtysomething"" and then you'll see that Marvin Scorcese missed the boat.  Probably a duck boat, since it's Boston (that's an inside joke for Boston people)Or see ""Club Paradise"" with Robin Williams, because he is totally on an island with friends in that wonderful drama."	1.0	The Retarded	2007-03-09	32	13	19

But there's no character development, and the plot is weak, overly complicated, confused, and lacking in resolution.Worst of all, this film is horribly violent. I walked out of the theatre feeling like I needed an exorcism and a valium.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18D0R137EYS6C	Clinton Enlow	I first heard of this remake of Infernal Affairs a year after seeing the original film. At the time I was interested mainly since Scorsese's was listed as the director which gave the film more heat than a remake like Pulse or The Grudge. Then I heard of changes made to the film, or an outlandish sex scene involving Nicholson's Frank and two prostitutes. The film began to take a lot of flak before it was even released and upon hearing the changes to the ending I was very hesitant to see it. And then of course the movie came out, and Scorsese delivered a remake that was as good as he could do it. It exceded my expectations in several ways.I don't feel like going into a whole synopsis of the film. So the long and short of it. Sometime in the past mob boss Frank Costello insinuates young Colin Sullivan into his gang keeping him at arms length to use him for a plan to infiltrate Boston's state police. At the same time Colin is coming up in the police ranks, Billy Costigan is recruited by the police to infiltrate Costigan's gang. Soon both spys are filtering information to their secret bosses. During a suprise sale of microchips to Chinese gangsters both the criminals and the cops learn information that alerts both organizations to the presence of the infiltrators leading the moles in a headlong chase to track each others identities down.This is a very good crime drama despite what some might say. Unlike the critics who gushed over it last year calling it the best film of the year, I think that was going a bit far but it is far better than even I expected it to. Part of it is that unlike remakes which seem to aim to keep the spirit of the original Scorsese gives the film an air that is comparable to his own films. Infernal Affairs had slick surface that made the whole film sleek and fast. The Departed is more realistic down in the dirt and grit of the streets that its presenting. Its realistic in preventing the organization of both the cops and the criminals, and doesn't haven't have that film like quality that made Affairs more of a thriller. I liked that it was a long film as well taking the time to tell its story and flesh out its characters nicely. And except Nicholson who seemed to be reveling in going near the edge of being over the top without commiting so fully the cast was great with Damon again showing that he could be labeled the best actor of his generation with excellent support from Mark Whalberg, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga.Everything in the film is good, but one thing holds it from being great. As good as everything is a lot of what made Infernal Affairs a great experience is the suprises it held in its plot. There were several deaths of major characters that were shocking and powerful in way. Here knowing who was going to die took all the suprise out. I guess I could warn you if you wanted to watch this one before the Affairs series, but that doesn't keep it from being a flaw. What ever the movie does well its always going to be a remake, retreading over what some else had done before. Despite this the films worth seeing for fans of the genre, or Scorsese.The two disc set is somewhat of a disappointment. Continuing Warner Bros lackluster treatment of releasing a one disc version and a two disc version I have yet to be impressed with extras on the two disc version. Here we have about three whole extras relegated to the second disc. One is a Documentary called Scorsese on Scorsese which I haven't viewed, a documentary on The Departed and the boston crime scene focusing on Whity Bulger, an influence on Nicholsons Costello, and nine deleted scenes with an introduction by Scorsese. Thats it. Theres no making of the film, no interviews with cast and crew, no commentary. For a film that is the forerunner for this years best picture oscar this is somewhat a let down in my opinion. Even The Aviator at least provided information on OCD or Hughes in general while also having a commentary from Scorsese. So in my opinion if you buy the film its best to go with the one disc unless you wanna be burned by a few features that aren't as interesting as they could be. Thats my opinion anyway.	4.0	The Departed	2007-02-13	10	6	4
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"I'll be honest: I wasn't that big a fan of Gangs of New York. The story was just not interesting at all and the only thing that saved it was the production values and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The Aviator was a good movie but the main problem was that it didn't seem like a film you can watch over and over but rather something that was good whenever you watched it, whether it was recently or not. The Departed, revisiting territory seen in Goodfellas, was immediately jumped on as one of Scorsese's best. Is it, or is it just simply the best he's done in years, since possibly Casino but definately since Goodfellas? Maybe.The main man in the Departed is Frank Costello, a crime boss in Boston. A particularly nasty and blunt fellow and dealing with many illegal practices, the police have been after him for years. Doesn't help that he's got an informant in the police department named Colin Sullivan. The police, headed by officers Queenan and Dignam, decide they need their own informant in Costello's crew. In comes Billy Costigan, who after a stint in prison gets accepted in Costello's crew but both sides know a rat exists so both Billy and Colin have to outwit each other without actually meeting.When a film is mentioned as being a director's best since whatever, it always nags me since that's not always the case. With the Departed, coming after simply ok films like Aviator or Gangs and Bringing Up the Dead, it's easy to say that it's Scorsese's best since his output isn't like what we've had recently. It's an exciting movie filled with twists and turns but at the same time it seems like a movie where it feels like Scorsese's niche. In other words, he knows how to make mob movies and is good at it. The only thing is that the story seems to twist without being shocking. Certain plot points don't have as much kick as they should and at the end, one character out of the blue says his connection with Costello, it's like ""him? where the hell was he the entire movie?""However, the casting is great with the accompanying performances through the roof. Jack Nicholson, seen in such comedies as Something's Gotta Give and Anger Management, it's finally nice to see ""actor Jack"" back and not the superstar. And once-reviled Leonard DiCaprio proves there's more to him than just a handsome face. Supporting players also work from scene stealer Mark Wahlberg to Alec Baldwin but strangely the only one I felt didn't work was one of the key ones. Matt Damon felt slightly miscast since I never got that feeling that this guy was corrupt and misleading. When he starts swearing a lot near the end or being kind of a jerk to love interest Vera Farmiga's character, it just seems...off. Of course it's probably just me.It's too bad that the DVD cover is so classy when the special features seem light. Yeah the Scorsese documentary is long and informative but there just doesn't seem to be enough features for this to be the definitive Departed DVD. Even the Aviator was more packed than this. The exclusion of a Scorsese commentary is one thing but an extensive making-of about the filming is kind of inexcusable. Look for an eventual double-dip in the near future.I will admit that the Departed was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to buy but this is a career highlight that hasn't had one in almost 20 years."	4.0	4.5; his best in awhile...a long while	2007-02-13	11	7	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"Although not necessarily liked by critics and movie-goers, Martin Scorsese's The Aviator, about the rise and fall of Howard Hughes, was an exceptionally well-crafted film, beautifully acted by Leonardo DiCaprio, depicting a dramatic and interesting time in American history. Martin does a wonderful job with the ""Historical Film""; however his ability to depict the reality of the organized crime culture in America has never been surpassed apart from the Godfather Trilogy. In The Departed, he returns to what he does best, with a superb cast: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walberg etc. If you like gangster films, this story is a good one that rivets one's attention throughout its 150 minutes.Nicholson as the aging Irish crime boss in Boston should win or at least be nominated for the Academy award. His narration at the film's beginning pulls the viewer in, describing his philosophy on survival and life. He is a character that knows what he wants and will go to any lengths to attain his desires. He is an expert manipulator that thinks ahead, nurturing the young boys in his neighbourhood to work for him as they grow into men.One of The Departure's major themes is a social paradox: the Matt Damon character is smart and ambitious, rising to the top of the Boston police force. On the other hand, the DiCaprio character has had it tough, scraping to survive, on the surface a ""loser"", and the paradox is this: one would assume the ""successful"" character to be `good', while the loser falling into crime. In fact, it is the ""loser"" who has integrity while the winner is a two-faced scumbag.Similar to all Scorsese films, the soundtrack is cool and the editing is extremely tight, working in tandem towards a striking effect.The film's violence comes off as very real, (too much violence, really) but truly depicts the culture of this underground world.The Departure's plot moves very fast and one needs to pay attention as to who is the ""rat"" and what will the Nicholson character do next. Some have said that the plot is too convoluted, too many twist and turns, moving in too many directions to follow. I disagree because the story is clearly told though moves at a lightning pace.The Departure is a quality film, well acted, well produced and the direction and editing top notch.Clearly a four to five star film."	4.0	Quality Film	2006-12-10	2	0	2

Monk ""CM"""	"In my opinion, it was a long movie with alot of famous actors and a weak plot.Think about it, if anyone else but Scorsese were to make this film, would it really be receiving all the hype?In my opinion, this film just never really got going.  Maybe it needed a Deniro-type actor to fill the main role, who knows.  I mean if you think about this movie, it's Gangs of New York (sorta) mixed with Goodfellas (sorta).The rest deals with the plot so don't read on if you intend to see the movie.Basically, the plot is that there are two rats...one from the police and one from the organized crime led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  But this doesn't really come into play until near the end of the film as the first 2/3rds of the film deal with the relationships among the main characters.There's the romantic aspect which never really goes anywhere and could have really been cut out and the film would have lost nothing.After nearly two hours, there is a shootout at a storage place but there's no build up to it; it just occurs.The last 20-30 minutes, really hold all of the ""action"" in that everyone is killed in the last 20-30 minutes.  And unlike Goodfellas or Casino, there is no anti-climax...it just ends.After watching the film, you're left wondering...why?  What was the point of all that?In my opinion, alot more could have been done with this storyline.  It's a film worth seeing, but it's not one you'll watch over and over like Casino, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver or any other better films by Scorsese."	3.0	Nothing Special	2007-02-24	10	1	9
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38U7Z88Q1MDWL	Cody Patton	The Departed is, in short, a stunning achievement from director Martin Scorsese, who gleefully returns to the hard-hitting gangster genre that made him famous. Joining him in his return is one of the better casts you'll likely find in one movie, and all of these elements combined make this one a must see.I don't usually give a plot description because anyone who has read this far down the page probably already knows as much or more than they wanted without actually seeing the film. To put it simply, Jack Nicholson plays the only clearly definable bad-guy in the film. Everyone else is morally iffy at best. This is definitely not a movie for those seeking characters to admire or root for, although it's so involving and played so well that you'll likely find yourself rooting for just about everyone regardless.The performances in this film make this film, period. Jack Nicholson is spectacular as only Jack can be. He's basically here to remind the audience what a commanding and terrific actor he is, especially as a villain. He's equally terrifying and hilarious and, as always, it seems so effortless. Matt Damon also continues to prove his chops in a tricky role of dual personalities and dual motives. He brings across both his Good Will Hunting charm and his Jason Bourne brooding to great effect. His role is complex, to say the least, and you don't really know his true nature until the climax.The real star of this show, however, turns out to be Leonardo DiCaprio.  His outstanding performance is a revelation of his true talent, and it's safe to say that I was absolutely blown away by it. He perfectly blends a tough guy (and he is tough) with a regular guy that wants no part of all of that ugliness. He is completely desperate throughout, both in his current situation caught torn between cops and gangsters, as well as his long-time desire to rid himself of his family's shameful legacy. DiCaprio makes you believe all of this from beginning to end, and if any acting awards are handed out for this film, they should go to Leo (sorry Jack)!The Departed also benefits from an unusually stellar supporting cast. Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin could easily headline their own film, but they all shine as role players in this one. Relative newcomer Vera Farmiga holds her own pretty well as the only female, which is pretty impressive considering that alone, not to mention the quality and reputation of the all-male cast she has to contend with.This movie is definitely not for children or the squeamish. It's violent, gritty, brutal, sexually charged, and almost every other word is four-letters. This is easily distinguishable as a Scorsese picture and is for mature adults that can enjoy this sort of thing and not take it too seriously. That said, any takers will be pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.The Departed is definitely not an indie movie and never feels like one. This is pure old-fashioned Hollywood in the best tradition. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking: Hollywood is anything but consistent & these days rarely of any real quality. Granted, but every once in a while a movie like this is made and reminds us that when the stars align in the right way, it is worth the price of admission and then some.	5.0	The Departed delivers the cast, and they deliver the goods!	2006-10-09	7	5	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A39AWL2FKWDFK6	Cory D. Slipman	"Martin Scorsese once again delivers an outstanding Oscar worthy effort in his interpretation of the Hong Kong produced thriller ""Infernal Affairs"".  ""The Departed"" is a convoluted crime thriller surrounding the infiltration of the Massachusetts State Troopers by Irish racketeer Frank Costello who in turn also has a mole planted within his organization courtesy of the Mass. Troopers.Costello played by the most talented actor gracing the silver screen today, Jack Nicholson, has groomed Colin Sullivan, a young fatherless Boston kid.  Sullivan played by Matt Damon evolves into an aspiring and rapidly rising officer with the Mass. Troopers.  He provides Costello with essential inside info to run his criminal empire.Meanwhile young trooper Billy Costigan, played by the extemely accomplished Leonardo DiCaprio is recruited to worm into Costello's crime empire.  Coming from a well known, by both cops and hoods, Irish family he is disgraced and incarcerated to help build up a suitable criminal background.  Working undercover clandestinely for Capt. Queenan played by Martin Sheen and his cohort the hyperactive and wisecracking Sgt. Dignam played excellently by Mark Wahlberg, DiCaprio is their eyes and ears.Both Costello and the Troopers ironically believe that their respective organizations are both populated by an informant.  Damon and DiCaprio are simultaneously commissioned to detect the other.  In a thrilling cat and mouse game the players manuever like pieces on a chessboard to elude unearthing.  Cynically, both Damon and DiCaprio confide in the same police psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga.This violent passion play set against the backdrop of the streets of Boston, is just another demonstration of the stupendous skills of the masterful Scorsese, especially in this milieu.  The acting performances were terrific most notably by Nicholson and DiCaprio.  The underrated Alec Baldwin also proves his mettle as Damon's boss Capt. Ellerby."	5.0	Superb interwoven drama of cops and criminals	2006-10-24	0	0	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3SFO2GSP5CVSM	"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom"""	As for anything `deeper,' in a film like this one cannot really dig into issues like cultural identity, or masculinity and violence, because, while they are there, they are there at such a superficial level (as opposed to, say, the same theme of violence in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, explored at a far deeper level). On a technical level, the film does employ music well, and the film succeeds with its many quick cuts, even if more longer paced scenes should have been interspersed to let the actors truly act and cogitate on their lives, beyond the overacting DiCaprio does on Fermiga's couch. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus does his usual competent job, especially in the retro look of some scenes, which open and close with irises.The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is naturally bloated. There are not enough extras to need a second disk, and furthermore, for a two disk set, they commit the ultimate crime: no film commentary by Scorsese nor any of the leads. There are nine deleted scenes prefaced by Scorsese's reasons for omission, a profile called Scorsese On Scorsese, a documentary on the criminal this film was based upon: Boston crime kingpin, James `Whitey' Bulger, a documentary on what influenced Scorsese's crime films, and the theatrical trailer. Solid stuff, but for two disks, more- especially an audio commentary, should be standard issue. But, were the movie better, the gripes re: the DVD package would be minimal.As it is, The Departed is good Hollywood fluff, yet, given that it's Scorsese, more is expected, although I have the sinking feeling that, like Woody Allen, he will never produce another masterpiece. This film follows a standard cops and crooks formula, which, in and of itself, is not a bad thing- consider the 1997 crime masterpiece, L.A. Confidential. The difference is that where that film took a genre formula and twisted it from pulp melodrama into real drama, via the writing and performances, as well as ending the film with a satisfying twist that was unexpected in the small, even if expected in the large (the good guys won), The Departed does the inverse, never rising above melodrama (even if good), and ending the film with a bad twist, of the worst deus ex machina sort. If you watch the film, don't expect much of an aesthetic not intellectual rush, only some mildly entertaining moments, crafted really well. If you want the former, go watch some earlier films from the Scorsese canon. Unfortunately, given his recent output, that last line was also likely seen coming from a mile away.	3.0	Solid	2010-09-01	6	4	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if they will be found out.  The acting is so good it keeps you riveted to the screen.I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it. Every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life. Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot.I do agree with the Amazon reviewers here who think it's a sad comment this won ""Picture Of The Year."""	3.0	The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed'	2007-09-08	15	10	5
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"This is a highly regarded film that has an almost agonizingly tight story line, even at two and a half hours.  The thing just never lets up.  Every one of the main characters is dancing on a knife's edge wearing roller skates.  It seems like every role in this movie is played by a star even though some are not household names.  The quality of the acting is superb.  I suppose that it helps being given such well written characters.  Since the movie won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay as well as nominated for Best Supporting Actor, well, it doesn't need my little bit of praise.If you liked ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", you will know what to expect here.  While there is plenty of blood, it isn't quite as gruesome as the other two.  No heads in vices or ice picks to the back of the head.  Plenty of punching, kicking, shooting, but the greater monstrosities are implied.  This is more about the emotional strain on all the characters.  Some seem to need the adrenalin rush of the danger while it tears the lives of others to pieces.Still, being a Scorsese film, the dialogue is filled to about half full with F-words.  I know that the movies would have us believe that is how people really talk.  Maybe some do, but not everyone.  I guess Martin Sheen's Captain Queenan didn't, but it is hard to tell because there is so much of it.  It becomes numbing in its ugliness after awhile.  Especially if you and your friends don't use that kind of language in everyday life.It is hard to single out one role for praise, because they really are all played superbly.  However, Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello is indelible.  Nicholson knows how to play it straight while going right up to going over the top, but not going over.  Still, Costello is a great monster.So, if you like this sort of thing, this is a great work.  If you don't, you had best avoid it."	5.0	"If you liked ""Wise Guys"" and ""Casino"", you will probably like this.  More emotionally taut and a bit less gruesome."	2007-03-12	9	4	5

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RLK9KKVGEETZ	"C. Tsao ""Seaview1"""	No one has depicted the modern underworld better than film maestro Martin Scorsese who has melded cinematic acumen with his Italian-Catholic upbringing to form a trilogy of unparalleled morality plays: Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino.  The trilogy has become a quartet by default as the director tackles the Asian cult classic, Infernal Affairs, and has fashioned The Departed, a film so good up until its stunning conclusion, it almost can't possibly live up to its steadily built, character driven narrative.Set in Boston, mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) rises from small time hood to major crime boss.  He befriends and mentors a boy, Colin Sullivan, who, as a grown man (Matt Damon) has studied his way to the State Police academy.  Simultaneously, another young man, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is about to graduate as a policeman.  A task force is formed to build a case against Costello.  Led by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), Sullivan and Costigan are recruited for the team separately and unbeknownst to each other.  Sullivan takes advantage of his status by tipping off Costello and keeping the kingpin one step ahead of the law.  Costigan infiltrates Costello's crew while Sullivan ironically leads an internal investigation into probable traitors/informants in the police department.  Soon, Costello and Sullivan realize that there is a `mole' in their own ranks too, but who can it be?  It becomes a perverse game of cat and mouse as the policemen try to expose each other.  Furthermore, Sullivan begins dating Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a police shrink who also counsels and then forms a bond with Costigan.  Realizing that he is about to be discovered, Costigan wants to be extracted by Queenan who senses that the situation is desperate.  As the task force closes on Costello, Sullivan zeros in on Costigan's identity by tailing Queenan, and thus good and evil are set on a collision course with startling, tragic finality.Here we have a dichotomy or duality of two men, Sullivan and Costigan, both intelligent, well read, and streetwise, who happen to be on opposing sides and for a majority of the story, unaware of each other's identity.  Costigan is the noble undercover cop whose life is in ever increasing peril and Sullivan is the hotshot policeman who will do anything to protect Costello.  Then there are the surrogate fathers as Nicholson's Costello mentors Sullivan while Sheen's Captain Queenan shepherds Costigan.  It is amusing to see how Costello sort of adopts Costigan and Queenan is the elder to Sullivan at the police station.  It is a parallel family nucleus turned inside out.The acting is simply put-great.  Jack Nicholson convincingly portrays a powerful mob boss with utter arrogance and ruthlessness. His dialogue is chilling and at times outrageously funny.  Damon, in his old stomping grounds, sports a New England accent and does a very credible job as the heavy.  DiCaprio demonstrates an ever-growing maturity in his roles; his recent partnership with Scorsese is proving fruitful (Gangs of New York, The Aviator).  You have to hand it to Scorsese as one of the few directors who can attract the best actors who are dying to work with him.  How else could such lead actors as Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin (who is a riot as a profanity-laced FBI boss), and Mark Wahlberg accept what are essentially supporting roles!The film does miss on a couple points.  It would have meant more if the relationship of Madolyn and Sullivan had been explored with more depth, and the emergence of Costigan in this unlikely triangle would have had more poignancy. Likewise, at the end, those relationships are left unclear and never fully explored as much as we want after we get so involved in these characters good or bad as they might be.  The film is a little long but never uninteresting, and when it reaches its astonishing ending, it is sudden and jarring in unexpected ways that reach Shakespearean proportions.Scorsese is still very much in command of his medium, as he will throw in a cinematic device like an iris-in shot or freeze a frame here or there. (Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, his long time collaborator, is in fine form juggling a dozen characters and maintaining the tension at a very high level for a long time, no easy feat.)  Though Scorsese's early Mean Streets (1973) was a fictional tale of low level hoods, it was also semi-autobiographical in its depiction of the people he knew.  Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) took a semi-documentary approach that held a fascination of real life events amid a dramatic storyline.  In terms of structure, The Departed, while similar in spirit and energy to his previous crime dramas, shows Scorsese fabricating essentially a purely fictitious story, and as always, he has a knack for depicting the inner workings of organized crime with realistic bravado.There are echoes of the films, The Corruptor (featuring Wahlberg), Donnie Brasco and Reservoir Dogs (also a Hong Kong inspired plot) with their questions of loyalty and betrayal.  While earlier police corruption stories were told primarily from the police/protagonist's point of view like Serpico or the great Prince of the City, The Departed takes an equal time approach with its protagonists and antagonists.The movie contains raw violence including a brief but action packed climax.  The profanity is excessive but realistic, and at times there are amusing cussing matches between the various factions.  It's hard to wrap your arms around The Departed because there's just so much to savor and admire while also wishing that the radical change in tone at the end weren't so jarring to the rhythm of the plot.  It's basically a film about rats, and you know what happens to rats.	4.0	THE DEPARTED - Scorsese's Gangs of Boston	2006-10-07	4	1	3

It's been too long since he did a good old fashioned bad-a**ed mob movie, and no one does it like he does.  The cinematography was sweet, the soundtrack was your usual old rock set, the story extremely well-written and riveting, and every performance was perfect.  This is officially one of the best movies he's made (the others being ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas,"" all in my opinion of course).  From the beginning of ""The Departed"" you get sucked right into the world of organized crime, police corruption, and some intense cat-and-mouse action.  While the movie is two and a half hours long, it does not drag on in the least bit, because Scorsese has that way of making every scene worth seeing.  If you can handle nonstop profanity and some often-times brutal violence, then definitely check this out, because there's a lot more to this movie than gore and ""the f-word.""

Unlike a recent reviewer, I thought this was one of the most focused films he has ever done (unlike Goodfellas and Casino, which could only be described as sprawling...brilliant, yes, but sprawling).  Yeah, it was long, but the screenplay and directing were very taut---the plot moved and there were no dull moments and everything made complete sense in the end.  (I would describe it as an extremely well-constructed puzzle where all the pieces fit by the end...unlike the Good Shepard, which was also a good movie but highly confusing at times).

I've seen more plot, and less bloodshed, in PETA slaughterhouse videos.""The Departed""'s appeal is strictly to those who like watching heads explode on camera and think that if a movie uses every naughty word in the book -- in every line -- that makes it deep and profound. Anyone who swallowed ""The Departed"" needs to have his stomach pumped.Good grief. Shakespeare, the Greek tragedies, classics like ""The Third Man"" would be lost on these people. As would a truly fine movie from 2006, ""The Lives of Others"", beside which ""The Departed"" looks, at best, amateurish and adolescent.I want my money back. And I saw this movie for free.I was so bored I started rearranging the groceries in my bag about ten minutes in. I looked at my watch at least half a dozen times. I thought up drinking games you could play every time Jack Nicholson utters the word *&^%.Several characters are shot -- or dropped -- to death on camera. A man's eyes are poked out. One character is reduced to a drug dependent, quivering wreck. I didn't care.I was amazed at how much I didn't care. I thought about why. I examined the desert emptiness of the script, other than for its resplendently brandished naughty words; reflected that the plot was so bankrupt it could be in chapter 11; I noted how absent characterization was, except to mete out how often each character said %$#^, or his posture when exploding a head.I pondered gossip column narratives involving Alec Baldwin and remembered how cute Mark Wahlberg was in that Calvin Klein ad; I wondered if Leo were still dating the model.An hour into the marathon that was this Guantanamo torture, I realized that I had been so pounded into boredom and apathy that the only thing that would have aroused me was if the entire oh-so-manly cast were, suddenly, to don black net hose and stilletoes, and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style.I hoped against hope that Leslie Nielsen would appear and reveal the entire thing to be a very obscure farce whose humor would gel once Nielsen put it all into ""Airplane""-esque perspective.Was Martin Scorcese trying to prove his own manhood by creating a dystopic Disneyland in which every ride is manned by a cop or a mafioso exploding heads and blurting out swear words?Scorcese insults manhood worse than Andrea Dworkin.As for art? I guess Scorcese never heard the phrase, ""less is more.""As it happens, I had just seen 1947's ""The Third Man"" the night before. ""The Third Man"" is black and white; its budget, compared to ""The Departed""'s, was tiny. The cast, excepting Orson Welles, consisted of character actors or unknowns.In ""The Departed,"" Jack Nicholson, playing a Very Bad Man, toys with a severed human hand. What hits you is not the shock and awe the scene demands, but the pathos that the movie is so desperately needy for its audience to respond, and so without skill at provoking that response, that it resorts to the kind of gorey tricks a Halloween prankster would pull.In ""The Third Man,"" Orson Welles delivers ""the cuckoo clock speech.""

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"The blurb for ""The Departed"" states that this is director Martin Scorsese's best effort since ""Goodfellas"".  Excuse, Me!  Since Goodfellas Scorsese's output includes ""Cape Fear"" (1991), ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993), ""Casino""(1995), ""Kundun"" (1997), ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999), ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), and ""The Aviator""(1994).  Not a stinker in the bunch.  In my personal opinion Scorsese probably deserved the Best Picture Oscar on at least six occasions:  ""Mean Streets"" (1973);""The Sting"" won, ""Taxi Driver (1976);""Rocky"" won, ""Raging Bull"" (1980);""Ordinary People"" won,  ""The King of Comedy"" (1983);""Terms of Endearment won, ""Goodfellas""(1990);""Dances with Wolves"" won, and ""The Aviator"" (1994);""Million Dollar Baby"" won.  Five actors have taken home gold from Scorsese films:  Ellen Burstyn, ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore""(1974), Robert DeNiro, ""Raging Bull"" (1980), Paul Newman, ""The Color of Money"" (1986), Joe Pesci, ""Goodfellas""(1990), and Cate Blanchett, ""The Aviator"" (1994).  Put this in perspective, Steven Spielberg who some consider America's finest director never delivered an Oscar for any of his actors.  The highest compliment that can be paid to Scorsese is that Daniel Day-Lewis came out of his self-imposed sabbatical to appear in ""Gangs of New York"".  So now Scorsese has joined the Avildsens and Costners with a best director Oscar.  When Marty won it was kind of a bittersweet moment.  For sure it was a long time coming.  ""The Departed"" was most certainly the best film of the nominated five, though I have a soft spot for ""Little Miss Sunshine"".  In my mind, though, the best picture of 2006 was ""Pan's Labyrinth"".  ""The Departed"" to me didn't hold up to Scorsese's stringent standards.  One quibble I had was Scorsese's use of rock music that in previous films acted as a Greek Chorus to the action on screen.  Here this same device added nothing to the film.  Maybe Sorsese should have enlisted Robby Robertson for his input.  Also, the film's content didn't seem to justify it's running time.  Those reservations aside the film's main strengths were William Monahan's adaptation of ""Infernal Affairs"" and the superb ensemble cast.  Monahan took the basic plot from the Hong Kong thriller and fleshed out the characters and added new and intriguing twists to the story.  Much has been made of the actors on hand but I'd like to cite Matt Damon for particular praise.  His sleazy cop is a work of great subtlety and nuance.  Check Damon out in Robert DeNiro's ""The Good Shepherd"" where his understated work brings to mind Gene Hackman in ""The Conversation"".  I guess I'll just conclude by saying justice was finally served but it was too long coming."	5.0	In Praise of Scorsese	2007-03-11	7	3	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2CNQ1JV16GHW2	David Cady	"As police thrillers go, ""The Departed"" ain't bad.  The script is intelligent and twisty, and the Boston ambience (as far as this New Yorker is concerned) is an interesting change.  Damon and DiCaprio are terrific, as always, and there's good supporting work by Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen.  But Nicholson's doing a Nicholson imitation and he wears out his welcome awfully fast.  Vera Farmagi, as talented as she is, is miscast as the romantic interest; she seems too old and matronly to attract either guy's attentions.  And in spite of the Oscar nomination, I think Wahlberg's way over the top (but not in a good way).  On the whole, the testosterone runs just a little too high throughout most of the film.  There's none of the nuance and subtlety one expects from a Scorsese film.  (Nicholson playing with a dismembered hand is just one example of the...uh, heavy-handedness.)  And the film's final shot is simply unworthy of a filmmaker of Scorses's caliber.  But you'll never be bored, and you might even be surprised now and then.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3DD70OOO17HHZ	"Declan Gallagher ""D"""	It's nice to see a movie, this day in age, where action, comedy, drama, plot twists, and many different actors are balanced nicely, and a movie that doesn't totally screw up in the second half. I have to admit, I was worried during the first half. By the time the titles comes up on screen, you forget that it hasn't come up yet. Normally, the title is shown in the first two minutes. Here, it comes only after a lengthy story set-up. After this scene, a few other sequences detail the worst possible aspects of a movie. There's loud rap music, so loud that it is not in the background, but covering the dialogue. A nasty remark is made about Puerto Ricans, and although the rap music stops full-on, the racial comments keep coming. The first half of the movie is great, mostly because you have no idea what is going on. Random text messages are sent, people have conversations about things that don't seem to relate to the plot, and random acts of violence knit the various characters together (i.e. two men are beaten to death by one guy, and the bodies are found by a second guy, whom the first guy happens to be trying to arrest.) I worried that all of this would screw itself in the second half. So many things were being introduced that a less talented director would have surely left plot strands dangling.But then the second half hits, with a glorious jolt of humor, violence, and great acting. In the same moment. So, in that respect, the movie is a relief. It's far more enjoyable upon a second viewing when you know that things won't be ruined. It's also better to watch it on DVD than in the theater, because when I saw it in the theater, I missed alot of conversation, and on DVD I could go back and clear up plot points. But I'm digressing.	5.0	A Violently Nasty Film (That's A Good Thing), But Leagues Above Scorsese's Last Two Films	2006-12-23	0	0	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1FF2KROA1D87	Denise P	"This is a present day cops, gangs, crime and corruption type of film.It's been done many times but the genre always entertains. And the subject matter always includes violence and profanity.It's a Martin Scorsese (film director) remake of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"". I have no criticisms of Scorsese's version since I haven't seen the original. But if you're not willing to let this movie take you to South Boston with these characters, you won't like the film.When Leo's character got knocked around, and Mark's character berated Leo's and when Matt's character was sweating bullets to try to save his skin again, I felt like I was in Boston beside each one. Even though there are a few weak moments in the movie. It took me there so I liked it.Leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) did a great job playing the under dog. Matt Damon is great. After seeing him in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", I new he could play the despicable type.Mark (Wahlberg) and Jack (Nicholson) were exceptional too.I was surprised some were offended by the language in this type of film.I didn't hear anymore profanity then I'd hear on the Soprano's or The Wire.The cursing in The Departed is used for camaraderie or frustration which I think is normal for the roles portrayed and the genre.Some may have run out to see it because the film received Oscar nominations without knowing the subject matter.I would suggest some of the other Oscar nominated films instead of ""The Departed"" if this type of movie is not something you'd normally choose.""The Devil Wears Prada"",Genres: Comedy, Drama, PG13 (Oscar nominated leading Actress and Costume Design) ,""The Illusionist"", Genres: Drama, Mystery, Romance Thriller, PG13 (nominated for Cinematography), ""Marie Antoinette"", Genres: Biography, Drama, History, PG13 (nominated for Costume Design), ""The Prestige"", Genres: Drama, Fantasy, Thriller, PG13 (nominated for Art Direction and Cinematography), ""The Queen"", Genres: Biography, drama, PG13 (Nominated for Leading Actress, Costume Design, Directing, Best Picture, Music, Original Screenplay).

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A20Q4HD6A2B8W9	Dennis Brandt	"A good story, a stellar cast performing brilliantly, the director of one of the greatest films of all time (The Godfather). . .  What could go wrong.  Well, a lot.  If you love hearing the ""F"" word, this is your film.  Its frequency of use was both unnecessary and boring.  (Scorcese created The Godfather without using it and became a directorial legend.)  If you love a film with fast, confusing cuts that bounce between time, then this is the one for you.  If you love cops that act as bad as the criminals, buy this one today.  The film improved as it went along, but the first half hour was slow and jumbled thanks to the cutting.  It finally settled in only to end absurdly with almost everyone being revealed as a double agent and/or murderer.  Mark Wahlburg's Sgt. Dingham character was over written and drastically over played.  His character should have been first to die in the film.  If it weren't for the performances, this film would rate a 2, although we've seen Nicholson in this type of role many times before.Addendum:  Of course I am wrong in saying that Scorsese directed The Godfather.  That was Coppola, and I knew that.  Brain cramp.  The opposite of foul-mouthed movies is not Walt Disney, as one of my critics has noted.  I might retort that, if you wish to hear that word in abundance, watch porno.  As Alfred Hitchcock stated: If you portray a man entering a meeting carrying a briefcase that the audience knows contains a ticking time bomb, that is what builds the tension, not the explosion itself.  Indeed, it is anti-climactic.  Film makers have largely forgotten that principle, and audiences, now with shortened attention spans by feeding on a diet of such films, demand violence as an inevitable end.  The Departed is still a poorly constructed film, and the police as portrayed were, to a man, as despicable as the criminals."	3.0	Could have been so much better	2009-10-09	9	3	6

Transferring the Chinese triads to the Irish mob was clever on the part of the screenwriter, another Irishman and Scorsese has done a masterful job of combining his themes of loyalty and betrayal into this gangster film.  The HD-DVD version is excellent with fine details in contrast & color (you can see the knits in Damon's shirt in the beginning of the film!!).

It's been so long, I don't even remember if he lived or died. Hopefully died, I guess.Damon & DiCaprio were wonderful as the two cops who were good or bad, or both. Who knows? I didn't. Nicholson is Nicholson, and he's always good, even when he's playing bad, which he does so good in this movie. It's a relative travesty that Wahlberg got the nod over Nicholson.When I saw American Beauty in 1999 I walked out of the AMC 24 and I KNEW it would be an Oscar contender, which it was.

He'd already won the Academy award for Best Director before I saw the film and even though I hadn't seen it, I thought it was well-deserved and long overdue praise. Needless to say, when I saw it listed as a film choice, while on an international flight, I was elated. Imagine my disappointment when I realized this star-studded film was not one of Scorsese's best efforts, which is odd because the performances seemed on target, especially the Mark Walhberg character. I don't know if it was the editing or what, but this movie just didn't do it for me. It was too slow in places, some scenes were not sufficiently developed and other scenes seemed to use violence as a mask for their lack of development. And the ending was terrible! This was a huge departure from the guy who gave us films like The Aviator, Gangs of New York, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc. I don't think it's so bad that you shouldn't see it for yourself, after all it did win an Academy award, but, I think you will be disappointed.	2.0	A departure	2007-04-29	12	9	3

The character-play between Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon is some of the best I've seen in years with a plot as twisted as Miller's crossing.

If you're a fan of counter espionage plots you will enjoy the dance between DiCaprio and Damon as well as Sheen and Nicholson. The drama is riveting and suspenseful--rarely leaving you a chance to relax. Wahlberg does an admirable job adding that essential spice to the recipe of intensity and pressure upon the characters.

Knouse	"This film has intelligence, good acting, a more than competent director (legendary, in fact)...so why the average rating?  Because...in essence this is just another cop drama that drags on for about thirty minutes too long and with far too many characters for me to care about any one in particular.  I remember leaving the theater thinking that it was all pulled together nicely but it was also nothing remarkable.  Martin Scorsese's best films remain ""Raging Bull"", ""Taxi Driver"", and ""Goodfellas"".  ""The Departed"" comes nowhere near the level of those three masterworks.  For that matter, as hit-and-miss as Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" was, it was ten times more ambitious than ""The Departed.""  All in all, I sincerely don't care if I ever see this film again."	3.0	I left the theater shrugging my shoulders.	2007-02-15	36	21	15

Lange ""volleyball mom"""	It's a good thing my husband and I watched this on DVD in our living room so that we could keep rewinding whenever we didn't follow something (which was often).  There was a scene where Jack Nicholson walks over to two priests in a restaurant and hands them a piece of paper.  We had to rewind about 5 times before we could pause at the right spot to see what was on the paper.  The acting was great, but the plot was too disjointed and confusing.  To add to the confusion, Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio even look alike!  We're not prudes, but the constant use of the F-word was wearisome after awhile and the fact that literally none of the characters had any redeeming values was depressing.  To sum up the plot:  Everybody's crooked, lots of blood, lots of profanity, everybody (almost) ends up dead.  The End.	3.0	Watch on DVD so you can rewind	2007-08-27	4	2	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"This was my first foray into Martin Scorsese territory in years--since I fled, screaming, after being bored to tears by the director's insipid ""Gangs of New York.""  And now I've got Scorsese--and annoying Leonardo DiCaprio--teaming up again, only this time a boatload of Hollywood talent is in tandem.  The result:  A gritty, good cop/bad cop thriller that had me at the edge of my coveralls; THE DEPARTED delivers the goods enthusiastically, augmented by nonstop F-bombs and enough over-the-top Beantown twang to shame a sold out Fenway.DiCaprio and Matt Damon headline this flick, and both give solid performances as two cops--one corrupt, the other bipolar but honest--literally looking for each other.  In fact, this is the very first time DiCaprio actually looks, and comes across, as a grownup--not some gangly adolescent running around on an ocean liner.  Yet Jack Nicholson (and doesn't he always?) creepily steals the show, playing an underworld kingpin--the target of an intense police investigation--aided and abetted by a very capable, and nasty, lieutenant (Ray Winstone).  Nicholson chews up every scene he's in with an eery dominance that lends a plethora of cred to the plot and story--a story that moves with breakneck speed.Yet this movie is populated with other heavy hitters that make it so much fun to watch, movers and shakers like Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.  These guys drop their F-bombs and answer their cell phones and contribute to the story in grand fashion.  With his stellar cast Scorsese takes you through a breathtaking, incredibly violent ride, culminating in an ending that took me completely by surprise--and absolutely made me go, ""Wow.""As this is the two-disc special edition you'll also enjoy (or maybe not) several deleted scenes, some of the cast talking about gangster movies, and Martin Scorsese talking about. . .Martin Scorsese.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ADKZOXAOV8EXD	Doctor.Generosity	"I remember a course in college which showed us classic Greek sculpture at its peak and then how it deteriorated over time, becoming a parody of itself, embellished with fancy stuff after the heart and coherence had run downhill. So it is with director Martin Scorsese. His early work had the purity and tightness of art. Now we get Hollywood dreck like ""The Departed."" This was produced as a Hollywood insider tribute set up to honor Scorsese; that he received an Academy Award for it was a foregone conclusion, more a 'lifetime achievement award' than a true upvote for the film.It's unfortunate a Scorcese tribute would turn out to be so mediocre, poorly designed, overly long, and overpacked with big names, none of whom does a very convincing job. It's clear they are all just putting in cameos to give homage to Scorsese. Too many hard to believe plot twists, such as the hero and villain both somehow falling for the same woman - really? Way too much pointless violence, which just becomes fatiguing. Some producer, aware the movie was flagging, punched the ""add more stars"" and ""add more violence"" buttons too many times. Of the big names, only Decaprio offers anything like a solid performance; not even Jack Nicholson is very good here, playing the crime boss as a cutrate Batman Joker. Mark Wahlberg is particularly offensive as an overly aggressive, overly foul mouthed cop who cannot contain a never-ending stream of verbal abuse. This is so overblown I almost laughed. An appropriate part for ex-skinhead street thug Wahlberg, but just not credible.

I owned four blu-ray movies so far.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon keep me guessing a lot. I'm pretty glad that Alec Baldwin is in this movie, and he is doing his best and I remembered him from Beetlejuice when he was skinny and look younger... but this movie everyone looks different and does the best job in this movie. I thought Anthony Anderson might kill this movie alittle bit but I dont see any flaw, so I'm glad he is doing great so the movie is flawless victory!!

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"The Good:* The Acting.  It's time to recognize DiCaprio as one of our most solid actors. Say whatever you'd like about Titanic (which was quite good), he's proven his chops and range in a diverse group of movies including Gilbert Grape, Man in the Iron Mask, the Aviator, (the sorely underrated) Catch Me If You Can, and others. DiCaprio shines here, too.Oh yeah, and the others in this movie aren't bad actors either, like Damon, Sheen (the elder), Wahlberg and Jack frikken' Nicholson. With a cast like this, you *ought* to be able to come up with a good film. All great actors, all great performances.* The Plot (to a point).  The premise is solid; you can see why this got made, and so many big names attached to it. The idea is that the mob and the Boston PD both have undercover informants who've deeply infiltrated the other side. While they experience very different lives (the faux-cop lives in a high-rise apartment; the real-cop/sham gangster lives in the slums) externally, they both feel the pressures of leading double-lives, etc. The action really picks up when they each catch a whiff of the other's existence, and it becomes a game of who will smoke out the other first. The plot is intricate and complicated, but in a good way, as the characters strive to one-up each other, and we're always left guessing as to who's playing whom. This is a wonderful plot and idea... which... never actually gets paid off (see: The Ugly).The Bad:* The Editing.  I knew the film would win for Best Editing at the Oscars (and it did), and it's a shame, really. I'll say this: the editing is *noticable*, and that, there, is exactly my problem with it. It is my belief that, in ordinary circumstances, editing should be one of those things that goes by, unnoticed, in a film. Editing should proceed in the background. Like referees at a sporting event, if you're noticing them a lot, it probably means they're doing something wrong, and in any event they're taking away from the sport, itself. You know--the thing you've paid your ticket for. With this movie, I wanted the plot and characters, etc., not to see a Film Editor's proof-of-concept.In the Departed, we get an insane amount of quick cuts with very little to establish scenes; we're just thrown from one scene to the next, often in the middle of dialogue. There's almost no changing of pace to be found; the movie is run, uniformly, at a sprint's pace, despite being of marathon length. Also, there are times when minutes elapse between cuts... and there's a few times when significantly longer periods of time whisk away. There's nothing in the editing, etc., to suggest any such thing, and so contrived lines of dialogue are thrust in to let us all know that ""well, George, it's been at least a year since we've seen each other... huh?"" Lame.After the movie was over, neither I, nor my friend watching with me, nor my fiancee, had any real handle on how long the events of the movie took place over. Based on the frenetic editing, it could've been a week. (Well, the 'adult' parts, at least.)* The 'Love' Triangle.  So, throughtout the movie, Damon and DiCaprio manage to fall for the same woman. Now... I could say that this hurt the film's sense of ""verisimilitude"" by being way, way, way over-the-top/coincidental. And, yes. For a movie so determined to be ""gritty"" and ""realistic,"" the idea that these two opposite sides of the same coin should manage to meet, fall for, and sucessfully woo the same woman, in all of Boston, is just ridiculous to the upteenth degree.But beyond that, the love triangle contributes nothing to the plot. Oh, sure, I know some will say that it gives the characters depth, etc. But really? Not necessary. There was already more than enough character material. And the romance doesn't contribute much in the way of characterization or anything else. I was hopeful at one point, because there was an earlier mention of impotence on Damon's part--which could lead one to compare against DiCaprio's apparent virility (he gets a sex scene, unlike Damon), and come to some sort of conclusion about how ""crime doesn't pay"" or something like that. Except that: Damon's relationship lasts over a year, upto engagement and pregnancy, so....Now, we could construct some sort of conspiracy theory idea where Damon was actually impotent for the entire stretch of their relationship, and so the unborn child is actually DiCaprio's (and I lean towards this last idea, at least), but the idea that Damon could've had this relationship for a year without consummation is... not likely. Also: he thinks the child is his, so he must know something about his chances in that regard.Now, all of this might be forgiven had the female lead been interesting. But, she's not. Her character is a complete cipher. She doesn't take charge. Doesn't accomplish anything. She's simply another chessboard upon which DiCaprio and Damon play out their little match, and she, herself, adds next-to-nothing to the events of the film. Near the end, there's even the suggestion that she might have some relevance as she receives a Mysterious Envelope. Stunningly, that Envelope isn't ever even opened. Someone forgot what you're supposed to do if you introduce a gun in Act One, if you get me...?Finally, there's not even a pay-off to the love triangle. Usually, in dramatic affairs, if you have people in a secret love triangle/affair, you'd want ""the moment of discovery"" where the two competing lovers learn about each other... right? Well, Damon and DiCaprio spend a year loving the same woman, and never find out about each other. Never, not once. As though the entire love triangle weren't a big waste of time to begin with... another strike against the editor: this material should have been cut.The Ugly:* The Ending.  As mentioned above, the plot of the Departed is incredibly complicated. How can a person possibly unravel such a Gordian Knot of intrigue and interesting characterization? It seems like a conundrum without solution, yeah? Unless, of course, you cut the Knot. So, the Departed takes the coward's way out of the sticky situation it's created by simply executing all of its characters, one by one, near the film's conclusion. There's little rhyme or reason to the killing, and it offers nothing in the way of a satisfactory conclusion. You're just: ""Oh. So, they're all dead now, I guess. Probably for the best."" They might as well have had safes drop from the sky on their characters to resolve those pesky conflicts; that, at least, would have been funny.The only one left standing is Mark Wahlberg, like Fortinbras surveying the slaughtered Danes, except without making a lick of sense or providing any commentary or satisfaction. In short, the ending makes no sense. It's a cheap way out of, what was to that point, a good plot. You can hear the writer go ""uh... so... what do I do now? Hmmm... well... what if they all get shot in the head?"" The ending nearly ruins the movie.Overall:The Academy decided that this was the Best Picture of 2006. Who am I to disagree? Well... I suppose that, by virtue of the fact that I saw all of the five best picture nominees, it does give me some right to an opinion. And, before the ceremony, I had the Departed as being #4 out of five (I had it over Babel). It's not a bad picture, and has much to recommend it, but it isn't a complete movie. There are plot elements that come in and go out without relevance, distracting editing and an abyssmal ending which is more about saving the writer from difficulty than providing a satisfactory (or even good, sad) conclusion.The premise and acting are good enough to give the film Four Stars, just not good enough to earn that Fifth.Four Stars."	4.0	The Departed: The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly *SPOILERS*	2007-03-02	14	8	6

I was on the edge of my seat all during the movie and there was more than enough action to keep things rolling every minute.There are very few films which knock my socks off and in 2006 The Departed was the one for me.  In the past, only Crash, Mystic River and Shawshank Redemption (the best film of all) to name a few fit into this genre.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A280GY5UVUS2QH	Doug Anderson	"Jack Nicholson as ""Frank Costello"" goes way over the top in this one (think THE SHINING & WITCHES OF EASTWICK & BATMAN) but then that just might be the thing that makes this film succeed so well.Nicholson is garnering a lot of attention for this role. In recent years it seems like Jack has just been lending his talents out to quirky romantic comedies until something better comes along. Well, The Departed is that something better. Jack just seems so thrilled to be in this movie that he can't stand or sit still. I've never seen a Jack Nicholson role where Jack felt such a compulsive need to be inventive. And it is an exciting thing to see. With a film like this you need a strong charismatic center and there's no one on the planet with more charisma than Jack. You could argue that with a slightly less mannered ""performance"" Jack would have drawn more attention to the character that he was playing instead of attention to himself as an actor capable of doing, and getting away with doing, anything that he wants. But then maybe this is exactly the kind of performance that is needed to make the all-too-familiar goodfella look new and interesting again. I'm wavering with my estimation of Jack's performance but that is maybe what a unique rendering of an all too familiar character makes you do: re-assess why the mobster is such a fascinating film type. This new take on a familiar character challenges the stereotype of what a mob guy can be.  In this film a mob guy can be an artist (both con and graphic), a father, jokester, and most controversial of all, a guy with friends and complex international contacts and business interests in all kinds of places. Its not just Jack's performance that is new but the character itself as written by screenwriter William Monahan (who in turn is not starting from scratch but re-imagining a character originally created by Alan Mak and Felix Chong; who co-wrote the script for ""Internal Affairs"") is something we just haven't seen before.[Exactly who deserves credit for the original elements of this film is a matter generating some debate. It should be noted that many Asian film makers see Scorcese as a huge influence. Certainly with The Departed Scorcese is borrowing a story from those who have borrowed from him, but like any great film maker he makes what he borrows his own. This transcultural borrowing has always existed in all art forms and actually benefits all cultures and allows us to compare how different stories work differently in different cultural contexts. I would recommend seeing both Internal Affairs & The Departed and comparing how the same characters and plot lines can mean very different things in different cultures. This kind of comparitive viewing can actually be very interesting, not to mention commensurate to a greater understanding of our own culture as well as a greater understanding of other cultures, including non-western ones.]DiCaprio (who I did not think was quite right in either GANGS OF NEW YORK or THE AVIATOR) does seem to suit this film's purposes more than he did the former two Scorcese projects. Although, DiCaprio is not an actor who gives you a fully imagined character (not in the way DeNiro does) he is good at playing internally conflicted characters. What DiCaprio does well is convey a sense of unease with himself and thats just what he's supposed to do. His ""Billy Costigan"" is a brainy kid from South Boston who attends the police academy in the hopes of becoming a cop and redeeming the family name (he comes from a long line of mobsters). But his superiors decide that with his family being what it is they cannot trust him and that he'll never be a cop in South Boston. They do give him one option: use your mob pedigree to go undercover for us and infiltrate Frank Costello's bunch of goodfellas. Leo's character accepts this duty only because he has no other choice but he never likes the idea of having to pretend to be the very kind of character that he is trying not to be. Throughout the film Billy Costigan fights a psychic duel with himself as he questions what he is truly made of and where his loyalties really lie and this is only exacerbated by the fact that he never really knows who he can rely on in the department and who he can really trust.  DiCaprio's moments with Nicholson are the stuff of movie legend; these kinds of moments are the reason you still get exicted about movies, and this exciting pairing keeps you on the edge of your seat. Jack plays his role less like a mobster (his own loyalties to crew and comrades are questionable at best) than like a megalomaniac psychotic bent on expanding his prodigious ego into new markets; his real motive seems to be having the ability to shape and govern his own life and the lives of those around him and, ultimately, he sees himself as a kind of untouchable lord of the criminal underworld. A good number of Stones songs on the soundtrack seem to hint toward a correlation between Jack Nicholson and Jumpin'Jack Flash himself. He's an utterly corrupt manipulator who loves molding the new kids on the block in his own image and DiCaprio and Damon are just two of his acolyte/proteges, or so he thinks (and theres the rub). Jack indulges himself in scene after scene but DiCaprio (as an actor and as Billy Costigan) never flinches. If DiCaprio does find himself being handed the statue on Oscar night its, in part, because Nicholson's performance makes his own look like a study in stoic restraint. Though the two performances are entirely different they compliment each other brilliantly.Matt Damon is equally good as ""Colin Sullivan"" but its a thankless role as he's the guy everyone is allowed, even encouraged, to hate. While DiCaprio is a mole in Frank Costello's crew working for the state, Damon plays DiCaprio's opposite number as a mole in the police department working for Frank Costello. So while DiCaprio is set on catching Nicholson, Damon is set on protecting him. Eventually they each realize that their own cover may be blown by the other mole and survival for each depends on who sniffs who out first. And though these two interact mainly via cellphone as they hunt the true identity of the man that is hunting them their personal motives for doing what they do does provide audience members with an interesting compare & contrast scenario. Both kids are from the same neighborhood and both are very gifted but each took a decidedly different turn at a key point in their childhoods. The larger question being asked by Scorcese is to what extent we are each a product of our environments and to what extent we are able to exert some amount of control over our lives but you may not have time to address the larger implications of these questions once the bullets begin to fly.Another performance that is creating a lot of buzz is Vera Farmiga's portrayal of the police psychologist who ends up dating both Sullivan and Costigan. At first she seems like she is just there to draw derisive laughs from both of these tough South Boston natives for being a naive ivy-leaguer attempting to be a do-gooder in a hard as nails precinct. But then we realize that she is actually there to allow us a glimpse of the  vulnerable side of these two moles.  In other words she's there to give us a glimpse of these two guys with their gaurds down. And its in her presence that we learn what each guy is really made of. Its not a large role nor is it even a flashy one as she is there mainly to react to the two guys. But she does a solid job with the role and gives her character a credibility and complexity that is as unusual as it is unexpected. Like everyone else in this film ""Madolyn"" is not exactly certain what she is made of either.This is a great cast no doubt and Scorcese succeeds in getting inventive and entertaining performances from his actors. Its obvious that Scorcese is encouraging his actors to do something original with their parts so that this mob movie will be distinct from others (and Scorcese has plenty of imitators so it is paramount that he do something original with the genre). Having a half dozen eccentrics in one film may seem like overload but no one does anything so over the top that it compromises the overall integrity of the film. Though its chock full of stars and performances (any one of which would have stolen the show in any other film) this still feels like a piece of collaborative team acting. And that is yet another of this films great achievements.This is a surefire hit. Can't wait to see it again."	5.0	Great  American Re-Make of an Asian Original	2006-10-09	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AOZGOFPVAUMTB	Doug Park	"{4.25 stars}THE DEPARTED makes fine use of its high-heavens stellar cast. The way that Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) resemble each other can be confusing but still invokes a sort of ""alter-ego"" effect. Jack Nicholson also gives a commendable performance as aging Boston Irish Mafia boss Costello, as does Martin Sheen as SIU Chief Detective Queenan. One of the most memorable characters of all is Mark Wahlberg as abrasive meanie SIU detective Dignam.A super-violent film without true heroes, THE DEPARTED views like a sort of mini-epic video novel. Although there's no shortage of surprises and turnabouts, it doesn't have the sharp thrills and twists that many cop films do and doesn't need them. Everything develops at a natural but very compelling pace. The loud, profane, wise-cracking Boston dialogue is also something else: Though I wouldn't want to use many of them against my worst enemy, there are some outstanding insults here.As intense as it is, THE DEPARTED goes way beyond the level of a standard good guy cops versus bad guy criminals shoot-'em-up fest. This film tackles some big themes and is very revealing of what a maddening head-muck detective work can be and how destructible everyone is in the end."	4.0	"""I never gave up on anybody who wasn't going down anyway"""	2014-05-14	1	1	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A633NIAR4JJAR	"Dr. Marc Axelrod ""PM"""	"This is an intriguing and sophisticated look at the war between the South Boston Police force and its most dangerous crime ring.Billy Costigan (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is allowed into the force under the condition that he will infiltrate the crime ring's inner circle as an undercover officer (the ring is led by a man named Francis Costello, played by Jack Nicholson).While he is working to gain Costello's trust, it becomes evident that there is a rat for Costello working on the police force (played by Matt Damon). The movie winds its way toward a bloody and penultimate conclusion.The movie is loaded with bad language, violence and bad values, so there's no way I would take a kid to see it. But for a grownup, it is a scary look at a world that we don't always get to see in our neck of the woods, as it were.My favorite character is undoubtedly the police chief (played by Martin Sheen), a devout Catholic who emerges later in the film as a Christ figure of sorts (you'll see why as the plot becomes evident).This is undeniably a well made movie, but it is not for the faint of heart. 4 stars.The movie is called ""The Departed"" because it surveys men and women on both sides of the law who have departed from God and have lost their souls, with the exception of Martin Sheen's character, who dies for one of the Departed."	4.0	Well Made Crime Thriller	2007-01-30	4	3	1

"My wife and I purchased this movie with the expectation that it would be a great movie, a fun couple of hours. It was not. It was simply boring and tiresome. We have all come to expect a great deal from Scorsese. While these expectations are high and maybe unfair, they are fairly earned as Scorsese has provided great movie after great movie. With that in mind, one can safely say this was a letdown of epic proportions. It was a just a rehash of Scorsese's previous movies with a helping of ""southie"" accent thrown on top. It was slow and boring. Skip this one, unless you have a few hours and a couple of bucks to kill. Sorry, but it was this bad.

The characters are quite good and the pace is consistent. There is no room for reflection unless you watch it again and you can watch this film repeatedly. I saw The Gangs of New York but The Departed is so much better. If you liked No Country for Old Men, you'll like The Departed. In both films the characters learn that there are no clean getaways. In this film the story ends when a bent cop finds a former cop in his apartment who promptly executes him. Undoubtedly the former cop received a copy of the tape between the crime boss and his rat and took justice into his own hands.	5.0	Worth the money!	2011-03-24	3	2	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AC1K4OQOZ90RS	"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10"""	"Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film, ""Infernal Affairs,"" is profane, violent, darkly humorous, sexy, and incredibly entertaining.  The theme is an intriguing one.  What if two handsome and brilliant young men both graduate from the Massachusetts State Police Academy but take opposite paths?  One becomes a detective but is really a mole for a big-time mobster.  The other pretends to be a gangster, but is really a cop trying to bring down the aforementioned mob boss.Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, who has been groomed since childhood by kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to infiltrate the cops and feed him secret information.  Sullivan starts out an altar boy, but under Frank's tutelage, he becomes an accomplished liar who sells out his colleagues for personal gain.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan.  His father was an honest man who held a menial job at an airport and refused to do anything illegal, but Billy's uncle was connected to the mob.  Costigan is not warmly welcomed into the police department.  In fact, Sergeant Dignam, played with a nasty and sardonic edge by Mark Wahlberg, mocks Costigan's ambition.  Oliver Queen (Martin Sheen), Dignam's boss, informs Costigan that the only way he will ever be a cop is if he agrees to work under deep cover, pretending to be one of Costello's soldiers but, at the same time, informing on him and helping to bring him down.  In a sense, Sullivan is Costigan's doppelganger, a person who resembles him superficially but embodies everything that Costigan despises.  Costello, who has never had a child, is, in a sense, Sullivan's and Costigan's twisted father figure.Costigan and Sullivan eventually find that living a double life is stressful and dangerous; having to lie constantly takes a terrible toll on one's peace of mind.  Complicating matters further, they both fall in love with the same woman, a beautiful police psychiatrist named Madolyn (Vera Farmiga).  Soon, both Costello and the cops suspect that there are ""rats"" in their organizations, and Sullivan ends up in charge of the search for Costello's mole (himself).  DiCaprio is terrified that his true identity will be discovered and he is desperate to come in from the cold before he ends up on a slab.Does this film sound a tad too complicated?  That it is, but the plot is not the reason to see this terrific movie.  The performances carry the day, with Nicholson playing Costello as a sadistic, lascivious, manipulative, and evil Svengali.  Seeing Nicholson's superlative performance is alone worth the price of admission.  DiCaprio shines as Costigan, an edgy young man whose desperation to escape his past leads him to explore dark corners of his personality that he would prefer not to acknowledge.  Damon is effective as a man who sells his soul to the devil and lives to regret it.  Scorsese does a wonderful job of integrating his large cast seamlessly. The lively screenplay is peppered with hilarious lines that provide needed comic relief and  the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, helps maintain the film's rapid and exciting pace.  The suspense in ""The Departed"" builds relentlessly, just like a Shakespearean tragedy in which an arrogant hero's hubris, greed, and overarching ambition bring him crashing down to earth."	5.0	"""We deal in deception."""	2006-10-27	0	0	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AT6CZDCP4TRGA	Eduarrdo Nietzsche	"This was definitely one of the most gripping and well-crafted cop/crime thrillers I've seen in years---easily on par with the now-classic ""The Usual Suspects"" though quite a bit darker in tone.  Certainly one of Scorsese's best films in a long time, though a lot of the soundtrack seems very, very familiar if you've ever watched ""Goodfellas.""Sidenote: why in God's name they chose a terrible, awful remake of the Pink Floyd classic ""Comfortably Numb"" instead of simply using the studio original eludes me.  This remake features Van Morrison (argh! this is just NOT his natural style or genre) and Roger Waters (who doesn't sound much like himself at all) and just sounds totally cheesy and weak.Other than that, my only other quibbles about this film are with a couple of rather implausible plot twists during the final 10 minutes, and a somewhat Tarantino-esque (think ""Reservoir Dogs"") ending.All very minor quibbles, indeed.  The script, by William Monahan, is flat-out perfect, as are all of the ensemble cast's performances, and when combined with Scorsese's trademark brisk pacing and snappy transitions, makes for a film which had me totally absorbed from the opening credits.  Stark contrast to how most films have a clearly defined ""setup"" first third which is kind of slow, then builds into a big second act where the conflict is played out, and slows again into a short third act plot resolution.  ""The Departed"" is just a hyperkinetic, grab-you-by-the-a$$ movie from the get-go all the way to the closing credits.A big part of its genius, and the reason it's a movie that you can watch over and over again, is that the characters are quite rich and mostly opaque, rather than being easily identifiable, focus-grouped stereotypes as in most mainstream Hollywood films these days.  Also, the dialogue is just stunningly well-written.  There's a lot of detail that you notice with repeated viewings, a lot of things that seemed a bit blurry or uncertain slowly become clearer.  The plot is quite intricate and best of all, totally unpredictable---refreshingly, I had no idea what was going to happen down to the very last frame.Another brilliant feature of this movie is that it has a very morally ambiguous subtext or perspective: there really are no clear good or bad guys, no knights in shining armor or innocent angels.  Every major character retains an extremely engaging element of darkness, shadow, and surprise and unknowability.  The cops and Feds and gangsters are all equally and comically, profane and violent...they're just on opposite teams, or most of them at least.  Even the Vera Farmiga character (this actress is a strangely dazzling and exquisite woman as well as a top-notch actress), has her own darkness.  What a delight, to enter a world of deeply imperfect and more or less impenetrable human beings, rather than good guys on white horses and bad guys in black hats...gasp! Why, I'll be damned, it-it-it's just like...REAL LIFE!!!In short, this film is definitely a keeper, most definitely worth owning.  One of the shortest 2 and 1/2 hours I've spent in a very long time..."	5.0	more or less FLAWLESS...	2008-03-17	10	7	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13E0ARAXI6KJW	Ed Uyeshima	"Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"". Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston-based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences, one is sharing the department's goings-on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans. The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition. The other detective is coiled-to-the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot-headed assistant, Sgt. Dignam, to infiltrate Costello's gang.Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed. The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn. She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor. As you can guess, the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated storylines battling for our attention. One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time-jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling-by-necessity character development.A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan. Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do. If Matt Damon's solid work is slightly less electrifying (with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in ""Good Will Hunting""), it's primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot. Of course, Jack Nicholson is getting the lion's share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello. Whether making subtly threatening non-sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello's path to success with his young cohorts, Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles.As Madolyn, indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl-support stereotype, bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character. In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid-fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable. Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby. It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story. Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, ""The Aviator"" and ""Gangs of New York"", to produce an incredibly taut, character-driven police thriller. It's aces for this kind of work."	5.0	Scorsese Back in Top Form with a Stunning Cast for an Unbelievably Taut Thriller	2006-10-10	3	2	1

It is what I would consider an ultra-violent film, but in a surrealistic way.  Keep in mind it IS a Scorsese film, but in my opinion one of his all time best.  However, as with most mob movies, if you dislike seeing people shot, are very sensitive to violence, etc., stay away.  There is one gratuitous sex scene in the middle of the movie that it could do without, but other than that it is ""just violence"" and language that earned it its R rating.  This is not a family friendly movie, but it IS a phenomenal film.The extras in the two-disc set are nice, but more targeted at Scorsese fans, than general fans of the movie.  There are some deleted scenes which are interesting, and a documentary length item on Scorsese as a filmmaker, among other things.

This film has more twists and turns and revelations in it than you can imagine.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon were excellent.  Jack Nicholson's character was vile and evil and he played it to the tee.  It got to the point in the movie where he was literally walking around covered in blood up to his elbows, and not even caring who saw.  Good cops, bad cops, gangsters, infidelities, betrayals, there isn't one moment that lets up.

This has to be in the top 3!!!When I first saw the trailers for this film on TV I was split down the middle. Being a massive fan of Martin Scorsese I was hooked. Yet never quite being a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio made me a bit indifferent. Then seeing the icon Jack Nicholson tagged to the picture gave my flesh goosebumps. The names Scorsese/Nicholson meant ""Great Movie"" to me. So because of that I avoided any remaining information about the picture so I could walk in opening weekend and be surprised.Right from the outset with Jack's monologue of his harsh outlook on existence I was lost in the world of the South Boston underworld. Through police corruption via Matt Damon's character & vigilance through sacrifice from DiCaprio.The movie further cemented itself in greatness with the amazing supporting cast. Martin Sheen brought in his 'A' game. Excitement and laughter came across me when I saw one of my favorites Alec Baldwin take the screen in a perfect role for him. Marc Walburg stepped up his dramatic chops even though his character most likely came natural for him. Matt Damon played the bit of hidden scumbag quite well. Then the biggest magic of all to me was that Scorsese was finally able to make a DiCaprio fan out of me with a very powerful performance.The story was so intense & alive you are along for the journey the entire time. It's almost as living it through eyes of someone else. The brutal realism of the violence where none of it is played for shock value or over the top theatrics is the final piece of truth that Scorsese uses to bring this all to vibrant yet rough polish.Yet to share one more thing with you all as to how great this film is. During the entire showing the first time I saw it on the big screen. My friend Dougie who tends to talk, talk talk & ramble on & on  & on actually shut his mouth through the whole thing.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BPDFR58H9575	Galina	"In ""The Departed"" (2006) directed by Martin Scorcese, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is young police officer who has been sent undercover to work for a vicious and powerful Boston mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was handpicked by Costello as a young boy and placed to the Police Academy with the intention to infiltrate later the Boston Police Department. One day, two young men will inevitably meet...""The Departed"" is a very good film but sadly, it slows down in the final 20 or so minutes and leaves a viewer (yours truly) with several questions and slightly disappointed. Seems that Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello kept all parts of the movie together and after his departure, it became literally empty. As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form -the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies). The cast is the closest to perfect it could be. As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career. About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, ""The Aviator"", ""Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction."" I am very glad to admit that in ""The Departed"" he is even better - the hell Billy Costigan has lived in working undercover for the devilishly evil Frank Costello was absolutely real, suffocating and palpable. DiCaprio had many scenes with Nicholson and he never got lost next to his celebrated partner.Not as perfect as ""Goodfellas"" which comes to mind while watching ""The Departed"", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I am happy that finally Scorsese has been recognized by the Academy for his directing."	4.0	"""One of us had to die.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3M3VNJT8DZ2PK	Ganondorf	"The plot of the movie was fair but Jack Nicholson's role was a bit disappointing. As far as I am concerned Nicholson always portrays evil characters or mentally ill individuals. He is one of the best actors. That is one reason I wanted to see this movie. I also like Matt Damon. However, Nicholson's role was awful once you find out the true reason why Nicholson was a drug ring leader.Also some of the plot appeared rush. Everything occurred in spurts, especially the ending. The ending felt very rushed, without giving anything away. There was a lot of action here and there but in between I felt like pressing forward.Finally, this movie is almost unwatchable due to the language. Directors use the excuse that they ""want to depict how society really is"" so they involve a lot of cursing and vulgar sexual comments. However, this is very exaggerated. Every other word involves the F word or a part of an individuals genitalia. This is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen."	1.0	A sign that cursing can ruin a movie	2008-04-15	24	8	16
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3E9YE8BP7OU8I	"Garrett Stiger ""Film student and aficionado"""	"Based on the Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" is a shotgun blast to the pandering cinema that has afflicted the American screen of late.  Scorsese has returned to the urban crime-drama genre that he helped to make famous with ""Mean Streets"" (1973) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990).Scorsese, a consummate auteur, shares many thematic interests with his screenwriter, William Monahan. A Boston police officer, William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes undercover in the local mob with the hope that he may purge himself of his family's criminal history (redemption and honor being major themes in Scorsese's films, such as ""Gangs of New York""). Costigan's job is to provide enough evidence to allow the police to apprehend the head mobster, the lurid and merciless Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello has infiltrated the police force with a mole of his own, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who Costello has been grooming since childhood (corruption being another important theme for Scorsese, see ""Goodfellas""). Each of the moles quickly becomes aware of the other's presence, and they both realize that if either is going to survive, he must quickly find his opponent.Monahan lathers his screenplay with the most vulgar language this side of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction.""  Supporting actors Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who both play upper level officers, deliver deliciously profane dialogue with side-splitting ease and authority.  Matt Damon infuses the antagonistic Sullivan with poise, sophistication, and charisma.  Leonardo DiCaprio's protagonist is conversely something of a blunt and unstable instrument.  DiCaprio's work recalls that of James Dean, as he plays a frazzled young man waging war with the world and within himself.  Surprisingly, screen legend Jack Nicholson is something of a weak link in the cast.  He uses his trademark mixture of charisma and menace in a familiar and admittedly somewhat goofy portrayal of villainy.The real star of the film is Scorsese.  Taking a cue from an early exchange between Wahlberg's character and Costigan - ""What's the matter don't you know any Shakespeare?"" - Scorsese's presents the film as though it were one of the playwright's tragedies.  Tragic and comedic tones are expertly juxtaposed.  Music, be it classic rock or Howard Shore's score, is ever present.  The Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is used to great effect during the film's opening.  It acts as a harbinger of things to come.  Violence is explosive and brutal. Michael Ballhaus' lighting is atmospheric and exaggerated.  Note a scene in Sullivan's office where a bizarre light effect casts an X across the wall (Scorsese litters the mise en sc&egrave;ne with X's, both as an homage to Howard Hawks's ""Scarface"" and a visual representation of Sullivan and Cositgan's duality).  Relentless camera movement and Thelma Schoonmaker's jump cuts further give rise to a sense of nerve-jangling tension.Under Scorsese' own admission, ""The Departed"" is his first attempt at a film with a plot.  On paper, the film does indeed represent one of his more traditional, studio-friendly ventures.  He is working with a very bankable cast and a three-act narrative (most of his films have been more concerned with character studies than a archetypal stroyline).  Despite the creative limitations that may be associated with a more commercial project, Scorsese is more than able to elicit his own passions.  ""The Departed"" is a fierce, raucous entertainment that is not to be missed."	5.0	Gripping Crime Drama Ignites the Screen	2007-02-19	19	14	5

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AY12DBB0U420B	Gary Peterson	"My late night movie for last night was ""The Departed"" in which Jack Nicholson was one of the leading roles. A number of people have told me I look like Jack Nicholson so that made it a bit more interesting. His wrinkle lines are a little deeper and his hair is a little thinner than mine and he cuts his mustache/goatee a little differently. I'd judge him to be about 5 years older than me. No, I haven't looked it up. I have a few diagonal wrinkles on my forehead from being a side-sleeper. Jack doesn't, and probably sleeps mostly on his back. Anyway, that's beside the point and I should indicate that it was quite a good movie but seemed rather long and my attention span waxed and waned here and there, and the plot and characters were interwoven to the point that it didn't make for easy viewing. Yaawwwnnnn. I watched it late at night.Nicholson played a gangster and was quite ruthlessly convincing. The movie was centered about the police who were trying to infiltrate the gang via a few ultra-secret undercover agents but the gang had also infiltrated the police and even the FBI so everyone had to be extremely careful about what they said or who they said it to and it provided a tense environment in which to function. It was a violent movie with a lot of blood and gore. Bullets were flying and a lot of people bit the dust. I noticed that this was yet another one of those ultra-realistic movies where you can see the puff-spray of blood after a bullet strikes a body, or particularly the head. The language was course and crude and heavily into the F-speech dialog of American English to a point I think it distracted from the quality of the movie. The acting and directing was quite good and the story moved along at a comfortable speed. Romantic aspects of the story were trimmed down to the barest minimum. I'd judge it as an excellent film from a director well known for excellent films, but I don't think this is his best.Gary Peterson"	5.0	A Long Movie But Well Done And Worthwhile Viewing.	2012-05-16	0	0	0

To be perfectly  blunt... it isn't his fault that the academy passed up on all his other masterpieces before allegedly setteling on this one. To go a bit further, I don't think this film is a masterpiece per se', but it is pretty damn near perfection.The irony of it all is that this film is ctually a remake of an oriental thriller called ""Infernal Affairs"" (I believe... haven't seen it and nor do I care to)Still, this is a thriller that is expertly crafted and intricately unraveled. The story begins with a boy recieving groceries from a powerful mob boss (played with typical flair by Jack Nicholson) who then grows up and enters the police force. The young man is Matt Damon and he is working secretly for that very mob boss while posing as a cop. Enter Billy Costigan (Dicaprio) as another cadet who is not exactly cop material but has something more useful that flags him for undercover duties. He ultimately gets tagged with the job of bringing the mob boss down. Unfortunatley, it quickly becomes clear to both men that there are other players in the mix and other road blocks to them both achieving what they desire. Ironically, both men share a love interest (the stunning Vera Farmiga) yet they never find  out about each other although it is alluded to near films end.The thriller moves at a modest pace, slow and clunky at times... but it all adds up to more meaningful story and fateful climax. I was told that there were many twists and turns but I didn't really notice any... save for one. Yet, the intensity of the plot and the unpredictability of the mortality of certain characters kept my attention glued to the screen. When this film needed to, it upped the ante and delivered on the thrills. All the actors did wonderful jobs and any of them could have been nominated for the supporting actor role. Whaldberg was quite good so it was nice that he got the nod.So, it may not be a masterpiece but it certainly delivered... and apparently it was intriguing enough to earn the director the gold he deserved for all his previous efforts."	5.0	Good stuff	2007-02-28	8	5	3

It includes a ""Scorsese on Scorsese"" doc (compiled in 2005 by Time critic and Scorsese friend Richard Schickel) in which Scorsese comments on his major films since Who's That Knocking On My Door (1967) up to The Aviator (2004).  Note the excerpts from Italianamerican (1974), which is one of the few Scorsese films not yet released on DVD, as well as the hilarious American Express advertisement where Scorsese collects his pictures at a photo development shop!  Scorsese on Scorsese updates the AFI Directors DVD about Scorsese (that covered Scorsese's work up to Bringing Out The Dead (1999)) and, along with the belated Oscar, the extensive DVD treatment of all Scorsese's major films confirm his place in the American film establishment.Another doc provides a good cultural-historical review of gangsters and life in South Boston.  Much of Scorsese's masterworks (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Aviator) are based on historical people and events, and the special editions of these five films all include information or docs on the people and events ""behind"" the films.Thirty years ago, Scorsese received the Cannes Film Festival Palm d'Or and his first Best Picture Oscar nomination for Taxi Driver (1976).  However, he had to wait until Raging Bull (1980) before the Academy nominated him as Best Director for the first time.  At the March 1977 Academy Awards, Taxi Driver received four nominations, including Best Picture.  But Scorsese's film did not receive a single Oscar award and the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing awards were all rewarded to Rocky (1976), with Sylvester Stallone also receiving Oscar nominations for both Best Actor (along with Taxi Driver star Robert De Niro) and Best Original Screenplay (no nomination in this category for film critic and Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader).Thirty years later, Stallone received generally positive critical comment and decent commercial returns for the sixth instalment of his Rocky franchise, Rocky Balboa (2006), a tribute to the original Oscar-winning classic.  But this time (as with the previous four sequels) there were no Oscar nominations and none of the spectacular commercial success of the original Rocky, whereas The Departed did not only win four Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay and Film Editing (Scorsese veteran Telma Schoonmaker's third Film Editing award) but was also Scorsese's most commercially successful film to date.Film veteran Clint Eastwood, another friend of Richard Schickel, was nominated for the third time in his career for both Best Picture and Best Director for Letters from Iwo Jima (2007).  Two years ago, Eastwood won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars for Million Dollar Baby (2004, Eastwood's second win of these two Oscars, following his final Western Unforgiven (1992)), when Scorsese had his fifth unsuccessful nomination for The Aviator.  This time, Eastwood had the rare experience of Oscar disappointment and Scorsese the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of Oscar success.But Eastwood could be consoled by the fact that, unlike Stallone, this aging, inarticulate action-franchise hero finally managed to receive massive critical acclaim (and the same legendary status as Scorsese), having moved on from 1970s and 1980s five-film franchise anti-hero Dirty Harry to original, interesting films that question his earlier screen persona stereotypes (in the case of Million Dollar Baby and Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Eastwood also provided a more complex, nuanced side to the 30-odd year underdog boxing champion and the American war hero).  At the March 1977 Academy Awards, dominated by Stallone's Rocky, Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Whales (1976, now considered by one film critic as Eastwood's best film to date) received some insignificant nominations and (like Scorsese's Taxi Driver) no awards.  Thirty years later, Eastwood and Scorsese are dominating the Oscar ceremony for the second time in two years, while actor-writer-director Stallone receives no Academy recognition for his originally Oscar-winning six-film franchise action hero Rocky Balboa."	4.0	Scorsese's Oscar-winning film	2007-03-12	5	0	5

So it was in more ways than the body count. Shakespeare is not easy to follow because of the difficult language and hard to follow plot. But this film beats the Bard on both counts. After a few minutes we switched on the subtitles to understand the incomprehensible Bostonian accents. It did not help me understand what was going on but my son who had seen it before kept explaining to me. The story was not without drama and tension but it was too hard to understand.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2SXGU7L6VLJ5P	Gogol	"Got to say I started watching this without knowing it was a Scorsese film. It took me about half an hour before I started thinking ""Something familiar about all this""  Quick look on the back of the DVD and yep, Scorsese.Sorry but all this rubbish about him being some great director, it just amazes me that nobody seems to see through his pathetic one dimentional films.  The usual 'wise guys' 'kid growing up in 'da neighbourhood' with the 'local hoods' 'trying to make it good' everybody talking out the side of their mouths in some laughable pathetic attempt to rip off 1930s gangster movies.  Someone made a point of Scorsese being 'anti religion' I would have to ask what does Scorsese have against black people?  In almost every film he produces blacks/latinos pretty much anyone non white seems to be either devoid of any intelligence or topless dancers.  In almost all his films they are refered to using the 'n' word (even in this one in the first few lines of the film when there is not even a black person in sight!) The driver in Goodfellas after pulling off the biggest highjack in US history then gets drunk and falls asleap in the getaway car (as you do like!) I mean was he dropped by a black person as a baby or something?The film is just awful.  Can Scorsese not think of anything else or has he given up hope after his pathetic attempt at looking at theology with last temptation?So whats the film about?  Usual gangster drivel.  This time instead of Italian 'wise guys' it's the Irish.  Instead of going back in time and having poor Daniel Day Lewis speak with some stupid accent where he cant make out if he is an Al Capone gangster or a fishmonger from Sunderland or Vegas with Casino.  Blah blah baseball bat scene, Jewish bookmaker pointless anti semitism, blah blah blah......  This time we move to Boston (exactly the same set up though) Think I lost count of the amount of times in the first 20 odd minutes of the film they made a point of refering to themselves as Irish with the usual Irish stereotypes.  Irish jokes, the IRA, the Irish 'hood' 'Irish are all drunks' 'Irish are all mad' even the 'Irish president' for Gods sake.  Yeh so what you come from Boston so your great great grandfathers sisters aunties best friends cat once had some connection with Ireland so what?  Some would think that afer the 3 or 4 odd generations they would not be still speaking with Irish accents and if they did they could have at lest got Irish actors instead of American making a pathetic attempt at being Irish.Cop who grew up in the 'Irish hood' goes undercover to investigate local Irish gangster.  Cant realy say much more about the story line because their isnt one.  Just a complete waste of such a great actor as Jack Nicholson.Give it up Scorsese, Goodfellas was a great film but thats about it.  Sooner or later more people will see through your paper thin plots."	1.0	Yawn!	2007-07-31	37	14	23

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A25H5WB72GMOLZ	G. Olmedo	The cast here is fantastic, and Leo DiCaprio has got to be one of the most interesting actors of his generation. He is versatile and fearless in a way that I have not seen in a long time. The fact that Martin Scorsese and other A-list directors continue to seek him out for their films is a testimony to his talent. He is supported by some heavy hitters in this film, but he really carries this movie.This was also a plum role for Jack Nicholson, who is a lot of fun to watch here. Of course, you have to wonder if this is really acting for Jack -- the character of Frank Costello almost appears to have been based on Jack's own personality.I find it a little confusing to put Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon in the same movie... is it just me, or is it difficult to tell these two guys apart?All in all I think it's a pretty powerful film, and the ending packs quite a punch.I really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that it is not Martin Scorsese's BEST work. I have heard people compare it to Goodfellas, and that movie is just so well crafted, this one just doesn't quite come up to that level. Goodfellas is one of those few movies that if it's on, even in an edited version on TV, I can't change the channel -- I'm stuck there watching right up to the part where you see Henry Hill out in his bathrobe collecting his newspaper, missing his days as a gangster, when he was a big shot (and complaining about the fact that he's now just an average schnook who can't get a decent dish of spaghetti now that he's in the witness protection program...).After watching The Departed once, I'm sure I'll probably want to see it again at some point, but I just don't see it becoming one of my favorite movies.	4.0	Great cast, and it's good to see Marty finally won a well deserved Oscar for this picture...	2007-03-22	2	1	1

Nicholson was the most disappointing, sloppily repeating his ""Joker"" character in ""Batman."" This film is also poorly crafted. There is much young talent in Hollywood in screen writing, production design, cinematography and all the other skills and talents that make a movie worth watching. Instead, what we get here is celebrity actors, celebrity directors and a tired sound track of the same old ""classic rock.""

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3GQXLVWTJLARH	Gordo the Gatling Gun	Before everybody around here condems this review, please note that I consider Martin Scorsese to be high up in the pantheon of great filmmakers. At least under three instances do I believe that he deserved to win not just for Best Picture and Director, but win big all around: Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Hugo. And in several other instances, such as Mean Streets, King of Comedy, and After Hours. After years of being favored over by lesser calibur films like Dances with Wolves and Million Dollar Baby as well as outmatched by decent rivals like Ordinary People, Rocky, The Sting, and Out of Africa, he finally won one...and needless to say, the film isn't all that's cracked up to be.I do believe one may need to cover the acting first and foremost here because everybody does a wonderful job with the roles they were given--which is surprising given that Anthony Anderson (the guy from Kangaroo Jack) is in this film as well--but not as surprising given that great amounts of talent behind this film: The three leads are Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholsen, with Mark Whalberg (in an oscar nominated turn), Martin Sheen, Ray Winston, and Alec Baldwin helping to round up the star-studded cast. With a film directed by the great Martin Scorsese and starring such a powerhouse cast across the board, it pretty much goes without saying that the acting would be first rate........But there is one small problem, and I'd be more than incline to blame the directing here than the acting for this, but both sides are to blame here: There is a crap ton of profanity and F-bombs in this film. And by that, I mean everybody pretty much curses their brains out save for Alec Baldwin, and every time I hear the F-word uttered on screen, it doesn't sound natural; it comes off more like the actors and director were trying so hard to secure the R-rating that they had all but forgotten that all it takes is four or more uses of the F-word, or just one use as a sexual euphenism to guarantee it (and even then, the amounts of blood and gore in this film, while not as abundant as a Tarantino film, is still enough to all but guaratee the rating on its own).And of course, one mustn't cover the writing without first covering the source in which the film was based on first. The Departed is a remake of a Hong Kong thriller called Infernal Affairs (which has an entire film trilogy of its own to back it up). Infernal Affairs is a surprisingly effective and believable crime thriller (I can definitely see their police force going to such great lengths in inserting a mole in a crime boss's organization just to bring them down). I cannot, under any circumstances (even knowing full well that Frank Costello planted a rat in the police force) see Martin Sheen and Mark Whalberg taking DiCaprio's character off the record and locking away his identity just to efficiently plant a mole in Costello's organization. And the ending is just plain weird; everybody just seems to kill each other in that film, leaving us only the girl, Whalberg, and Baldwin left alive by film's end.The main problem is that, in translating a Hong Kong crime thriller to an American setting and cast, the film loses credibility. It's comes across as way too farfetched and needlessly vulgar, and the end result just doesn't gel. Of the Best Picture nominees from 2006, three are better: The Queen should have easily won in that group, with Little Miss Sunshine and Letters from Iwo Jima as superior alternate nominees. It is also, in essence, the worst of Scorsese's major films, behind only Gangs of New York for worst film he ever directed. Even his lesser films generally have more mirth and merit than The Departed.	2.0	I hate to say this, but....	2013-11-17	6	1	5

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED.  This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible.  But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art.  Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan (apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak) and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention, our breath, and our applause throughout.The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances.  On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al.  The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.Some may find the violence obsessively graphic, but then this is Scorcese's style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story.  It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama, spiced with just the right amount of wry humor, making its running time (in excess of two and a half hours) speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere.  This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again.  Grady Harp, October 06	5.0	Moles and the insidious tunnels they dig	2006-10-14	14	10	4

Hogwash.If there's any justice in this world, Scorcese will win best picture at the Oscars.  There isn't a false note played by the entire orchestra, and praise in particular should be singled out to Leonardo DiCaprio, who (as an actor I haven't cared for in the past) finally rose up and claimed one of his films as his own.  Over the past few years, the boyish good-looks have given way slightly to a more jaded, more polished actor, and he just might be Johnny Depp's rightful heir.Beyond that, however, the rest of the cast is flawless--kudos to the casting director--Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin (never funnier), Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone... this film doesn't simply re-create ""Infernal Affairs"", it actually improves on the source material.When Roy Buchanan's ""Sweet Dreams"" fades you out to the credits, you'll feel a sense of euphoria, that you haven't felt in a long time.  That this may be a master director's last shot at the golden prize, but even if it fails, you know in your heart that the film didn't fail one bit.  All the way down to the soundtrack, ""The Departed"" is an absolute must-see.The Best film of 2006, hands down.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3A4WQL80WOTMH	Green Manalishi	"...no matter what the touts say.  And for two reasons: the actors in the film are not of the same caliber (not for the mob) as those of the great Scorcese films, and the script/plot of this picture is also not the stuff of genius that his masterpieces were.  It's an entertaining picture, but let's not get carried away - never was I in AWE, and at times found it hard to take seriously in spite of staying interested. Even WITH forced Boston accents, it's nowhere in the league of gangster films like ""Good Fellas"" or ""Casino"".  Lacks the character beleivability and originality of a screen-play like ""Taxi Driver"", or ""After Hours"". Nicholson as an Irish mob boss?  DiCaprio as one of his thugs?  Matt Damon as a mob mole in the police department?  Smacks of Hollywood-land!  Compare this to a line-up of De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci.. like comparing men to boys, no offense to Nicholson who plays great crazy guys, but mob boss was stretching it.  Or maybe I'm just too used to seeing ""Italians"" in the role.Personally I think Scorsese should go back to working with unknown actors just like he did in the very beginning - hell, it was Scorsese that practically brought De Niro and the gang to fame in the first place - and that was when he (Scorsese) was unknown as well.  Why should he now insist on using actors we've all seen a million times, if not for the reason of commercial success?  I think Scorsese needs to take more chances.  I wish just for once he'd use a cast of all no-name actors in a film - fresh meat.  Even if we don't know who they are, it would sell on Scorsese's name alone - and bring a breath of fresh air and credibility to his next picture."	4.0	Not in the league of great Scorsese pictures	2010-01-07	1	1	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33TRNCQK4IUO7	guillermoj	"There has been much writen about Scorsese not ever having won an academy award for unforgetable films such as ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" and ""Goodfellas"", just to name a few. It's hard to believe, but then then look to see the other best picture nominees the year ""Chariots of Fire"" won the Oscar. Even those who don't agree about most films, will agree that ANY of the other nominees that year would have made for a more deserving winner. The starting point that I am trying to make is that good/amazing work is sometimes not awarded the acclaim that it should, but whether the Academy gets it right or not, we the public know is ""best"" as per our own appreciaton. I've learned to appreciate the work and put aside the awards hoopla that only serves as a point of departure for conversation about great movies.Is ""The Departed"" a great movie? You better believe it. I have not enjoyed a Scorsese picture this much since ""Goodfellas."" The story is engrossing, the performances are captivating, and the execution is that of a director at the peak of his capabilities. While the movie is over 2 1/2 hours along, it seems to pass almost too quickly. It is worth noting that, like many Scorsese films, this one has graphic violence to boot and I would caution anyone to take kids to see this film, as some scenes are among his most shocking.While you may have read something about the plot. I am not big on revealing anything that might give away part of the joy of experiencing a movie which you know as little about as possible, but enough to get a gage as whether it's a ""you"" movie or not. I can tell you that both Matt Damon and Leonard DiCaprio give the best performances of their careers. I've never been a huge fan of DiCaprio, but they both surprised me and both are Oscar-worthy performances. Damon is growing into one of this generation's best. Not showy and always present. For some, Jack Nicholson can sometimes be too ""Jack,"" but with the exception of a couple of scenes (one of which is hilarious) he stays within his character. The supporting cast is flawless.The story itself challenges you to concentrate and keeps your adrenalin flowing PAST the last frame. Unlike some past Scorsese movies, this one injects a strong dose of humor between all the deception, double-crossing, and graphic violence. I saw this movie a couple of days ago and will be getting the DVD upon its upcoming release. At that time I may update this review to reveal whether the DVD has any extras worth noting.While I won't be watching the Oscars as I's rather watch the arrivals and hear the resesults the next day, I would not be surprised if this movie were to win honors for both best film and best director. If it does not win, it won't be for lack of deserving to as it's one of the best of the year. I give this movie an unqualified 5-stars. Just remember that there is a lot of violence and it and you may want to bring an oxygen tank as some of the suspence builds up to a point that you may find yourself gasping for air."	5.0	One of the most entertaining, albeit violent movies in years.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANIMV3SPDD8SH	Guy De Federicis	"Maybe all the pieces in this cinematic 'who's the mole?' extravaganza don't add up; any failed police recruit spending a light sentence in prison, should upon release be wearing a T-shirt reading, ""I AM A POLICE INFORMANT"", but the mere question, ""Are you a police informant?"", and the answer, ""No."", satisfies all suspicion in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Oscar winning Best Picture, ""The Departed"". Good storytelling and intense suspense, and finally, a rather supreme film, are just slightly riddled by bullet holes of nagging doubt, like the FBI informant spending nearly the entirety of the film comfortably in the trust of street level Mafia type, while accomplishing nothing, an informant who never informs, or double-crosses; a neutered zone, while spending what must be an adulthood in the brotherhood of Scorsese's gangster kingpin, Frank Costello, (Jack Nicholson). But if you can't find the jigsaw puzzle pieces that fall off the table, or get stuck on the implausible factor, like the big booty for these goodfellas; a nuclear detonating device that can find the hairs off a camels hump from an enormous distance, much like Alfred Hitchcock's 'to die for' 'microfilm', ('bricks' of the nuclear device are passed from a car trunk to a briefcase), and the strangely cliched and martyred Catholic Irish cop, and the king mole who apparently never gains anything for all his troubles, save maybe an unmentioned Swiss bank account, and the post-Archie Bunker mentality towards race, and Scorsese's favorite, and finally, ugly image of gunshot dead gangsters, there is Jack Nicholson's character purring god fatherly sweet murmurs of ""it's just a movie""."	5.0	BIG GANGSTER MOVIE	2007-03-19	4	1	3

It seems that if we have famous actors that political correctness requires us to rate the movie high. This movie was just not good. I sold it at a pawn shop for 50 cents. I would not recommend it even to cop movie fans. A one star rating describes the movie much better than a 5 star rating. However, I have rated movies 2 star and watched them a second time and moved the rating to a 3 star. but I doubt that would be the case with Departed.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A14Q6R4481YFFG	Hinkle Goldfarb	Trust -- and its flip side, betrayal.  Personal, professional, familial.  Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of double-dealing, double-crossing, deceit and dishonesty, mixed in with an inordinate number of head-shot executions, in the seamy Boston underworld.What does the movie ultimately say about trust?  First, that there's not a whole lot of it for either cops or robbers, but second, that not all trust is misplaced, and honesty will at least be vindicated, even if it can never be fully compensated.But forget the movie's theme for a second.  Picture this plot: a determined, Donny Brasco-type mole inside an Irish gangster's criminal empire, combined with an equally determined dirty cop trying to find him.  Cat and mouse action, generous helpings of violence, a semi-demi-plausible love triangle, lots of coke and Chinese gangsters all make appearances in a surprisingly coherent and entertaining mix.  Great action and performances abound with the all-star cast as well.	5.0	Trust and betrayal: integrated case studies	2008-02-22	4	3	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	Inscribed in what we might say a smart variation about the noir genre, Martin Scorsesse has constructed, depicted and achieved possibly his finest works in decades, with a breathtaking script in which you must not miss just a single line; when two young agents, both smart, clever and astute work in the police, one of them is a very poor boy who since his childhood was literally engaged by Costello; and in the other hand we have an outlaw boy who comes from a rich family and by that well known rebelliousness, typical of the first three decades of the human being, decides to be hired by the police to work as a covered agent without identity in order to make Costello goes to prison.Absorbing drama with profound psychological inflections, spiced with black humor, a formidable cast, a sleepless camera that simply does not blink for a second, with admirable mobility and mesmerizing angle shots, and a very clever script make of that movie not only the best entry of this veteran director, protagonist of so many battles and an erudite connoisseur of the cinema which may be compared at the level of let's say Peter Bodganovich.Another high peak to realize: the hidden homage to The Thrid man in the last sequence when she ignores Damon after having buried to Di Caprio in the cemetery, Then go to the last sequence of the Thrid man when Alida Vali makes the same with Joseph Cotten.	5.0	Absorbing cat an mouse thriller!	2007-01-30	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NH7PYU4AD5GA	H. Schneider	"At long last a great movie by Scorese again. After a disappointing Aviator and an impressive but somehow soulless Gangs of New York, this one is entirely satisfactory.A highly suspenseful cops and gangsters story with the main driver provided by the mutual spy set-up, i.e. both sides having their undercover agents in the opposite camp.Leo D. and Matt Damon are perfect in their parts as ""rats"". Of course they represent different species of the rodent. Leo is the good rat, who hides among the baddies and has to pretend to be one of them. You suffer with him and are near a nervous breakdown, just as he. Damon is the smooth and admirable bad rat who seems to his environment like a good solid bloke, but the viewer knows better. Well, also Wahlberg's character does not like him, but he likes no one. This is the Hitchcockian technique of letting the audience know more, which increases suspense dramatically. Imagine the same story, but you don't know who is the bad rat. That would be much less interesting.Nicholson as the evil gangster boss is possibly slightly overdone, but very well so. A good cast in the cop team includes Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, the latter being mainly remarkable for his foul mouth and his crucial role in the story's conclusion.The movie is a remake of an excellent Hongkong movie of a few years ago. Scorsese's version is quite different, but neither better nor worse. Most Hongkong reviewers seem to have decided not to like the new version. Up to them."	5.0	Ratology	2006-12-17	35	31	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1F2IPYSXB0ZCX	Ian Phillips	"""The Departed"" (2006) is a thrilling, totally riviting crime-drama, directed by the award-winning Martin Scorsese, delivering what is undoubtedly his most enthralling film since the masterpiece ""Goodfellas"" (1990). ""The Departed"" was based on the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. William Monahan delivered the scorching screenplay, crackling with savage, brutal wit while producers of ""The Departed"" included Brad Pitt, Brad Grey and Graham King. With such a high calibre team behind the scenes, the impressive array of A list actors all deliver magnificent performances, complimenting the stark blend of unflinching violence, harrowing, psychological drama and exhilirating, rip-roaring action scenes.Young Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a rookie, Boston-based cop. Billy grew up in a world surrounded by crime and violence. Billy's superiors, the diligient Queenan (martin Sheen) and ever-obnoxious, but straight, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are desperate to catch notorious local mafia godfather Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and see Billy as the only suitable member of the team, given his background, to go undercover and trap Costello. Reluctantly Billy agrees, seeing he has little choice, and cunningly wins Costellos trust.The intriguing drama unravels further when, unbeknown to Billy, Queenan and Dignam, is that Costello had groomed sneaky and nauseating Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to be his unscrupulous spy on the force. In a flash back sequence at the beginning of the film, it depicts that Costello had preyed upon Colin when he was just a young boy and brainwashed him to his evil, corrupt way of thinking.Heading the cast is another stunning performance from the versatile Leonardo Di Caprio as the mentally tortured undercover cop Billy Costigan. He conveys many dimensions to his character, giving it infinite depth. You get a more psychological insight into his character during the scenes where Billy pours his heart and anguish out to his understanding councellor, who he subsequently ends up having an on-off affair with (while she is dating Colin Sullivan).Jack Nicholson is devilishly evil as Frank Costello, the highly feared king of the underworld. His mere presence in the fim enhances the seedy, cut-throat atmosphere. Costello is clearly insane and when he discovers there's a ""rat"" among his team, his paranoya escalated further and he begins losing his mind. This is played with stark realism by Jack Nicholson who is in his best role in some years.Matt Damon plays the snake Colin Sullivan, Costellos mole, and shines in all of his scenes. On occasions during the film, you question whether you should really feel some empathy towards his character having clearly been brainwashed and manipulated by Costello when he was at a very impressionable age. However, upon witnessing Colin's underhand tricks and how he evidently wouldn't think twice of killing anyone he even suspects as getting in his way or bringing him down, you suddenly lose that slight sense of empathy.Even the luminous lead performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon have an extremely hard job not being upstaged by the stunning, scene-stealing supporting performances from Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. The ultimate on-screen hard man, Ray Winstone, is terrifying as the cool, calm collected hitman Mr. French. Ray's understated performance is oscar worthy! He possesses a strong screen presence and the way he can shift from being composed to just suddenly gunning down somebody without even blinking, is ever-riviting to watch. Very edge of your seat stuff! Quite simply he steals any scene hes in and even Leonardo Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson seem slightly humble in his presence.Mark Wahlberg is also thoroughly fantastic in his memroable supporting turn as the snide Dignam. Dignam is, thankfully, on the right side of the law (until the end that is - wont say anymore as dont wish to spoilt it for those that yet to view this film) but revels in winding up undercover mole Billy and constantly cross paths with him, Colin and other members of the force. Mark Wahlberg richly compiments the rapid flow of the razor sharp dialogue and seemingly breezes into his character almost effortlessly. Martin Sheen is also of good value too, in his small but effective role of the more sympathetic detective Queenan while Alec Baldwin also delivers a scene-stealing performance as a passionate though often aggressive cop.With a gallery of top notch actors, an intriguing screenplay, first-class direction, rollercoaster dialogue, ""The Departed"" is an exceptional film, and nothing short of a masterpiece.The extras on this double disc set are all fascinating. they include additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese and documentaries such as Stranger than fiction:The story of the Boston Mob, The real Life Gangster behind Jack Nicholsons character and theatrical trailer.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1E8RJN1L9UMHX	IKCWMBFD	"Martin Scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he.  But, of course, Scorsese really should have won for Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Goodfellas, and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement.  This is a decent, entertaining picture, but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best, I think, or one of the best pictures of recent years.The acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast: it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts.  Damon is surprisingly good, capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness, and Walhberg stands out, though he is on screen too rarely.  DiCaprio does a nice job, except that I think sometimes the pressure to have him play ""vulnerable"" and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative: that no one believes him to be the cop, given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence, is a bit preposterous.  The basic storyline, which is almost exactly the same, scene for scene, as in Infernal Affairs, is a pretty neat one, with a lot of nice reversals and twists, though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie.  But, somehow, for me, this film just ultimately didn't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it.  Perhaps because I had seen the original version of this tale, the specific changes and updates made to it in Monahan's script to make things ""Scorsesian"" seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic.  In the end, I had this peculiar feeling like I had just seen almost an imitation Scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones, pasted onto the Infernal Affairs framework.  It may be that, after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent, more personal projects, a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground, to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment, and thus maybe even Scorsese's heart wasn't totally into this project; while certainly there's an energy here, the technical work doesn't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work.  It may also be that, after living with the Sopranos for years and all the Scorsese wanna-be mob pictures, that I am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre, that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me.So, certainly recommended for viewing, but the Departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done."	4.0	enjoyable but a bit disappointing	2007-04-15	3	2	1

A commentary with screenwriter William Monahan would have been a major plus as well.	5.0	Cittizins	2007-03-11	5	1	4
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A31ZF0F4FZHLBD	jackarm	Supposedly based on real life story of Whitey Bulger.  This may be the best roles Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg and the crybaby whose name I have forgotten have played.  A lot of really good talent, a great story line, and superb acting in this film.  The only thing out of place was the &#34;psychologist&#34; lady Dr. who was being passed around between the players.  Clearly had nothing to do with the film and I very much doubt ever existed in real life.  Just a directors feeble attempt to get some kind of romance in this film - which clearly did not need it.  See it anyway.  You will like it.	5.0	THE DEPARTED	2013-09-22	0	0	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2H1WNB30JNAWU	Jack D. Lowry	"The Departed I found out was a remake of a forgein film from China, but what an amazing job Martin Scorsese did with the cast and script.  Truly an all star cast with Leo, Matt, Jack, and Mark, plus Martin Sheen and few others within the film.  To me it is one of the single best crime drama movies I have ever seen during the course of my lifetime watching movies.  I have watched a ton of movies because movies, music, and books are my life.  So if you enjoy Martin Scorsese films and also love a good crime drama movie with lots of great diologue and action mixed with who's working for whom then pick this up and watch this great crime drama movie.  Bonus note to add I truly enjoy the song they played over and over again during the course of the movie the band is called Dropkick Murphys and the song is called ""I'm shipping up to Boston.""  Really good punk rock song to get you going."	5.0	one of the single best crime drama movies I've seen in my lifetime	2012-12-11	0	0	0

It's not that I needed to have a ""happy ending"" to the film, its that the other crooked cop on Costello's payroll seemed like a throw-in to the film to add an emotional jolt to moviegoers who had not engaged the first 2 1/2 hours of the movie.****Spoiler End****I have been watching Martin's fllm's for over 3 decades, and Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Casino, etc. tower over this one.  But then again, the MPAA did nominate Babel for best picture, so maybe tastes are dumbing down these days..."	3.0	Not Scorsese's Best	2007-03-11	8	1	7
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A21XG7UVD2ABKS	Jack R. Tallent	"You have probably already come to grips with the fact that when you go to see a new Scorsese film, it's not going to be another ""Taxi Driver."" Without the burden of comparison to classic Scorsese works, ""The Departed"" is an enjoyable thriller with an all-star cast, some of whom deliver better than others.On the subject of the cast, there is, of course, Jack Nicholson as Costello. Nicholson is a master of playing characters which are simultaneously disgusting and compelling, and this role is no exception. There's lots of great dialog in this film for Nicholson.On the other end of the scale is Matt Damon, who seems a little weak in this film. There are a number of moments in the film where he pulls out the Good Will Hunting, and you think to yourself ""Oh Geez."" I am a fan of Damon's, but this role did not seem to be a great fit.Mark Wahlberg's role is a relatively minor one, but it is one of the film's highlights. He is excellent as the extremely vulgar and abusive Sgt. Dignam, of whom I wanted to see more.The best part of the film, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who's central performance as Billy Costigan is excellent to the point that Matt Damon seems diminished in the complementary role of Colin Sullivan.As for the plot, I am told that this film is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film entitled ""Infernal Affairs.""  It is the story of two moles; a police mole in the mob, and a mob mole in the police. The suspense lies in who will discover whom first.If I had one major complaint about the film, it was that the script did not sufficiently (in my opinion) convey the motivation of DiCaprio's character. What motivated him to endure such a harrowing, dangerous, life-wrecking enterprise?One last thing, I just remembered that Alec Baldwin is in the film, and he is quite good as well!"	3.0	Not a Classic, but Enjoyable	2007-05-21	13	9	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne	5.0	More un-human than me you die !	2006-12-06	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3D119NRFXDBLG	"James Street ""Street Writer"""	"American movies have moved so far in the direction of unconscious self-mockery (think of ""big-time"" wrestling) that they and most of their viewers are not aware of just how far they have moved.My first attempt at a review of this film used so many asterisked expletives, simply to describe the verbal content, that it did not pass the Amazon censors.  Therefore, in this review I will simply say it is so replete with the expletive that describes the act of human procreation that, well, it is boring and embarrassing.The plot can be satirically summarized as four or five rat-like beings getting into a black van and trying to make a getaway while being shot at by ten or twenty of Boston's finest.The cops do NOT succeed in shooting out the tires, even though they fire off at least a hundred rounds of ammunition.  And that is the extent of  the ""verisimilitude"" of the film.There is a scene where Martin Sheen falls off a very tall building and lands at the feet of Leonard DiCaprio.  He lands on his back and still manages to look like Martin Sheen even though he has fallen at least ten stories. (His face is still recognizable.)I had the improbable thought that Sheen might simply have taken a few punches in the face from Ted Kennedy for a very bad imitation of Kennedy's Boston accent.The Departed is about as creative as Jack Nicholson's backside but has obviously pleased the video game crowd.  If you want social realism, avoid this film.  If you want adrenaline rushes from fantasy criminals and cops, buy it or pirate it.It was (un?)officially condemned by the Pope and the Boston Police Department so maybe it isn't as bad as I think it is."	1.0	The film is a cross between Pulp Fiction and Batman	2008-03-27	20	6	14

To bad Brad Pitt didn't star in this film, when I saw his name on the credits I was wondering why he didn't star in the movie he helped produce? #4- You have to see this in HD it is sweet! I saw it in the theater the day it came out and if I had a chance to see it again on the big screen I wouldn't, HD-DVD has changed my life and my mind on watching movies. I think I would rather save my 10 dollars and put it towards the HD release ! Anyways a must buy for the HD-DVD or Blu-ray Collection!

This is absolutely the best movie in the the past 5 years, let alone 2006.  There's something seriously wrong if Scorsese & crew don't sweep at the Oscar's this year.  Everything about this movie was awesome.  From the cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, ""Marky Mark"" Walhberg, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, & of course Jack Nicholson), their performances (Jack Nicholson was born to play this part, & Vira Farmiga deserves alot more attention as an ""A"" list star), the story & of course the direction.Because everyone and their mother have already gone over the plot, I'll skip that.  For those that don't know, ""The Departed"" is based on the 2004 Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"".  Alot of people were skeptical that Scorsese wouldn't be able to come threw & pull off the film.  Scorsese took it, made it his own, & knocked it right out of the ball park.  There's not one dull moent all the way threw.  The action, comedy, drama, intense violence, & the suspense keep you totally strapped into your seat from beginnnig to end.As for the people complaining about the violence & language...  What were you expecting?  Have you not seen any of Scorsese's other work?  Did the ""R"" rating not clue you into what was in store?  Ya, this movies really bloody.  The violence isn't cartoony, it's real, intense, & horrifying, the way it should be in a movie.  If you don't want that, I'm sure you can just as easily go catch the latest Walt Disney money machine.Anyway, I'll step down off my soap box.  Just go see, buy or rent this movie.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Two young men from South Boston graduate into Massachusetts State Police and want to join its Special Investigative Unit. One is in the pocket of Frank Costello, the underworld thug and Irish Mafia kingpin who controls everything that goes on in Southie. The other is trying to transcend, by working for the police, the criminality that has marked his family. Throw in corrupt FBI, a gang of vicious and pitiless thugs and some decent acting, and you have ""The Departed.""Leonardo DeCaprio stole this movie. His tortured performance as an informant inside Costello's gang required (and got) a virtuoso performance. Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin also were terrific. Standing out though was Mark Walberg (!) as Dingam, a profane but pure undercover cop who ends up being every recent cadet's worst nightmare.But in spite of the fine performances, ""The Departed"" left me unsatisfied. By the end, the struggles of the characters seemed pointless. This seemed less from a desire to deliver a deliberate message than from a lack of imagination. Let's see: the story about a crooked Boston cop, corrupt FBI and a murderous Southie mob boss was played much better in real life (with no neat ending) by the real Whitey Bulger. The tale seems uses Boston as a backdrop, though it's hard to recognize the city I know so well. The State House makes many conspicuous appearances, and the Zakim Bridge is used, but the Hancock Tower, Big Dig, Fenway Park, the Common and other Boston-y landmarks are missing. ""R""-less Boston accents abound however, ludicrously (except for Damon) on the lips of many of the actors.

Anyway, lifes crazy, and now they think of Dicaprio as satisfying. Even talking crazy stuff like nominating him for some sort of acting. Not sure if he star's or co-stars. Either though, so far in the year I mean. The power is incredibly in the style of the movie, which never fails to steal the audiance! The ending is ""goodfellas"" like, where everyone dies and who the hell wins!? Who cares, awesome ride. I highly recommend this title. I can't wait to see it again.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ATS1HA5M3EPZ4	"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile"""	Scorcese has never been known for directing pacifist stories.  The iconic director of such films as Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino and Taxi Driver shows once again that his signature of film boldly displays the most prominent aspects of old Irish or Italian American culture and all the violence, machismo and Catholic guilt that goes with it.With The Departed, Scorcese shows he is still a great director in the most traditional definition.  His style is still intact even though it incorporates modern film making and technology.  The movie is an adaptation of a Chinese crime drama called `Internal Affairs'.  I'm not sure how close they are in plot but I have to believe Scorcese has put his stamp on this one.  I have to admit, I have only seen a few Scorcese films and I believe him to be a good Director just from those examples.  He has a straight forward style that is character focused and traditional.The Departed takes place in Boston and starts with a young Colin Sullivan (eventually played by Matt Damon) being corrupted by a local Irisn Mob Boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at an early age.  He then goes on to eventually graduate from the Boston Police Academy, then joins the Mass. State Police as Costello's inside man.  Along side him is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is also enlisting in the State Police at the same time.  Billy's family history is tarnished, and Staff Sgt. Bryce Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) thoroughly trounces him for him for it, most likely testing him as Capt. Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) watches.  Billy is eventually told that they want him for a deep cover operation into Costello's mob.  He would be cut off from the police, only Dignam and Queenan would know his identity.What happens next is a dichotomy of two men working for both sides but only loyal to one.  There are many tense scenes and the performances by all actors are top notch.  No one can be singled out, everyone is at the top of their game.  From what I know about Scorcese, he draws from his own background of growing up around mobs and Catholicism.  His stories tend to center on redemption in the midst of a heavy environment of corruption.  This certainly holds true for Leo's character, who seems to be trying to atone for the sins of his family.  There are clear father-son roles as well; Costello taking on both Sullivan and Costigan as well as Queenan being a father type sanctuary role for Costigan.  Throughout the movie, Sullivan and Costigan are dealing with the truth of their own identities and the contradictions that are coming with the roles they've chosen.  Sullivan finds having a real life that includes a wife and child is exceedingly difficult as he progresses in his dept.  While Costigan wants nothing more than to get out of his situation and be his own person.My only complaint for the Departed is the excessive language and the violence.  Don't get me wrong, I expect a crime drama to be rated R and to depict scenes of brutal violence and to use the F-bomb in it's dialogue.  But it overtook some quality of the movie and I became desensitized to it by the end.  The surprises that happen at the end of the movie might have had even more weight had there not already been so much.  It's truly a minor complaint for a movie that was so well acted and written though and does not deflate the rating of Five Stars.	5.0	Characters strong in The Departed	2007-03-05	5	2	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"It's no secret that ""The Departed"" is a remake of the successful Hong Kong movie. I've watched it several months ago and was very impressed. After watching ""The Departed"", I realized that I wanted watch it again. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation.This is probably different from other Martin Scorsese's movies but it's truly enjoyable. It takes a Scorsese to gather such a crowd of stars and herd them into a consistent and coherent film like this. Although movies like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" are classics, and very very well made films, ""The Departed"" is incredible from the amazing cast, interesting soundtrack, to the remarkable editing.The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson. Leonardo really does give one of the best performances of the year. He plays his character with an anxious fidgetiness and a bunch of controlled fear and anger. Matt Damon gives a criminally underrated performance. His character isn't entirely bad, but I feel that he does the deceptive things he does out of honor and devotion to his 'Dad'. Jack Nicholson is a constant threat in this film. His tenacity and unpredictability strikes fear in the hearts of everyone he comes in contact with. He demands respect and he gets it. His chemistry with Leo and Matt is top-notch. Mark Wahlberg plays an A-Hole in every form of the word. If he doesn't know you, he doesn't like you and doesn't get to know you and Wahlberg plays it with perfect arrogance. Vera Farmiga holds her own on the screen with DiCaprio and Damon, but she is easily forgotten. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone add great veteran backup. Props to Marty.This is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and one of the best films of 2006. I can honestly say that Scorsese brilliantly makes ""The Departed"" look like an original and genuine chef-d'oeuvre, whom only he has the secret to. I highly recommended this movie as well as ""Infernal Affairs."""	4.0	Cops and Robbers at its Best!	2007-03-21	7	4	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3R1ZXQB54GONI	jenslouise	First I have to say that in no way do I agree that Mark Whalberg was the weakest in the film, I personally did not find any weak links in this movie at all.  Having grown up in Dorchester I have to say that he is the epitome of a Boston cop/detective.  And how refreshing it is to hear some authentic accents!  LOL!I was blown away by DiCaprio specifically in this movie, but must note that Jack Nicholson was amazing (as always, what better villian is there?), and Matt Damon was also dead on.  It was a nice treat to see him play the baddie.I think that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and having never seen Internal Affairs, I was rendered speechless by the events at the end of the movie.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HW33PQSRHLNO	J from NY	"No, this isn't up to the level of ""Goodfellas""; and no, this definitely isn't up to the level of ""Raging Bull"" or ""Taxi Driver"".  Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before this so I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about that sore subject; however, if he did need one, I wouldn't mind if the Academy believes the hype around ""The Departed"" and gave it to him as a reparation of sorts.I know the plot was adapted from a film called ""Infernal Affairs"" and I really don't care: no one complains when foreign directors take American films as their inspiration with roughly the same plot, so I'm not complaining about Scorsese doing it in the opposite direction.""The Departed"" is a gripping, brutal, and unflinching meditation on the sometimes tenuous difference between good and evil.  Scorsese's juxtaposition of Roman Catholicism with the sordid realities of crime and perversion is not a new one, but is given a different sort of treatment here.  Comparing it to his other films is to do it a disservice: it is a welcome revisiting of what made this director great in a new way.  This is more an Eastern type approach, with more things taking place off camera that eventually play a crucial role in the gut-wrenching finale.  It may seem ridiculous to call this film subtle, but there is an element of that many people have missed.The performances vary, but if an Oscar should go to anyone it should be to Jack Nicholson.  He makes Dicaprio and Damon nearly disappear, and I don't care if he was stealing scenes; I enjoyed every one of them.  He plays Irish mobster Frank Costello, loosely based on Whitey Bulger, and his performance within this genre transcends much of even of the best work done before.  He is debauched, sadistic, thoroughly evil and corrupt even within the framework of his own twisted ethics--and he doesn't care. He is hilarious and frightening, repugnant and magnetic all at the same time.  He is Nero watching Rome burn and playing his violin.  If he had been in eating up every shot I might think this deserves Best Picture of 2006.Unfortunately, the other two key figures in this Grand Guignol are simply not fleshed out enough to be believable.  We see only the seduction of Colin (Matt Damon) into a life of compromised loyalty at an early age, and we know virtually nothing about Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) except that his family was tangled up with the Southie mob and that he doesn't like his Uncle too much.  And then the action begins: Billy goes undercover as a member of Costello's crew and Colin becomes a Detective who does his best to give a heads up to Costello every time a move is made against him--particularly about the new undercover in his crew.  I have to confess I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio has improved much as an actor: people keep giving him new costumes to try on and the same thirteen year old who just got his skateboard stolen and is fuming mad emerges every time.  Damon is like he usually is only with an on again off again Boston accent.  With these two Scorsese made a bet and I'm not sure he came out on the winning end.  A good example is how badly the ""father figure Queenan tragedy"" with DiCaprio came out: a complete lack of connection.At no point do we really understand why either character is willing to go to such extremes and that seriously weakens the power of the film, in my opinion.  Both are from the same area and are in some respects not that different: capable of violence on the spot, an ability to endure the most uncanny situations without cracking, and along the way both have picked up the unique skill of pathological lying.  They seem phantasmagoric are supposed to be the connective tissue for the whole plot.Also, I get the distinct feeling (having been Irish Catholic my whole life) that Scorsese should stick to his Italian heritage and get rid of this pet fascination with the Irish.  This is an area I believe he has read more about than experienced, and sometimes the Drunk Violent Irishman Cartoon comes out once too often in this movie (Alec Baldwin's character is a case in point).All of this aside, it is absolutely worth watching and worth owning: there's a Shakespearean quality to this dirty earthquake you won't find in one single movie out there right now.  Any Nicholson fan has to see this: its like his ultimate Ode to all the Bada** characters he's played so brilliantly over the years. It is a testament to Scorsese's genius that despite some fatal flaws he's made yet another film that isn't likely to leave my mind or the mind of most people who see this for years to come.And just give him an Oscar already.  He's earned more than one."	5.0	Scorsese's best for awhile now	2007-02-23	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1H5P8121Z0OKF	J. Lay II	"""The Departed"" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with ""GoodFellas"" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay.This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film ""Internal Affairs""(2002) of which ""The Departed"" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.The screenplay for ""The Departed"" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director.Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he ""adopts"" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries.Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's ""Gangs Of New York"" and 2004's ""Tha Aviator"") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced.Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.""The Departed"" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala ""The Sopranos"".

In a star-filled cast, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop. Rather than play the typical cool customer of this genre, he portrays the sheer terror of a man playing a very dangerous game. Over time the lines in his face and tremors in his hands convey unbearable tension. His opposite number is Matt Damon, whose boyish good looks also show strain as he manages the investigation to find the traitor in the department. Nicholson is Nicholson; Martin Sheen wonderful; Mark Wahlberg is great as one of the more obnoxious cops to appear in film. Nice twists involving modern technology--text messages and cell phones.

I like movies that don't seem generic in time and place. This movie places you in Boston. Scorsese's attention to detail pays off here. I liked the various dialects. I liked the fact that some of the guys were right off the boat from Ireland. That seems realistic. The screenplay is amazing. I can imagine cops talking just like that. The screenplay is VERY realistic in terms of not shying away from using ""bad language"" (someone counted and said that the F-word is used 250 + times in the movie). The mixing of scene and music was great. The themes of the movie: identity, class in America, personal secrecy vs. openness, etc. were well delineated. There was the classic Scorsese humor. We are watching some pretty nasty stuff, and still can laugh at it. It seems to me that this is one of Scorsese's main themes: life is violent and brutal, but still, we can laugh at it. The depiction of the many layers of bureaucracy and secrecy within both police units, and crime organizations, was good. I liked Jack Nicholson, but there were two scenes where they let him go a bit overboard, and he almost *hijacks* the movie in those two scenes. But still, he is great in it. DiCaprio is really good, expressing the multitude of emotions of someone who doesn't know who to trust, or even what his own identity should be. I liked the depiction of psychology, especially as related to police work (""cops see policemen on TV crying after using their gun, and then they think they have to do that too""). I think this movie is saturated with realism. As they say, ""reality is weirder than fiction"". This movie is both sad and funny, all at once. I can't say this is a masterpiece. But it is a very good movie."	5.0	Screenwriting, music, sense of place, humor	2007-02-26	9	6	3

A great group of actors were assembled to make this film what it is.  The writing, which Scorcese had a huge influence on, was outstanding.

Not much.  We got a lot of derivative, recycled stuff which did not have long-lasting memorability.  ""Departed,"" though, was a memorable film experience, and, especially given its length, its ability to sustain interest was intrinsic and not layered on.Watch the movie and see if you agree.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	If there is a lesson here, it is this: stick with the truth.I don't know why it took me so long to see this film. When I first read about it, long before its release, the premise hooked me. An undercover cop working a mob boss, while a cop is working undercover for the mob. The cast didn't hurt either: DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Baldwin, Wahlberg, and Sheen belong to an elite crowd, and can all turn in strikingly realistic performances. (And did.)Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a straight-laced kid who grew up under the wing of mob boss Frank Costello, played demonically well by Jack Nicholson, and who later joins the police force and works his way quickly up the ranks. From within, he becomes Costello's rat.Billy Corrigan, played with impressive range by DiCaprio, is to Sullivan what a negative is to a photograph. He grew up surrounded by all of the wrong influences, but rose above it to become a cop. Because his superiors (Sheen and Wahlberg) don't trust him, or believe that he will ever make a good cop, he goes to work undercover in Costello's mob. (Honestly, I had a hard time swallowing the rationale behind that, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief.)There are both surprising and predictable plot twists, but what impressed me most was how every action taken by a character had an affect on another character or characters. This was a well and carefully plotted story that, in the hands of a less skilled director, might have been a mess. Scorcese deserves all of the praise he has received.Some have complained about foul language and gore. While both exist in the film, none of it is gratuitous. Frankly, I expected Irish cops to swear every three words as opposed to every ten. Add in corrupt cops, a scheming mob boss, an FBI informant - there's going to be a bit of gunfire. Scorcese kept the violence close, not to shock or abhor us, but to make those scenes that much more believable - if not tangible, as they were to me.All of the actors had to be spot-on in their roles, and they were. I've never seen a more believable good cop / bad cop duo than Sheen and Wahlberg, and within the first two minutes of seeing Wahlberg onscreen I understood why he received an Oscar nod. DiCaprio also was worthy of recognition, as his character bore the brunt of a conscience. He was at once brutal and vulnerable.Corrigan (Damon) and Sullivan (DiCaprio) have precious little time together on the screen, but as everything they do affects the other, it seems as if they are neck and neck. Their relationship, as it is, drove the plot. Luckily, they were guided well.4 stars, rounded up to 5.	5.0	Those who deceive	2007-03-26	5	2	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2MF3U2PZJ4N0M	"Jonathan Collingsworth ""JonCollie"""	"Two scenes in the movie that make this not worth watching for me.  The first one is when all the troopers are celebrating at the station and the secretary or whatever she was brings Matt Damon that coffee mug with wine and he thanks her for it, and then she looks at him and the camera focuses directly on her and she says,""No, thank you.""  WTF!!!!  Corn.  The second scene is when they are having the funeral for the troopers and they give them the old twenty-one gun salute.  They cut to a group of cops around Matt Damon and when one of the shots rings out from the rifle detail, the whole group flinches.  These are people that knew a shot was coming and they still jumped like they had no idea.  Small things like that generally can ruin a movie for me and this was no exception.  Leo can also ruin a movie as well so you throw him and Baldwin in the mix and it's a all out crapfest.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1I334JBODWFEW	Jon	"Set in Boston, the film begins as crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) takes a young boy under his wing.  Flash forward 20 years and that boy--Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon)--is now a man.  Her works in the Boston police department as an informant for Costello.  Knowing that he has a rat in the department, Police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) assigns Billy Costigan (Leo Dicaprio) to go undercover: to wash out of the force, commit assault, and go to prison with the intention of getting recruited into Costello's criminal organization when he gets out.  Costigan does of course work his way in...leading to a fast paced game of cops and robbers, as both sides try to find the leak in their organizations before their own guys gets nabbed.To begin....I really enjoyed this film.  I was on the edge of my seat for at least 90% of the movie.  It's got an impressive ensemble casts.  Dicaprio gives one of the best performances that I can remember, and it's great to see Jack Nicholson as a real bad guy again....The movie has great acting across the board.Some reviewers have complained that ""The Departed"" isn't as ambitious as some of Scorsese's other works, such as Goodfellas. Raging Bull, etc.  The fact is that this film is not trying to explore any complex philosophical themes--that's not the goal here.  With this movie, Scorsese was just trying to remake a fast paced, sophisticated crime thriller.  And at that, he's succeeded on all levels in my opinion.One of the only real criticisms that I'd be able to agree with is the significant role that coinicidence plays in the plot of the film...such as the criminal and police mole fallling in love with the same woman.  But overall, I think this is destined to be a classic in the crime thriller genre.  I highly recommend it."	5.0	New Classic in Crime Thriller Genre	2007-01-16	4	2	2

One man is a cop named Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Inception"") who gains the trust of a high ranking mob boss, the other is a man called Colin (Matt Damon, ""Hereafter"") working for the mob syndicate that has gotten into a nice position in the police's Special Investigation Squad. As both try to do their best to maintain their double lives it becomes clear one of them must either break their cover or die.What sounds like a basic everyday cop drama, is elevated to Academy Award status thanks to great performances by DiCaprio, Damon, Jack Nicholson (""As Good As It Gets"") the mob boss, Mark Wahlberg (""Shooter""), Vera Farmiga (""Orphan"") as a woman both Damon and DiCaprio fall for and many other supporting players.Also having Martin Scorsese (""Shutter Island"") as your director really adds some nice punch and spice to this movie, as there aren't many directors who could handle this big of a cast and handle it as well as he does. The story is also very layered, plenty of stuff going on with some good side stories. The best performances to me were DiCaprio as I feel this was his major breakout role, Damon was great as well and Wahlberg was fantastic especially in the closing scenes.Its quite possibly as close to a perfect cop drama as you'll get, just great from start to finish. **** out of 4 stars."	5.0	Layered performances help a typical police cop story....	2012-07-29	2	1	1

Nicholson's portrayal of Costello is endemic of this-he goes from being a cold-blooded mob boss to an uneven egomaniac.  Is Scorcese trying to say that all mob bosses will eventually meet Costello's end? Also, it seems like Alec Baldwin's character disappeared over the second half of the movie.Having said that, I felt that both DiCaprio and Damon were solid in their performances.  Scorcese did a great job of juxtapositioning their characters, and that really is the heart of the movie.

The movie keeps your interest with a great cast and a story about an investigation into an Irish mobster in Boston.Performances by Nicholson, Sheen and DiCaprio are great.  However Wahlberg did not deserve an Oscar nomination and the female lead generates no chemistry with Damon or DiCaprio.  The storyline keeps the movie moving well enough, but there are too many cliches in it.  And seriously, how could Nicholson's character not figure out who the rat in his crew is when the police investigation doesn't seem to gain any ground until after DiCaprio starts working for him?

(Which, in our celebrity obsessed culture, is probably just as good a reason to watch a movie as any). And it is quite an impressive cast: Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and directed by Martin Scorese....Now is that a cast or what? And I know that usually in movies with too many big names somebody ends up being under-utilized, but I thought all the main actors in this movie were given at least a couple great scenes to chew the screen up.Some researching on the internet reveals that this movie is an American remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs"". (I've not seen ""Infernal Affairs"", but I've seen the previous at least. It always looked kind of interesting.)""The Departed"" is set in Boston and revolves around the Irish-American culture and the Irish mafia. It doesn't come close to the level of pyscho-analysis that ""The Godfather"" did for the Italian mafia, but there are various throw away lines referencing the Irish-American experience: ""Twenty years after an Irishman could't get a job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace.""The plot gets a little complicated but basically Jack Nicholson is a Irish Mafia boss. Leonardo DiCaprio is an undercover cop infiltrating the mafia. Matt Damon is an undercover mafia who has infiltrated the police department. As the movie progresses various betrayals and changes of allegiance follow.I don't want to give away too much to anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but at various points I thought it should have been obvious who the respective moles were. And it seemed like everyone was getting pretty sloppy and getting away with it. But that's Hollywood for you I guess.Also (and again, I hope I'm not giving too much away here. Spolier alert) the climax of the movie revolves around a taped conversation. You know, it turns out that something one of the characters said was being tape recorded and he didn't know it, and he said a lot of self-implicating things. Like we've seen a million other times in a million other movies and TV shows.I suppose this is the most obvious way to end a story like this (which is why it's been used so many times before), but perhaps because it is the most obvious it is also the laziest. For my two cents I would liked to have seen a more interesting ending.But the movie definately held my attention for the time I was watching it."	4.0	A few loose ends, but a great flick	2007-06-15	4	2	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AIFXFHO2N9WJB	"Justice0309 ""Justice"""	"Director Martin Scorsese, who has often been hailed as one of the best directors of all time, has had his share of success in Hollywood.  With hits such as ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The Aviator"", and ""Casino"", it's easy too understand just how he got to be so successful.  After taking a break from directing mafia themed movies for a while, his last mafia movie was ""Casino"", Scorsese returns to the subject matter that has treated him so well in the past, and delivers audiences what could easily be his best work to date, ""The Departed"".""The Departed"" is an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both rats: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier, assigned to discover who Costello has embedded in the police force.With such an excellent cast of actors ranging from veterans Jack Nicholson (easily giving one of his best performances), Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin to younger, yet experienced, actors Leonardo DiCaprio (giving his best performance as well), Mark Wahlberg, and Matt Damon, it's no surprise that Scorsese came through with such an incredible movie experience.  The writing from veteran writer William Monahan (writer of ""Kingdom of Heaven"") is tight, never letting up with the twists and turns, while still managing to keep the movie from being confusing to the audience.  Martin Scorsese, after a long and successful career, has finally achieved that which has always eluded him, a Best Director's Oscar for his work here, and I have two things to say about that; 1) it's about time, and 2) this movie, and all involved, deserved all the awards they received.If you have yet to see this movie, waste no more time, go rent it or buy it (I guarantee it's worth it to just buy the movie), and enjoy what is easily one of the most intense dramatic movies you may ever see.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZ5WK99NSFNRV	"Justin Maldonado ""JM"""	"The master of all things movies and mafia, Martin Scorsese, returns to top form with 'The Departed.' The Oscar-less director's new film is his best since 'Goodfellas,' and the best film of the year by far.He once again reinvents the crime genre, taking an ingeniously plotted story and through his vintage techniques, as well as a fantastic cast, he elevates a cops-and-mobsters crime thriller to the level of a Shakespearean tragedy.Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the kingpin of the Irish mob in South Boston. Everyone in his neighborhood fears him. That fear allows him to do practically anything, from hitting on store owners' underage daughters, to telling off Catholic priests about their scandals. He's got his hands in everything from protection to drugs to selling defense microchips to the Chinese. Everyone from the feds to the ""staties"" (state police) wants him.So Boston's Special Investigations Unit sends in a spy to help build a case to bring Costello down. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-headed young cop fresh out of the academy with family ties to Costello. He goes deep undercover (he's forced to serve jail time to make him more convincing to Costello and his crew) and after a while he's a familiar among Costello's crime affiliates.Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the police department, Costello has been grooming his own rat into a top-notch cop. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) grew up under Frank's wing, idolizing him almost as a father figure. He's a promising young officer, and quickly works his way through the ranks until he gets promoted into the SIU.But soon the boys learn of each other's existence (not their identities) and they're out to discover the other rat before they are found out themselves. This plot setup leads to some suspenseful sequences, including a superior one when a confrontation between the cops and Costello is coming down to the wire and the cops and Frank continually get tipped off by their respective moles. There is also another terrific scene when Colin finds Billy's number and calls him. Billy picks up knowing it's Colin and both say nothing. The tension is extreme.Scorsese shines here more than he has in years, mostly due to the subject matter. Sure the story takes place in Boston and not in his beloved New York this time around, but Scorsese is the perfect candidate for depicting these kinds of neighborhoods and telling these kinds of violent, dense, darkly hilarious crime/mob stories.The cast is an embarrassment of Oscar-worthy performances. DiCaprio and Damon both show what they're made in their best performances yet. DiCaprio is a pool of rage, remorse, fear, and paranoia. Damon shows off his dark side, but allows just enough of charm to ease through as so not to make Colin completely hateful. Nicholson tones down the ""Joker"" long enough to showcase some real menace as Costello. Supporting characters Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg (playing Billy's bosses), Alec Baldwin (as a sergeant who really wants to get Costello), and Ray Winstone (as Frank's right-hand man Mr. French) all shine and each get a moment of their own. Vera Farmiga (from the just-as-violent mess 'Running Scared') appears as a police therapist who falls for both Colin and Billy. Some might complain that this love triangle is a clich&eacute; and doesn't really belong here, but that's merely a quibble. It actually provides a nice twist or two in the story.The film may not be the most original or artistic film of the year, but it certainly qualifies as the most entertaining endeavor the cinema has had to offer all year long. And you just can't find a more crowd-pleasing and emotionally satisfying ending in any film this year.The film is unsentimental yet completely involving. Shocking plot twists shock us even more because the film, running at a brisk two hours and 30 minutes, has taken the time to invest in these characters and their lives and fates.So maybe this will finally get Scorsese that way-hay overdue Oscar. And even if he doesn't, 'The Departed' is some of his best work ever and an American crime masterpiece."	5.0	A new American crime classic!	2006-10-08	6	3	3

This isn't necessarily a bad thing though - you feel sort of like you have been through something after this movie ends. I suppose you could watch it and not pay as much attention - you'd probably still enjoy it.The movie is basically about rats and organized crime in Boston - There's a mob guy working inside the police and there's a undercover officer working inside the mob. So each side is working to find out just who the rat really is.The movie has an all star cast - Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin to name a few.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	"MOVIE: So, Scorsese is making a movie, you say? It's a remake of a Hong Kong flick, really? Is it any good? Damn right it's good! I don't know where to begin about this movie other than this is a near perfect piece of contemporary filmmaking. We open with a long running prologue that introduces the main players to us. In fact, this movie has one of the longest prologues I can recall maybe since Fiddler On The Roof. The brilliant part of it is that during the entire introduction we never see Jack Nicholson's face in the light, he is always in the darkness and only until he is finished with his speech does he step into the light. The story revolves around so many characters that to describe the plot in detail would take awhile. All you need to know is that Leo DiCaprio plays a rejected cop who is chosen to do this dirty undercover job to help arrest mob boss Frank Costello, played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. On the other hand, Frank has his own contact within the police force played by Matt Damon. So, we have situational irony here in that the cops are trying to figure out who is leaking information to Frank Costello, and Frank Costello is trying to figure out who among his guys is leaking information to the cops. The movie has so many brilliantly constructed characters that not one person overshadows another. There is so much going on yet is incredibly focused thanks to a brilliant adapted screenplay by William Monahan. Monahan has proven to me that he is the next great screenwriter in Hollywood, his first screenplay was Kingdom Of Heaven and he is currently doing Jurassic Park IV and Tripoli. He has a bright future ahead of him. Anyway, back to the movie.Talk about brilliant direction, this movie has Marty Scorsese written all over it, it is oozing with Scorsese. He used a red color tone in one scene with Jack Nicholson and these two girls as he throws cocaine all over the place, and I thought it was brilliant. At the climactic shootout at the end he uses a stylized way of freeze stopping the frame, which I thought was really cool. The way the scenes are structured are sharp, quick, and intense. I had to give my neck a quick stretch after I left the theater because my entire body was tensed up throughout the entire 2 and a half hour movie. Did I mention this movie is bloody and brutal as hell? Oh yes, but the violence is not just for the sake of it, consider it an opera of violence if you will. Everything about this movie is fresh and nothing feels like it has been done before (unless you've seen the original). The storylines play out smoothly and they work. The dialogue in this movie was brilliant, I don't remember the last time I have seen dialogue that flowed so naturally as it did here. The lines are sharp, funny, meaningful, and they really shape out each individual character.One other thing to note about the movie is the use of music, not score, but music. I have come to the conclusion that ""Gimme Shelter"" is Martin Scorsese's favorite song considering he used it with Casino and a few times here in The Departed. Howard Shore's score rarely comes in, but when it does it is a unique and effective way to move the scenes along.All in all this is a brilliant film. If Amazon would allow half star intervals I would rate this film 4.5 stars. I felt like there was no emotional connection to the characters. There was definitely emotion being expressed by the actors, but they weren't relatable to the audience. All the characters in this movie are filthy rats and scum-bags, so as an audience we can only be entertained by what is on the screen and not really take anything away from it. I didn't think knocking down a whole star because of that was justified, so I left it as a 5 star rating, but know that it's 4.5 in my head.ACTING: This is the best cast I have ever seen assembled on screen. Every actor here is at the top of their game. Jack Nicholson is brilliantly menacing in this movie and will be nominated for his supporting role, maybe even walk away with the win. Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio are at the top of their games too, sporting authentic accents and all. We really believe what they are going through. Ray Winstone shines as Frank's right hand man and it's nice to see him becoming more prominent in American cinema. Many of you may know Winstone as the voice of Mr. Beaver from the recent Chronicles Of Narnia movie, he was also recently in The Proposition. Mark Wahlberg is amazingly sharp and witty in his role and gets some of the biggest chuckles from his lines. We get more great support from Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen, both turning in great performances. Not one rotten egg in the entire batch, even Anthony Anderson earns his place in a Martin Scorsese picture.BOTTOM LINE: I think what initially put me off of this movie was the trash marketing campaign that Warner had for the film. I really wasn't all that thrilled from the trailer, and the tv spots just made me more pessimistic. Don't let Warner's bad marketing discourage you from what is one helluva brilliant, brutal, and contemporary film with a classic feel. The Departed is a modern American classic that shows Scorsese doing what he does best. For some reason I wasn't expecting much from this film after I was disapointed with veteran De Palma's recent effort, but I am so glad I was wrong. The Aviator was good, Gangs Of New York was great, The Departed is amazing.

""The Magnificent"""	"I would like to say that even though I had heard that this was a really violent movie with filthy language, I went to watch this movie with positive expectations. I mean, isn't this the director of Goodfellas? I thought this movie would be rough around the edges with a great story, as most of Scorcese's films are. I was BRUTALLY disappointed. I cannot believe how bad this film was. In most films that use foul language, the the foul language is a part of the dialogue which kind of makes a background tapestry that makes  up the film. Not this movie. The language was so bad that it totally detracted from the viewing experience. It would have been a much better film without the disgusting language. And that's not the worst quality of the movie. The plot was generally well handled, and often suspenseful,but was totally predictable. But there was one problem. I didn't care what happened to the characters. And the plot ""resolution"" which I won't give away here was so disappointing, so bad, so WRONG and DISAPPOINTING. At the end of the movie the only thing I could think was WHAT A HORRIBLE FILM AND WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME. DiCaprio's performance was great, but it didn't redeem this film. Why does hollywood continue to churn out such drivel? This film, so far as I can tell has no redeeming qualities. I long for movies that are actually entertaining, and this film is not among those.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8MQW5B5QB3H1	Kerry D	"Read this review only if you can't wait until you get your copy to find out what the plot is all about.The police are looking for a rat within their ranks.  Their rat is Matt Damon's character.  Matt is working for the mob, led by Jack Nicholson's character.  The mob is also looking for a rat within the mob.  Their rat is Leonardo DiCaprio's character. Leonardo is a deep, under-cover police detective who is supposed to find out about a stolen supply of computer micro-processors.  Leonardo finds out that Jack Nicholson's character is, besides being a mob boss, an informant for the FBI.  This is important because later in the movie, Matt Damon shoots Jack because he knows that Jack is planning on giving up some of his mob people to the FBI.  Leonardo finds out that Matt Damon is the rat and tries to arrest him but instead Leonardo gets shot by a guy who is ""on the take"" for the mob.  Matt Damon thinks he's off the hook and can go back to his secret life as a police sergeant but then in the last scene Matt Damon is walking into his apartment.  Mark Wahlberg is waiting inside.  Mark walks toward Matt Damon with this matter-of-fact, taking-care-of-business look on his face, doesn't say a word, and shoots Matt Damon in the head.  Then Mark puts a ski mask over his head and casually walks out of the apartment.  He is wearing booties over his feet and gloves so he will not leave behind any forensic evidence. This last scene is worth the price of the movie all by itself.  At the very end, you look out the window of Matt Damon's fancy apartment and you see a rat casually walking by the window."	5.0	"Warning - ""Spoiler"" review"	2007-02-17	6	3	3

Yes, the movie resembles the HK INTERNAL AFFAIRS, but that was so long ago I forgot I had seen it till the very end of TD.  I guess maybe its reliance on an outlandish plot setup made me feel it was a little artificial as opposed to the Cassavetes-ish sense of improvisation and hyper-reality you used to get from the old De Niro-Scorsese films.  The storyline is so crazy that you felt the actors, good as they were, must have always been asking themselves, why am I in this situation again, and many of them seemed to bark out their insanely violent Monahan dialogue only by biting the inside of their mouths to keep from laughing.Nicholson seems like he's into it, and he made the movie much better than it is at heart, by really unleashing for once that tragic power we all know he has but hasn't emerged since the Joker took over.  Is it true that Jack got the part after Daniel Day Lewis turned it down?  If so, good for Dan, he made room for a better man.Matt and Leo were both in there swinging, but they should have traded parts, and as for the divine Vera Farmiga, she must have thought the movie was about a woman's sexual growth, but too late she found out it was about a bunch of guys and how arteries explode under gunfire.  Scorsese and his screenwriter took care to expand her part and to shield MS from further accusations that he is running a billionaire boys club in Hollywood, but alas Vera failed to score the critical acclaim Cate Blanchett did in THE AVIATOR.  But she was a cartoon and Farmiga was trying to play someone real.The picture was long, but it was rushed too, and not a single one of the sequences would hold up if you took the time to analyze what was happening within the story structure.  Every minute was unbelievable, especially Leo and Vera making love, finding shared passion while Van Morrison belts out ""Comfortably Numb"" on the soundtrack like the angel of decrepitude."	4.0	A Fleeting Glimpse	2007-05-28	1	0	1

I will describe the quality of the particular product. The packaging is very solid as is expected of a steelbook and house the blu-ray perfectly. The image quality is very sharp and allows the viewer to feel that they are watching this in an actual cinema using a digital projector.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1W661TC1P6VQI	"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi..."	"Here we go again. In the history of film making, there are few directors that have been praised as much as Martin Scoresese. By that same token, it's kind of strange to see a man make so many classic movies like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and ""Raging Bull"" never win an Academy Award of any kind. I thought for sure ""The Aviator"" would be the movie where Scoresese would finally get awarded the Oscar he deserved, yet the A.M.P.S.A. felt differently, and awarded the Oscar to Clint Eastwood and his boxing movie ""Million Dollar Baby."" Now Scoresese has brought us ""The Departed,"" to prove to us once again why he's one of the few directors to get his name above the title of the movies he directs. ""The Departed"" revolves around a crime lord by the name of Frank Costello. Costello is a smooth talking, chain smoking, terrifying villain. One of the worst I've ever seen in a movie.He kills without hesitation, tortures without batting an eye, and actually finds humor in his methods of madness (after killina woman in cold blood he jokes ""Huh?  She fell funny""). In seducing a young boy to join his gang, Costello says ""When I was your age, they would say you could either become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?"" The boy he gives this scary bit of advice is named Colin Sullivan, who grows up to become one of the more important cops in the police department, but is really a mole for Costello, who he shares confidential information with. On the other end of the spectrum is Billy Costigan, who was training to be a cop, but flunked out of the academy. However, the police department feels he can still be of use to them, so they convince him to fake a crime, get thrown in prison, and be released a year later to become a spy on Costello for them.The plan works, and a year and a half later, Costigan is in Costello's gang, making deals and beating up store owners who are late on their payment. Soon though, Costello suspects that there is a ""rat"" in his gang, and calls Sullivan with an order to find the rat. Likewise, the police suspect that is an informant leaking Costello information about the police department as well, and Costigan is ordered to discover the identity of this person too. Both men share information with everyone in many different ways, but the most intriguing device they use is the cell phone. With calling, text messaging, and voice recordings, the cell phone becomes a story device quite unlike anything else in this movie. Cell phones are normally used as gimmicks in movies, normally being degraded to simple things like ringing while someone is trying to hide from the bad guy. In this movie, the cell phone becomes an essential part of the story telling.It's used in so many unique and interesting ways, that if you took it out I don't think you would have a movie anymore. At the very least, you wouldn't have one that is half as interesting as this one. But the cell phone is not the only thing that makes this movie good. What also makes the movie work are the excellent performances from all the principle actors. Jack Nicholson proves once again why he's a living legend on the screen, Matt Damon shows that he is a very underrated actor, and Leonardo DiCaprio steps up to the plate to reenforce the notion that he is the next Robert DeNiro. In fact, looking at the past three to five films DeCaprio has made including this one, I think it's safe to say that DeCaprio has come a long way from being the icon of many a teenage girls dream several years ago. It's Jack Nicholson who takes up most of the screen time though, and is fascinating to watch from beginning to end.Playing a character that is a perfect vision of what true evil is, I think Jack Nicholson will be up for another Oscar nomination come January (Editor's Note: I was wrong on this one). In fact, I think it's pretty safe to say that while this film won't win any major prize, I would confidentially expect this film to get a Best Picture nomination for sure. Sadly, it will not win for two reasons. The first reason is that this is a Martin Scoresese picture, and none of his movies have won Best Picture despite their quality. The second reason is that despite the quality of this film, ""United 93"" is still a better movie, and five months later people are still talking about it, and I do believe that ""United 93"" will win the top prize (Editor's Note: Wrong again). For it's subject matter if nothing else.Still, at the end of the day ""The Departed"" is still a great movie with great writing, acting, and tension. It's smart, it keeps you at the edge of your feet, and there are several moments where you don't know where the movie is going, and you will be shocked at where it does go sometimes. I must admit that the amount of foul language in this movie is a bit bothersome, but seeing as how the movie is about a crime syndicate, it's (sadly) unsurprising. If movies with the use of a ton of F words bothers you, then you should just not watch this movie at all. Also the movie is extremely violent, so keep that into consideration also. But if you can stomach this, then by all means enjoy ""The Departed,"" one of the best films of the year.Rating: **** and a half stars"	4.0	Dearly Departed	2007-02-17	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27H9DOUGY9FOS	"K. Harris ""Film aficionado"""	"Every time Martin Scorsese releases a new picture, the Oscar talk begins. Obviously, the world waits breathlessly for the next ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"" or ""Goodfellas""--but it's not easy to craft a film of such enduring appeal. ""The Aviator,"" his last Best Picture nominee, is a handsome biopic bolstered by good performances--but hardly elicits the same passion as the Scorsese classics. And ""Gangs of New York,"" the nominee prior to that, is a genuinely muddled mess led by a terrific performance by Daniel Day Lewis. So that you may calibrate this review, I'm going to say it right now--in no way did ""Gangs of New York"" deserve to be among the top five films of it's year.""The Departed"" is this year's candidate, and I have no doubt it will receive many accolades from the Academy. It's a vastly entertaining tale based on Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs."" I don't know that I consider it to be among Scorsese's best work--but it certainly brings back a life and passion absent from some of his recent efforts. Brasher and more viscerally exciting than ""The Aviator,"" more coherent and intelligent than ""Gangs of New York""--""The Departed"" does remind you of the pictures made on the mean streets of Scorsese's earlier classics. And while the film is abundantly entertaining, thrilling and twisty--it is not without flaws either.First, the good. It's a terrific plot well executed--complicated and morally ambiguous. You can't help but be impressed with the layer upon layer of complexity as our characters live in worlds that are based on lies. How do you maintain the essence of yourself when you exist in a state of pretense? How to you survive and thrive when one mistake could mean your life? There are knotty ethical issues to be wrestled with throughout the picture--a lot more for the viewer to think about and contemplate than in your traditional action fare.Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio give fully realized, dynamic performances. It may be a career high for both actors--I appreciated their immersion into these men. They are bold and challenging portraits of two people trapped within situations that now define them. Free choice is limited and you can't play by the rules. Ruthlessness and dishonesty become necessary to survive--their lives parallel beautifully even though they are at odds. Nice characterizations from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are highlights as well. Wahlberg, in particular, has rarely been so alive on the screen.One element in the film that has been debated is Jack Nicholson's performance, however. Either you think it is a brilliant Jack Nicholson role or you wish for a little more restraint. Well, I almost always wish for some restraint with modern Nicholson (aside form the nice nuanced role in ""About Schmidt"")--but here, his over-the-top portrait actually serves the film well. I enjoyed his antics and it worked as a suitable counterpoint to the younger performers.The one element of the film I really struggled with, however, is the female character. Played by Vera Farmiga--she is more of a plot convenience than a real asset to the film. Awkwardly and unbelievably positioned between Damon and DiCaprio, she does little to heighten the drama. It's a huge suspension of belief to put her into the middle of things--and with only an unnecessary romantic subplot to show for it, it just isn't worth it. It's not Farmiga's fault, but the film came to a screeching halt every time she entered into it (especially her absurd doctor/patient interactions with DiCaprio).I definitely recommend ""The Departed."" Close to a great film, it's deliriously entertaining. KGHarris, 11/06."	4.0	Brash, Bold, Complex--The New Scorsese May Not Be A Classic But It's Deliriously Entertaining	2006-12-28	1	1	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A22TZUXUKA11SQ	"K. Hinton ""avid reader"""	"The plot of The Departed basically a question of ""find the mole."" Jack Nicholson plays Frank, the head of an Irish organized crime unit in Boston. His protege Colin, played by Matt Damon, has joined the police force and works as a detective. Not to save the world, mind you, but to fish out information for the mob and prevent Frank from being arrested. On the other side of the law is Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy comes from a family who has a history of ties to the mob, but Billy wants to put that behind him and join the police force. His shady past, however, makes him a better candidate for being an undercover informant. So there you have it. Two moles on two different sides of the law. Who will catch who first?The Departed is visually stunning, as any Scorsese fan will tell you is to be expected, but besides that it's enthralling. The characters are richly drawn and the emotions run high in this crime drama/thriller. It's also a story with so many twists and turns it was hard to keep up. At several times I thought the movie was about to end and then, nope, here comes another twist and the story goes on. It was great and multi-faceted. I think anyone who likes well-planned crime capers, and films about organized crime will love The Departed. With its all star cast and big name director, I wouldn't have expected anything less than perfection. It's nice that I wasn't disappointed."	5.0	Visually stunning... but what else would you expect from Scorsese	2007-01-20	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3TU5QX4TA3XB9	kMan	*** This was copied from a review by LamCui@hotmail.com, with which i agree 100%.*** This review may contain spoilers ***Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD).Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.b. the time-line.c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did?g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me toProduction value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.	1.0	Awful	2011-04-29	23	7	16
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	The story is set in Boston's brutal underworld, where Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the all-powerful crime boss.  Frank mentored a young man (Matt Damon) through the police academy and now he's both a State Trooper and a member of the mob, while the Staties have their own man (Leonardo DiCaprio) working inside Costello's organization.This movie is not for the squeamish; there are almost non-stop bloody killings and barely a line of dialogue that is isn't full of profanities.  Nicholson chews up the scenery as the ruthless kingpin, wallowing in his magnificent evilness.  Unfortunately, I couldn't quite believe Damon and DiCaprio as men who could commit such cruel acts; with their soft babyfaces they looked out of place and when they shared the screen it looked more like a magazine shoot than a shoot out. Leo's bogus attempt at a Boston accent also came up short. All of the mobsters mumble, making them hard to understand, but this is a visual story and a striking one at that.The movie is intense and thrilling, but definitely only for those who like tough crime dramas.	4.0	Definitely a guy movie	2009-04-10	2	1	1

"The DepartedMovie number 2 out of 5 in the list of Best Picture 2007 Oscar nominees was ""The Departed.""The film is destined to become a classic due to many aspects.  Not only will it, I predict, win the Best Picture award this year.  It will also become known as the one which finally won Martin Scorsese a long overdue Academy Award for Directing.Among the other reasons the classic label shall be thrust upon this great piece of filmmaking is an intense, but twist-filled tale of cat and mouse, good and evil, gangster and cop, and pure americana.  The last bit is a tad ironic since it's a remake of a Japanese thriller from a few years ago.With a cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and others, the actors alone make this a film to behold.The plot involves Leo DiCaprio as a kid whose uncle made a few mistakes in his life and wound up killed by Frank Costello (Nicholson.) Later in life he joins the police force, and is offered a position by Sheen and Wahlberg  to help take down Costello and his Irish mob crew. While on the other hand, Matt Damon grew up admiring Costello and moving up the ranks within the Massachusets State Police through hard work and cunning. He's always thinking one step ahead of his superiors.The two lives of DiCaprio and Damon intertwine through minor 'almost' meetings and just misses.  Each of them has set out to detrmine who the rat is for the other side.  Each of them have the task of protecting their own lives and careers while helping those undeserving.  Yet, with all the similarities within each character, they're complete opposites.  Both of them make a living and income from a life of crime. One attempts to shut it down while commiting it elsewhere.  The other tries to commit crimes while wearing the facade he's trying to shut it down elsewhere.The movie is overall fun if nothing else.  For the movie buff who enjoyed Casino, Mean Streets, Goodfellas or any other underground urban gangster film, this is their type of adventure.  Even for some waiting and hoping again for the classic Nicholson craziness audiences love.  His boisterious mannerisms, cocky attitude and smartass evilness is all here in glowing technicolor.  The movie is violent to say the least, and gory especially near the end.  However, it's done reasonably and with merit because it's meant to get the point across of how violent and disgusting a life of crime can get.Clocking in at a little over 2 and a half hours, it's amazing just how little the movies paced dragged on.  Every frame is filled with either excitement, great drama, fantastic acting, or shocking gasp-worthy scenes.Even the music, Scorseses masterful use of classic rock songs from the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd (redone by someone else, unsure of who.) The music doesn't downplay the violence, instead it enhances it.I must say for anyone who doesn't care for Leo DiCaprio (I'm one of them,) this movie will change your mind a bit.  One should with all warrant, feel your heartstrings pull for this character in a tough spot no matter which path in life he chooses.  If anyone doesn't care for Matt Damon as an actor (my wife for example,) this movie isn't going to change your mind soon.  His character is one of pure arrogance and selfishness, one may feel like taking a crowbar to him within the first 15 minutes of his screentime.From the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold.Watch...and enjoy!!"	5.0	Dearly Departed	2007-02-24	3	2	1

I thought it looked like it would be a good movie just because I like Jack Nicholson.

I watched this movie (the first time) and got a little confused in the beginning because of the way it is set up, but I told myself ""Just plow through it and hopefully it will make sense by the ending.""  I was right.  The ending blew me away.  The music is sooooooo awesome and got me into it right from the start.  I absolutely fell in love with Mark Walhberg and Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie.  This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time (I have since watched it 3 times now).  The whole good cop, bad cop storyline is so intriguing.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ICI500LRO01K	Kyle Wells	"You will hear many people being a little wishy-washy about Martin Scorsese while reviewing ""The Departed"". Numerous people after praising such recent efforts as ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" will now go on to say such things as `Scorsese is back' or `Scorsese's best film since' ""Casino"" or ""GoodFellas"". Are comments like these justified? Yes and no. ""Gangs..."" and ""The Aviator"" were good films, especially the latter, but they were not typical Scorsese fare and one couldn't help but wonder whether or not Scorsese had gone a little soft. On the other hand 1999's ""Bringing Out the Dead"" is easily the most underrated film of Scorsese's career, so his talents have not been as sorely missed as some may suggest. But all that aside, when watching ""The Departed"" one can not help but get a little worked up and excited by the fact that for this film Scorsese is doing what Scorsese does best: producing a violent, incredibly foul mouthed, fast paced, uber-masculine, religion shadowed, highly entertaining movie. In many ways, Scorsese is, in fact, back.I say that this kind of film is what Scorsese does best, but really the kind of film this is is a Scorsese film. He invented this particular style of storytelling and is still the only one who can truly pull it off. The film feels and acts like it's straight from the streets and holds nothing back in trying to seem so. The violence is realistic and blatant. The colourful language is appropriate. The characters, situations, locations all feel right, and all because Scorsese knows this material like he knows his own NY neighborhood. Of course it is ultimately a movie, and Scorsese uses his incredible skill as a director and his uncanny use of music and editing to achieve this effect, but with Scorsese, unlike those who imitate him, the whole fabrication of the film feels honest. Scorsese isn't trying to pull one over on us or pathetically trying to pass off content he knows nothing of through a fancy delivery; he's trying to allow us to share in an atmosphere and world he knows well enough to create a definite sense of within the framework of a motion picture. He's using the full cinematic language to create the tone of the material he is presenting, and it is his skill at achieving this `feel' of the film that is his true brilliance.And ""The Departed"" is one of his best. The story may take place in Boston rather than New York and the characters may be Irish rather than Italian, but Scorsese still manages to create a pitch perfect tone for the film. It even seems as though this change of scenery may have breathed new life into the man. The playfulness of his direction is refreshing and it adds great energy to the film. Scorsese's camera is never still and often noticeably cockeyed. He plays with the conventions of film, conventions he himself invented, holding shots a tad to long, taking angles that seem a tad off,  cutting with jittery editing, using odd effects such as the old school iris. The entire film is reminiscent of the last act of ""GoodFellas"", where the editing and cinematography become such an essential part of evoking the events on screen that they carry and drive the material. The content is exciting to be sure, but Scorsese's willingness to experiment and play with the form of the film is its greatest success.The material is certainly striking though. The story of police corruption and organized crime is excellent and the talent brought to the film by its incredible cast is remarkable. DiCaprio is skittish and compelling, Damon tough and commanding, and Nicholson, as always, outrageous and grand. Mark Wahlberg too is great in a small role, and manages to once again remind us that when not in Disney crap like ""Invincible"" he can be a first rate actor. Vera Farmiga is the only mentionable actress in the ensemble and is talented enough to be a notable feminine presence amongst all the testosterone being thrown around on screen. The film does well to balance action with character and it achieves a pace and tone succinct enough to carry its near three hour run time. Pace is essential to a film and with regards to it Scorsese is truly one of the masters. ""The Departed"" like most of his films is fast enough to generate interest but confident enough to sustain it. It would be so easy for a film like this to burn out half way through, but thanks to a plot that never drags and an energizing use of the medium the film never falters or missteps.""The Departed"" is the best film of the year so far and not because it questions the nature of humanity or inspires us to seize the day or whatever. It is great because it is honest, enjoyable, never pretentious, and always invigorating. It reminds us why Scorsese is one of the all time greats and if an Oscar has been deserved in recent years for him than it is for this film above the others. It may not be as large in scale or budget, or as much of a stretch as recent material, but it is what Scorsese, and only Scorsese, does best."	5.0	Scorsese Doing What Scorsese Does Best	2006-10-23	1	0	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1CDZNPO7U4E6N	LadyLestat	"I actually like this movie overall, I just have a few complaints, so bare with me. First of all, I wanna say this cast is amazing. Of course, we all know Jack Nicholson always delivers the goods, but Matt Damon, Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Walhberg were absolutely amazing as well. This movie is full of star power. However, with that being said, this is a typical ""gangster"" movie. They all pretty much follow the same formula. There's always the head ""gangster"" that the star Cop or the F.B.I wanna bring down, but they can't seem to make anything stick. There's the classic mole which could be anybody from a Cop to a D.E.A agent trying to infiltrate the organization as a Narc. You have a lot of unnecessary foul language. There were points in this movie where the language just got worse and worse for absolutely no reason. Don't get me wrong, my ears are nowhere near sensitive, but some of that stuff was just way over the top. Again, that's always classic ""gangster"" movie fashion. This was a good movie, but nothing special by any means. I know I'm not the only one who noticed that Leonardo Dicaprio's accent kinda comes and go's the entire movie. Frankly, I don't think any of the actors pulled off a believable Boston accent throughout the film. I am glad that Mark Walhberg got his much deserved nod from the Academy for his role. It's about time too because I've loved Mark Walhberg for a long time. I also want the Academy to go ahead and give Leonardo Dicaprio the award they have been trying to give him for so long now. At any rate, this a good movie, but I wasn't dazzled. I guess I was looking for the ""WOW FACTOR"" Just keep in mind while watching this movie D.T.A (Don't Trust Anybody). That's all I'll say to keep from spoiling the ending."	5.0	Good Movie...BUT!	2007-02-22	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A4E7GD5DPTAAL	Lawrence Miller	"This does tell some plot secrets, but gently. Has spoilers.I cop to its deep professionalism. Truth told, I went mostly to see Martin Sheen, deserved star of THE WEST WING, reduced to a minor role, and prove himself by far the best actor in the film. To see him and Jack Nicholson in one short scene together was a treat. Thing is, Nicholson it seemed to me, an actor I respect, was playing his character as if he were The Joker, sans joke, a humorless Joker.It was a good story and Vera Farmiga was a plus.But I didn't care about anybody. BigNameActor/MainCharacterA got shot. Who cared. Same with B or C or D.  I never really ""got"" the DiCaprio character, nor why he was a best-actor nominee; good job, no more than that, not remotely on the same level as Mirren or Dench. Alec Baldwin did a good job, very good, but his character was irrelevant to the story so why was he there?As a documentary it may have some value, same as THE BLACK DONNELLYS may. As an example of the art of storytelling, of mystery writing (and it really was a mystery genre pretending to be a police/crook genre, whatever that is called), it did a good job but the emotion of the drama was subsumed under the action and gunshots. Another hood gets shot? Oh well... So they almost all died, no loss to me or to society and thus the movie failed.What's with Scorsese? As his skill increased his humanity fell? THE SOPRANOS does it better, with less detail perhaps, and a lot more emotional impact. I know Tony is a vicious killer, not too different from the Nicholson character. But I was happy the latter got killed and I hope Tony finds a way out, sad to say. I wonder if others could get into this movie more than I could.And oh, it violtaed a principle stated clearly in the newish David Mamet book, BAMBI VS. GODZILLA, about ""aesthetic distance"": It's okay to show a 555 phone number in a cartoon or spoof, but not in a serious realistic drama like this. Scorsese broke Mamet's rule, and it hurt the scene. ""Remember,"" it implied, ""This is just a movie not real.""By the way, his name is pronounced SKOR-SESS-SEE, not SKOR-SAY-ZEE."	3.0	Heavy handed and lightweight	2007-03-04	11	3	8

I will, however, provide a fair warning for those wanting to purchase the blu-ray version of this film: if you have theThe Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)and you care more about special features than a minor picture quality upgrade, just keep your DVD copy. I say this b/c the blu-ray version notably excludes the feature lenth TCM profile Scorsese on Scorsese, which is a movie length bonus feature about Scorsese's career, with him in the driver's seat of chronicling it. When I noticed this feature wasn't included on the blu-ray special features section, I wondered why they included all of the other bonus features except for that one so I did a little online research and found out that in order to fit everything on one blu-ray disc at full HD capacity, they decided to exclude that feature. I was a bit surprised that the online reviewers who provided that information said that wasn't a deal breaker if you wanted to upgrade to the blu-ray version and I would tend to agree, only if you plan on keeping the 2 disc DVD version and you get the blu-ray cheap. In my personal opinion, I would just stay with the 2 disc special edition on DVD if you already have it and it's in good shape but if you just have the basic 1 disc version or you don't have it at all, then the blu-ray purchase is certainly worthwhile. Also, don't be fooled by the blu-ray steelbook editions, as their features are exactly the same as the basic blu-ray release and one less than the 2 disc DVD. You're basically paying extra for the steelbook. One format or the other, though, you must own this movie!	4.0	5 stars for the movie, 4 for the blu-ray edition	2013-07-17	1	1	0

It has all one would expect from Scorsese and the top name stars.  Great performances be all.Reading the reviews by critics a few criticized Nicholson for his performance, being his usual Jack Nicholson self.  When one hires Nicholson one should know what to expect.  Scorsese know what he would get, it is most likely what he wanted and that is why he picked Nicholson for the part.Getting to the two things that are wrong with this movie: Alec Baldwin and the ending.Alec Baldwin is not the actor he used to be.  His acting as suffered and he is no longer the ""A"" list star headliner of movies.  Maybe it is because he could never really act, or maybe, as I think, he has become so full of himself and he inserts his poiltics into his acting, which adversly affects his acting.  Which leads to the stupidest thing in the movie.  Where Baldwin breaks character and screams (paraphased) "" I love the Patriot Act"".  A real cop in that position would not do that.The second thing wrong with this movie is the ending.  Or perhaps it is the/an event leading to the ending that is wrong.  If DiCaprio had exited the elevator the way he entered, with extreme caution, I expect that things would have been different.  Scorsese should have worked out a better scenerio to get to the ending that he wanted.And what is with this second mole in the Police Depart. coming out of nowhere?"	5.0	Two things wrong with this movie	2006-12-09	10	2	8

It seemed to have all the elements I like... mob....corruption....violence...famous director (Scorcese).... Movie stars (Jack Nickolson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio ...  big budget.  The critics all praise it and it's a box office hit.But, frankly, I found it confusing, pretentious and lacking characters that I could care about.It's set in modern Boston where the Irish Mafia rules.  Jack Nicholson has seduced a kid into a life of crime and we know he is grooming him to be his connection in the police department.  There's another young cop being groomed by the police department to infiltrate Jack Nicholson's organization.  So here we see the two young men at cross purposes.  I know this might sound silly, but it took me a while to figure all of this out.  Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio look alike to me.  Also, both are really bad actors.  It's hard to see emotion on their faces.  And neither seems authentic.  Lionardo DiCaprio is just Hollywood and plays the role so over-the-top  macho that he seems like a stereotype rather than a person.  Naturally, a young nave police psychologist falls for him.  This romance is all about wisecracks by DiCaprio.  There just doesn't seem to be any romantic chemistry.  The best acting, of course, is by Jack Nicholson.  He seems to shine in everything he does.  But I didn't get the feeling of him being a mobster.  Yes, there was one scene where he talked rough and cheated some Asian dope dealers.  But he didn't seem like a bad guy.I found the plot hard to follow.  I also just didn't care and spent too much time looking at my watch and waiting for it to end.  The last ten minutes have a lot of bloodshed.  That's the way they concluded all the loose ends of the plot.  I also could never figure out where the title ""The Departed"" came from.I can't recommend this film. This certainly is no ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"".

Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson, often reminding me of his role in ""The Shining"".  And Matt Damon ""mans up"" in a way that will surprise all.  Everyone in this flick does a masterful job.  However, although the only signigicant female, Vera Farmiga, was out of her league here.  If the plan was for her role to be downplayed, it would have worked better if she wasn't even in the movie - no one would have missed her.  Again, another part that could just as easily been done as a ""phone in"".  And, while I love Anthony Anderson, he also seems like he just wandered onto the set so Martin Scorsese factored him in.This is one of the very best movies of all time.

But you're a girl!""Sex doesn't matter when you love this kind of action movie! It is brilliantly made, with wonderful characters that are played to the hilt  by each actor. You may be able to figure out what might happen in some places, but there are always surprises you would have never thought coming!My title describes what I think of DiCaprio's performance in this movie. He has turned a page in his career and cannot be thought of as a ""young adult"" actor anymore. Scorcese seems to have brought out the best in him as they have worked together. His character is believable, and you can definitely feel for this man who wants to do the best he can, but has to deal with a lot of emotional baggage that comes with being an undercover cop.Jack (Nicholson) is the disturbing villian once again! This character was tailor made for him. Martin and Leo fought to convince Jack to do this film, and boy, are we glad he agreed! You can see his character, Costello, start to unravel mentally towards the end. I wish he's win SOME award for this!Matt Damon's character is all the more chilling because of the traditional ""good boy"" roles he's had in the past. Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg give the film some good comedic moments while remaining totally immersed in their character. I couldn't help but love Martin Sheen in this movie!

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2KHE353KJDQY6	"lmacbeth08 ""LMac"""	"If you've gotten to the point where you're reading movie reviews, you probably don't need a plot synopsis, so let's skip it.  So how good is this movie...?  I would say that this movie is to cinema what ""An American Tragedy"" is to literature - the most poorly made great piece of work of its time.It's a great movie in the following ways:  1) The script is tightly plotted.  Nothing is superfluous, nothing is overdone or overlooked, and the REAL RARITY?  YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION.  If you miss a second of this movie, you won't understand how the rest of it unfolds.  2) It's nice to watch some of the best living American actors all do their thing in a single film. Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio turn in particularly fine performances, and Matt Damon seemed to be extending his range (happily), playing a character for whom one cannot feel sorry, nor want to take home to meet Mom. 3)  Depending on how you feel about one liners generally, the one liners are good, and very apt.  I could go on about the familial and racial subtexts here as well, but suffice it to say that there is more than one character trying to please Daddy, and if you're black, Italian, Arab or Catholic, the first twenty minutes won't give you the warm fuzzies.The Departed is less than stellar in the following ways:  1) As mentioned in several other reviews, the ending is a bit ludicrous. It felt like plot twists were being made for their own sake, rather than for the good of the film or the story.  Without being a spoiler, let me just say here that I DID respect the choice NOT to pander to the mass audience's sensibilities in terms of what happens to the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys, or to reveal too much information in the end. 2) A few of these (albeit brilliant) actors are cast as themselves.  Jack Nicholson brought out Jack the bad guy/madman for us, and Alec Baldwin was as smarmy on screen as we filthy little pigs are accustomed to seeing him offscreen.  Most of these actors really brought their A-games though. And really, are Jack and Alec playing themselves the worst thing you could watch?  Methinks not! 3) Aside from the ending, my one complaint with the script is that it was over-plotted and under-characterized.  There were so many plot lines (two A lines, as well as B and C lines) that there just wasn't time for the main characters to have much of an arc.  From beginning to end, Costello is Costello, Sullivan is Sullivan and Costigan is Costigan.  The only two characters who seem to take themselves off the path they initially set out on were Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga's characters.Departures in The Departed: Although the characters in this film are believeable and very well acted, make no mistake: this is a plot driven movie.  This seems contrary to the recent films of most of the lead actors, as well as for director Martin Scorcese.  Also, this is a film that was truly made in the editing room.  Although DiCaprio and Damon have the two A plot lines, they're in only 2 or 3 scenes together.  There's a lot of editorial juxtaposition, cutting back and forth, and it can get a bit obvious - and overbearing.  Another departure from Scorcese's style can be found in the cinematography, which is tighter and less panaromic than he seems to prefer.  However, once you've seen a shot of Jack Nicholson lit in redlight showering two half naked women in coke, you'll remember whose movie you're watching.All in all, I would say buy the movie.  But don't turn away - you'll miss something important."	4.0	No One Here Gets Out Alive	2008-06-23	1	1	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A24H35U47VPA9P	Lord Darkseid	"The only reason this film was nominated for an Oscar is because of the Scorcese name and the cast of actors. I think we all have figured out by now that the motion picture academy is like the popular group we all knew in high school. They'll only let a few select individuals in their little clique. As a result, we get the same directors and actors being wrongfully praised as being the top of their fields when they aren't deserving of it. ""The Departed"" is no exception. Let me start off by saying that I was entertained. I liked the movie, but its ORDINARY.This is not an instant classic. It's not a brilliant work of art. Its generic. This is just like every other mobster movie ever made. They try to throw in several twists in the end but it only achieved making the film seem even more pointless. You walk away from the movie learning absolutely nothing. Scorcese didn't cover any new ground. I honestly think Hollywood has forgotten how to make riveting movies. I will note that I thought Leo Dicaprio's performance was really good. He took a mediocre script and did his best to still pull off an amazing performance on his part. Now, Jack Nicholson on the other hand was just plain Jack Nicholson! He acts the same in every movie he's done the past 20 years.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JX5C8CIOJ5L5	macdougallgreen6	Winner of Four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. Featuring an ensemble of great performances including Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating thug leader Jack Nicholson's crime syndicate, a snake in the grass crooked cop Matt Damon who's on Nicholson's payroll, Martin Sheen as one of DiCaprio's handlers, and a foul-mouthed Mark Wahlburg in what is undeniably his best performance, Scorcese's 2006 crime saga is a remake of a Hong Kong-made trilogy called Infernal AffairsThe Infernal Affairs Trilogy (Infernal Affairs 1 / Infernal Affairs 2 / Infernal Affairs 3) (Special Collector's Edition Box Set).At 2 hours and 31 minutes, this film is rather lengthy, but it feels about as half as long as it really is, with incredible suspense and intense scenes of violence that make Goodfellas look like the Wizard of Oz. What's really so great about this film is that it feels like it's been around for decades instead of just a few years. From the time it came out it felt like a classic, not only because of Scorcese's signature style of homage and innovation but also for the well-written script by screenwriter William Monahan.I own the single-disc Full Screen copy, and my only complaint with it is that it is full-screen. You really need to see this film at it's original aspect ratio to appreciate how wonderfully it is made. Buy the widescreen single disc version or the double-disc widescreen version, you'll be a lot happier.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	I suppose it's faint praise to say that one of the brighter points of The Departed is a solid performance by the now bloated and pasty Alec Baldwin. After the shock of seeing his face is such a sad state, you realize he's become a character actor. And a good one. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific, too. He makes the most of a terrific character with poorly written dialogue. It's a testament to his immense talent. The rest of the cast is so-so, with Nicholson reduced to a self-parody. He's fun for a while, but a weak link in a pretty strong cast. Matt Damon makes the most of a lousy role brimming with bad lines. To the extent he pulls it off, it's on charisma only. The worst performance of the lot is the only female character to speak of. Vera Farmiga simply isn't up to the task, and you end up focussing on her nose job. How she made it past auditions is not only a mystery, but a shock.The Departed is weak where it should be strong. We get a small glimpse of the possibilities when DiCaprio's character trails Damon's character. It gives a hint of the cat and mouse possibilities of having a mole stalking a rat -- cool stuff, but a completely wasted set of possibilities. At moments where you think the dramatic tension ought to get ratcheted up, it falls flat. And then there are twists for the sake of twists, with weak pay-offs and even weaker set-ups.I gave this movie a 3 because of DiCaprio. I liked his character and his performance immensely. He makes you engaged when, by all rights, you shouldn't be. He dominates the screen and the film. It's worth seeing for that alone.By the way, the final image in the movie may be the silliest, most pathetic thing I've seen in a while. Dumb, dumb, dumb.	3.0	Good, off and on.

I'd really like to see him try.  Matt Damon was so unbelieveable.  I can believe Matt as Jason Bourne, but this cardboard character in ""The Departed"" just fell flat.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ULSA0IRUE09E	Marc Cabir Davis	"I am going to keep this review relevant to the pros/cons of the movie, and inform you of the reasons why you should buy this movie on DVD:1. Martin Scorcese's Best Movie Ever : No, Im not kidding, I frankly think this is the best picture he has ever directed. I know some people thought that his Oscar was undeserved for this film, but I am positive this is his best work - even ahead of his DeNiro arc and the brilliance of his later work with DiCaprio. I think that even though this remains a remake of an Asian film, he gave it enough personality of its' own, and that his directorial style finally moved toward being less mainstream, and more artistic. Never has bloodshed seemed so sudden yet so inspired - violence reaches levels unlike the cartoonish depictions of Tarantino's work - what Martin achieves here is pure cinematic poetry.2. Leonardo DiCaprio in his second best performance of all time : Leo has always been a directors' actor, and I still think his greatest performance of all time has been in ""Blood Diamond"" (another instant classic). But his performance here where he overcomes his own acting limitations to literally 'become' the character he plays is admirable. Leo has it all - raw sex appeal, acting chops, and an uncanny knack of knowing how to give the camera his best shot - plus his troubled performance as an undercover cop here is head and shoulders above some of the more early dramatic performances he excelled in (eg ""The Beach"")3. Matt Damon as a slimeball : I loved his negative turn in ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" and his character here, while not as weird, is certainly equally disturbed and foul. Matt's pretty boy looks translate very well when he wants to play a negative role, and his performance here won me as a new fan. I never really thought of him as much of an actor either way, but his performance here was admirable to say the least.4. Mark Wahlberg as a foulmouthed cop : I have never heard such foul language from one character in a film in forever, so listening to Mark Wahlberg here was shocking - you must watch this if only to be startled by the language he uses!5. Jack Nicholson in one of his most humorously dark roles : It is hard to take his character seriously but watching NICHOLSON in a SCORCESE movie (!) itself was worth the price of admission. He has such hilarious one-liners and the best screentime. As usual, he walks through the role, and his presence here overshadows everyone, including the luminous DiCaprio in most scenes.6. The Story : Everyone pretty much knows that this tale is about everyone betraying everyone, but to see it played out and watching everyone reach their unique and very sudden deaths was a treat in itself!I must say, I am not usually a fan of violent movies, but the fact that this film made me embrace the genre readily was quite a revelation. Why? Well I have to hand it to Scorcese - he has taken what was pretty much a basic cops and baddies tale and revolutionized it with his clever direction and some excellent dialogue. Also, hes gotten the best actors to work with him, so thats great.Another thing - the film holds up very well on repeated viewing. This is an excellent film to watch again and again - and actually gets better upon repeat views (I've seen it three times, about to watch it a fourth, and am still excited about the prospect).To sum this up, ""The Departed"" is easily Scorcese's best film because its one made for this generation, while respecting the film making techniques of the past. Its bold, brash and unnerving, and extracts the best performances from its' leads.Special mention must be made of the male lead - Leonardo DiCaprio. Never before has this actor looked this good on screen - age works its' wonders - and last year saw him in two of his greatest films of all time. This is one actor who I will be watching in every one of his future films, and if its enough - should be the only reason to pick up this DVD.Timeless and endlessly re-watchable, ""The Departed"" needs a place in your DVD library. You'll be watching this one again and again - for years."	5.0	Scorcese's Best, in my opinion - A Masterpiece	2007-03-14	11	6	5

His appeal in this movie adds alot, as does the other stars fine performances. Martin Scorcese's cinematography and the rapid pace of the storytelling don't leave any moments for attention lapses. The information comes at you pretty non-stop and if your not paying attention, you might miss a crucial element to the complex story. Involved as it is, it still was very well conceived I felt. What a complicated balancing act Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio's characters juggled! Every twist and turn to the story made the entire thing all the more compelling to watch. Everyone will decide for themselves how this Scorcese flick stacks up to his others, but comparisons notwithstanding, it was a highly entertaining and well done drama.	4.0	Vastly entertaining , but hit PAUSE if you have to go to the john!	2007-02-19	4	3	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33775AIB1A664	"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url"""	"This is a fast-moving, complex story where you really have to pay attention to follow what's going on.  The attempt at accents, and the real accents, and Jack Nicholson's mumbling can make the dialog a bit hard to understand, but the dialog is essential to following the story.  Turning on subtitles, or turning up the center speaker, may help.It's a Hong Kong cop movie rehosted to the Massachusetts State Police, but set in Boston.  It's cruel and violent at times, not for the squeamish.  After Gilbert Grape, I think it is one of DiCapprio's better performances.  Even Jack Nicholson manages to play a character not entirely resembling Jack Nicholson sometimes.  Matt Damon, too.  And some other big names in smaller roles.The back cover gives away enough of the plot to give you the basic idea up to about 3/4 of the way through.  If you don't read it, you might still figure out the trajectory of the plot.  But there are nooks and crannies, twists and turns, along the way to keep it interesting.As a metro Boston resident, I enjoyed some very familiar locations, notably Boston's Chinatown, even if the scenes seem to suggest that a certain alley exists near the dogs at the entrance.  There's no alley like that there; there's one like it around the corner a block away.  But this obviously does not detract from the story, and is not out of the ordinary for a location movie.When I say ""Good to a point"", I mean that I thought it was interesting until it was time to wrap up the story.  That happens swiftly, and isn't all that interesting.  I was a bit let down by the ending.I might give it three and a half stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that.  It's closer to four, so that's what it gets from me."	4.0	Good to a point (no spoilers)	2013-01-03	3	2	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JBJSKB2HG6FH	Mark Greenbaum	The Departed was my favorite film in 2006, and probably the best movie I've seen in the theater in several years.  The plot and the setting were very compelling, but the best part was the incredible cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and especially Jack Nicholson were all outstanding in their roles as cops and mobsters.At times, I have felt that Nicholson gets way too much credit for his acting, and that he seems to play the same iconoclastic rebel in all of his roles.  I was wrong: Jack Nicholson is one of the best parts of this movie.  Nicholson is superb as a Boston mafia boss, and he completely dominates most of the movie with his persona.  You never quite know what he is going to do, and have to watch in anticipation.  While not quite as dominated a presence, DiCaprio is also excellent as an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the mob.  Throughout the film, he appears calm in many scenes, but exudes a strong frantic sense, as his life hangs on a thread as he tries to hide his true identity.  Matt Damon is great as a dirty cop if for no other reason than you spend the whole film hoping he gets his come-uppance.  Finally, I really enjoyed Walberg as an intense detective whose angry exterior betrays his disgust at being unable to lock up Nicholson and a deeper class resentment.  I do wish his character had gotten more screen time and been explored a bit more.  Hopefully if the DVD has deleted scenes, some of them will have Wahlberg in them.The Departed explores several fascinating themes.  The first, is obviously identity.  Many of the main characters spend much of the film grappling with who they are and where they belong.  Dicaprio is torn between being a cop and upholding the law and assimilating himself as part of a violent criminal organization.  Similarly, Damon works as a decorated cop, but he works diligently for criminal Nicholson.  Questions abound about whether the characters are completely good or bad, and it is unclear if they themselves know.Another great theme is that of change.  The first scenes in the movie show Boston's (violent) resistance to the school busing of the 1970s, while Nicholson laments how the city and its culture have changed.  Throughout the film, Nicholson and other show degrees of disgust to how they feel Boston's character has been tainted by new people and classes.  I thought this was very interesting, and well fits Boston, a city that is rapidly changing from what it was for generations.  For example, many parts of South Boston, where a lot of the movie takes place, have become gentrified and less Irish working class.I could talk about The Departed for hours, as there are hundreds of interesting parts worth discussing.  Needless to say, it's a splendid movie.  While there are some parts that don't quite make sense -- for example, it seems very unlikely that Nicholson could be so brazen and escape justice time after time -- but they are few and far between.  The best movie of 2006, no doubt about it.	5.0	My favorite movie of 2006	2006-12-23	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"Martin Scorsese finally took home his first Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Departed"". With consummate skill he assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave.The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as ""Internal Affairs"". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the ""Internal Affairs"" script. The story is a compelling narrative. Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an ""edited for TV"" version.The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston ""Southie"" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the ""mole"" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.)Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is ""ungettable"" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. ""The Departed"" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films!Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both ""moles"", not knowing the ""true identity"" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department ""rat"" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in ""The Third Man"" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic.Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, ""Frenchie"") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would ""star"" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns.The plotting and timing are relentless. There are a half dozen scenes with more edge-of-your-seat white-knuckle tension than a hundred chainsaw and machete wielding madmen movies combined. DiCaprio's performance brings home the fear that the character must have constantly been feeling. If discovered, he would certainly be killed by Costello's mobsters in a way that would serve as an example. The film ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a ""Hollywood"" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for ""Best Picture"" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make ""The Departed"" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week?

The good guy is Billy Costigan played by Leonardo di Caprio. Here he is driven almost insane by his role as an undercover cop - mental survival is his big challenge. The baddie is Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon - He goes from success to success in the Police supplying his mentor/godfather and with inside information. The godfather in this case is Frank Costello - played by Jack Nicholson, perhaps over-played is a better description of his swagger and insanity.Damon is only mediocre in the role, di Caprio is great but the great player for me is Mark Whalberg as Seargent Dignam he is such a star in his minor supporting role. Whalberg is a highlight.Another great highlight is the very creative and inspiring sound track especially with Van Morisson singing the great Pink Floyd classic Comfortably Numb - Amazing.	4.0	Comfortably Numb - NOT	2006-11-10	0	0	0

After 27 years of being nominated, he finally got the award he desearved. Not that he needed an oscar to prove his worth in the movie world. Scorsese is by far the one of the best directors of any generation. But this movie is still worth a watch. It's a rivetting tale of murder, deceit, and betrayel. Everyone gives it their all.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3G36K8ORL9BFI	"Mary E. Clarneau ""mary clarneau movie buff"""	Martin Scorcese is definitly a brilliant director, there is just no question, but many were angry that this was the movie for which he was finally recognized at the Academy Awards. I enjoyed this movie immensely, watching it over and over.The thing about this movie that is so genuis to me is there are two characters living very different lives coming to the same result.Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon enter state police training. Matt Damon passes with flying colors and is immediately made into a sergeant. His secret, he is friends with Jack Nicholson,(Costello) a very evil mastermind that generates just about all of the cities crime. He is based on a true character of that time with a few small changes. Scorcese even recruited the police chief that worked on the case for a small part in honoring the new state police which I found to be very noble. Leonardo DiCaprio doesnt quite make it through the state police due to his background they don't quite trust him with the responsiblity. As he fails that, and is told he could be an astronaut not a statey, he is recruited to be undercover in Costellos crew to finally catch him and his gang once and for all. Costello ends up liking him, while questioning his motives.Excellent movie, lots of decisions to be made which leads us to a very complex conclusion. Superb acting from many of our leading men including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3U3BEZMH3F01Q	maskirovka	"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and thought it was good, tense crime drama. As everyone knows, it's an adaptation of the foreign film ""Infernal Affairs.""  But I think I see another influence, namely, the true story of Whitey Bulger and the ""Winter Hill"" mob of Boston.For those who don't know about him, Bulger was a crime boss quite similar to the fictional one played by Jack Nicholson.  Like Nicholson's character, Bulger has a long list of killings and dirty deeds to his name.  Like Nicholson's character, Bulger was an FBI informant who traded on that status to win a certain degree of immunity for himself and his associates (while feeding less fortunate thugs to the feds).  The final similarity is that Bulger had something akin to what Nicholson's character had in that played by Matt Damon, a source inside law enforcement.  The only difference is that Bulger's de facto source was his supposed FBI case officer, John Connolly.Bulger's life is a very sordid story and the FBI's handling of him ranks up with the Robert Hanssen espionage debacle as a blot on its record.  People who are interested further should check out a book called ""Black Mass"" (the author's name escapes me).  It's pretty good.I think that ""the Departed"" does a pretty good job distilling the often uncinematic aspects of criminal life in south Boston into a drama that crackles with tension.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and it keeps the viewer guessing to almost the very end.  While Nicholson dominates the film with his mob boss portrayal, Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio do a great job as well.This being said, the film is not perfect.  I have four gripes with it:1.  I don't think it really explained why someone like the character played by Dicaprio would subject himself to the degradation that he endures in the movie (ostensibly being kicked out of the police force and serving a sentence in prison to build his credibility.  Maybe there are police officers who are dedicated --or crazy enough-- to do someting like that.  But the film never tells us why Dicaprio's character would be willing to do that.2.  I also didn't buy the idea of the police psychologist getting herself romantically involved with Dicaprio's character.  I found it hard to believe that someone who is a trained psychologist who correctly saw that Dicaprio's character had serious personal problems, was maybe developing a drug problem, and was an apparent felon would let herself do that.  But when Dicaprio stares hungrily at her and the music swells, the next thing you know, she's on her back. I didn't buy it, and I could hear the ""mandatory romance for Dicaprio"" plot wheels turning.3.  I thought that one of the very last plot twists wasn't adequately explained.  What a particular character does provides a shock, but when you think about it, you find yourself asking, ""how would he have known where to go and what to do at that time?""4.  I thought the idea of the Massachusetts State Police having a hard time smoking out a corrupt cop like Damon's character was a little bit silly.  Frankly, I think a police sergeant who is living in a palatial condo (or apartment) with a beautiful view of the cityscape, who has a stereo system that looks very expensive, who can afford to take his girlfriend to five star restaurants, and afford law school to boot would stand out like a blinking neon sign if the police did a cursory comparison of what the man had in terms of legitimate income versus what his expenses were.This being said, ""the Departed"" is a very entertaining flick, and I know I will be buying the DVD when it comes out."	4.0	Very Good but not Great	2006-11-30	4	3	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A22JG2WG04EJSL	Matthew Moses	"I have just never responded to Scorsese [okay, I liked Kundun]. I just don't find much meaning in all that macho blustering, and I find his movies very unemotional and cold. I also just don't respond to gangster movies. I don't find them compelling at all. So this may account for my feeling of intense annoyance when walking out of The Departed.The first 20 minutes are fantastic. Scorsese lays out the histories of Damon as Sullivan, being a good boy and rising up the police ranks while all the time beholden to Nicholson's Boston crime boss Costello. DiCaprio has a more troubled history [during which I was never convinced WHY he wanted to be a cop], but both of their stories are laid out in a very quick and energetic way. The friend I went with was talking about the quick, staccato editing here that ""is almost like the intro to a TV show where they tell you what happened last week,"" but for me it really worked.So Damon goes on this elite police force and DiCaprio is asked to go undercover with Costello. From there it's all Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco [okay, there's one gangster movie I responded to], with the additional wrinkle of that both guys need to discover the identity of the other one. There are lots of near-misses, lots of one-person-relaying-information-while-the-other-is-too, and gallons of macho bluster and OTT mugging from Nicholson [who wasn't quite as bad with that as I expected]. There is funny faux-Mamet patter like Alec Baldwin quickly saying ""I'm gonna go outside and get a smoke. You want a smoke? No? What are you, some kind of fitness freak? Go f*** yourself,"" or a guy, after being shot in the knee. Whining ""I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It hurts!"" that are amusing, but that's when you still believe that this story is going to come to something.I can't even be bothered to talk about the many twists and turns, because in the end they turn out mostly to be just time-wasters, and as we headed into the last hour I started thinking ""Why do we need this scene? This scene could go. And what about that scene before? That was just another version of the many scenes we've seen before"" which is not something I think any filmmaker wants the audience to be concerned with while they're watching a film.And finally, it just doesn't come to much. Maybe it's a case of my expectations; I thought we were building toward a big showdown between Damon and DiCaprio where they would really have at it, and then it's getting to be 30 minutes `til the end [I was definitely waiting], then 15 minutes `til the end.... And that's when I really started to turn against the movie. Which is not even to mention the overall dissatisfaction of the ending. I want to avoid giving anything away, but suffice to say that the thing I wanted to see, we did not see. And we saw a whole lot of something else that, yeah, I guess it's one worldview, but it's not a worldview I find particularly compelling or interesting. And it's kind of a worldview that you don't need two-and-a-half hours to express, and is probably why I was so bitter that I felt this movie wasted so much of my time... for that. But Scorsese seems to be unable to make a movie that is less than two-and-a-half hours, and if he did, well, how would we know that it's an important film?My friend [who liked it a little more than I did] asked me ""well, how is this different from De Palma?"" [And I was indeed sitting there wishing De Palma had directed it instead.] My answer was, well, in De Palma there is emotional content that gives me something to get involved with, whereas with Scorsese it's all tough guy blather with a little emotional stuff [here, the psychologist] thrown in for a little color, but the focus is on the guns and the cell phones and the tension and just how very hard these guys are. Wow, they sure are hard, tough guys, Marty. Wow.Secondly, when De Palma enters into a set-piece, the sense I get from what's on screen [and this is highly subjective, just my feeling] is that he's inviting you, the audience, to play along and he wants you to enjoy it. The sense I get with Scorsese is that he wants you to passively sit back and admire his skill. Add that to how cold I find his films, and the sense I get is of Scorsese casting himself as the tough guy through his show-offy-yet-stand-offish technique, just as his films are filled with tough guys that he is unable to be. Yeah, yeah, Marty, you're the man, okay? Now go be the man over there.The final shot is a somewhat sledgehammer-subtle message that there will always be corruption in the highest offices of power. Is this a statement? Well, obviously it's a statement, but is it an interesting statement? Did we need a 150 minutes to tell us this? Especially given the current state of Congress?Everyone else loves this film, so take that as you may. As I said, I just don't respond to gangster movies and I just don't respond to Scorsese movies. The performances here are all very good and it's certainly well made but... take a half hour off and I'd be fine. And change the ending."	3.0	[Fart noise]	2007-06-22	12	7	5

I am a native Bostonian, and I sat in the theater watching this movie in Oregon, listening to a bunch of left coast people talk about how bad the accents were. Being something of an authority on the subject, I have to tell you folks, for the most part, the accents are pretty spot on. What most people think is a Boston accent is what is off. The accents also ranged from Southie to the Cape to Lynn, which I thought was pretty cool.As far as the content of the movie, I really enjoyed it. The premise was interesting, the excecution easy to follow, and the acting pretty damn good.

It has allowed him to deservedly win his first Oscar.The story is about two moles symmetrically infiltrating enemy organizations: Massachusetts State Police Headquarters and Mob's Boss Entourage.This unimaginable & improbable situation gives birth to an exciting & intelligent film!Each mole is followed from the first step he gives to penetrate the organization. The film explores differences and similarities in each career. There is one basic trait that deeply affects both of them: a mounting life-stress due to that they are basically and emotionally the opposite of what their daily life is.Both organizations become simultaneously aware that they are infiltrated by the Enemy. HQ and Big Bosses grow increasingly mad & apply pressure to their spies to discover who the rival is. Action is more and more frantic until the end.I think the movie has many strong points.First: a very intelligent screenplay from Hong Kong born Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong adapted by Oscar winner William Monahan.Second: Scorsese's direction at par with his most successful precedents ""Raging Bull"" (1980), ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and ""NY, NY"" (1977).Third play acting: Jack Nicholson once again fleshing a complex character; Leonardo DiCaprio & Matt Damon, as the moles, is convincing and forceful; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Vera Farmiga are solid and last but not least Mark Wahlberg is a step above these last three. This is quite a huge number of excellent performances for just one film!Fourth: film editing in charge of multiple Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker, with a long story of association with Scorsese.This movie is one of the best action films I've seen lastly!Reviewed by Max Yofre."	5.0	Beware: the Moles are inside!	2007-11-06	5	3	2

This film is so freaking amazing, I have been watching it probably twice year since it came out.  So I saw a deal and got a copy.  It's been several years now, but at the time it blew my mind.  Everyone dies.  That's a great twist for a mob movie.  But that's just one detail.  I think Jack does an amazing job.  All the performances are a ten.  Great symbolism, scenery (I love Boston), story, soundtrack.  And long ago Mick sang, ""all sinners saints, every cop a criminal.""  So the nature of the human to have both sides, the duality that is explored, makes it all the more interesting.  Is Colin a product of his environment?  Does he just owe Frank everything?  Or is he really bad and will do anything to get ahead, whatever it is?  We certainly don't see him torn and tormented like Billy is.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BKMZ1YHKFCQR	me	"This is not a bad movie.  The story is great.  The duality of good and evil used to be a staple of Hollywood film making during the noir era.  This tradition has found worthy heirs in Hong Kong directors, while Hollywood has happily descended into the moral clarity of Spielberg land where you can take a still shot and immediately tell who the good and who are the bad guys are.Scorsese went to great lengths arguing that Departed is ""not a remake"" of Infernal Affairs, because the scriptwriter has moved the plot from Hong Kong to Boston.  Yeah, right.  Departed is as faithful a remake as any, up to the ubiquitous cell phone rings, etc.  There are only three changes Scorsese makes, and all of those are disastrous.  (Attention: spoilers --- skip 1.-3. if you haven't seen it yet.)  1. The antagonists Damon and DiCaprio fall in love with the same woman.  It's the cheapest trick ever to establish a connection between the two.  The original version works beautifully without such conventional soap opera techniques.  2. When Damon, the mobster mole in the police force, shoots his gang boss Nicholson, he does so in self defense, as Nicholson is about to kill him. In the original version, Tony Leung kills the mobster in cold blood to get rid of the only person who knows about his true identity. Only by killing him can Leung break free from his past and truly become the respectable member of society he feels he has become over time anyway --- needless to say, a much stronger message.  3. There seems to be a Hollywood mantra that bad deeds must not go unpunished.  So Scorsese has to have Damon killed at the end in an utterly implausible epilog.All these modifications are in line with Scorsese's apparent attempt at domesticating the complex plot of Infernal Affairs for, well, us.  It is a manifestation of a great plot however that it survives those mutilations and still functions.  As has been said about the music of J.S. Bach: it cannot be destroyed by bad interpretations.The acting in Departed is good throughout, with the exception perhaps of Nicholson who at this point in his career can only play himself.  Otherwise, even Damon delivers his goods, no comparison with his droopy-eyed ""hug me, I'm not really evil""-performances of the Bourne trilogy.In the ocean of rip-off artists that is Hollywood today, Scorsese stood out by reliably coming up with original plots.  Aviator and Las Vegas cannot not stand up to his earlier work, but at least they were genuinely Scorsese --- catholic male rage and all.  It is not surprising that his peers denied him any Oscar honors until he joined the camp of copy cats of the Soderbergh ilk.  Still, if you live somewhere without access to foreign films shown on big screen, watch it.  If you have the chance to see Infernal Affairs instead, don't waste your time on Departed."	2.0	Departed departs in three ways from IA--I wished it hadn't	2007-11-04	3	1	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""The Departed"" is an excellent cop thriller revolving around Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his inside man, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is embedded within the police force. Sullivan gives the impression of heading up the Costello investigation, when in reality he's secretly feeding Frank enough information to keep his buddy one step ahead of the police. Meanwhile, disgraced police cadet William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is pressured into going undercover as one of Costello's newest soldiers. Costigan attempts to help the police bring down Costello and identify the leak within the Boston P.D.This film is fast-paced and very exciting throughout. There are many multiple subplots that involve Sullivan and Costigan searching for each other and simultaneously romancing the same woman (Vera Farmiga). The film also contains excellent supporting roles played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who deliver powerful (and at times hilarious) performances. ""The Departed"" never loses momentum, and it's full of surprising twists and turns right up until the final scene. The cast is excellent and everyone delivers outstanding performances. I think the only gripe I have about the movie is that Damon's Boston accent tends to fade in and out from scene to scene, which becomes pretty annoying after a while. Still, it was great to see Damon play a slimy character for once, and watching Damon, DiCaprio and Nicholson interact onscreen was wonderful: They're all excellent actors, and every scene was fabulous.I'll probably purchase ""The Departed"" on DVD, as it's one of those movies I'll be able to enjoy again and again. It is also quite possibly the best cop movie ever. I'm so glad that Martin Scorsese won an Oscar for it."	5.0	Brilliant crime drama	2007-08-25	6	2	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AWLYCG1EO7SOF	"MetallicaGhost ""Ghost"""	I picked up this film primarily because of the fact that one of my favorite actors (Jack Nicholson - Frank Costello) has a starring role in it. For his acting the the movie, I surely was not disappointed. The Departed is a film with Mind-blowing plot variations and shocking revelations which culminates in a violent and stunning end.Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan) are both in very interesting roles, seemingly polar opposites, who actually have more in common than they would ever realize. Placed as a mole in Frank Costello's criminal enterprise, Billy Costigan was a young recruit, chosen by his superiors to infiltrate and ultimately take down the organization from the top. Colin Sullivan, on the other hand, groomed from a young age by Frank, becomes a sucessful trooper, right out of the academy. He becomes a mole for Frank, feeding him information on department activity in an attempt to prolong and save his enterprise. Colin looks to Frank as the father figure, and Frank seems to take Billy under his wing as well.What follows is a stellar performance by the entire cast, with a story that is as intense, as it is violent, profane and shocking.One warning, the film clocks in over 2 hours, and you cannot miss a minute of it without being lost... However, even with the length of the movie, it doesn't ever seem to lag, I couldn't imagine that any of this movie should be cut. A very compelling, imaginative and true to life plot with an ending that will leave you in a stunned silence of contemplation.	4.0	Crime Drama that is a wild ride from beginning to end	2008-12-02	2	1	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A34BWLZ9HERHGM	M. Galindo	"Two Irish kids from the Southside of Boston join the MA State Police in an elite department to deal with organized crime. One - Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon - has been groomed by mob kingpin Frank Costello to infiltrate this department and act as his mole. The other - Bill Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio - comes from a less than stellar family and is hired to infiltrate Frank's mob leanings and become a mole for the State Police. Eventually both the police and Frank realize they have a rat working for the other side, and it comes down to a game of cat and mouse to find and catch the culprit.Martin Scorsese will love this film. It has all the elements that endear fans to him: raw, gritty action and violence. He makes no excuses for that. Fans will think the film is perfect and quite possibly the best they've seen all year. For those of us who do not proclaim to be fans of Mr. Scorsese's work, the film is less than perfection and very far from his best. The acting is great - DiCaprio has certainly come into his own, with this film and with ""Blood Diamond."" Matt Damon does an OK job as well. Mark Wahlberg turns in a performance that is both brutal and memorable. And even though some might say that Jack Nicholson was ""overacting,"" I thought he was deliciously evil in his role.So, what problems did I have? Surprisingly, nothing to do with the amount of violence. Hey, when one sees a gangster film one can expect violence, and this one delivers. For me, the movie had a lot of confusion in the beginning. Establishing storyline and who was who left me feeling more like I simply didn't know what was going on. Of course, I've found this to be a trait of Scorsese's films, so to be expected, I guess. He seems to like a lot of entanglements. It also doesn't help that, surprisingly, DiCaprio and Damon look amazingly alike. Who would have thought that? However, after about the half way point (or maybe a little more) the plot finally began to even out for me and things began to make sense. Characters settled in and I could pick up on what was going on. But, as I said, this usually happens to me in a Scorsese film.The last point was language. It is heavy in this film. I know, I know. ""That's that way people talk"" is an excuse I just don't buy. It's not the way I talk, and it's not the way people I know talk. And when I converse with people casually, they don't talk that way, so no, it's not the way people talk. I hold the The Godfather up as an example: powerful movie, what I consider the premier gangster movie, and very little (any???) cursing. It can be done. Anyway, if you happen to be like me, this might bother you. Then again, maybe not.Overall a very good film and I would recommend it. I actually liked this better than ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Aviator.""

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1CDNTB7377YH2	Michael A. Newman	I really enjoyed this film with directing that reminded me of Scorcece's Goodfellas.  DiCaprio is excellent in probably the best performance I have seen from him as a cop who agrees to become a mole into the mob.  To do so he must actually be convicted of a crime and serve time in jail.  Similarly like Larry Fisburne in Deep Cover, DiCaprio becomes a type of dark character that may not be able to actually differentiate from being a criminal and a cop.Meanwhile the mob has set up Matt Damon as DiCaprio's opposite.  Damon is a state detective in a unit very close to all the investigations into the mob so he can let the mob know when something big is coming down.  Ironically, Damon and DiCaprio are dating the same woman, a physiatrist who specialty is troubled cops.Things get dicey for DiCaprio as he must get enough evidence on the mob head (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) before he is found out to be the mole and killed.  Meanwhile the only two detectives that know DiCaprio's real identity are removed (I won't say how) leaving Damon in charge of the department and putting DiCaprio in grave danger.Great performances up and down especially by Martin Sheen, Mark Wohlberg and Alec Baldwin.  Nicholson's henchmen are also highly entertaining (shades of Joe Pesce in Goodfellas).

Then it was on to the next scene until it was time for the next murder - repeatedly a bullet to the head - with threats, intimidations, fisticuffs, bludgeonings, and vulgar dialogue filling in the gaps.I like the actors and they pretty much had roles that we are accustomed to seeing them play.  But in the end this is just another pointless, cynical, violent movie with many characters killed along with two and a half of my own hours."	1.0	meaningfulness departed	2006-10-07	64	30	34

Disappointed because I could not follow the confusing plot at all. Flashbacks and generally choppy editing made it impossible to get drawn into this plot. Puzzled because I have no idea why Martin Scorsese got an Academy Award for this film, except (as popular belief holds) it was finally ""his time"" and they decided to give him one before he died. This movie made no sense and is full of pointless profanities and violence.To me, the movie mainly serves as a signal that Jack Nicholson needs to find a different part to play other than Jack Nicholson. In this movie, he just plays what he's been playing for 20 or 30 years now -- some sarcastic, bitter SOB who is totally evil. Then he collects his fat paycheck for another ""acting"" job.Avoid this movie! It's all hype and little payoff."	2.0	Academy Award -- why?	2007-11-10	12	6	6
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ZX5079G6KROH	"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian"""	The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was a superior plot.The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston crime scene. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time.The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.	3.0	Best Scorcese Film Since Goodfellas	2007-06-05	5	2	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"Critics have been busy comparing ""The Departed,"" Martin Scorsese's superb new crime drama, with his earlier movies, particularly ""GoodFellas."" Personally, I think a more interesting point of comparison is with ""Mystic River,"" Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning drama of a few years ago, which like ""The Departed"" is set among Irish cops and mobsters in South Boston. Scorsese's film is more kinetic, Eastwood's more deliberative; Scorsese gives us a little taste of vicarious revenge at the end, whereas Eastwood leaves our guts ripped out by a monstrous, unavenged injustice. (As a general rule, Scorsese believes that what goes around comes around; Eastwood believes that violence begets violence, which is not the same thing at all.) After watching both movies, however, you'd be justified in thinking that being an Irishman from Southie is the harshest and most inexorable of fates. Certainly Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), both born under the shadow of mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), had little choice in their circumstances. But, as Scorsese shows us, it's the choices they make as grown men that make all the difference. In William Monahan's brilliant screenplay (based on the Hong Kong-made thriller ""Infernal Affairs""), Costigan is recruited straight out of the academy by fatherly Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and feral Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to cop to a trumped-up charge of assault, go to jail, pretend to lose his badge, and infiltrate Costello's gang as one of his leg-breakers. What Queenan and Dignam don't know, however, is that Costello has bred Sullivan from childhood to go through the police academy, become a detective with an impeccable service record, and serve as Costello's mole in the Boston PD. From there the story becomes a wildly compelling rollercoaster ride, filled with multiple double-crosses, frequent savage violence, and at the end a body count rivaling any Elizabethan revenge tragedy. What keeps it from being unbearably depressing is the brilliant if highly profane dialogue; Scorsese's usual brilliant technique, almost arrogant in its perfect mastery of varying styles, aided superbly by photographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker; and the extraordinary ensemble cast, truly one of the finest assembled for any movie in the past decade. There are welcome, if shocking, flashes of humor, thanks largely to Nicholson, the greatest living expert in gleeful screen sadism. (To see Nicholson's Costello delicately remove the gold wedding ring from a severed hand is to learn a whole new definition of the word ""aplomb."") Nicholson and DiCaprio, his gaze so intense that it almost melts the celluloid, dominate the film, but one must also acknowledge the excellent contributions of Damon (more hissable even than in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""), Sheen, Wahlberg, Ray Winstone as Nicholson's right-hand man, Alec Baldwin as Damon's clueless superior in the PD, and Vera Farmiga as the police psychiatrist who falls for both Damon and DiCaprio. Don't expect to feel happy after you've seen this movie, and don't expect every loose end to be tied. But do expect to leave the theater exhilarated at having seen the most satisfying movie in years by one of the world's greatest filmmakers."	5.0	Your home town is your destiny.	2006-10-28	4	3	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	"Blood, violence, crime, treason. The grand american director, Martin Scorsese, woke up again with a fantasic ""Mob Opera"" called The Departed.Based on the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, The Departed revolves around Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his relationship with two young men who lead double lives in their objectives to serve and prosecute him. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is befriended and protected by Costello at a young age and has subsequently gone to build a successful career as a detective with the Massachusetts State Police Department. It's a position he uses to help Costello. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young rookie cop has been given by his boss the covert mission of infiltrating Costello's mob in an effort to nail him.The script is full with sharp dialogue, with many of it reserved for the abusive mouth of Dignam (Mark Wahlberg in yet another brilliant performance). Everyone gets good lines in William Monahan's screenplay, but the best, understandably, goes to Nicholson himself.Damon and DiCaprio are nicely contrasted; What we get from them is extraordinary; both turn sharp and complex performances. As for Nicholson, his villainy presence is a welcome treat, a mix of pure evil and wicked sense of humor. This is the kind of performance that no one else could possibly do, but which he could do in his sleep.As for Scorsese, it is a return to his fluent, muscle-flexing movie-making. This is a monumental work, a crime thriller that leaves behind its remake status by coming off as fresh and original.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"Proving that he is not dimming with age, Martin Scorsese directs perhaps his best crime drama in ""The Departed"", written by William Monahan and inspired by the 2002 Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"". Corruption and duplicity are the rule in the longstanding feud between the Irish crime syndicate of South Boston and the Massachusetts State Police. Crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) took Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) under his wing as a youngster and groomed him to serve the syndicate. Sullivan grew up to be a cop and rose through the ranks in the State Police's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), where he fights organized crime while keeping Costello well-informed. Billy Costigan (Leoardo DiCaprio) was recruited out of the police academy to a deep undercover operation within Costello's inner circle, known only to Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) of the SIU. When the criminals and police both realize that they have a mole in their organizations, a complicated game of cat and mouse ensues.There have been other movies about double crosses and double agents, but none so gut-wrenching as ""The Departed"". Great dialogue and characters who sit constantly on the emotional edge set this film apart. Billy is a bright guy trying to hold onto his identity. Colin is a yuppie trying to focus on his ambitions. They are both about to crack. But there is no melodrama, just a suspenseful, violent ride that looks like it can't possibly turn out well. The cynicism escalates in tandem with the characters' anxieties. Nicholson abandons his shtick and does some real acting here as an admittedly entertaining sociopathic sleazebucket. If ""The Departed"" has a flaw, it is excessive length. An hour into the film I was wondering how it could run another hour and a half. Some of the early exposition could have been cut. But most of the time is spent on unexpected twists and turns -that really are unexpected. ""The Departed"" commendably avoids doing the obvious at most points along the way. It keeps the audience guessing, while powerful performances keep us involved."	5.0	Duplicity and Duality in a Tangled Game of Cops and Robbers.	2007-02-14	8	6	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AKJ9MEE93DG5O	mitchell5954	The Departed I find to be a good but somewhat overrated film.  Most people (especially critics) regard it as a masterpiece, but I personally do not think so.  It has a great cast, great acting, and a solid story, but I have some issues with it.  I am also not a fan of Martin Scorsese.  The only film of his that I really like is Shutter Island.  I find most of his films to be not my cup of tea (this one included).The plot of the Departed is fairly simple.  On the one hand you have Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is working as a Boston police officer, but is truly working for this gangster named Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  He is a rat that is infiltrating the police force.  On the other hand you have Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wants to be a good cop.  He gets the job of going undercover as one of Costello's men and infiltrate his operation.  Throughout the movie each side is trying to find the rat infiltrating their systems.As I said the film has an excellent cast.  There are many big names like DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, etc.  Each of them does a great job acting wise.  I also like the story and how it would play out.However, I do have a few gripes that unfortunately bring the film down for me.  One of them is the characters.  This movie has a huge cast and there are only two characters I cared about are DiCaprio and Martin Sheen's characters.  I liked Cardigan because it is easy to sympathize with him.  Most of his family is dead and he is basically alone.  On top of that most of his family was crooks or offenders.  He often gets regarded as a bad person because of his family history which he does not deserve.  The only person in the film who really trusted him was Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), which is why I liked him as well.The other characters I find to be horrible people.  Martin Scorsese has a habit of making his characters unlikeable which is one reason why I do not enjoy most of his movies.  Matt Damon's character, for most of the film, was a rat working for this blood-thirsty gangster, which makes him unsympathetic and unlikable.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Dignam, was basically a useless character.  He was an annoying prick throughout the entire film, and that is all he was.  He was completely useless up until the very last scene of the film, which makes me wonder why he was even in the movie.  The girlfriend of DiCaprio and Matt Damon I did not really care about either.  I thought she was incredible bland.Another thing I did not care for was the excessive amount of cussing in the film.  People are dropping the F-bomb every other word it seemed.  It was not just the gangsters but the cops were doing it as well.  Is this how Boston police truly talk?  This movie and Gone Baby Gone made me never want to visit Boston.  I am not offended by swearing, but there is so much of it here that I found it hard to take the film seriously in places.  Scorsese likes to put a great deal of cussing in his films and I do not know why.  Does he think that doing it will make the film more adult?  If anything it makes the film more childish.Also, the ending I did not care for either.  Scorsese likes to have downer endings in his films.  Usually he does it not because the ending fits the story, but for the sake of having a downer ending.Overall, the Departed is a decent film with a great cast, great acting, and a good story.  If you like cop films then check it out.  I just have my own issues with it.  It is not really my cup of tea.	3.0	The Departed	2013-08-31	3	1	2

His baby-face looks usually lend him to be the good guy, which he does quite well. But playing the smarmy weasel in The Departed works well, too, since he is the last to be suspected.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	So, you may think to yourself, Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon.  Hmmm.... Of course then there's Leonardo DiCaprio, but he too is a mixed bag.  Then you expect Jack Nicholson to have to save the film; however, that would in my opinion be very false, because Scorsese and all the actors mentioned above, plus more, turn The Departed into a really intriguing film, and truly deserving of an Oscar or two.The story, in case you don't know, follows these two young officers rising up in the Boston police force.  One officer, Matt Damon's character has a perfect record and becomes leadership, while the other, Leo's character, has a family history that, due to the family's deviousness, makes him perfect for undercover work.  As such, both are part of the larger task force set-up to take down, legally speaking, Jack Nicholson's character, who is the local mob boss.  Sounds simple enough, but here's where it gets interesting as Leo infiltrates the mob, while, and as we see early on, Damon's been working for Nicholson from youth, thus leading to them both being 'rats', with plenty of cats just waiting to find them.Sound exciting?  Well, I hope so because it certainly was.  Although, giving it a four and not a five may make you wonder why, so here are my few problems with the film.  Basically, I find the film unrealistic, as this film takes place in modern times, and I believe the police and mob would look substantially different, especially in terms of technology.  The other problem is the ending, but don't worry I'm not going to give it away, but I just want to say it felt a little unsatisfying.Just to reinforce my liking the film, I will state to the contrary that all of the actors did a marvelous job, especially Wahlberg and DiCaprio.  Having Martin Sheen didn't hurt, as he added his own sense to the film too, which I duly appreciated.Well, hopefully now you have a brief understanding of this film, one of Scorsese's tops, and additionally may you yourself see the film, and find equal pleasure.  (Because now I have to see Infernal Affairs, the film this film is based on!)	4.0	Name fits... as it departs from the bland!	2007-02-07	7	4	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8N3VG9Y3I6GZ	"moltenlava3000 ""moltenlava__3000"""	"I saw this motion picture, 'The Departed,' about a month ago at our Union theater for free (thankfully) and all I can say is... ""Wow, I'm impressed!"" Impressed with, not the movie itself, but with how arrogantly lofty its ratings are. There are five types of viewers who will absolutely adore this movie to the point of sleeping with it underneath their pillows every night while in bed: viewers who love watching other individuals get their heads blown off, followed immediately by the gushing of blood leaking and pouring out of the same location; viewers who are sick and tired of so-called ""happy"" resolutions (trust me, you definitely won't find one of those here so you should be okay); viewers who try to stay away from any movie of less than 2 hours; viewers who enjoy excessive amounts of pointless violence; and finally, viewers who are intolerable movies being ""predictable."" If you are seeing this movie for the first time, and you are trying to figure out what will happen next, then 9 times out of 10, your guess may be less than accurate. I have read enough movie reviews to know what kind of movie will be well-perceived by the public and what kind will be treated like some kind of dangerous black mold or toxic waste; but as for the writer of this review, I personally could care less about any of the five aforementioned categories, so in that sense, I have to stay neutral. The students with whom I saw this film absolutely fell in love with it. My mother and her male friend, on the other hand, saw it months earlier and they didn't seem to think it was all that, and after all the great things that I had heard and read about it, I wondered why, but now I think I have a pretty good idea.As for the leading performers themselves, well, I had always wondered what it might be like to see Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio in a movie together, which actually, was the main reason that I had had any interest in seeing it at all. The former does a pretty good job with his character and at no point in the film does he ever appear as if he was reading off a cue card, or some nonsense like that, even though personally, I liked him better in 'Ocean's Eleven.' As for the latter, he, too, delivers a stellar presentation, especially in the scene where he's getting his already-injured hand smashed, banged up against a table, and then beaten with a shoe. Even Jack Nicholson comes through with a praiseworthy presentation with his character, even though I always thought that 'The Shining' was his landmark role.I definitely can't say that 'The Departed' is any where close to being my favorite movie. In fact, I can't even say that it is close to being in my Top 10, and it is certainly not one that I have any intention of buying anytime soon. On the other hand, I'll probably just rent it as it did have a couple of parts that actually tried to be good or make any sense. One thing that I have found is that a vast majority of viewers almost always fall into one or more of the five categories mentioned in paragrah # 1, so in that sense, it definitely won't have a tough time establishing a fan base who would equate it with some form of high-ranking personal status. To think that this actually won ""Best Picture of 2006"" award is enough to make you wonder just how far filmmakers went to bribe the Academy THIS time. There's been a lot of that going on in the past few years or so. Additionally, the movie can also be found somewhere on IMDb's Top 250 list (Who knows? Maybe I can bribe the staff members of that website to include a movie I like somewhere on that list, too.), for those readers who refuse to come into close contact with any motion picture that is not. However, if you are looking for a film that is not only on IMDb's Top 250 list, but is actually good, then I would suggest either 'The Shawshank Redemption' or either one of the 'Toy Story' movies as good places to start... and perhaps, even finish."	2.0	IMDb's Top 250 list + Oscar-winning = overrated movie	2007-05-13	21	13	8

I would rank The Departed as his second best film, right behind the obvious (Goodfellas of course). All the actors put on an acting masterpiece, especially Marty's go to boy, Leonardo DiCaprio (very mature & his personal best piece of acting) and the mad man known as Jack Nicholson. Jack steals the show by playing a comedic menace on the edge, but never going into over the top Joker territory. Give the man another Oscar nomination. Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Alec Baldwin are all outstanding as well. The violence and language may be heavy at times, but that's how these people would live. Realism is what I expect from a well made movie. And this my friends, is an expertly made film. Don't miss it!	5.0	Hands Down! The Best Film of the Year!	2006-10-07	4	2	2

It kind of reminds me of the ending to Lucky Number Slevin, JUST NOT AS GOOD.  Lots of twists.  I didn't mind the love triangle between the cops & their psychiatrist lady but it kind of made it distasteful.  The ending would have been just as good without Dicaprio's character & the psych chic having a relationship.  Anyway - beside all that I was quites surprised I liked the movie that much.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2PJSHMB83QYKX	MoVwatcher20	"*Warning--Spoilers*I'll admit that, to my utter shame, my DVD of Martin Scorsese's The Departed--oh excuse me: Martin Scorsese's Academy Award winning The Departed--has, until last night, remained in plastic laminate since last Christmas when I got it as a present from my mother.  I actually had to remind myself that I owned this film and I did have to brush some dust off of it before popping it into the player. Now before you totally discredit me as a Scorsese fan, I will say that I have punished myself severely for my stupidity and plan to make up for it by watching this film again and again for the rest of my days. Please forgive me Mr. Scorsese, for I was blind but now I see.It is a little difficult for me to talk about this film given that I've been experiencing some very PTSD-like symptoms since seeing it. Note to Scorsese: if you plan on shooting Leonardo DiCaprio in the head in the final act of your film, you need to put a disclaimer on the screen somewhere that clues in your female audience members to the horrors they are about to witness. I still haven't gotten over his death in Titanic for crying out loud! How could you do this to me?! Ok, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. I am a woman and I'm pretty sure that it's in my genetic code to love DiCaprio. It doesn't matter how serious a film geek I may be, I still turn into a squealing fangirl when the lovely Leo enters the screen.Ok. Now that that's out of my system, I'm ready to give this remarkable piece of cinema a proper analysis. This has to be the most plot-driven of Scorsese's films to date, which is probably why it received as much Oscar love as it did back in 2006 when it picked up a well-deserved Best Picture award--aka the We're-sorry-we-picked Dances with Wolves-over-Goodfellas-award. It also saw Scorsese his first-ever (I know right?) Oscar for Best Director. Now I'm not going to get into the whole Goodfellas-vs-The Departed debate because, first of all, I think that when it comes to quality, both films stack up side by side and secondly, while yes, both are concerned with organized crime, they couldn't be more different in how they approach the subject.Goodfellas, as brutal and violent as it is, practically canonizes the mafia in comparison to The Departed. Don't get me wrong, it's an incredibly fun and often-hysterical film that questions human morality and our almost-primitive thirst for power. It dangles the life of a mobster in front of you like yarn before a cat and dares you not to pounce on it. I'll admit I was tempted while watching it. Who wouldn't want a remote-control liquor bar in their living room? Don't act like you wouldn't.I will say that the first few minutes of The Departed resembles Goodfellas quite a bit in tone, with Jack Nicholson giving his ""I own the world"" narration and the retro rock music, but when it comes to story, I actually found it much more reminiscent of something like Gangs of New York, not just because it involves Leonardo DiCaprio getting in deep with the crazy bad guy, but because the film doesn't glamourize the criminal or the world he inhabits. Sure, Scorsese gives depth to the bad guys like he always does, but he never tricks the audience into liking them or thinking they're good people. There's not a moment in this film where Costello isn't shown for what he truly is: a complete sociopath who could give a damn about anybody. I would say that his crazy, coked-out character easily parallels Daniel Day-Lewis' murderous Bill the Butcher, even though the thought of them in the same room is way too terrifying to go into. However, the similarities between Gangs and The Departed extend far beyond the villains. Both films explore a character struggling to maintain their identity as they delve deeper and deeper into violence and corruption. All the glitter of Goodfellas is brushed away to reveal the dark and dirty realm that the world of crime truly is--and what we get is a beyond-intense and super entertaining battle between good and evil, complete with all the man-candy a girl could ask for.DiCaprio gives such an intense and energized performance in this film that, right from the get-go, pretty much puts Gang's Amsterdam on the bench. This is one of those performances that truly proves that DiCaprio has much more to him than an unbelievable pretty face, but incredible talent. He perfectly embodies the aggression and anger that threatens to break the character's cover and, as an audience, you're filled with dread as you watch him sinking further into hopelessness as he is continuously undermined by the conniving Sullivan. Throughout the film you're so with him that when the third act finally rolls around, you're so relieved--that is until Scorsese takes that relief and slugs you square in the gut with it. And while I joke about it, I think the conclusion to his character is the boldest the filmmakers could have chosen. It fully drives home just how crooked and complex the criminal world truly is and how it's always one step ahead--or is it? Let Mark Whalberg answer that one."	5.0	The Depahted is a Mastehpiece!	2014-04-14	0	0	0
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A61R9081V43B4	M. Pillai	"I'm not going to review the movie, but I'm going to state some observation.  I bought the DVD version of the movie a while back, the limited edition with the metal casing.  Once I got my PS3, and I played the DVD on my PS3 with HDMI cable, and it looks AWESOME because it unconverted DVD's to 1080p.  But since I essentially have a BluRay player now, I'm eager to get my favorite movies on BluRay.  I got the BluRay version yesterday from Amazon, I popped in this edition in the PS3, and there are some obvervations I'm noticed.I don't see ANY DIFFERENCE between the Video quality.  I mean, there are some scenes like sceneries that I can see maybe a sharper picture, but I don't see a difference between picture quality between the excellent DVD transfer and the BluRay version.  So, I kind of wasted $25 on the BluRay version, and now the question is which do I sell.  I like the metal casing for the DVD version, but BluRay is BluRay, so.......Also, there is a special feature missing from the BluRay version, and it's the ""Feature-Length TCM Career Profile Scorsese on Scorsese"".  Don't know why they left it out, I mean BluRay has a lot of capacity, so why do that.  It makes the point of BluRay having more capacity than HD-DVD mute.I don't see a difference between the unconverted 1080p DVD and the BluRay edition, unless somebody can point it out to me."	3.0	Excellent Movie...

Scorcese's films are often too long, but they are always well made and he gets some fine performances out of Leo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson. Mark Wahlberg also gets a fantastic small supporting roll. Whether the end is ideal, I am not sure,  but the ride up to it is absolutely fantastic. I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, he was miscast in Gangs Of New York, but he has shown a mature performance in Blood Diamond, and The Departed is probably his best role to date. Matt Damon is also excellent as the bad good guy.With the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, also in this movie, there is a top cast to add to the fine story, with twists and turns based on events involving a Boston Police Department and Jack Nicholson's crime lord and his gang.  Definitely, the film of the year, and the best thing I have seen since Crash & Brokeback Mountain, which won and finished runner-up for Oscar glory last year.

The plot is 100% worthless with basically cell phones and text messaging going off for two hours between a bunch of cops and informants trying to figure each other out with NO point or reason for any of it.The problem is that there is absolutely NO way the real police would work like this. It is was so convoluded and contrived that it became worth laughing at about halfway through. The acting was obnoxious with the way over-done tough guy mafia BS and Jack Nicholson trying to play Jack Torrence from the Shining albeit in a mob role.  The last 15 minutes features about 25 gunshots to the heads of like 25 different people with B horror movie type blood spatters.  It was truly funny and if Scorsese meant for this to be serious then he needs to check into a mental hospital or double his prescriptions.  I laughed outloud at the end.... you will to unless your IQ has a decimal in front of it and you actually think this film had some point.I thought low-budget horror movies had dumb plots with idiot characters. This takes the cake by a longshot and had as much sense as Friday the 13th part 74 if you knw what I mean.Its amazing that Scorsese can make something as great as Goodfellas and then churns out this abhorrent garbage. Dont waste your life.... I was looking for a butter-knife to gouge my eyes out with so it would HURT more than a sharp knife since the pain I was feeling needed to be countered by tearing out my own eyes.

Any fears I had going into The Departed were quickly put to rest within the opening minutes of the film, beginning with a voiceover from criminal mastermind Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, perfectly cast), and his recruitment of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who quickly rises in the ranks of the Boston police department while providing Costello with the info he needs to avoid detection and capture.  A snag gets put in the plans however when crook turned cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is chosen to infiltrate Costello's world, as both he and Sullivan end up playing a cat and mouse game of lies and deception in an attempt to catch and kill one another.  With great performances from DiCaprio, Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg in what ended up being an Oscar nominated performance; The Departed is pure Scorsese all the way, including some of the most inventive use of cell phones you'll ever find in a big time film.  Any reports of ""sloppy craftsmanship"" should be disregarded, as this is one of Scorsese's best films in his long established and Oscar ignored career.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2SKB6TNF5I3C7	Nicholas Gravagne	"Director Martin Scorsese has made a good living reminding us that the human body is a fragile thing. A small, inanimate object such as a blade or a slug of lead can shatter the delicate human envelope and spill out its life-sustaining contents onto dirty city sidewalks. One moment you're here, the next you're a heap of flesh lying in a widening crimson pool. Violent and sudden death is no respecter of persons -- a 9mm slug takes down the good and the bad with equal ferocity.Scorsese's Academy Award winning film, The Departed, is his latest reminder of these facts. This is a dark story set in the seamy South Boston city innards where a decent gesture or simple honest ideal is nowhere to be found, not with the crooks, not with the police. Suspicion and duplicity reign. Trust no one. Likeable or familiar and neighborly characters do not exist. This is a story about begetting - bad begets bad, there is no escaping it. And yet an inexorable reckoning waits just around the corner, probably in the form of a gunshot to the head. Even good intentions, if initiated with evil machinations, will eventually return in the form of a silencer. Simple goodness is an unattainable ideal, unrealistic even. Foul language and even fouler attitudes on both sides of the moral line suggest that the line has become so blurred that cop and crook seem interchangeable, with a further implication that this is the real world.Mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) nurtures and plants a mole, an informer (Matt Damon), into the Boston City Police detective squad. For their part the police, headed up by Captains Queenan and Ellerby and Sergeant Dignam, (Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Whalberg), are fiercely determined to bust Costello and his organization. They imbed Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) as an undercover agent in Costello's mob. The two moles are unaware of the existence of the other, and each is dogged in carrying out his assignment. And so follows round after round of second-guessing, suspense, blackmail, intrigue and brutality.As Costello, Nicholson turns in a perfect performance of the consummate, sleazy and depraved animal, a human predator ready to swallow anyone he can use to sustain his life and his lordship.  As with many of this actor's roles, there is a deliciously seductive facet to his shady characters --- the toothy smile, the soft-spoken casual manner, the serpent holding forth the irresistible apple. Any small truths uttered from his mouth are designed to slowly trap you in an imperceptible yet closing dark web of lies. As mob boss there is nothing of the grand and prim Don Corleone here. Nicholson's Costello is shabby, unshaven, polluted, yet sharp - nobody's fool.Character portrayals led by the ensemble of Damon, Whalberg, Baldwin and Sheen, reel with tremendous power and conviction along with some nuance, but are more or less standard fare, especially in a Scorsese film. There is one exception, however. DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, in part due to William Monahan's excellent Oscar-winning script that allows this character a broader unveiling, delves deep into the subtleties, tensions and grinding internal conflicts of a real three-dimensional character. All the other roles, either in solo or ensemble, though riveting, seem to exist as the canvas for DiCaprio's portrait to unfold.If there is a hero in this film it is Billy Costigan. His is the character of deep internal struggle. He needs a mentor, a loyal friend, someone to help him come to terms with his shady Boston ""southy"" family background, his personal longings, and the soul-crushing and astonishingly cynical police team who cruelly berate him and then put  him to work. Costigan's painful oscillation between brutality, rage, vulnerability and tenderness is an unheeded plea for someone to help him come to grips with his dark, vicious existence and his higher instincts of compassion and light. In his affair with a police psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farminga) we see a vulnerable and pathetic young man, one searching for gentleness and meaning in a wretched world. This relationship works for Billy to a point, but mostly it works for us as we witness more of Costigan's unfolding, multifaceted character. In the end what he wants so terribly much is a personal identity, he wants his life, he wants to start over.DiCaprio's brilliant portrayal captures it all, and with an absolute honesty that is so rare these days. The trap for the average actor is to play the role with a flat linear rage, followed by sentimentality, then with maudlin self indulgence and self consciousness. The demands of this role are vast - from rage that is invested with a hint of fear and confusion, to a churning visceral boil kept scarcely under control, to the softness of a lost little boy who just found his mother. Where Nicholson's fine performance unveils two lines converging on a point, DiCaprio's drips with fullness of perspective - Oscar-worthy to be sure, but overlooked in 2006 by the Academy. The actor did, however, walk away with the Austin Film Critics 2006 for Best Actor and was nominated by the British Academy Awards and The Chicago Film Critics Circle.Scorsese's mastery of this type of material is legendary. Desolate characters and circumstances are mirrored and supported by the natural backdrop of south Boston. Lighting, settings (even the police station seems dark and scary), shooting angles and camera motion all conspire to stir up a constant sense of uneasiness along with an ever present and palpable purpose of dark destiny. A bright, humorous and ironic shot placed in juxtaposition to the overpowering force of the film would have made for a nice touch of relief.The Departed will go down in cinematic history as a powerful and important film. DiCaprio's presence as an actor will continue to rise to new heights. With this film he cements his cross over from mere stardom to accomplished actor."	5.0	The Departed - An Important Scorsese Film - A Triumph for DiCaprio	2007-04-24	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2PZJYHC2342W	"Nikon131 ""Nikon131"""	Leonardo stars as (Billy Costigan), a police cadet drop-out who becomes an undercover agent for a little known unit of the Massachusettes police department. He is set in place to takedown Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan) Frank Costello is a South Boston mob boss who adopts Colin Sullivan, who then becomes an undercover agent in the Police department. (Sounds complicated) but its not really.These three give good performances, but it's Mark Walhberg who is the wekest one in the cast. But they all give a seemingly good portrayal of South Boston underworld. This is a tense thriller which plays well off of the crossed loyalties, who is good and who is bad. In the end a not so suprising ending kind of ruined it, but it is still a good ride.	5.0	Excellent	2007-01-25	5	1	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A12FLZREV32JOP	Noelle Eiram	"I'm not usually a fan of cheeky gangster films that are both humorous and bloody. They amuse me, but they have little emotional impact. Though at times hilarious, this is not one of those films.The plot sold me. Either searching for a mole in the police department or following an undercover cop alongside a mad mob boss would have been enough. But both are in one movie. (Note: I'm afraid I hadn't seen Internal Affairs, which I hear has the same plot.)Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the undercover police agent. Costigan's family is peopled with criminals, and he himself has a fierce temper. According to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Mark Wahlberg's Dignam, Costigan is also too intelligent and perhaps idealistic to be a cop. Thus, Costigan must gain the trust of Jack Nicholson's insane, unforgiving, and amusing Frank Costello, an Irish mafia kingpin.While one half of the plot monitors Costigan, the other follows Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. Rather, the story-line revolves around the two of them. Sullivan is essentially Costigan's opposite, even though they have identical tasks and similar upbringings. Sullivan is the mafia's mole, nurtured by Costello from youth. He is a trusted, pragmatic police officer who is assigned to find Costello's mole - himself, of course. This means bad news for Costigan and possibly for Sullivan.This tale has countless ""gasp"" moments as key information is revealed to us or to unwitting characters for the first time. Scorsese lets us thoroughly invest in the characters, feeling their pain and fear.Acting is outstanding all around. DiCaprio is extremely sympathetic as Costigan. He is as passionate as Sullivan is empty. Damon is also excellent as Sullivan, a subtly drawn but disturbing character whose duplicity knows no ends. Nicholson is batty, merciless, but almost likable as Costello. Wahlberg is hysterical as the verbally abusive and fiery Dignam. Despite his cruel attitude towards Costigan, Dignam stubbornly protects him from exposure. Martin Sheen is likable as Queenan, and Ray Winstone is suitably dead eyed as the violent Mr. French. A special note must be given to Alec Baldwin. His police officer Ellerby is witty and perhaps on crack. (Not literally.)Vera Farmiga also plays an complex character. Madolyn is one of the only women in the film who is more than just decoration for the male characters. Her relationship with both Sullivan and Costigan further compares and contrasts the two men. Sullivan has money, and is clean cut and insensitive. Costigan is a drug addicted mess, but he displays genuine affection for and interest in Madolyn. Their sexual relationships are quite different as well. She is a smart woman making foolish choices.This movie is a series of wonderful quotes and moments. Various themes are threaded throughout this tense story. The parallels drawn between Costigan and Sullivan are fascinating. Sweeping camera shots and a variety of memorable music set the mood. The lyrics of Comfortably Numb are too perfect, as is the tone of every song. The Departed This film is about survival, which makes for an intense, entertaining, and powerful experience."	5.0	My first Scorsese film	2006-10-22	1	1	0

However, as far as the Bluray quality, this movie looked amazingly good on my Sony HDTV via my PS3. The film ran perfectly without any hiccups and has some great shots of Boston that Scorcese captured well for HD. Not the best high-def film for showing off your HDTV or PS3 (Planet Earth gets the nod there), but a great film nonetheless.	5.0	Great movie on a great new HD format.	2007-07-11	1	0	1

Yes, DiCaprio gives a damn fine performance here. But BEST picture?Surely not.This is a film that is nicely done. It is well made. Outside of Marky-Mark, who is way over the top in his role, there's not really a weak link in the cast (though Nicholsen once again pretty much plays himself). I just don't see what sets this one apart.I'm kind of glad I don't have a vote for best picture. This year was thin on good movies, much less great ones. The Departed is a B, maybe a B+ movie at best. Great?Nope.Which brings me to what is probably my biggest critique of the film: you better have a Hamlet on your hands if your gonna be littering the stage with bodies at the end. There is no prince of Denmark here--just a bunch of blood and bagpipes.	3.0	A Question...	2007-03-02	11	3	8

It also includes a Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 surround track, more perfection from Warner. The film is pure genius, well-written and performed with a healthy dose of hilarity, but you can check out film reviews from thousands of others elsewhere. Overall, I'm pretty happy and very impressed with this HD DVD release of The Departed.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27ZCU9LK0CMQ5	"Obiturized ""Metal fan"""	When I first watched this movie back when it came out on DVD, I didn't fully understand it because there is a lot happening, so you have to pay attention, but anyways, even though I didn't fully understand it, I enjoyed it none-the-less, and it was worth my time to watch it again to see if I could figure out what I missed the first time, and I sure did, so ever since the second time watching it, it has become one of my favorites by Martin Scorsese.Now like I said it can get very confusing, because there is a lot of names and double crossing, but once you figure it out, you will love this film, it has everything you'd want in a mob/scorsese film, excellent and well thought out plot, terrific performances (Leonardo Dicaprio has really become a great actor), and Matt Damon, Mark Whalberg, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen all deliver performances you would expect from them.Let's just say this, I watched the movie again for the first time in about 2 years the other day, and I watched it again that same night, and I'm going to watch it again tonight, you really get drawn into the characters, because it's really a character driven movie.Now I have not seen Infernal Affairs, but if this movie was influenced by it, I'm sure it's really good, so I will have to check it out, I'm sure it's not easy taking a Chinese movie and converting it for an american audience, and like I said, although I have not seen Infernal Affairs, and I cannot make a valid comparison, they did a hell of a job in my book.Another thing I must give a shoutout to is this films soundtrack, every song fits perfectly in every scene, the only song that is meh is Roger Waters cover of 'Comfortably Numb' great song yes, but the original is far surperior, but I can deal with that.So in one word, this is a fantastic modern mob movie, I usually go for the classics myself, but you can set aside a few more modern movies for me, and this is at the top!	5.0	A masterpiece of a film, a very worthy addition to Scorsese's cannon!	2012-07-30	2	1	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13FBTZ8SO8T3D	o dubhthaigh	For the record, the only two films of Scorcese that I have enjoyed were Raging Bull and Last Temptation. I think he is hugely over-rated and typically Italian: everything is the mob mix of gratuitous violence, sex and religious chicanery. Whaddaya want from an ex-jesi? Maybe not The Aviator - that was more like gratuitous boredom, possibly the most insufferably dull film of all time.So we have here in this Oscar winner the latest imaginative turn in Hollywood gangster films: acknowledging that everyone has seen all the Italian mob stories they can stomach, make a movie with an Irish mob! Quel Intrigue! This is almost as stupid as Gangs of New York. Jack Nicholson does his rote version of Evil Jack, just back from The Shining Retirement Home. Leonardo continues his spin with as nearly fake a Boston Irish accent as you can get this side of Johnny Depp. Martin Sheen is adrift - what happened to him? Did the West Wing suck all the believability out of him? Wahlberg is pretending to be Matt Damon. Again. And Matt Damon looks like he is hoping there's another Bourne film in his future. You do a Scorsese Film for the same reason you do a Woody Allen film - it buys you respect among your peers - see, more Italian mob brio - not because the film is any good.It's not that this is a bad film (that was Aviator & Gangs - anyone who casts Cameron Diaz in a drama should have their Kodachrome taken away), it's just that it nips every mob cliche in the book and re-casts them with a Boston accent - WOW! Like a dead horse head? how about a severed hand? Like Marlon Brando's mumbles? how about Jackie's leers? Double crosses and snitches? we got 'em. The only two good crime films I have seen in the past 10 years were Usual Suspect and Layer Cake, and this film is real rubbish compared to them. It is as pruriently violent as Passion, and that's not a compliment.If you are worried about your Jersey or Little Italy credentials being taken away, you better say you think this is great. For the rest of us, yawn.	3.0	GRATUITOUS OSCAR FOR GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE	2007-02-27	15	2	13

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2Z3Q7JS89QP9J	olofpalme63	"...but at least Nicholson was worth a look, although i'm still trying to figure out just what Jack (an Irish gangster here) was doing in this film.  What you have here is a couple of undercover guys (Matt Damon & Leonardo DeCaprio), errr rats going through the motions of trying to expose each other for being the unidentified rodent in an attempt to bring down the head of the Irish mob. Whats left in its wake is alot of over-the-top dumb jock tuff guy cop talk with labored upper east coast accents (ie; let's paark the caar at th baar and get some bacaardi & cokes). Mark Wahlberg appears to be the only actor best suited for this role...only his talent is wasted here to the extent that you forget he was even in the film until the end. It's almost as though this film was manufactured on an assembly line and the editors forgot about Wahlberg.This outing from maverick director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver) is pure cliche on every level right down to his being bored with direction, thus boring the viewer with the same Rolling Stone song he's used in countless other films.  Nicholson & Alec Baldwin lend the film some credibility, other than that...don't read much into Access Hollywood's Scott Mantz stating this is ""Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas"".  Nothing could be further from the truth. This wasn't even as good as Cape Fear...and that was over-the-top for a reason.  It would appear that guilt finally caught up with the Academy Awards blunder for giving Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" the Oscar in 1990 for best direction instead of Goodfellas.  This is a film worthy of purchase only if your a Martin Scorsese completist.  Otherwise...rent it instead.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A70YTUFJY5HXN	Olukayode Balogun	I thought the movie had an interesting premise: a criminal organisation sends one of their own undercover to infiltrate the state police force, while at the same time, that same police force sends one of their own undercover to infiltrate the same criminal organisation. It's a Martin Scorcese film and has some great actors in it, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Walberg, Matt Damon and Martin Sheen. I have a lot of respect for all of them and greatly admire their collective body of work.Still, for some reason I didn't rush out to go see it when it was in the cinema and now I believe it was my instincts telling me not to. One thing I know for sure: if I had gone to see it in the cinema, I would've walked out after the first twenty minutes - and I even doubt I'd have lasted that long.My problem with this movie was the racist and homophobic language that assaulted me right from the get-go. The N word was liberally used to describe black people, I heard the G word used to describe Italians (I actually had to go look that one up in the dictionary) and then there was copious use of the Q word and the H word as a form of homophobic abuse. I'm a man of the world and I've been around. I know racism and homophobia are out there, alive and well and I was thinking, well, maybe that's how people used to talk in Boston 'some years ago'. Maybe that's how they still talk now (very interesting accents, by the way). I'm all for realism. Still, for a man who is both black and gay, it was tough going. It felt relentless. I found myself wondering what it must be like to live in Boston if you're black. Or gay. Or both.As much as I tried to get into the movie - as I had it on DVD, I could stop when I felt it got a bit too much and come back to it later. I did that three or four times - after about twenty minutes or so into it, I just had to give up. The atmosphere of menace and impending doom I felt just added to my discomfort and queasiness, and even though the language wasn't so bad after a while, the beginning of the movie had spoilt it for me and I had to take it back. I didn't like it. It could possibly go on to win a truckload of awards simply by virtue of its director and the lead actors, who did seem to be giving very good performances, but this one was not for me.Good thing it was only a rental.	2.0	Didn't like it	2007-02-20	19	6	13

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the second (bonus)disc.  The mini-documentary about Whitey Bulger was a little short (around 20 minutes), but was very informative.  The Scorcese on Scorcese segment was outstanding.  It comes from (I beleive) an A&E documentary where the director talks about many of his major works.  It was very interesting to hear what his thought processes were while making some of his (many) legendary movies.  There are also the obligatory bonus scenes which were mildly entertaining, but really, felt like they were there because they always are on bonus discs.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ	Paul McGrath	"Welcome, class, to Filmmaking 101.  Today we are going to study the great Martin Scorsese and in particular his great masterpiece, The Departed, as a way by which to exemplify the basic tenets of filmmaking in American Cinema.  It is probably not necessary to take notes, as most of you have already been appropriately indoctrinated, but in the event you find yourself disagreeing with any of the following principles, please feel free to leave the classroom and the University entirely so that you can begin to pursue your career at the local tire store.To begin with, we all know that religious institutions in general and the Catholic Church in particular are horrible and dangerous, so feel free to disparage them at every opportunity.  In The Departed, see how Mr. Scorsese shows two priests and a nun drinking in a restaurant.  Note how his character comments to the priests about pederasty and implies that the nun is sexually promiscuous.  This is important in that it reinforces the viewer's perception that the Catholic Church is inherently corrupt, and also brilliant on Mr. Scorsese's part in that if he is ever accused of viewing the Catholic Church with hatred--which we know, ha, ha, he obviously does--he can simply claim it was the character making these accusations, not himself.Your second task will be to make sure that all violence is gruesomely and graphically portrayed.  This is very important for at least a couple of reasons.  First, it makes the dimwitted public--and critics in particular--take you seriously.  If they see that you've taken the time and effort to show blood, gore and other grotesque mayhem consistently throughout your films, over and over and over and over and over, they will be certain to overlook your film's unrealistic, improbable and indeed ludicrous elements.  Secondly, of course, we know that gore sells, so it's really kind of a win-win situation.  You will be lauded critically and your films will sell even if they are completely ridiculous.A third thing to keep in mind is that all American institutions are corrupt from top to bottom, and that critics will never pan your film if you use this as your theme no matter how many thousands and thousands of times they've seen it presented.  In Mr. Scorsese's film we see it is the Boston Police Department that is corrupted by a mole.  So nobody gets the idea that it's only one guy, we are shown near the end that there is at least one other mole, and if that isn't enough to make the point, we see that the worst character in the film is actually a FBI informant--and we all know how evil the FBI is--and if THAT isn't enough, we see that the police treat each other in verbally abusive ways and regularly brutalize one another.  Whatever else you do in your film, make sure that the police ALWAYS look bad.  No matter how illogical, you can't ever make the police seem too corrupt, too immoral, or too shameless.  (It's okay to have one or at the most two good cops, though.  This will help the critics to think your film is ""realistic."")That American society is so awful that one is forced to do practically anything to succeed in it is another theme the critics love and it isn't important that it has been aired about 456,000 times in the last decade alone.  Note how Mr. Scorsese does it here, having the main bad guy say something like, it doesn't matter which way you go when you have a gun pointed at your head.  Get it?  Living in America is like having a gun pointed at your head.  So the bad guys are really no worse than the good guys who are actually worse because they pretend to be good.  It's to the bad guys' credit that they know that they're bad, because at least they're not hypocrites;  hypocrisy being the second worst sin one can commit in this world.  Note how Mr. Scorsese handles this theme in his film, showing a very beautiful frame of a beautiful city hall after all the main characters graphically get their heads blown to smithereens.  City hall.  Get it?  This kind of thing goes on behind the facade of EVERY city hall.  The critics love this stuff.So now you have it.  Remember, it doesn't matter if the first forty-five minutes of your film are an incomprehensible mess;  it doesn't matter if your characters don't resemble any real live human beings who have ever existed on the planet earth;  it doesn't matter that your editor pieced together your film as if he were blind;  and it doesn't matter that the events you depict in your film never occurred to such an extent in United States history.  All that REALLY matters is that your film expresses trite, politically correct, simplistic, hackneyed themes, and that you present these themes with an abundance of blood and gore.  Toss in couple of Rolling Stone's songs--to show baby boomers that you're hip--and guess what?  You might even win an award!"	1.0	The Fundamentals	2007-02-18	91	42	49

The writing and directing may not be stellar, but it works.  DiCaprio, though, is very, very good.  I had written him off in most of his movies, but here he has depth and versatility.  In one particularly good scene, in which he is questioned by the only female character (a rather undefined police psychologist) as to his vulnerability, DiCaprio works wonders without many words.  The film's basis in meta-levels (the watching of the watched, the 'criticism' of characters by each other) is more intriguing because of DiCaprio's performance.  Damon plays his typical role.  Like Vince Vaughn, he seems to be an actor driven by rage, as if that's the one emotion he can truly portray.  That being said, Damon's last line is brilliantly acted.  ""OK.""  One little word.  And yet it delivers his performance from mediocrity and justifies his being on the same screen as Nicholson and DiCaprio--at least for that one moment.  Good movie.

It demeaned women,other ethnic groups if not Irish, religion etc. The plot bascially was about an amoral criminal(a user/manipulator with no conscious) who inflitrated the justice system and extorted money from his neighborhood. He observed for the brightest and most vulnerable children and enticed them into the organization. I would not classify this as a thriller or action/adventure. This film was intended to shock your sensiblities, such as after shooting execution style a man and woman in the back of the head, the lead character states ""On they fell funny.""

Yet every Mafia birthed due to lack of sustanence, whether the Italian's needing to survive in Cicely, or the Irish needing a foot hold in the US.  The fact that the two FBI protagonists are both also Irish, adds brilliance to the tension. The cast would have been hard to best. Jack Nichelson was in top form. DiCaprio, I thought would literally break from stress. and me....clutching my knees, eyes wide..and by the way, a person who hates bloody violence, found that there was nothing gratuitous about this movie's depiciton of the bloody mayhem that has existed and still does within the Irish Mafia.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"The moment the movie opens with a voice over from Jack Nicholson, ""I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me"", and the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" comes blaring on the speakers, I knew I was in for a treat. Make no mistake, this is a movie of Scorsesean proportions, who continues to prove that he is eons ahead of the majority of people in Hollywood who claim to be directors. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Hong Kong movie from which this was based on, Infernal Affairs (or Mou Gaan Dou, as my friends call it), my expectation for The Departed was through the roof. Never one to disappoint, Scorsese expands the canvas that this movie was based on, breathing life to the characters, delving deeper into human emotions of not only the two leads, but those around them...and he has painted his masterpiece. I can safely say, this movie elevates movie making to the next level, surpassing some of Scorsese's earlier classics, The Goodfellas and Casino.The story is brilliant in it's simplicity. The Irish mob in South Boston is headed by the ruthless, Frank Costello. Always one step behind him, lurking in the shadows is Detective Queenan who is dead set to apprehand Costello by whatever means necessary. Colin Sullivan is picked by Costello to enter the Massachusetts Police Academy as a cadet, and he eventually rises to the rank of detective in the Special Investigation Unit, and is Costello's eyes and ears in the police. By a cruel twist of irony, Detective Queenan has the same idea and sends rookie Billy Costigan, who has ties to the Mafia family, to infiltrate the Irish mob and report Costello's activities to the police. Things go as planned until both parties realize they have a mole amongst them. A cat and mouse game begins, to uncover who the mole is. The difference between this movie and the many out there, is that both groups consist of intelligent people constantly out-thinking one another. They match wits, and there are many exhilirating moments in the movie, where you're not sure who's going to win.Personally, what I really liked about The Departed is the moral implications this movie questions. Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan are two people thrown into two complete different environments. Sullivan thrives in the new environment. He advances very fast, and is even contemplating starting a life with Madolyn, a phsyciatrist he met. Costigan however, is trapped in what he has been trying to escape his entire life. When he is with the mob, he shows no fear and has an air of bravado about him. But inside, you see a tortured man. He resents the kind of person he has become, to see the things that he has seen, to do the things that he does. Which brings me to my next point, put in that position on a long enough timeline, do you become that person? Do you become another person than what you set out to be? Towards the end of the movie, it is clear that this is no longer a battle between good and evil, right or wrong...it is about identity, knowing who you are, or who you want to be. This, to me is the epitome of great film making, movies that not only entertains, but challenges you to think.Of course, conveying or strengthening this message is no easy feat, but this is where the acting comes to play, and I cannot think of a cast more talented than what Scorsese has reeled in here. Leading the pack is Leonardo DiCaprio playing Billy Costigan. I have stated time and time again, he is one of the brilliant actors of our time. Costigan is a violent man, yet he has a vulnerability accentuated when he is alone or with his phsyciatrist, Madolyn. Playing a bad guy is not easy, and you can see his decision weighing down on him. Exceptionally portayed by DiCaprio. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan like the two-headed snake that he is. Sullivan is not a decent man, you can practically see the wheels turning in his head, concorting his next deception. Even when the odds are against him, he comes up with a plan or a lie. And the role of Frank Costello seems custom made for Jack Nicholson. Playing a crazed, demented, sarcastic old man is nothing new for Nicholson, but unlike his many other movies, here he doesn't go overboard with it. He keeps it at bay and makes calculated risks. Costello has the attitude that provokes fear and Jack Nicholson easily manages to do just that. Supporting these fine actors are excellent performances from Martin Sheen, Mark Walhberg, Alex Baldwin and Vera Farmiga. Mark Walhberg especially is in fine form. Not since ""Boogie Nights"", have I seen such a splendid performance from him.Another thing that impresses me about the movie is the way the story unfolds and the cinematography. In true Scorsesean style, the script is peppered with trademark scenes that stick in your mind. The camera shots were marvelous and sets the tone for the movie. The violence is gritty and real. No excessive and unnecessary sound effects here. And there are humorous moments in the movie which actually works in favour to some of the scenes. I have watched this movie 4 times and like an onion, there are layers that upon peeling, you find new appreciation for. Another noteworthy aspect of The Departed is the music selection, handpicked by Scorsese himself. It's a throwback to the glory years of rock with The Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, John Lennon and The Allman Brothers. It blends perfectly with the movie and definitely adds to the cool factor, if anything else.This movie has already been nominated for a slew of awards and who knows, Marty might finally win the Oscar that has so far eluded him all these years. This movie might not be for everyone, but I can assure you, if you're looking for an intelligent movie that not only entertains but leaves you thinking, a movie with unrivalled performances from it's star-studded cast, look no further...this is it. Leave it to Scorsese to take an already excellent movie and lift it up to dizzying heights in what I feel is a true representation of a modern day crime classic, The Departed. Definitely a step forward in America cinema, highly recommended!"	5.0	Packs A Mean Punch...	2007-02-06	14	10	4

YES.. for instance(there is a lack of character development with the shrink, and the film at times romantisizes her role in the film making her enigmatic character even more difficult to understand..Also, although I loved the music (lots of Stones and that great ""Well Well Well"" from Lennon's Primal Scream album, the Pink Floyd cover shmaltz (i.e. DiCaprio's love making scene) was pretty over the top..that's where I can agree with critics who may have felt that they were drinking Diet Scorcese and not the regular Scorcese...That being said...Scorcese uses cinimetography to his everyadvantage in this film... his Hitchcock like use of camera angles..his direction produces a wide spectrum of vantage pointsand the movie rides much more like a Thriller thanany other Scorsese movie I've ever seen..

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A31ARSC1LGY8WK	"Peter Hoogenboom ""Film, Music & Book lover"""	"Never has a film been so aptly titled!""The Departed"" tells the story of two Boston cops - one called Billy (played by Leonardo di Caprio) who is ""good"" and one called Colin (played by Matt Damon) who is most certainly rotten. Colin is using his power and influence to protect his gangster father-figure Costello (Jack Nicholson).The police know that they have a traitor in their midst so two investigators - a wise old cop Queenan (Martin Sheen) and a young tyro Dignam(Mark Wahlberg) have secretly asked Billy to infiltrate Costello's gang to find out who the mole is.So begins a race against time between Billy and Colin to see who gets ""outed"" first.Scorsese has humbly described ""The Departed"" as a genre movie. But it is more than that - sure it's a bloodthirsty gangster film with more than a few credibility issues - but this is Scorsese in top gear.  The concentrated energy and almost stylised nature of the plot gives ""The Departed"" an operatic quality.Scorsese draws superb performances out of the big-name cast - did I mention Alec Baldwin as the wonderfully oily Chief of Police?Truly exciting film-making from this master film-maker."	5.0	Never has a film been so aptly titled!	2007-05-31	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11MLCDN9TR0PB	Philip W. Henry	"The Departed (Widescreen Edition)The DepartedThe recent arrest ( June, 2011) of New England crime boss and fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger has focused attention on Martin Scorsese's cinematic treatment of the story, ""The Departed.""Jack Nicholson heads an all-star cast including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.Coming from the Boston area, I am familiar with the Whitey Bulger legend.  Some residents of South Boston (the largely Irish-American community where the movie was filmed) see Bulger as a kind of folk hero.  But in reality he was a violent sociopath who used deadly force on his enemies and served as an FBI informant, giving the Feds information on the largely Italian-American Patriarcha crime family of Providence, Rhode Island. In return, the FBI ignored his criminal activities and the complicity of FBI agent John Connolly, his FBI handler.Cops and their informants play this game all the time -""I'll spill the goods on this target -- what's in it for me?""I think ""The Departed"" is Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas"" and maybe his best movie ever.  The all-star cast is superb;  Damon as  t he upwardly-mobile plant inside the Massachusetts State Police; DiCaprio as the neurotic police mole inside Bulger's organization; Sheehan and Wahlberg as the driven Massachusetts state cops on Bulger's trail; and Vera Farmiga as the police psychiatrist both Damon and DiCaprio are romancing. As only he can, Nicholson walks a thin line between steely self-control and psychopathic rage. In one scene, he holds the disembodied hand of a man he has just killed and removes the wedding ring from it. He tells an associate to send it to his widow, adding ""she really wasn't that sentimental.""Despite its length, The Departed moves along at a brisk pace.The cinematography reveals a gritty, working-class side to Boston that is reminiscent of Damon's ""Good Will Hunting.""The closing scene filmed out of Damon's Beacon Hill apartment, with the Massachusetts Statehouse in the background and a rat on the window sill, is priceless.""The Departed"" won Best Picture at the 2006 Academy Awards."	5.0	"""I Smell a Rat"""	2011-06-26	3	2	1

I wasn't too impressed with it and felt disappointed after watching it.  Most movies I watch and feel this way, I tend to keep my initial reaction even after trying it for a second time.  This movie, however, I have grown to like more after the second and third time watching.  I don't feel I appreciated the acting as much the first time, because I kept comparing it to other movies the actors in it have made, and felt let down.  I didn't give it justice for its own movie, separate from all the many others they have made.  The ending still is not my favorite, but the rest of it is action-packed.Leonardo Dicaprio has easily turned into one of my favorite actors.  Though he has been in movies I didn't care for (the other one with Kate Winslet that is not Titanic), most of his movies I am taken aback by how great his acting is.  It really helps add to the movie, and I have come to appreciate it a lot more.  Though he has been nominated and won some Oscars, he may be one of the most under-appreciated actors out there.  Matt Damon is another I have quickly grown to like, though his character I don't feel any remorse for at all in the movie.I love the intensity in which both of the two main undercovers played their respective character.

The Departed is about a cop named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who grew up in a crime filled neighborhood. He becomes an under cover cop who has been planted into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime operation. It's up to Billy to win Costello's trust and help his colleagues (Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen) bring Costello down. There is an unexpected twist when officer Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) gains everyone's trust in the department. What they don't know about officer Sullivan is that he's Costello's mole. The Departed while keep you glued to your TV as you deal with all the of twists, and turns. Martin Scorsese makes a great and very entertaining movie that reminds us why we like to go to the movies in the first place. The cast is amazing and I believe this is going to win BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and/or Best Supporting Actor (Mark Wahlberg) at the Academy Awards this year.

He seems truly grown up in this movie.Matt Damon is excellent, although as one of my favorite actors I hated to ""love to hate"" him in this morally degenerate role.Jack Nicholson annoyed me.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3PUN2N9OPUB3N	P. T. L.	I admit, I had to see The Departed twice to truly get it, even though I lived in Boston for thirty years and know quite well the story on whom the movie is based. I'm not a Scorsese fan. I'll watch his movies, but I don't go out of my way to catch them. The only reason I made a point to see The Departed is because of Boston boy Mark Wahlberg.That kid has grown into his own as an actor, as evidenced by his Oscar nods for Boogie Nights and The Departed. Against the usual suspects, Martin Sheen, Leonardo DiCaprio and Alec Baldwin, Wahlberg more than holds his own. In fact, he practically makes them look like furniture.Just as co-star Matt Damon is a Boston local, so is Wahlberg. Both give very authentic Boston performances, and you'd have to be from Boston or have really spent serious time there to really appreciate that.I saw the movie twice because it was a little hard to follow, at first. It's a long film, like Gangs of New York, but unlike Gangs of New York, it followed two sides of the same story concurrently. Once I knew the storyline I was free to watch the movie again and really get into the nuances of each actor's performance.Martin Sheen makes it look so easy it's really quite embarrassing for him. Jack Nicholson has given us plently of fun crazy, devilish crazy and plain crazy crazy to enjoy through the years, but this is the first role I've seen him in where he's so frightenly and irredeemable criminal crazy that he's scarier than most horror film monsters.Leonardo DiCaprio is beginning to show skills that I never would have guessed he had. This man has come a long way from the doomed, dewy-faced boy in Titanic. He's become what we've seen so little of in Hollywood these days: a real actor.Tom Cruise is always Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks is always Tom Hanks, Will Smith is always Will Smith, but Leonardo DiCaprio slips into the very skin and spirit of whomever he's portraying. Forrest Whitaker does the same thing, as does Robert DeNiro.The movie had the requisite bloodshed for a Scorsese film, but The Departed ventured into another dimension beyond Scorsese's past films. The raw intensity of the psychological gamesmanship going on made this one of the tautest, most exhausting films I've ever seen.I was surprised by the manner of diCaprio's character's end, not by the end itself, as it had been foreshadowed throughout the movie. Damon's character's final meeting with Wahlberg's was a complete surprise that left me feeling a guilty satisfaction that really forced me to examine my own soul.This is the first of Scorsese's films that made think about more than just what I was seeing onscreen, which is the job of an Academy-Award winning filmmaker.	5.0	Brilliant	2007-03-30	4	2	2

So when a stellar cast of movie actors/diector/procuction/engineers took this on in the form of THE DEPARTED I couln't wait. The film follows the original very closely. The love interests and ending are different.Having just finished the non-fiction book The Brotherhoods about the mafia cops in The New York Police Department, this plot of placing undercover crime members into police organizations is the real deal.  Jacks performance is great but of course one always wants more, after all he sets a high bar.

He did once make some really great films, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Color of Money"", and ""Goodfellas"". But, that's been over 15 years ago. ""Casino"" was alright, but it was just an attempt at remaking ""Goodfellas"". And, films like ""Gangs of New York"", ""Bringing Out the Dead"", and ""The Aviator"" were just atrocious. His remake of ""Cape Fear"" was good, but nowhere near as great as he used to be.But, lo and behold, Marty has remade another film, ""Infernal Affairs"", and made himself a new classic that he deserved every accolade thrown his way for. He definetly deserved the Best Director award at the Academy Awards for this. For all of you people who praise Scorcese like he's God, well, I have to say you're right on this one. This is an extremely deep and profound and intense fast paced masterpiece of modern cinema that will leave you utterly breathless in practically every scene. And, it is rich with irony! Especially the plot of having, not one, but two moles, each one on a different side than the other. Brilliant storytelling at its best! I just didn't like that a certain character got killed in the end that should have lived, but that's not going to taint my judgement of this great film.Scorcese is on fire here, making quick cuts left and right, entering scenes through a circle point of view, cutting back and forth between scenes and characters, past and present, and using an extremely terrific soundtrack to boost the film along like a freight train to H*ll. This kicks people like Tarantino back into Kindergarden!! This is possibly the best crime thriller genre film that I've seen in years.Everybody in the film is perfect for their roles, and their performances all shine through. This isn't near as gory as a lot of people make it out to be. It is violent, but no more so than any of Coppolla's ""Godfather"" films, and even less so than Scorcese's own ""Goodfellas"".

Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over-rated.  The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel.  This allows a lot of well done cross-cutting between plot lines but strains credulity.  Some of the dialogue verges on self-parody.

But, since Brian and his film (""The Black Dahlia"") took such a beating for God knows what reasons unknown to any intelligent person, I took a 'political' stance and trashed Scorcese and his film, because I have felt for the past 12 years that Martin Scorcese is the most over hyped, over praised, overrated director in the industry; with people throwing roses at his films, while in the meantime they hate my favorite director Brian De Palma, and want to heave meat cleavers at his classic films. But I do love ""The Departed"" a lot more than I ever thought that I would.Yes, Martin Scorcese is the most overrated, overly hyped, highly praised director living today. And, for what?

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	"I decided to see what made ""The Departed"" such a big hit at the last Oscars and I must admit that it is an impressive movie.  I was engrossed in it right from the start.  It is suspenseful, violent, and left me with an emptiness that really disappointed me.When I was a teenager we had ""biker"" movies that showed an outlaw society of young losers whose aimless and pointless life somehow invigorated audiences.  That same rebellious, ""nobody tells me what to do"" type has invaded Westerns, Science Fiction, War movies, and, throughout a number of generations, Gangster movies.  There are some classics out there; ""The Wild Ones"", ""White Heat"", ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", etc.  I generally watched them with the idea that there would be some sort of meaningfull statement about individualism, society, right vs. wrong, or something along that line.  Sometimes there was a message and sometimes there wasn't.  I'm still waiting to figure out some redeeming message from ""The Departed"" but I'm not coming up with anything in the 24 hours after I saw it.Like ""Goodfellas"", ""The Departed"" is a brilliantly filmed glimpse of the seediest side of life in America.  There may be some semblance of a code of honor but the overwelming brutality that is shown wore me down in each film.  This is typical of Martin Scorsese's movies and I wish he would seek a higher calling that to just shock us with the brutality of organized crime.  It is clear and always has been that he is a talented director.  The scenes in this movie are strong and memorable; too memorable.  After seeing ""Goodfellas"" once, I have never watched it again because the scenes haunt me too much to revisit them voluntarily.  At first, I sensed a direction in ""The Departed"" but, for my two cents worth, the greatest disappointment in this movie is the absence of any message whatsoever.  There were so many possible endings to the movie that would have worked so much better and, yes, a lot of them would have been predictable because they've been done so many times before.  However, they get done a lot because those kind of endings leave an audience with a sense of purpose, or cloture, or morality, or meaning.  Anything but a sense of nothing.The acting in ""The Departed"" is very good to terrific.  For my money, Leonardo DiCaprio gets the nod for best leading preformance but the strength of the movie is in the supporting cast.  I acknowledge Scorsese's belated Oscar for Best Director because, as I mentioned, his scenes are so strong and compelling.  I guess I'm just part of the crowd that doesn't cheer for the bully."	4.0	Descent into the Depths	2007-09-17	2	1	1

It is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today.  The actors are the Lefty cadre of Babylon.  You know them.  They're in every IMPORTANT film, Leo, Matt, Jack, Alec, and Uncle Marty, the inner circle of the KGB.  They rant off screen about poverty while unloading Hollywood gold into their vaults.  They rant about environmental waste and drive a fleet of limos. But stop me before I puke.  Can they act?  Sometimes, but in the awful Hollywood school of the soulless-on-acid, I wish they would shut up and study old Humphrey Bogart films.Is this plot and the awful cop dialogue believable?  NOOOOOO!  And does that one love interest, Vera Farmiga, give you any skinny shivers at all?  No!  For a Harvard shrink, she comes off mousy and dumber than a brick. Who'd fall for her?

The Departed -- if it is possible to use these words -- also seems like a kindler, gentler scorcese with all the blood but less pure brutality then goodfellas or casino.stellar performances abound. for nicholson, wahlberg and damon this is prime territory -- rough boston characters -- and they shine. sheen and baldwin play strong supporting roles. dicaprio is the real surprise, playing a tortured, morally driven young man tormented by undercover work so close to pure evil and the demons of his past. do not expect sunshine and roses here, but thought-provoking, edge of the seat work.	5.0	worth all the accolades	2007-03-04	6	3	3

Story plot that will boggle your mind and star cast that will dazzle you from start to finish.  We are in Boston where all protagonists reside.  We have a mix of gangsters, police detectives and each clan is trying to infiltrate the other.

I will not write what this film is about, because plot is so supurb, my elaboration would only spoil the show.

The story is rather predictable and there is really a minimum of thrills in what should have been a film filled with them.  While there is an attempt to make the characters less stereotypical of the genre, they ultimately fall into the familiar, with Leo's undercover cop the only sympathetic one in the lot.Dicaprio and Damon take top acting honors while Nicholson is basically playing Nicholson, something that he's been doing for the past thirty years.  Sheen and Baldwin appear in what could best be categorized as ""glorified"" cameos.And how Wahlberg received an Oscar nod is a mystery, due to his limited and not-so-impressive on-screen time.If the Boston PD really talks like that within the confines of their respective precincts, then they are in need of some serious ""profanity management.""I'm giving the film FOUR STARS solely on the strength of the director.It's just s THREE-STAR movie, though!"	4.0	"I've seen better episodes of  ""Law & Order"""	2007-03-17	18	7	11

If you enjoy intense crime thrillers, sharp dialogue, suspense, superb acting, or infinite replayibility... look no farther than this film.The Departed follows two undrcover men who are extremely devoted to the same mission. Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio) is an undercover cop who means to spy on Boston crime boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon) is undercover for Frank Costello, attempting to spy on the Boston police. The two both face challenges reaching a level where they are considered trustworthy in their opposing organizations, but the real trouble starts when they discover there are moles in BOTH sides. The men must now find out each other's identities before the truth finds its way to their ""employers"". Costigan and Sullivan ALSO happen to be falling in love with the same woman...Who will be able to silence the other first?The acting is truly marvelous in this movie. DiCaprio as the in-too-deep cop, Damon as a loyal mobster, Nicholson as a wise-cracking crime lord, Martin Sheen as a fatherly police chief, and the list goes on. Great music, great sets, great shootouts, good script,...This movie has it all. One of my favorite movies to come out in a long time.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A22RIIYSPA3EDH	R. Eye	There are just a few movies that I feel like watching again several times and this is one of them.  I am not necessarily a Martin Scorsese fan but this movie certainly delivers.  The movie is about an odds-are-against-him character played by DiCaprio who rises above circumstance and becomes a police officer.  Because he has already been indoctrinated to the way organized crime works in Boston and some of his family members are still minor players, the undercover police section discretely asks him to work for them.  Only Martin Sheen & Mark Wahlberg know about his assignment and they meet with him clandestinely to get his reports.  This is a thriller that leaves you on the edge of your seat - you know the score but the characters do not.  It's also a wrenching testament to the toll that undercover work exacts on the police officers who undertake it.  In this movie, the betrayal by an police force insider leaves DiCaprio without protection and on his own.  The movie underscores hypocrisy since those (e.g., the corrupt Priest) whose outward occupations garner instant respect from society are not necessarily worthy of it as contrasted by DiCaprio's character, who sacrifices his hard-won reputation (outwardly) to serve a greater good yet remains a stellar person who never receives (from society) the respect or accolades he truly deserves.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A12X2J7AVZ04IQ	"R. Gawlitta ""Coolmoan"""	"I read some of the other reviews, and I'm frustrated that so many people are finding a problem with Martin Scorcese's sensibilities in adapting a Hong Kong -set thriller to an American venue, using his legendary experience to create a very American ""original"". I was immensely entertained, baffled at all the intended times, intrigued at the appropriate times, and thoroughly blown away with the remarkable ending. Others have blabbed away plot-points, and I'm glad I didn't read those reviews before I saw the film.  There's no doubt that Scorcese is deserving of Oscar recognition, and trying to make comparisons to his other films doesn't fly with me. This was a brutal display of some very mean people, but not as gory as ""Goodfellas"", not as character driven as ""Raging Bull"" and not as gritty as ""Taxi Driver"". It WAS, however, a terrific plot-driven narrative, and Mr. Scorcese should be applauded for taking this very complicated story, where each character is constantly affecting the others, and making it coherent.  Nicholson was, indeed, playing a familiar version of Nicholson, so it was a natural choice in casting but no stretch for the great Jack. The 2-disc DVD is fine, with ample interviews with Mr. Scorcese, and other interesting stuff, especially about Bulgar, the guy after which  Nicholson's character was based. Very glad I made the investment. BTW: The sextet from ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" is by Donizetti, not Puccini.  UPDATE: 2-26-07: I'm glad it won the Oscar."	5.0	A remake? An original?

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26VF18X91983P	Richard	I'm often a bit behind the curve. It's no different with this movie having just seen it this weekend on HD DVD no less.I would have to say that Goodfellas has always been a great favorite of mine. Then I saw Casino which again I would describe as horribly fantastic.Suffice it to say, I can't exactly explain my fascination with Scorsese's movies other than to say that they capture human depravity in a unique and striking way. I don't know if Scorsese's insights into our horrendously flawed fleshly existence come to him by accident, or if he is somehow uniquely able to see into the baseness of the human psyche. But, regardless, this is cinema genius at work rivaling Shakespeare's greatest tragedies in starkness, and complexity.With all that said, Departed is yet another great movie. Great acting by a host of great actors, excellent photography and environment, and smooth pacing. High tension and hold your breath action all the way through. An absolute classic.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3OJ012QPTGMLR	R. J MOSS	Hot on the heels of enduring,'Elephant', I subjected myself to Scorcese's much vaunted,'Departure'. The common ground of both films is the casual gun murders of numerous people obstructing self-fulfillment. Van Sant stalked his victims from behind, down school corridors suggesting that computer games, shooting targets from behind, fed youthful imaginations bent on violent retribution. Scorcese's thugs, with blurred distinction between police and criminals being its meaning, share the amoral code of Van Sant's teenagers. Conflict resolution equals gunfire. None of this is news. Death as entertainment has a hallowed cinematic history and Scorcese's contribution has been enthusiastically received. Michael Moore's corrective,'Bowling For Columbine' explores U.S.A's fascination with gun culture. The acting quality here is very good: Nicholson deploys a full palette of facial gymnastics, di Caprio is particularly good playing vulnerability - all contribute to the film's weight. But is this a parody? Nicholson's emergence, arms inexplicably besmattered with blood suggest as much.The film is too long by about three or four deaths. Even Leonardo seems unconvinced of the plot when Sheen thwacks the pavement next to him in a pulpy mess. It's laughable.The police shrink, who could have operated as a crucial link in the rife duplicity, or add to the film's moral stance, is insufficiently developed and lacks the sexiness to sustain her male suitors. She secures key information, but remains mute. All the protaginists are stymied by information deficiency and continue to blast their ways through to it. While the others cancel out each other, she survives to slip away below the inquisitorial radar. The final shot of the rat on the railing and the distant, gilded dome, is too contrived for comic relief.	3.0	'Last Man Standing' Syndrome	2007-03-28	0	0	0

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AHBNPMHDWZ7SB	RJ Smoove	Without question, Scosese is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. His pention for telling top notch criminal parables is practically unrivaled. Many would probably argue that Coppola is at the top of that list, but I'd put my money on Scorsese. I've been a fan of The Departed since I first saw it in theaters. I was a fifteen-year-old rookie, when it came to film, who had not had the pleasure of being acquainted to the plethora of crime classics out there. I later bought it on DVD and watched it a bunch of times, and considered this the Holy Grail of its genre. These however many years later, I've become much more of a film enthusiast, and I've seen many more mob and crime movies. So with more of a well-rounded perspective on the subject, I can still proudly say that this is my favorite mob movie, and possibly my favorite Scorsese film. This is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen, period. I always knew it was excellent, but I never really took the time to reflect on just how great it really is. Martin Scorsese is one hell of a director. He is a master at his craft. I need to do some research because I would swear that Martin Scorses is a gangster himself. He has to have ties to the mafia. He crafts such perfect gangster movies that it is hard not to think he has personal experience. I guess some guys are just that good telling stories. And his cast coudn't be better. Well if Samuel L. Jackson was in it, then it would be better, but even without him it's perfect.It's pretty obvious why Scorsese has Leonardo DiCaprio in a lot of his pictures these days. The guy is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is pure genious, as always. His mannerisms are unbelievable, and he delivers lines with a beauty that we don't see very often on screen. Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and the sexy Vera Farmiga round out the all-star cast. My personal favorite perfomance, after Jack Nicholson, is Mark Wahlberg though. His character made me crack a smile almost everytime he spoke, or started a fight. There were great performances all around. I always pay attention to the music, and Howard Shore's (LOTR trilogy, and so many others) score is excellent. I'll leave the debates about Internal Affairs being much better alone. For my money, I love this movie, and don't care to debate it. I won't summarize the story either, because I doubt that anyone has not seen this movie. But if by some chance you haven't, you really need to, as soon as possible. All I will say about it, is that the last twenty minutes are some of the best film that modern American Cinema has to offer. Actually the entire movie is. And the Blu-ray presentation is stellar. It's a definite must-see, and a must own. Highly Recommended!	5.0	My Favorite Mob and Scorsese Film	2012-08-13	3	2	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1YN02LEKPJIUO	R. Kahn	"Some comments I have seen at various sites ask about The Departed's ending. Some feel it was too simplified or Scorcese just didn't know how to wrap up a film where most of the principals are now dead. The only principal left at this point is Sullivan (Matt Damon) and we haven't see where Dignam is since he left the police department after his superiors murder.How else could the film end? What ending would you suggest? Dignam has to exact his revenge by killing Sullivan. Sullivan killed his mentor and friend. I was left wondering whether Queenan was a crooked cop when I realised he was a good guy. Many of you are forgetting that most of the principals are now dead (including French, Costello, Costigan etc.. leaving only Sullivan alive). It only follows the progression of the film that he die; especially since he clearly deserves it. A rogue cop like that is just as bad as Costello.Notice how Sullivan kills Costello when many viewers might have thought that Costigan would. He finds out that the very person who made him crooked is an FBI informant. Notice how minor charactors like Sullivan's buddy from training end up in critical scenes. I like the way Sullivan is ready to die for the 2nd time. When Costigan attempts to arrest him on the building roof, Sullivan, after being beaten by Costigan, asks him to shoot him. In the last scene at his appartment, he is prepared to be shot by Dignam (Walburg).So, what other logical way could this film end? Maybe we could see Sullivan a year later leading an ""elite"" group of corrupt cops. I thought that seeing that rat running across the balcony railing against the backdrop of the mosque was an interesting choice.This is the film of the year and one of the best Scorcese films to date."	5.0	Regarding the Departed's ending	2006-12-27	8	3	5

The performances by everyone in this movie is way above average but the story, although very sophisticated and well-written, just doesn't seem to bring the viewer anywhere.After following the characters and storyline, the film just seems to abruptly...END. Maybe I just didn't get it, but after enjoying the performances of some great acting talent, I just didn't understand what Scorsese was trying to say with this film. When it was over, my response was more or less, ""Yeah. So?""I guess maybe I expect to come away from a film with a better understanding of it's subject matter, but in this case, it just didn't happen.In my opinion, if there weren't so many stars giving their all with their performances, this movie would hardly be a blip on the radar. I'm glad I rented instead of buying. Scorsese has done much better work in the past. Maybe there were just so many characters in the story that I couldn't establish empathy with any of them.Great direction, great story, and great acting....but what was the point of it all?????"	3.0	The star-power carries this film	2007-10-01	3	2	1

After all, aren't movies supposed to entertain, educate, enthrall, or enlighten us about our fellow man?  This film did none of the above.  It is no wonder that this film received high acclaim by absolutely no one in the biz with the exception of Martin Scorsesephiles.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1LE79HKL5G9C6	Rob6965	The Departed is a twisting and convoluted crime drama that uses grit and excitement to thoroughly engross the viewer. While supported by a fantastic ensemble cast, the film also benefits from an intriguing plot and excellent screenplay.Leonardo DiCaprio plays undercover cop Billy Costigan, a member of a crime family who tries to redeem himself by infiltrating the Irish Mafia in Boston, led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a mole in the Massachusetts State Police feeding information to Costello. This set up leads to a thrilling ride supported by fantastic performances from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen.Martin Scorsese returns to the form that led to Goodfellas, one of the best movies of the late 20th century, and this film rightfully earned Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. Overall, excellent performances and fantastic screenplay elevate The Departed above any other cinematic effort in 2006, and is a great way to spend two and a half hours.	5.0	This is Gonna Be Fun	2007-03-24	4	0	4

The Departed deals with a number of subtle issues that we see not only in the SB area, but in any big city. That both the DiCaprio and Damon characters ended up with the same shrink was a little weak, but not impossible as she dealt with specialized area of post-trauma distress. That aside, I enjoyed the movie.On the down-side: It was a little long. Plot was a little choppy. I never like movies that tend to portray police organizations as corrupt, but I can suspend that dislike for two hours and be give the movie a fair assessment.If you like the organized crime genre and dark, tragedies this is a good accompaniment for your next batch of home-made hot-buttered popcorn.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	The Departed (Martin Scorsese, 2006)One of the things I was really, really hoping would happen with Martin Scorsese's remake of the fantastic Asian film Infernal Affairs would be that Scorsese would try to make the film a little less confusing during the opening half-hour or so, when we have very little experience with these characters and are still liable to get them easily confused. Nope. If anything, The Departed's opening half-hour is even more confusing than that of Infernal Affairs, and I didn't even have a language barrier helping to confuse me. And yet The Departed does, somehow, manage to be almost as good as the film that spawned it. This surprised me, given both the level of accomplishment found in the vast majority of American remakes of Asian films, no matter who's at the helm, and the level of accomplishment found in Martin Scorsese's films of late. The Departed shows Scorsese back with a vengeance.The premise can be related simply, but is in practice almost impossibly complex: a criminal organization and the police have both trained a mole and infiltrated the other's organization. One mole finds out about the other, but has no idea of his identity. And to make things just a little more interesting, one mole is living with the other's ex-girlfriend. Yeah, that's the entire setup. But if you think about it for even a few seconds, you can start seeing all the many, many places a really good scriptwriter can go with a setup like this. And rest assured, Siu Fao Mak and Felix Chong, who wrote the original script, are very good. (Why else would Scorsese pick this instead of, say, One Missed Call?) Pushcart Prize winner William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven), who adapted the original screenplay into English, did the right thing by, for the most part, simply getting out of the way and staying faithful to the original. (The bit with the ex-girlfriend is expanded upon somewhat, but the rest is faithful to the spirit, if not always the letter, of the original).Of course, when you're Martin Scorsese, you pretty much have your pick of A-list addresses to stuff his screenplay with, and he goes all out here. The two moles are played by Scorsese regular Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, and as with the two moles in Infernal Affairs, they're subtly altered to look as alike as possible. The heads of the two organizations in question are Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen. Yeah, we're not even out of the first tenth of the cast list and Scorsese has probably set himself back seventy or eighty mil. To put it bluntly, he got his money's worth. I don't think DiCaprio has been this good since The Basketball Diaries, and Damon? He's never been this good. Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson, and a host of others all do fine work here as well, but there's one guy who really makes this movie for me, and that's Ray Winstone.Ever since 1997's Face, Ray Winstone has pretty much been the (no pun intended) face of the modern British gangster movie for me, the way Michael Caine was back in the seventies. Problem is, no one over here's really heard of him all that much. Oh, sure, a couple handfuls of Americans saw the wonderful Sexy Beast, and he's had a few minor roles on this side of the pond, but let's face it, Ray Winstone hasn't gotten a lot of quality face time in American theaters. But Martin Scorsese, he knows from gangster flicks, and he goes for the best. He got it here. (And from the in-development credits at IMDB, it looks like America has now cottoned to Ray Winstone. It's about time.) Winstone plays Jack Nicholson's right-hand man, a guy who can go from affable drunk to sadistic psycho in the space of a breath (yeah, you've met him in the form of Joe Pesci before, but Winstone's even better at it). There's this air of coldness about him that's just perfect. Really, the movie wouldn't be what it is without him, despite his being a relatively minor character.This is good stuff, this is. I wasn't sure Scorsese had it in him any more. I'm almost hoping he tries another Asian remake--The Bird People in China, maybe, of Miike's Triad Trilogy. If it's half this good it'll be worth seeing in the theaters. **** 	5.0	Infernal Affairs indeed.	2008-12-07	3	1	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A37D1YC0D7VG2C	"Robert Brueggemann ""Guy Douglas"""	Although this is Scorsese's best film in recent years, with razor sharp editing and direction, it comes up short compared to his masterworks:  Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas.  On a positive note, this is how re-makes should be done, but there a few things I have a problem with.  First, this should not have been the film Scorsese received his first directing oscar for (save his integrity for a Lifetime Achievement award, Alfred Hitchcock anyone??), and secondly,  The Departed is a recent remake of the Asian film Internal Affairs.  If you've seen this film before The Departed, there was a chance you came out with a serious case of deja vu.  And if anyone has seen Howard Hawk's 1932 classic gangster masterpeice Scarface, will easily notice Scorsese paying a somewhat nauseating homage of the overty used 'X' motif.  The film is completely drowned in it.  From the first shot of Jack Nicholson delivering his opening monologe, to the final showdown at the abandoned building, there is an 'X' forshadowing an inevitable death.  Stylisticly it fits the film, but this film didn't contain enough original material to run away with Best Picture, and Best Director, although this was the case due to the weak selections this year.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining film, with great acting from a solid lead and supporting cast.  Alec Baldwin steals the scene whenever he's in the frame.  Ray Winstone is always at the top of his game and highly underrated (check out Nil By Mouth, The Warzone and Scum and see what I mean).  DiCaprio shows glimpses of brilliance with his tortured character, and Jack Nicholson does what he does best, and plays it cool.	4.0	A great, unoriginal film	2007-03-16	3	1	2

Each time it gets betterFirst thought: Dicaprio is a world class actor, and the star in the Jason Borne series needs not explaining, except to note that he was a Southie and created the movie script for his first film as a Southie.This movie is super at three levels:Strategically: it shows how to penetrate organizations (crime ito police, police into crime) and how to reinforce and protect those penetrations with ""back-ups.""  CIA and FBI are both penetrated by everyone on the planet (including Guyana), but they are in denial and lie to us by pretending to be some sort of mythical ""super"" power.  I deeply value my past as a spy beacuse it allows me to serve the public by saying IDIOCY AND DECEPTION.Operationally, this movie is a cut above the average in showing how gangs work, how gang leaders are extremely intelligence and running operations against the police (the movie does not cover this, but most police departments across America are constantly monitored by criminal gangs that have used the back door to the police voice and radio communications systems to route a complete copy of every transmission or conversation to a third site.  Cops are on the payroll and do not care about operational security.  Criminals understand the value of couter-intelligence and intelligence.At the tactical level, from wide beaches for executionn to marshes with the unexpect banker getting laid, the movie is fully satisfactory.I have come to the conclusion that governments and religions are a form of ""legal"" organized crime that We the People need to ""shut down.""  ENOUGH.I have been an undercover officer, in a combat zone as well as more normal locations, I have felt the terror of being exposzed, helpless, and subject to immediate execution (in El Salvador, a direct threat to execute me from the Colonels in charge of the country), and I consider this movie to be, easily, in the top ten alltime great movies about law enforcement, honor, and so one.One nit: real spies, and the traitors they handle, do not use cell phones.  Imagine a web cam following you everywhere.  A cell phone can be turned on remotely to become a microphone recording non-cell phone conversations.  That is the only unrealistic aspect of this otherwise superb movie.A Real Pleasure!!!!Botttom line:  plot A+ actors A+ script A+  Execution A+WOW.  This is a GREAT MOVIE.

I leave it up to other reviewers to give their own opinion if its a *5* star film (which I don't think it ever will become)  And I have to admit that if I could give it *3 & 1/2* stars I would but since amazon does not give me that optionthen I have to give it a *3* star rating.	3.0	Too Much Violence....	2014-05-02	3	1	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A20G957N2TEVQX	"Robert W. ""BobTheCopywriter"""	"Martin Scorsese has done many incredible things and its doubtful that this will be remembered as his masterpiece, but had anyone else directed it, the Departed would be heralded as a jewel.Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Baldwin and Sheen are all extraordinary and stretching themselves, but it's Vera Farmiga who steals the show. Maybe it's testimony to something about DiCaprio's ability to truly share the screen, but Farmiga is just as exceptional in this film as Cate Blanchet was in the Aviator. Furthermore, Farmiga is every bit the equal of Pfeiffer in her similar role inTequila Sunrise.Long the best part of shows like ""Touching Evil"" and ""UC: Undercover,"" Vera Farmiga brings a vulnerable honesty to her role, even as she plays against some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters.That said, the plot gives the audience an interesting twist on the roles of the police and criminals as each side shows its factionalism and parallels.It's less a tale of good and evil, than one of revelation, distrust and continuous compromise.It may not be Scorsese's best, but let's face it doesn't have to be to be an exceptional film by any standard."	4.0	Stepping out.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SBRISKS7PH7U	Rob	An A-list cast is wasted in this overlong & unimaginatively scripted remake of an excellent Asian thriller. Relocating the action from Hong Kong to Boston the plot twists of the original are dutifully reproduced but writer Bill Monahan fails to add anything new. In the original story a gang of criminals have a mole in the police and the police have a mole in the gang. As cop and criminal try to ferret out the other each begins to wonder who he truly is. For example the mole in the police wonders where his real loyalty lies while the undercover cop fears losing his true identity. Scorsese's remake dispenses almost entirely with this rich theme & turns the mole in the police force (played by Matt Damon) into an inexpressive walking blank spot & DiCaprio (playing the cop turned criminal) into a panic stricken caricature. Jack Nicholson does significant damage to the movie by overacting appallingly as a gang boss with an obsession about informers, said obsession signaling an all too obvious 'surprise' revelation concerning his character.In the original movie each of the leading men found comfort, along with an exploration of their identity crisis, in their relationship with a woman. But Scorsese's remake lazily merges the two women into one & in another unconvincing development has her sleeping with both of them! Of all the actors only Mark Wahlberg as a vulgar cop & Ray Winstone as Nicholson's psychotic enforcer make an impression.As for Scorsese, who is now in his mid-60's, his direction here feels tired & unengaged. His trademark combination of contemporary music & classics with scenes of graphic violence lacks the impact it once had although it must be admitted that the mediocre material he's working with does him no favours. Unable to control Nicholson (or perhaps encouraging him to overact. Who knows?) The Departed feels - most notably in its silly 'let's-kill-everybody' ending - like a parody of his earlier gangster films. Slick, profane & violent but also hollow, superficial & juvenile, The Departed will be forgotten faster than you can say 'I'm shipping up to Boston.'	1.0	Departed from Greatness	2007-05-03	34	16	18

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2In Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling ""moles"" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law.  Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a ""rat"" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations.The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs,"" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence.  In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director.  Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, ""The Departed"" falls short of the ""Goodfellas"" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion.  In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles.  Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don`t mind watching it yet another time.The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion.  There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side.  One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film`s success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in ""The Departed"" - a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre.  The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art.  The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in ""The Verdict"").  The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against ""Goodfellas.""  Moreover, even the violence in ""The Departed"" is handled much less effectively than it was in ""Goodfellas.""  In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in ""The Departed,"" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to ""Goodfellas,"" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of filmmaking.  It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product.A good film but not a great one."	3.0	a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas	2007-02-22	6	3	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"DeCaprio & Damon are ""The Departed"" - men who've gone undercover and created unlikable new identities for themselves.  Damon is Colin Sullivan, a rising star of the ""Staties"" (Boston State police) and soon assigned to a high-powered State/Federal career-criminal investigations unit.  Decaprio is Billy Costigan, a loser cut from the Staties soon after gradating the academy, and soon jailed on an assault rap.But appearances are deceiving - Costigan's fall from grace was an elaborately orchestrated sham to endear him to Boston's underworld of Irish gangs, allow him entry and destroy it from the inside.  Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) rules this dreary kingdom of protection money, four-letter words and flying fists, and he's is both the target and aggressor of everything that happens there.  To maximize security and nail Costello, the Staties' operation is compartmentalized - only Captain Queenan (Sheen) and his foulmouthed lieutenant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know the identities of deep-cover operatives like Costigan.  (If Queenan is fatherly, Dignam is like everybody's abusive older-brother; if bad words could kill, Dignam could make blood fly all over the place.)  Unknown to anybody other than Costello, the crime boss has a mole of his own among the Staties - Damon, having been recruited by Costello as a kid.  With law-enforcement looking more like some foreign counter-intelligence operation, the mutual penetration of criminal investigations officials and crime-bosses looks less like a Scorsese-style gangster tale than John LeCarre transplanted to Boston.  Amid Costello's high-powered deals and the Staties' efforts to build a case against him, each side learns that they've got a mole in their midst, forcing Conway & Costigan to play cat and mouse to uncover the traitor while keeping their own cover.""The Departed"" is a great movie, but not necessarily a great Scorsese movie.  The leads chew up the scenery and beat each other bloody, but the story never becomes more than one about a bunch of guys shooting, hitting and cursing each other.  The story suggests all sorts of complex weaving subplots, but can't come up with anything more satisfying for closure than having somebody getting royally smacked.  The big draw here are the leads - Nicholson, Damon & DiCaprio.  Even the 2nd stringers here are great - besides Wahlberg, we have Alec Baldwin as the Fed boss of Boston's anti-crime ops, and Sheen who seems to sense that he needs to protect DiCaprio from both sides.  However, the performances are mostly wasted.  Nicholson plays Costello like a straight version of The Joker - he's the arch-villain without the camp (instead of jokes, he gives us tough-guy bromides of how little anything matters about you when you've got a gun to your head).  Damon's character is so determined to look squeaky-clean that he's the least interesting character in the story.  DiCaprio is obviously the focus here, yet we've barely met him before he's subsumed into the invented character he needs to woo Nicholson's gang with, and it's hard not to see anything about him as necessary for his performance as a hood.  Sheen is too nice a guy to be working organized crime while Wahlberg looks too effective (you wonder why he hasn't cracked everybody's case and a few skulls while he's at it).  Critics hail ""Departed"" as a return-to-form for Scorsese but it's more a hint of what Scorsese was, and the much better movies he used to make."	4.0	Great movie - just not a great Scorsese movie	2006-10-16	2	1	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3572FTYUQQW3P	Royce Callaway	"This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.  The entire cast does an outstanding job and virtually all turn in oscar quality performances but DiCaprio stands out.  His performance can only be called ""electrifying"" because his dialog does not convey his inner struggle and he is left to convey these feelings by body language and expression.  He does a magnificent job of this -- gone is his pretty boy image and underneath that bland face we find a real actor.  Matt Damon does and equally fine job with similar challenges and he too turns in an oscar quality performance.  However, Jack Nicholson is evil personified and turns in his usual outstanding perfromance.  The surprise is Wahlberg who has a supporting role but demonstrates that he too can act.  Alec Baldwin plays the clueless detective and does this well.  Unfortunately he simply cannot act in any movie without dragging his political messages into it but fortunately this is kept to a minimum and doesn't spoil the film.  However, when it happens it is out of context and is like hitting a wrong note.  Nevertheless he and Martin Sheen do excellent jobs.  The screen play is one of the best written in a very long time.  While there is violence and profanity it is logical in context and does not seem gratuitous as it usually is.  The cinematography and set design are also well done.  The movie is spellbinding from start to finish and you are on the edge of your seat the full time.  The tension felt by DiCaprio and Damon is palpable.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is an Oscar Winner and would be a logical winner for Best Picture, Best Screen Play, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor.  I canot recommend this picture highly enough but it isn't for the squeamish and I wouldn't take children younger than about 16 to it."	5.0	Electrifying	2007-01-18	4	0	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A387BD735MI50R	R. Schultz	"I'm not quite as enthusiastic about this movie as a lot of other people seem to be, including those who were on the Oscar Nominating Committee. It doesn't give the viewer the sort of realistic fly-on-the-wall eavesdropping vantage point that movies such as ""Good Fellas"" did. This movie is more about style. It keeps you running after each showy, bloody panel, trying to piece them all together and make make some sense of them.Admittedly, Scorsese probably aimed at keeping audiences guessing who's-who right along with the characters. But the viewer is confronted with additional layers of confusion here. We are constantly challenged to guess not only the real identity of each character, but why it matters. And Matt Damon and Bernard DiCaprio are shorn to look very much alike, so you even have to stay alert to distinguish them. I don't know if their two-sides-of-the-same-coin appearance was intentional.So there aren't many places where you can simply allow yourself to be absorbed into the film. One of the few exceptions to this is the scene most often used as an advertising clip for ""The Departed"" - the scene in which Nicholson and DiCaprio engage in a tense cat-and-mouse conversation over a pub table. These moments will draw you in. But for the most part, this movie will probably leave you on the outside looking in, trying to figure out what's going on, or admiring the bravado turns of the individual actors. You may admire, for example, Jack Nicholson's sheer panache as he appears out of a back room spattered with blood, banters a bit, issues a few commands, then returns to - ahem, whatever it is that is occupying him in that back room.But in general, this movie is hard work. You can't just settle back with a bag of popcorn and let it lift you out of your usual labors. I felt that I might understand its twists and turns of identity better if I watched it through a second time. However in the end, I just didn't think the movie was worth the trouble."	3.0	Didn't Quite Strike Me as Oscar Material	2007-03-19	14	10	4

The other, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes deep undercover to get the goods on Costello.Their lives weave around each other, until eventually they find themselves actively searching for one another, with fatal consequences.Jack Nicholson makes for a mean gangster, and transitions between a friendly ""uncle-type"" and an emotionless killer without missing a beat.This is a movie that will have you wishing you owned stock in one of those fake blood companies prior to production.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1WBXDI7LRPLXB	R. Sohi	I saw this film several months ago and am only getting around to reviewing it now.  When I saw it, it didn't make much of an impression on me, although I fully expected it to get a slew of Oscar nominations, considering the names involved (the Academy still owes Marty a Best Director Award).  I saw it in a theatre, felt I got my money's worth, but pretty much forgot it by the time I reached home.  What stunned me was a recent critics' poll in Film Comment that listed it as the best film of the year.  Their picks are usually somewhat esoteric from a mainstream point of view - the target audience for this film - so I was surprised they acclaimed it so highly.The strengths of The Departed are the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone, the swift pacing (a result of Scorsese's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker's, usual brilliant work) and the premise, lifted from the Hong Kong actioner, Infernal Affairs, which Scorsese's film might be a slight improvement from.  Also, Mark Wahlberg's profanity spewing performance somehow manages to be very entertaining.Among the weaknesses are Jack Nicholson's incredibly obnoxious presence.  He seems to be doing his utmost to steal every scene and ends up merely being a distraction.  Also, the film could have been trimmed down from its 151 minutes but it rarely drags.  The symbolism is also embarassingly heavy handed, seemingly deliberately so.This is far below Scorsese's best work, some of which represents the best of American cinema.  The Departed is merely well crafted entertainment.  No new artistic ground is being broken here.  That's not a bad thing, but it's important that viewers have clear expectations going in.My four star rating is not based on comparing this film with Scorsese's other work, but with other films from the crime-drama genre.	4.0	Entertaining Time Killer	2007-02-11	7	4	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1Q9KH8JQD3GS7	"Russell Breedlove ""mad about movies"""	"This may be Martin Scorsese's crowning achievement.  It did, after all, finally bring that elusive first, and very much deserved, Best Director Oscar.  The Departed goes straight to the top of my favorite Scorsese movies, ahead ofTaxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andGoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition).The film centers around two men- one an undercover cop who infiltrates a Boston crimelord's gang, and the other a Massachusetts ""Statey"" who is secretly in the employ of that same Boston crimeboss.  Leonardo DiCaprio as the undercover, and Matt Damon as the crooked cop, are outstanding in these roles.Both sides of the law soon discover that they have a mole in their organization, and efforts are made to learn his identity.  That's the main plot line, and Scorsese does a masterful job of building the tension to an almost unbearable level.  You will find yourself almost holding your breath as DiCaprio and Damon try to function in their respective worlds without being found out for who they are.Supporting the leads is an all-star cast led by the incomparable Jack Nicholson as the kingpin of the Irish Mafia in Boston.  It's typical Jack, which is to say it's brilliant.  Mark Wahlberg received an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of a sargeant in the Massachusetts State Police.  Also present are Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin as police captains, and they do good work here.  But the rest of the cast is outstanding, too, as they play the balance of the cops and Irish Mafia members convincingly well.  There are no weak performances.The movie contains strong, brutal violence and coarse language, but it isn't gratuitous.  It is necessary to the story and character development, and the stark, in-your-face manner in which it is presented pulls the viewer emotionally into the lives of those men perpetrating the violence and suffering it.I enjoyed everything about this movie- even the music is a joy- and repeat viewings further my appreciation of an expertly crafted piece of film making.  The Blu-ray disc is of course beautiful, and has good extras included, but any version of this movie is going to make you happy you bought it.

In regard to The Departed, you can make the valid argument that it pales in comparison to his previous masterpieces: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, etc. However, the visceral energy sucks you in from the onset and carries you throughout a savagely brutal saga of more people getting shot in the head point blank than has ever been committed to celluloid. More importantly, Scorsese's overdue coronation by the Academy with Speilberg, Coppola and Lucas presenting his Best Director trophy was the higlight of watching the Oscar ceremony for 13 years. If you are new to the canon of Scorsese's films, I would suggest starting out on his earlier works, especially Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull before watching The Departed or any of his later pictures. Either way, you'll experience film making by a true genius, who are in short supply these days.	5.0	Although not his best, Scorsese finally gets his just rewards	2007-04-04	1	0	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZIFPJVUEJ4J5	S. Alan	Let's get this clear from the start. No matter what Scorsese says about being 'inspired' by Infernal Affairs (the original Hong Kong hit movie) and what writer Monahan says about the original work he put into 'researching' the script, this is simply a REMAKE. The plot, the scenes, the characters ... everything has been basically lifted from the original. The phone calls, the cinema scene, the taking of names by the Tsang/Nicholson character, the envelope with the corrected writing, the rooftop climax, the shooting of the Leung/DiCaprio character ... all these scenes and more have simply been carbon copied into The Departed. Even the expressions, pace, camera angles and other details have been faithfully reporduced. In an ironic reversal of roles, Hollywood is now doing the pirating of Asian movies now. So if you have watched and enjoyed Infernal Affairs (IA), what you have to ask yourself before paying to buy this DVD of The Departed (TD) is: Is TD any different from IA? Do the differences make TD better than IA? Are the differences great enough to justify my splashing cash on a flagrant copy of IA?So what are the differences between the two movies? Here's some of the more important ones:1. Jack Nicholson gets a HUGE expansion of his role (orginally Eric Tsang's in IA). This is where Monahan did his homework, fleshing out the role of this evil gangster with real-life Boston underworld details. Whereas Tsang had a relatively secondary role supporting the two younger leads, Monahan and Scorsese turn Nicholson's character into arguably the central pivot of their movie. Nicholson delivers a fantastic performance, creating one of the most memorable bad guys of the last 10 years. It is tempting to say that ol' Jack's virtuoso display alone is worth the price of the DVD. But IMHO this overly strong performance actually comes very close to overshadowing the entire theme of the story. The success of the original IA was the fine balance between the 2 sides: Tony Leung & Anthony Wong (DiCaprio & Sheen) pitting wits against Andy Lau & Eric Tsang (Damon & Nicholson). This edgy and closely-matched battle was critical to the genius of the story. Nicholson's scene-stealing is eminently watchable but undermimes the central Damon-DiCaprio battle. Damon is in many ways reduced to Nicholson's stooge. This is a shame because both Damon and DiCaprio deliver truly great performances of their own which would already have carried the movie well.2. The setting is changed from Hong Kong to Boston. This is done flawlessly. The basic story of IA was sufficiently brilliant enough to allow transposition to New England without any hint of awkwardness. Here, Scorsese works brilliantly with the script and actors to give a convincing Bostonian feel to the movie. The accents are natural enough, the settings feel right, and the details put the audience right in the heart of Boston (such as the rugby games etc). The first 1/3 of TD, where the characters of DiCaprio and Damon's characters are being fleshed out are easily its greatest area of improvement over IA.3. TD adds the dimension of a love triangle evolving between Damon, DiCaprio and the psychiatrist. At first, this feels so contrived. Yeah right, so in a large city like Boston it just so happens that these two moles are stalking each other ... but they also just happen to go for the same woman?! Gimme a break. But after watching TD, it actually works OK. In IA, the psychiatrist (Kelly Chen) only acts as a foil to allow Tony Leung to verbalize his internal conflict as an undercover agent. Sammi Cheng's role as Andy Lau's love interest is even more redundant and sticks out like a sore thumb. Combining these two female roles into one actually serves to reduce their irrelevancy in this mainly male movie. The only downside is that the scene where Tony Leung comes across his ex-girlfriend and the daughter he never knew he had is gone from TD. That is a terrible shame: it was easily one of the most poignant and emotional moments in both movies - and a candidate for Top 100 Best Moments in movie history.4. Mark Wahlberg's character is superfluous. Yes, he delivers a probably career-best performance - but the character really is completely non-essential. It is as though Scorsese and Monahan realized they stacked the hand of the gangsters excessively with Nicholson on that side - and decided to add Wahlberg to Sheen on the Police side to balance things out a bit. It doesn't work. Anthony Wong's strong display on IA confirms this: properly acted out, his character is the mirror image and equal of Eric Tsang's. Adding a Wahlberg cannot compensate for the dominating presence of Nicholson on the gangster side and imbalances the movie a little. Having Wahlberg delivering the final murderous twist at the end also feels excessively contrived and introduces last-minute questions of logicality that spoil the ending.5. Monahan's script tries to be clever by providing extra detail on the main 'crime' perpetrated by Nicholson's gang: the smuggling of some fancy military micro-chips. But this is clumsily done and again serves to distract more than add to the story.6. In both movies, one of the gangsters finds out about Leung/DiCaprio's real identity just before dying. IA does a far better job of explaining why he didn't give up this secret. In TD, it seems so illogical why this hood didn't expose DiCaprio earlier.7. In IA, the Andy Lau character is shown to be more of a master of his own destiny. He is cool and calculating, and he is the one who consciously makes the decision that he no longer wants to be a gangster - and then plots to make the switch sacrificing friends, mentors and collegaues ruthlessly in order to do so. In the end, he is prevented from completing his switch back to the side of Light by the second mole planted by the gangsters into the Police unit. He is therefore fated to live on in this purgatory existence - as opposed to Leung who dies but finally is allowed back his true identity and honor after death. Whose fate is worse? In TD, Damon's role is made much more simple-minded. His character is reactive, not proactive - having his hand forced by circumstances more. His desire to switch from Dark to Light is less obvious, even when he delivers the 'clean slate' monologue to his girlfriend. It seems that in TD, Damon is forced to suurender the main Gangster role opposite Leung's main Cop role to Nicholson. Instead of Lau vs Leung, we get Nicholson vs DiCaprio with Damon being nudged aside to a more subservient role.8. Much is being said about the excellent acting throughout TD. This is undeniable. Besides ol' Jack, DiCaprio really gives one of the best acting performances of the year. He is truly wonderful to watch and convinces us with his torment and suffering. But as good as he is, one could argue that Tony Leung was marginally better. What DiCaprio delivered with his face, Leung delivered with his eyes alone. Tony Leung is widely considered to be one of the best actors of all time from Asia. Sadly, Hollywood seems uninterested in oriental actors who are not sexy nymphs (like Ziyi Zhang), kung fu superstars (like Jackie & Jet), or wizards at posing with guns (like Chow Yun Fat). Those who are even vaguely familiar with Asian movies will know that the ensemble of Lau/Leung/Tsang/Wong is easily the Hong Kong equivalent in terms of star power and acting ability to Hollywood's Damon/DiCaprio/Nicholson/Sheen. All four Hong Kong leads were Best Actor award winners at least once in Asian film circles. The only area where the acting in TD pulls away from IA is probably in the minor roles. Alec Baldwin gives a wonderfully steely, hard-edged core beneath the misleading fat buffoon-like exterior - far superior to the purely comic Hong Kong equivalent. As said above, both female leads in IA were annoyingly redundant (and accordingly poorly acted by trendy pop songstresses rather than proper actresses) but the psychiatrist in TD is sympathetically rendered as a flesh-and-blood person.So the conclusion?In the end, I still would prefer IA over TD. The story is much better told with a beautifully crafted balance of characters and wits on both sides. The emotions and conflicts of the two key protagonists are better portrayed and much more convincing. The story (surely a modern classic) is allowed to drive a powerful movie in IA, rather than serve as a Marty Scorsese bloodfest or a Jack Nicholson star vehicle.But does that mean TD is not worth buying/watching? Far from it!! TD falls marginally flat only when compared to its stellar parent from Hong Kong. In its own right, it is a wonderfully acted and directed movie, with great chracter developments - especially in the early part of the film. For those who have not watched IA (or can't be bothered to read subtitles), TD easily represents one of the best movies of 2006 and one of the best ever crime movies from Hollywood. It is arguably even better than Goodfellas in terms of character development and entertainment value. Even for fans of IA, the differences between IA and TD are sufficently interesing enough for one to momentarily overlook the obvious plagiaristic elements and enjoy the experience. Watching TD for the 1st two times is probably more entertaining than re-watching IA for the umpteenth time for most people.I would not be surprised to see The Departed win Best Film Oscar this year. Maybe Scorsese will finally win his Best Director Oscar. But it would be a shame that while he never won for his many original classics, he may now win for a blatant copy of a foreign movie - with even most of the clever directorial flourishes also reproduced exactly verbatim from Internal Affairs. If Scorsese did win Best Director, he owes the original directors of Internal Affairs a share of the statue.	4.0	A Review for those familiar with the Original: Infernal Affairs	2007-02-11	5	3	2

The body count is uber high.  Martin Scorsese's film is boasts an impressive cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg (quickly becoming one of my favorite actors), Martin Sheen and many more.Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in his portrayal of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop working as a mole in the Irish Mafia.

Vera Farmiga, the psychiatrist treating both Damon and DiCaprio's characters,gives a wonderful performance.The Departed delivers a powerful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	"I've seen the film only once, which is not quite enough to catch some crucial details about the father at the beginning.  But the film is essentially a frantic gangster send-up like ""Goodfellas"" plus Hamlet with a theological twist: it's the search for identity and for the father, which are essentially the same thing.  It's also a film in which DiCaprio is no longer seen as a mere teenager or, recalling Spielberg's leaden caper film, where Sheen is more caricature than believable character.There's a scene in the film between DiCaprio and Nicholson during which I was conscious for the first time that the former could hold his own--as a mature, believable, adult actor--and with the very best of them.  And what a crucial scene that turns out to be.  In this modern-day ""Hamlet"" tale about a young man's desperate search for identity, he gains it--threefold--and just at the moment we're convinced he's lost everything.  In the film's last incredibly tense, headspinning moments, we learn that 1. DiCaprio rather than Matt Damon is the trusted ""son"" of the mafia father figure played by Nicholson (Damon's character rejects outright the sentimental notion of being a ""son"" to Nicholson); 2. we are assured that DiCapio's identity is not lost when Mark Wahlberg's character, as a surrogate for Martin Sheen's character which, in turn, is a surrogate father to DiCaprio's, shows up to dispose of the imposter; 3.finally, the deal is triply ""clinched"" at our realization that the father of the baby being borne by Madolyn is not Damon's but DiCaprio's.The line from ""Hamlet"" that's recited is ""Readiness is all.""  But life, Scorsese, seems to be saying, is far more unpredictable and ludicrous, far more messy than this: none of us is ever ready (Nicholson's line to the effect that ""we're all dying"" suggests as much), and DiCaprio's character seems the least ready of all.  Yet in the midst of all the violence and bloodshed, and despite all the lunacy and confusion, justice and clarity win out after all.  This is, in many respects, the film befitting a mature, or ""senior,"" director, who is moreover a man of faith.  Unlike Coppola's fascination with the ""humanness"" of mafia families, Scorsese seems more interested in the ""humanity"" of these unsaintly, fallen prodigals who come to symbolize us all: they represent the universal human condition in all its absurdity and hope for redemption.  For Scorsese they, no less than all of us, must not be consigned outright to the circle of the eternally damned.  Even in their twisted, misguided, and confused relations, fathers and sons manage to find one another, mothers produce the sons by the fathers they truly love, the identity that is at once so elusive and questionable emerges after all--there's no question about its being a human identity and there's even a possibility that it retains much that is holy, emanating from a supreme father who ultimately pilots this ship of violent fools to a peaceful end."	5.0	DiCaprio finally comes of age under the direction of a worthy father.	2009-05-24	4	2	2

Also, the movie was just a good old boys call for ""come on over, you can be in the movie too"".  However, I don't think that even with good casting this movie could have been saved.  But regardless, Mark Walberg was terrible and his acting as always was unbelievable and distracting - they should have cast his brother in this role (better actor of the two - actually the only true actor in the family).  Jack should have gone to a Laker game, Martin Sheen should have gone to a protest, Alec Baldwin should have filmed another Saturday Night Live episode, and Matt Damon and Anthony Anderson should get out of the acting business.  Ok - Matt was good in the Bourne series - but this role was not for him.  You would never have known that Marty's hands were involved in this movie.  He has arguably made some of the best movies of all time only to throw together this mess (the Oscar award was clearly a mercy offering).

Do they automatically go for anything with Jack Nicholson? The film was contrived, hokey, packed with inexplicable behavior and major plot elements left unanswered. How did DiCaprio find the police shrink? Do all undercover officers use police shrinks to score tranquilizers? Do police shrinks really go on dates with men who spent the prior five minutes angrily yelling at them? Do attractive, young, female psychiatrists really sleep with pill-popping patients who have nearly zero time for a relationship? What happened to the envelope DiCaprio gave her? Regarding Damon's first encounter with the shrink in an elevator, does repeatedly using the F-word in public really work to impress female strangers?Shouldn't the cops have, like, duh, wondered why a car packed with thugs just happened to show up to kill the cop captain that Damon ordered tailed? At the very least, wouldn't that have been a REALLY good time to take Damon off of his assignment? Would the cops tailing their boss really stay in their vehicle when they knew a gang of thugs had just entered the deserted building he was in? Is the murder of a state police captain so routine in Boston that no action was taken to find the killers? Why did DiCaprio feel that he had to be the one to arrest Damon, with zero backup? Oh, wait, I forgot, he did that so there would be another dramatic confrontation between two big stars.I was riveted to the TV while watching Goodfellas and Casino; but then, those were dramatizations based on actual events.

All the things that made his past movies work, added with an excellent plot show why this movie could be his first Oscar win or best director. Nicholson gives the performance that we are used to Jack giving; eccentric, enigmatic, and at times even funny. However, the rest of the cast is nearly flawless. DiCaprio is brilliant, Scorsese seems to bring this out of him more than any other director. Damon, who I am honestly not a huge fan of, was excellent. Wahlberg, Baldwin, and Sheen portray their characters very well. The plot was very well directed onto screen, a very character driven storyline. The story weaves and cross weaves on screen excellently and is pretty easy to follow. Once again Scorsese's camera work is phenomenal, reminiscent to all of his classics.Now, I have seen alot of Scorsese bashers online saying, ""Too much violence and gore"", or, ""Too foul mouthed."" Ok. Scorsese will never direct a Disney classic, so to walk in and expect a mob film of his to be sqeaky clean...you are crazy.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3AP97OLS0BDVO	"Scott Piranian ""scotty p"""	"Please disregard any review less than 3 stars and ""S. Seifert's"" review below of this movie because about the only thing he/she gets right is that the movie is violent. It's a Martin Scorses film, what do you expect? Although The Departed is violent, no pens are jabbed into victims necks, and you won't come away after watching the movie thinking about the violence. You be thinking about the truly great parts.While it's hard to say this is Scorses's best with all that he's done, it certainly has to be up there.  From start-to-finish, this movie will have you focused, engaged, and waiting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next and what twist the movie takes.From the top-notch acting, to the dialogue, to the plot/plot twists, and the often overlooked soundtrack, this movie is brilliant to perfect in each of these respects.  Nicholson deserves a best actor or supporting actor nomination and should win for his villainous kingpin role and DiCaprio as usual has a strong performance. Matt Damon, for maybe the first time in his career (Mr. Ripley is about as close as it gets), plays a bad guy, but is convincing while displaying an ""innocent"" bad guy demeanor.  For the supporting roles, Mark Wahlberg steals the screen when he's in them, you can't take your eyes off Vera Farmiga(Running Scared, Manchurian Candidate), whose innocence among characters mired in crime shine's like her eyes, and Ray Winstone(Sexy Beast, King Arthur) is great as Nicholson's right hand man.  Dialogue, as always for Scorsese, is great with some of Nicholson's lines being Tarantino-esque.  Some reviewers have said the plot is confusing, but I think as long as you pay attention, it's not that confusing at all. It's pretty clear whose side everyone is ""really"" on, but the storyline takes a few U-turns that are just part of the reason why this movie is so good.  And like I said, the soundtrack is excellent from the numerous Rolling Stones tunes in it, to some Allman Bros., to Dropkick Murphy's highlighting the Irish-Boston theme, and more.  Simply put, some scenes in this movie are even better and more memorable becuase of the songs playing at that time and the soundtrack.While, like in almost any movie, you could be critical about something like scene transitions and the such, I see no reason to not give this movie 5 stars. I went into the theater expecting a great story, plot, and acting (like any Scorsese movie), and left fulfilled in those aspects and many more. There is NO Marty Scorsese movie like this, which is something to think about considering all of the mob movies he's done.  Although we haven't quite gotten to the ""Oscar Period"" that comes in a month or 2 when they release those movies they expect to have Best Picture potential, this movie will almost undoubtedly get nominated. I can't think of a Tom Hanks or Russell Crowe movie that has come out yet this year, so maybe the Academy will finally give a Best Picture Oscar to Scorsese. After all, 36 Mafia has one, why doesn't he?"	5.0	Should Win Oscar for Best Picture	2006-11-04	4	3	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"Martin Scorsese made a surprising choice when he agreed to film ""The Departed,"" because it is a very loyal remake of the Hong Kong 2002 demi-classic, ""Infernal Affairs.""  Scorsese has gone the remake-route before with 1991's ""Cape Fear,"" but he has largely made his mark as one of cinema's most original directors.The question of any remake is whether it can be separated from the original.  ""The Departed"" succeeds on that score, not by reinventing the plot, but by reimagining the characters.  While the broad outline remains the same, the characters who inhabit ""The Departed"" are very different from those who populate ""Infernal Affairs,"" and that's all to the good.  The fact that Scorsese was able to line up a stellar cast of Jack Nicholoson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga (along with a solid supporting cast) ensures that William Monahan's screenplay is never dull.The plot is well-known.  Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is Boston's south-side crime lord - a mix of Tony Montana, Melvin Udall and Larry Flynt.  (Jack, God bless him, is actually a bit of a distraction because he never disappears into Costello.)  He finds a trusted laddie at a young impressionable age and grooms him to become a stellar young player in the Boston police department (Matt Damon).  This way, Costello can stay one step ahead of the Boston cops trying to nail him (Baldwin, Sheen, and Walberg all shine in their brief roles as cops, particularly Walberg).But the cops aren't stupid.  They know that they can't bring down Costello by conventional means.  So they find their own young cadet (DiCaprio) - intelligent, but running away from a family who has long connections with Boston crime.  They arrest him and put him in jail for several months, and when he emerges, he inserts himself into Costello's crew.  Eventually, DiCaprio and Damon are charged with finding the mole in Costello's and the cop's operations - they are essentially ordered to find themselves.What could have been played for nothing more than slick, cool operations becomes a soul-wrenching march toward fate.  Both Damon and DiCaprio give solid performances as the pressure of living dual lives wears away at their identity.  How can you be happy if you strive for success in your world, but the world you live in is the very thing you are trying to destroy?  Damon is glad-handed by cops he is undermining, or worse.  DiCaprio is trusted by the same men he is trying to put into prison and who will kill him if they even suspect he has one toe out of line.A violent, macho movie, ""The Departed"" is widely recognized as one of Scorsese's better films, but definitely not one of his best.  So it will always have a bit of notoriety as the movie that won Scorsese's first Oscar - but Hollywood has a long tradition of rewarding second-class work as payback for earlier snubs.  After all, Russell Crowe won Best Actor for Maximus in ""Gladiator"" but was not honored for his other stellar work in ""The Insider,"" ""Master and Commander,"" etc.If you can separate ""The Departed"" from its ""Best Picture"" status, it is an enjoyable film.  If you have recently seen ""Infernal Affairs,"" you will recognize the basic plot instantly, but you can still savor the performances by one of the best testosterone-heavy casts recently assembled."	4.0	"Well-executed American version of ""Infernal Affairs"""	2007-08-29	5	2	3

Jack Nicholson is brilliant -- seems to have lots of fun being an arch villain; and DiCaprio/Damon seem to be opposite sides of the same coin. Plot twists and drama holds up to the very last frame. I absolutely loved this film, loved the games played with classic country and modern day rap -- all told, I'd like to see it once more in the theatre to be sure I haven't zipped past the nuance and just focused on the meat and potatoes. Oh -- there wasn't a performance I didn't like -- and that includes actors whom I generally prefer not to see -- in this case, a less than engaging Mark Wahlberg. If you can get past the gore, go and enjoy. I hope Scorsese is awarded an Oscar for this one.	5.0	Best of Scorsese to Date	2006-11-04	2	1	1

So had to see it again to refresh myself. I remembered bits and pieces. But the real punch is in dialogues and expressions.Excellent movie. Very well made. Needless to say actors make or break a good story.Even with a loaded star cast The Departed doesn't lose it's way. Each character has played its part to perfection.For me best was di caprio.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1GSTCPM8NRZRV	Sebastien Pharand	There are too many mob movies out there. Most of them aren't worth your while, but once in a blue moon, a great one is produced. Scorsese is no stranger to mob movies. And The Departed presents the director in top shape. Based on the incredible asian movie Infernal Affairs, The Departed is a wonderful film.This is really a story of mistaken identity. One cop (Dicaprio) infiltrates the chicago mob under a false identity in order to try and bring them down. But the ways of the mob - their violence, their way of thinking - is slowly impregnating his own mind. Meanwhile, one of the mob's own (Damon) infiltrates the police and can now tell the mob their every actions.After a while, you don't even know who's good and who's bad anymore. The film presents this violent world in a very realistic way. Damon falls in love with a woman who can never truly trust him. And that woman falls in love with Dicaprio, who will never fully trust her either. Trust seems to be a huge issue in this narrative.Some things bug me about this movie. Its running time is rather long (the original movie, which has every plot point presented in the American version, was almost an hour shorter and it is, in fact, better). The story sometimes takes too long to unveil. And I have a big problem with Jack Nicholson. Playing the mob boss, he seems to think that being disgusting and crazy will make his performance great. In fact, it's truly annoying at times. As times goes by, it seems that Nicholson is becoming less of an actor and becoming more of a walking joke.But Dicaprio and especially Damon save this movie. Supported with strong performances by Sheen and Whalberg, The Departed is a violent and often funny dark film that gives you exactly what you wanted.	4.0	Gritty Mob	2007-02-28	8	5	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AESSQ2RJMU4L2	Seblick	The Departed has some great performances and interesting twists in the story. It is also self-indulgent and overblown.For most of the film the story and characters pull you along and keep you interested. There are individual scenes of absolute brilliance, but I had a nagging feeling that I had been fed this stuff before by Scorcese - ad nauseum.The last 1/8 of the film is so utterly ridiculous and cartoonish that I found the whole thing to be unsatisfying. I think that Scorcese has gone as far as he can in trying to be the tough guy by making films about tough guys.Goodfellas and Raging Bull will always serve as a pretty fair legacy,no?	3.0	Cartooning on a big budget	2007-03-07	9	3	6
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LFMJWHJOWGSC	sedonaman	".My reaction to watching this movie is similar to reviewer ""WebViking's"", except I give it only 1 star.Like ""Parsifal"", the opera that starts at 8:30 and three hours later, you look at your watch and it's only 8:45, there is a point at which you think this story will never end, and indeed it doesn't. I would periodically look at the clock, and when it was over (could tell by the credits rolling), would swear I had wasted at least three hours of my time.I thought I was too dense to get the plot(?), but after reading what other reviewers wrote, I am relieved to learn it isn't just me. It is overly-complex for its fast pace. Also, in order to follow the climax (resembles the one in ""French Connection""), you have to be REALLY good at how  cell phones work.As for the ending? I can't spoil the ending because it never really ends  -  you are left hanging. Like ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" is number 11 on the list of 10 worst movies, this has got to be number 12 because there is no room for it in the ten. I don't care about the credentials of anyone else who says it is a good film. Even though this over-bloated-with-""f'ing""-dialog story appears to have a lot going for it, especially cast-wise, it turns out to be a 135-minute Parsifallian test of your endurance.As others have noted, the plot involves two undercover operators, one in the police working for the mob, and the other in the mob working for the police. To conceal the existence of the one working in the mob for the police, they cook up an elaborate scheme to have him agree to go to prison for a while and do everything else to convince everyone he is a real mobster. One would think he would have no contact with the authorities for fear of blowing this cover, but one would be wrong. Now, remember, no one knows how many moles are in the police or who they are, but this guy infiltrating the mob pays periodic visits to the police psychologist (at the police building!) for stress counseling. The psychologist is a young woman who provides the requisite female love-interest for the women watching this story. They even take a stroll in the courtyard outside the police headquarters! Now, to say the least, it stretches credibility to ask us to think his being seen with her (and often, too) in public  won't blow his cover. Not only that, but what if she were one of the moles for the mob? And indeed, one is led to think this at one point when she calls the mob king-pin on a cell phone. There is even a hint that the king-pin himself is a mole for the police, and another that leads you to think the chief of the state troopers (Sheen's character) is undercover for the mob.If you like Mafia-like crime movies with lots of graphic violence, you might like this movie just for the gore; but don't pay to see it. I'm glad I didn't - it was only loaned to me.P.S. I still don't know where the title came from."	1.0	Parsifallian test of your endurance	2007-02-16	47	19	28
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18IK6YI6T3RK2	Shannon Deason	First of all, let me make it clear that I was jazzed about seeing this movie, and was surprised that I didnt love it.  Some performances were great, like DiCaprio, some were, uh not great, like Marky Mark and the debauched, deranged, Nicholson, and some were just annoying like Damon's,  I mean all he did was his will hunting again, and his character was so obvious, I just sat there thinking, who would not suspect him..I mean he lives in a multi million dollar penthouse in Beacon Hill with a commanding view of the state house and he's a bleeping cop, ..uh this is not a red flag, and he grew up in the same neighborhood as Nicholson's character and they were close as he grew up..and nobody knew this?  NOBODY?!!!  Baldwins character must be the biggest idiot on the eastern seaboard, he keeps promoting the corrupt Damon.  As for the love connection between Damon and the psychiatrist, I did not buy it at all, I mean a woman with an M.D. and is a shrink is going to fall for a classic sociopath, not to mention Damon's mysoginistic faux charm, it's all to rehearsed and too smooth, it does not resonate, Damon has no sex appeal, he seems like a narcissistic bore, and that good will hunting faux bastin accent, lord, he seems so impressed with himself that he can imitate a south boston accent, I know Damon is from Boston..but it seems so fake, he should have consulted Marky Mark..who grew up in South Boston, not Cambridge, like Damon,  but, I did totally understand her feelings for DiCaprio, he is just naturally so much more sexy and interesting than Damon, I have a feeling if you met them in real life you would feel the same way...hummmm.  I loved DiCaprio in this, he is the only reason I gave this film three stars, that is why i hated the ending so much, it was unfair to his character, shocking really, it's like Scorcese, just wanted to stun his audience.  I do recommend seeing this film, Scorcese is a great director and the film is art, but it's not Goodfella's or Raging Bull. I would like to know who is reading all the neg. reviews for this and giving an unhelpful..are you related to Scorcese, is Damon your secret crush?...I have seen this movie and this is a fair synopsis, well articulated, thoughtout and whether you agree or not: valid.	3.0	DEPARTED	2007-02-27	10	2	8

Frankly, it was difficult to sit through the entire movie just due to the graphic extent of the violence deplicted.  You don't need to draw adults a graphic picture in such detail to get the point across and still maintain a good production. Otherwise, this movie would have ranked a ""5"" for the story itself.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AVI158V7UOB2B	Sir Cinephiliac	"I am amazed that Hollywood can complain about bootlegging and movie pirating at one moment, and the next get away with a collosal ripoff of an acclaimed international success, stamp it unique and original, win several Academy Nominations, and give absolutely no credit to the source or inspiration of the film.When, might you ask, has this ever happened? Not so very long ago actually. If one were to recall in 2006, a film entitled The Departed took the stage as one of the most successful box office hits in the world, grossing hundreds of millions of dollars, and jam-packed with an all-star Hollywood celebrity lineup.Even reknowned critics at the time seemed oblivious to the fact that The Departed, directed by Scorsese, was in fact a blatant rehash of the Andrew Lau original, ""Infernal Affairs"". People who professed to know everything about films, hailed the movie as ""another Scorsese achievement!""Well, if all of Scorsese's other films were undisclosed remakes, then perhaps The Departed was an achievement. Putting integrity aside, the fact that he and his team got away with hundred of millions of dollars in revenue, and received some of the highest honors and most prestigious awards in the industry, all from a film largely adapted from another film, should certainly be considered an achievement of sorts, shouldn't it?While I visualize the scene of this movie's inception in my mind, I can't help but be amused at how easily The Departed met with success. I imagine it happened something like this...On one of Brad Pitt's whimsical excursions to the east, he sees Infernal Affairs for the first time. Next thing he knows, he's pitching the idea to Scorsese in the following paraphrase, ""Hey Martin, I have this great screenplay I want to run by you."" [Pitt summarizes the plot of Infernal Affairs, and Scorsese eats it up.] Then as an afterthought, Brad mentions the source of the idea. Scorsese reassures Pitt that noone would make the connection saying something like, ""We don't really need to mention the original source. Hell, most people in this county wouldn't watch a foreign film if they were cast in it themselves."" They both laughed at this... and kept laughing all the way to the bank.Lately, Hollywood has been backing a string of Asian Market imitations or adaptations including, The Ring, The Grudge, Kill Bill (loosely adapted from Lady Snowblood), and yes, even the Lake House, actually derived from the Korean film, Il Mare. What does it say about the American Film Industry when many of our greatest modern film successes are based on original foreign screenplays? Well, firstly, it shows the world that Hollywood is getting short on ideas, and has little or no qualms about borrowing someone else's screenplay to compensate for its creative gap. Secondly, it reflects on the level of astuteness of the American audience -- that they know no better than to praise and endorse a film that has already been recently released in another country under a different name -- and finally the combination of these two things leads to the conclusion that we will continue to see many more of these foreign remakes to come. After all, if the money and public support is there, Hollywood directors and producers won't quit their [...] ways any time soon.Although, I'd love to scream out to people, to go check out the foreign section of their local Blockbuster once in a while, with all my efforts, I can't possibly make everyone aware of what they are missing by limiting themselves to mainstream aisles. It's sad to see that Hollywood must thrive on this ignorance, but I can only hope that in the future, if I ever see a Kurosawa adaptation or remake, it won't be a Martin Scorsese and Brad Pitt production."	1.0	The Departed, Undercover Hong Kong Knockoff	2007-05-20	35	16	19

Scorcese directs with the pace and panache that you've come to expect from the director of the five classics above.It is a remake of the Hong Kong movie ""Infernal Affairs"", and Scorcese gives full credit to that movie in the credits.

However, each performance is remembered for its individuality.A B-list actor turns in forgettable performances, and usually isn't in a lot of movies (that are good).Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson reaffirm their A-list status with flying colors in The Departed. How many movies have you seen Jack Nicholson in? How after being in so many movies can you keep your performances fresh? My expectation was that I'd go into The Departed and have an experience where the Nicholson character was unoriginal, familiar or unbelievable because the portrayal would be so diluted by other Nicholson performances. So much for my expectation.Nicholson's portrayal of Frank Costello was realistic and refreshing. You don't see Jack Nicholson ""in another role""; you see Frank Costello. That's an A-list actor.The movie as a whole was just excellent. A great story. Engrossing. Believable. Suspenseful. And the twists were on target; even though you mostly knew who the rats were and what side they were on, the deceptions effectively keep the viewer slightly confused as to who is really working for who.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AMYW43AHO16SS	smoothjazzandmore	"Martin Scorsese's lifelong journey to winning his first Oscar ended with this thrilling police drama, ""The Departed"".  Based on the movie, ""Infernal Affairs"", Scorsese brings us back to the days when he first burst on the scene as an upstart director with films such as, ""Mean Streets"" & ""Who's That Knocking On My Door?"".  The cast here is top notch, lead by multiple Oscar winner Jack Nicholson who is brilliant as mob boss, Jack Costello.  It's hard to imagine how Nicholson couldn't have been nominated for his role.  He's charming, funny and disturbing.  Other outstanding performances were by Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg.  Watching this film reminds me of the work of Alfred Hitchcock.  In his films, (i.e. ""Strangers on a Train ""Psycho"" & ""Saboteur"") Hitchcock lets his audience know who the antagonist is on purpose and the audience is enthralled about how the perpetrator will be caught.  The film's writer, William Monahan (with the help of Hong Kong original writers) keeps us guessing on what will happen and it works ever so effectively.  This is a film that is volent as Scorsese can make it and though not his best film, is worthy of Oscar's top prize. Congratulations, Martin!"	5.0	Scorsese's Long Oscar Journey Ends!	2007-07-16	5	3	2

Leo and cast were absolutely believable in their roles. Although, I must admit I would have liked to have seen Robert DeNiro play the crime boss' role. Him and Scorsese have always made a great combination. I have never really cared for Nicholson's acting and I felt that in some points of the film he was hammin' it up a little too much. Other than that and an unexpected ending this is a good movie to add to you collection when it released on DVD.	4.0	One of the better films of  2006.	2006-11-17	2	1	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3CF1NK9ZSPF5T	"Solution ""every problem has a SOLUTION"""	The previews prior to the theatrical release of this film were reason enough for me to see it.  Brilliant and memorable performances from a very well rounded veteran and all-star cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio(I was beginning to think that he was overrated) shows that he can really pull it off playing rookie cop Billy Costigan....downright epic performances from Matt Damon's portrayal of half cop half criminal Colin Sullivan and Mark Wahlberg's performance as Costigan's next in chain of command and hard as nails Staff Sgt. and Martin Sheen's performance as the one calling the shots as Capt. Queenam.  Of course, my hat will go off to one of Hollywood's most precious gems and my ultimate motivation for seeing this movie...Jack Nicholson's performance as aging mobster Frank Costello(think of Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone in the Godfather but a lot more edgier).  This film in my opinion would solidify Scorsese's mark in Hollywood(as if he already didn't have one).  Set in Scorsese's trademark filming base of Boston and listening to the cast speaking in that Northern Boston dialogue(I bet the dialogue coach had a hell of a time with that one)...even though Wahlberg's accent wasn't coached...this film will of course go down as one of the best of 2006 and by the end of the decade will go down as one of the tops of the decade.  Nuff said...just go and see it already.	4.0	Scorsese Shows That He Still Can Make Hollywood Magic....4.5 stars	2007-02-18	4	2	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AKP40TIE5SVSQ	Some Gravity	"Hollywood has welcomed a lot of great mob films (""The Godfather"" trilogy,""Goodfellas"",etc.),and a great addition to that genre of films has proven itself to be,by far,""The Departed"".Based in Boston (mostly South Boston,one of the most famous mob places in the world),this film focuses on several different characters. It begins with a good depiction of Matt Damon's character in this film,Colin Sullivan. While Colin did have an unhappy childhood (I won't give away too much of that--that is something for you to discover when you watch this film for the first time),the one man he had to get him through his childhood was Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson),a Boston mob moss who has politely welcomed Colin into his organization,with Colin and Frank remaining friends ever since they first met. For Colin and Frank,this is a trusted friendship that helps the both of them in the long run.But,what is the one problem that lingers here? The problem is that Frank Castello has commited several crimes and is wanted badly by the Boston police,who who will do anything to stop him. Their luck comes along when two important Boston cops,a boss on the force named Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen)and a sergeant named Dignam(Mark Wahlberg)hire a man named Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio),who has lost his family and is an unsuccessful person. His job? To go undercover and become a member of Frank Costello's mob,in order for him to be able to help the Boston police bust Frank Costello (something that is a very difficult task for them). Once the investigation has begun and trouble has stirred up in both the Boston Police Department and Frank Costello's mob as a result of the investigation,can the good guys win,or will that honor go to the bad guys? Only time will tell!!!When it comes down to ""The Departed"",while this film is VERY long (close to the same amount of time that ""JFK"" and ""The Good Shepherd"" were)and is complicated and hard to follow,on top of those two flaws,it is an excellent film. The plot for this film is very smart while it has a great scipt accompanying it. As for the performances,Matt Damon turns in a good performance while Leonardo DiCaprio allows the film to be interesting,and gives in an entertaining performance. But,the performances here that are REALLY worth watching are the performances of Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Nicholson brings a lot of suspense and drama into his performance,and allows viewers get to know his character and helps bring the film to life. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance,Wahlberg turns in one of the finest performances of his career here,as a no nonscence cop who plays it out tough until the very end. With his performance,not only does Mark Wahlberg contribute to this film's essence and success,at the same time,he allows his talent to continue to improve as an actor. Also,Martin Scorsese leads this film in a smart manner that will make one guessing until the very end,which is the main factor in this film being so well-planned and being the good film that it is.The only minor flaw for this DVD is that the only extra feauture here is a theatrical trailer for this film. But,if you want to see a good amount of special feautures for this film,you will want to skip this DVD and get the two-disc Special Edition DVD that was released for this film--which has good bonus feautures that one would want and except on and with this DVD.If you are a fan of mob films,""The Departed"" is a must-see film. It is one of the best films to ever have been made and released. It has everything a good film needs (a great plot,a great script,a great cast,great acting,and a great director),and will probably continue to make an influence on film fans over the years,the same kind of influence that other mob films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" have.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1B4TEX216CAVA	so very bored	Eventhough this movie is watchable it has many flaws. I know that the characters in this movie are bad people well except the Martin Sheen character. Bad or not i did not feel anything for these characters. In other Scoresse movies the were filled with bad people these people atleast were entertaining. Joe Pesci was very evil in Goodfellas and Casino but at least he was entertaning the same can be said for other parts like Bill the butucher from Gangs or New York, Rupbert Pumkin from king of comedy, and countless other baddies in Scorsses other better movies.Spoiler alert: All of the leads except Walberg die and Walberg kills Mat Damons character.When the were killed i did not fell anything. This movie is so forgetable that i cant even remeber the characters names. The other thing that bugs me about this movie is how the characters especially's Walbergs character use gay slurs to insult people. If this movie did not have this cast and director behind it no one would care. Also why does Scorsse keep puting Leo Dicrapo in his movie he needs to go back with Deniro the star of all his good movies. Atleast he did not do another movie like the snore fests The Avaitar or Age of Innoncence he is at his best with Deniro and a Rated R movies with violence and cussing stuff this movie has plenty off but so what when the characters are boring and the script is just a remake of another movie.	3.0	Just a overprice tv movie	2007-02-21	8	2	6
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ	"Spare-Time Critic ""Deb"""	"Two guys played by Matt Damon (Sullivan) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Costigan) embark on mirror-image spy careers. One is a mobster pretending to be a cop; the other is a cop pretending to be a mobster. Since the actors look annoyingly similar to me, I had trouble at first sorting things out.Jack Nicholson (Costello) plays basically the same dirty-minded old grouch in every movie nowadays, so he at least was no puzzle (though he did show something new in this movie, come to think of it). Same thing with Martin Sheen (Queenan), who channeled ""West Wing's"" Josiah Bartlett for this movie. Maybe recycling characters saves rehearsal time? Mark Wahlberg played a nasty, sarcastic, snarky guy named Dignam who was in almost every scene with Martin Sheen, maybe to cancel out all that Josiah Bartlett niceness. He did everything but perch on Queenan's left shoulder wearing horns and a pitchfork.To keep the female viewer's interest, there was a ""love triangle"" aspect with a ditzy female therapist who fell for both Sullivan and Costigan. Maybe she couldn't tell them apart any better than I could. A good twenty minutes could've been shaved off the movie if only she'd been able to beg, borrow or steal a clue in the romance department. Both of these guys were Bad Choices. Didn't she learn anything in therapist school?I didn't like any of the characters enough to care what happened to them, and was thus bored for most of the movie. I nearly gave myself tennis elbow from checking my watch.So now I wonder why so many people gave this 5 stars. Was it the shock value? Well, there was a lot of skull cracking and blood spattering. Haven't we seen enough of that yet? Lots of foul language, but they're going to have to get truly creative to shock people with that anymore. There was one truly revolting glimpse of Costello in a porn theater that fell squarely into the ""shocking"" department, I guess. No, I think what really makes this a work of genius is its message: There's not much difference between good and evil anyway, and life is short. Better get while the gettin's good.That's such an important message to hammer home to people nowadays, especially young people. Through the magic of DVDs, every teenager can watch this movie over and over again until that life philosophy is burned into his psyche. And they will.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AP79P3RQ1EOT9	Sparky	"Man, people, there sure are a whole lot of blood thirsty closet assassins out there. Well, here's a movie tailor made for you. If prefer your killin' close up and personal, there's probably nothing more satisfying than the close range head shots in The Departed, complete with realistic exploding skulls and Hollywood-accurate blood spatter patterns. When I watch a film this grotesque I have to wonder, is art really imitating life here? Or is art leading the way? I just can't wait for the next generation of Hollywood programmed sadists to hit the streets.While 'Infernal Affairs', the Hong Kong film on which 'The Departed' is based, is a reasonably interesting, though occaissionally melodramatic, cops vs. gangsters action flick with an interesting twist, Scorsese's blood soaked revision seems at times to have more in common with 'The Saw' or 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Clearly he was more interested in getting the head shots right than the story.By the time Martin's added enough unnecessary (and often poorly considered) plot turns and forced a Hollywood romance into this bloated epic, it's nearly unrecognizable from the original. Which might be okay if Martin's version made any sense, but it doesn't. Everybody just gets killed save the last guy holding a gun, and from the way the world turns in Scorsese-land, you can bet somebody popped a bullet into his head about two minutes after the film ended. No real point, just, ""Man, life is raw, dude.""If you get a rise out of blood spatter and storylines just get in the way, go for 'The Departed', if you want the better film, check out the original or just check out something else. Scorsese got the Oscar for this simply because Hollywood wanted to give him an Oscar. Another director wouldn't even have been invited to the show."	2.0	Sadistic	2007-04-08	14	9	5

For shame Marty, but it's ok, you're a typical American - unoriginal, uninspired, and ultimately, a thief.Noone from the Hong Kong films got any mention or credit from Marty or his minions, except for the half-hearted under the breath mutter of acknowledgement to Andy Lau at the Oscars.  And oh by the way Marty, it was a CHINESE film, NOT a Japanese film that you ripped off.  At least get that right.These two films are so alike it's creepy.  Departed added a couple of new, but pointless, characters, and based it in Beantown.  Aside from that, the film is Infernal Affairs.This is my opinion.  I know most people ""loved"" the film and thought it was so fresh and wonderful.  Guess what?

The characters were unusual, interesting, believable, and you felt like you got to know them.  You felt their motivations for things, and what they are feeling inside.  There is a particularly amusing supporting role by Mark Wahlberg.

The way they show the violence done by Costello or for Costello and the fact he just walks around town like any man, is ridiculous.  Either one or more of his victims, including his own men, would have bumped him off long ago.  I don't mind violence in a film if the story seems real, but I felt the director went for the shock value and the heck with the story.  Violence, more violence and ever more violence was supposed to make this an exciting movie and for some I am sure it worked.  If violence, sex, dirty jokes, and cursing fit the story I'm all for it being included.  The Departed, however, just seemed too contrived and the just too many holes in the story ruined everything.

Scorcese is getting on in years; maybe they wanted to throw him a golden bone? You know his judgement is slipping every time he casts Leonardo in roles he can't handle. Even the number of little continuity slips from shot to shot just groan with signs that the old master's touch has dissipated long ago.This thing looks and sounds like it was made by the boys on the force. And speaking of boys, Scorcese should have realized that putting Nicholson into the pool with little 'uns like Damon, DiCaprio, and Wahlberg only emphasizes the fact that they're still not ready to play grown men. They can't even spit out the endless stream of f*#@%-letter-words without sounding like they came right out of a script. And listen to how every one of them sounds like they were trained by the same accent coach.I agree with another reviewer, the thing's a mess.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ARRAMXWT83PT	Steven Adam Renkovish	I just saw Martin Scorsese's new film, The Departed, last night and I have to say - it was excellent! Scorsese is back in top form here, revisiting the mobster genre that he has been known for over the years. I would rank this one up with his classic film - and one of my personal favorites - Goodfellas. It's nice to see Marty swing back to his gritty, ultra-violent self!First of all, the acting, directing, and just about everything else was state of the art. Jack Nicholson was perfect as Frank Costello, a mob boss who is in charge of the organized crime ring in Boston. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, an undercover cop who sneaks his way into Costello's gang so he can be an informant for the police department. Meanwhile, Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, an informant for Costello's mob who works for the police department, and is on his way to be promoted in the Special Investigations Unit. Both men cross paths, and fall in love with the same woman - a psychologist played by Vera Farmiga from the little-known indie Running Scared. Each man starts to become consumed by their work, and when they are both in danger of being found out, only then do tensions rise, and things get a little out of hand. The performances from the leads are all Oscar-worthy. I never thought that I'd ever say that about Matt Damon. Well, let me back that up. He was quite good in Good Will Hunting and he was great in The Talented Mr. Ripley, and his performance here is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance here since What's Eating Gilbert Grape. DiCaprio is becoming a fixture in Scorsese's recent films, almost as if he is the director's newfound muse amongst male actors, the last one being Robert DeNiro. This is Jack Nicholson's first film with Scorsese, which is hard to believe, but it is true. Jack is back to what he does best in this role, and, pardon the cliche, but it fits him like a glove. His performance is one of ferocious intensity, and everytime he's on the screen, you feel really uneasy...and that's not a bad thing! The direction is flawless. I've already said enough about Scorsese, but the man knows how to make a great film! I must also give credit to the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, who worked on Goodfellas. Her editing makes the film seem fast paced and hyperactive, and for a film that is thirty minutes short of being three hours long, that's amazing!However, if you are easily offended by profanity or graphic violence, then stay far away! They are both here, and in abundance.	5.0	Scorsese's best since Goodfellas.	2006-10-11	33	27	6
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	The Departed (2006)Crime, Drama, 151 minutesDirected by Martin ScorseseStarring Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack NicholsonI have heard a lot of criticism for The Departed because it's based on the Hong Kong film, Infernal Affairs (2002). While I'm usually against remakes of any kind, there are a few that were worth the effort. Another criticism is that Scorsese won the Oscar for Best Director for this instead of several superior films. I understand that argument, but it shouldn't be a reason to downgrade the film. I must admit I haven't seen Infernal Affairs, and there are still a few Scorsese films that I haven't got around to, but I am certain that The Departed is my favorite from the many I have seen.The Departed works for me because of Scorsese and the incredible cast. DiCaprio and Damon are both superb in their roles and both are among my favorite modern actors. Jack Nicholson dominates the screen as Frank Costello and Ray Winstone is perfect as his main sidekick. This is also the first film in which I noticed Vera Farmiga. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen. What's not to like?The movie has a complicated plot and it's a pleasure to see it unfold. There isn't much action, but the few scenes that do contain action are violent and shocking. The movie is enhanced by the dialogue which partly explains why it is 50 minutes longer than Infernal Affairs. The characters have considerable depth and I always come away from the movie feeling that I know them.The Departed won Oscars for Best Director, Film Editing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. Although it didn't win any acting awards, there wasn't a bad performance from any of the cast. Writing this now, I realize that I need to see the movie again soon. It's definitely one of my favorites and easily in my Top 20.	5.0	One of my favorite Scorsese films	2012-02-29	0	0	0

Before bashing me for having bad taste, keep in mind that Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films. This movie was fantastic up until the end.

It is very engrossing with both multi-sided characters and a facinating storyline.  The film, like many Scorsese efforts, is visually stunning and graphic.  DiCaprio delivers another awesome performance, his third with Scorsese, and Matt Damon and Jack Nicoholson are top-notch as well.  Mark Walhberg's performance, while excellent, wasn't, in my opinion, Oscar-caliber.  I scratched my head on how he got an Oscar nod for this film and none of the other actors did.  The script is very original and I enjoyed the many surprising plot twists.  The title should give away to you a lot about how the story ends, but I'll just say that it is a sad story in the end.  Like real-life good guys don't always win and bad guys don't always get caught."	4.0	The Departed Delivers!	2007-05-01	5	2	3
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AJ4RHKZEX07ID	Steven P. Mccann	"Martin Scorsese is my favorite director. That said, I now reserve my seat as the only person on the planet to find this movie a hokey, predictable and childish mess. I hold the mob/gangster flick closer than any genre. I can accept any premise and watch it for that level. The premise is delicious: Jack Nicholson as a gonzo Whitey Bulger and an assorted cast of misfit sadist mobsters and dirty cops turn Boston's Southie section into a meat grinder. The cops got a rat, the bad guys got a rat and for the next 2 hours...cell phones and more cell phones. These points are my problem: Can Matt Damons character seriously have achieved such high level status in a state police special operations unit that quickly? Can Dicaprio seriously have been accepted into the inner circle of the most vicious mobster in New England by using a couple brawls and a lousy pedigree for references? Was Damon eventually going to frame that envelope? Going off the deep end to link Dicaprio and Damon by trading ""sloppy seconds"" with a nothing character like the shrink? A ""bugged"" conversation recorded in a porno theatre that has c.d. studio quality? This is the anti-Scorsese. His trademark style of Mean Streets and Goodfella's isn't here. A lower case, less glorified Irish mob flick with plenty of squibs is State Of Grace. I accepted that movie on its own level. Nobody pumped me up for a re-telling of the Godfather like they did for the dear Departed."	2.0	"""Good Fella's"" it ain't."	2007-02-23	7	4	3

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2U1M5DOGULIQA	"S. Thomas Adelstein ""Tom Adelstein"""	"Say what you will about the movie, some people like it and others don't, but Leonardo DiCaprio out-acted every big star in this movie including Jack and Matt. Who garnered the most sympathy and carried this film? That's correct it was Leonardo.I have watched his performances over the years and he's shown mostly a gentle side. He started to come out in The Aviator and that may have been where he garnered the energy to put this performance together.When I checked the movie out, I thought the casting was remarkable. They put together an expensive, very expensive cast. Jack was a big as ever, maybe bigger. Matt was big too, when he had the sound stage to himself. All this celebrity carried their own scenes. Leo in contrast to Leo looked remarkable.His superior acting became obvious when he interacted with Matt. I consider Matt a king among actors, especially his performances in the Bourne series. In the Departed Matt looked vacant compared to Leo.What distinctions do I see that had Leo as the superior of the cast? First, he held his own against Mark Wahlberg, which I consider generally difficult to do unless your a beauty wearing lots of skin. Next, he held his own against Jack. That's not only difficult to do, but Jack didn't have to act down to his co-stars. Jack acted straight on with Leo. Jack put in a remarkable performance, even though his character lacked sympathy. He still had to bring his ""A"" game to his scenes with Leo. I didn't even know Leo had an ""A"" game.We can break this down scene by scene, but you can judge this yourself. Watch the movie and notice who gets your attention the most. In every scene, Leo takes over. My eyes went back in forth when Leo and Jack worked together. Perhaps I was nailed by Leo's character. I don't really think that. I would have them do a role reversal and Leo had the most energy. That energy put him over the top.Finally, toward the last scene when Leo's character is killed so suddenly, I couldn't believe it. It was in such a shock that time seemed to stand still.Only a Martin Scorsese could make all these superior actors work well together. He balanced and juggled as well, if not better, that he ever has. This film has little redeeming value without the star power including the director.I'll never know who brought Leo out. I suspect Leo did, but that's a guess. I wonder if Martin has the time to coach Leo. Again, I'll never know.If you haven't seen this movie, then watch it. The blood and guts didn't bother me at all because it was so much a part of the fabric. I disliked blood and guts movies as they are about B&G.; The Departed is about character and strength and ingenuity.Judge it for yourself."	5.0	Leonado's Movie	2007-12-25	1	0	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AAX003J4OL1LN	St. Nick Name	"This is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen.I was drawn in at first, but the storyline never gelled, and was eventually completely buried in extraneous garbage and ho-hum acting.  The main plot could have been interesting, but none of the details made any sense, and none of the characters came close to being fully developed.- Who IS Costello?  A small-time thug?  A big fish?  A guy trying to crawl out of the ghetto? A psychopath who just likes to partake in ridiculously risky money-making schemes? What other crimes has he committed?  Why does he hate the church?  The film never answers any of these questions.- Who IS Costigan, and what motivates him? He's got an uncle who was bad, and I think his dad was good.  So what?  Why, exactly, did he become a cop? Why do all of the bad guys know his bad uncle, but not him (and vise-versa)?  They know he was in the police academy, yet decide to let him join the gang!? After he's only been in the gang for 4 months, they learn there's a rat.  They have no problem shooting others in the head in cold blood, so why don't they do that to Costigan?  They don't just fail to kill him, we find out later that he is inexplicably the Costello's MOST TRUSTED!?!  Huh?- Why does Sullivan risk his entire life and career for Costello?  Because he bought him groceries once? Why do we care that he was an altar boy?  What was his family life like?  Why does he enjoy lying so much? Why does he show no emotion ever - is it part of the character or just bad acting?- Why is everybody else so one dimensional?  The weak, weak girlfriend caught up in a complicated subplot, who eventually learns the deep secret at the heart of the movie and does NOTHING about it. The token black cop from Costigan's police academy class who speaks exactly ONE line to set up that credential. The Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen characters with zero depth - both actors phoning in their performances. The other gang members who have almost no discernible personality.- Why are the state cops running a high-budget, low manpower sting out of the city police station with no interaction with the city cops?- Are we really supposed to believe that an erased file on the computer system can't be recovered and is really the ONLY evidence that Costigan is an undercover cop?  REALLY?Added to all this are the thousand subplots that go NOWHERE.- The baby.- The envelope given to the girlfriend, never to be seen again.- The very important, but never shown, FBI-informant angle.- The relationship never explained between the Sheen and Wahlberg characters.- The unexplained attraction the girlfriend has for violent men with psychological problems.- The innumerable undercover people on both sides that we only find out about AFTER their deaths, which we don't care about because we hardly noticed them when they were alive.- How and why did Costigan record all his conversations?- Is the oft hinted at pederasty directly related to any of the characters?Not since ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" have I been as let down by a movie.  Like that movie, none of the characters in ""The Departed"" have any motivation or redeeming qualities.  None of their actions or reactions makes any sense.  It's OBVIOUS who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, but I didn't like or hate ANY of the characters. The strongest feeling I had toward them all was WHO CARES?I need to stop thinking about this movie.  The more I think about it, the dumber it seems, and the angrier I become for having wasted time watching it.  The fact that it gets rave reviews simply adds to the anger and confusion."	1.0	The Departed - D.O.A.	2012-07-23	18	7	11

Many of the performaces were a bit forced, flat, or otherwise sub-par.  The only standouts were Alec Baldwin and a surprisingly solid Mark Walberg.  The romantic angles of the movie felt uniformly ""hollywood"", that is, lacking in any real substance or chemistry, or ""reality"".  I was taken out of the movie everytime Leo or Matt interacted with the female love interest.This ranks right up there with ""American Beauty"", ""Crash"", and ""Forrest Gump"" for the Academy's tendency to pick contrived scenery-chewing over real substance and depth."	3.0	The Academy sure knows how to pick 'em, eh?	2007-03-22	6	4	2

Is it DiCcaprio, is it Matt Damon or Jack Nicolson? You wonder. Such is the finesse of the director. Martin makes even other co-stars Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and others such as Jack Nicolson's men and Vera Farmiga as the Psychiatrist stand out with their performances making you feel that almost everyone in the movie is important. The acting is brilliant and almost everyone delivers.And if you thought all the villians were played, Jack Nicolson just proves you wrong. It is amazing to see that he can still go on delivering memorable performances for his age.One of the finest scenes of the movie is the conversation scene between DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson after the latter suspects a rat in his band of men. This is a scene that will send your heart pounding even if it was just a simple scene of two people talking. Full stars to DeCaprio and Jack. There are several other notable and dramatic scenes exuding brilliant performances from the stars bringing the climax to a heart pounding finish.It is also difficult to believe that this is a retold story of another movie. Similar movies have appeared in the past notably Donnie Brasco and LA Confidential but Martin's treatment of The Departed proves there's more to such stories.Action is gory and language will not be appropriate for watching with children.On Oscar night, if George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Capolla had to be on the stage to present Martin with the Oscar for best Director, it was not without reason.Five stars.	5.0	Scorsese delivers a masterpiece	2007-04-11	3	0	3

But which is which? Great action and guts, but somehow Dicaprio is sleepwalking through this one, with Damon more convincing as a seedy, sleazy recruit gone bad. Jack Nicholson is cocky, but not convincing as a crook somehow (?!?!?).  The violence builds up and gets labyrinthine, as the two characters close in on each other.

It does a remarkable job showing us the dark side of human nature as people often struggle to better themselves - a lofty goal but done without guidance or morals. Matt Damon is at his best in this role filled with dualities.  Jack Nicholson proves once again that he is an actor's actor.  He is believable and powerful as the ruthless antagonist.  Leonardo DiCaprio is truly a sympathetic character, and he plays that role with heart-felt realism.  And Mark Wahlberg?  He may have done some different kinds of roles in the past, but he has certainly come into his own in this film.  His portrayal of the angst-filled, loyal tough guy is accurate and strong!  The movie moves along on a fairly fast track, keeping the audience on its toes.  The lighting is a wonderful enhancer to the intricacies of the plot - it guides you in and out of darkness.  Martin Scorsese knows how to do it!  In The Departed, he has surpassed himself by weaving a story where even the good guys make you nervous and the streets of any city start to look menacing!

Lyvers ""The Big Boss"""	"The original fits what Martin loves to make movies about but I would have hoped he presented the movie like how Guillermo Del Toro and now Quentin Tarantino do for the films they love to watch and support.  A good film buff friend of mine showed Infernal Affairs to me around the time it came out domestically and I fell in love as everyone else did.  Later I followed up with the prequel/sequels as they came out.  Very pleased and impressed since I loved Martin's crime stories and all.I encourage people to try watching the original Infernal Affairs trilogy with subtitles (if reading is hard for you then I'm sorry). The originals are great films otherwise you wouldn't ever get this remake. And in the original, Wai-keung Lau's (with Yiu-Fai Lai) work is more complimentary to Michael Chapman's style for those of you who loved Taxi Driver & Goodfellas. I like the style of the actor's work with the nice subtle vibe going on with the cinematography in the original that I always enjoyed in Martin's style in his films and with Michael Chapman work which was what i was expecting to feel but didn't (the film Bringing Out The Dead is a great film by the way).  Do note though, I am not hating on Robert Richardson. I like his work on Inglorious Bastards, The Good Shepherd and even the Horse Whisperer.  As a remake though, with the two films, I felt in the remake there were more moments forced that were not needed, then again it was pressing 3 films into one.  My main beef with the Departed is simply that its unecessary and over done in a subtle way which is a complimenting minus point or low passing grade in my books a D+.  With 3 movies in one, its longer than it needs to be.!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!! (yes even for a remake)I felt the death of SP Wong Chi Shing was more artistic and had a stronger impact than the death of Queenan...but in American cinema, sadly Actors can have a say on how they want their character's death scene handled in films and that part displeased me the most (I say this cause something was fishy with the narration of that scene).  The death of Wong Chi Sing was more of a shock and brought on a gun fight with lots of people involved that I was hoping The Departed would've went to town with like something from Heat, but no. I didn't get any suspense and there is a weird steady cam shot looking down on the action from whoever was holding it that felt very community college film class for a second.  Every other death scene had nice work put into it but this was a combination of over the top and under worked...all unnecessary. It was the scene I was excited for and curious on how America would top it but it didn't.I felt the relationships with the female characters and the male leads were not forced as they were in the departed.  Lau Kin Ming (""Colin"") was married to a writer and her role was very nice and separated his good conscience from beyond the job conscience in another element that I felt Colin should have stayed with.  And my number one thing is that Billy was undercover for less than two years and Chen Wing Yan was undercover for ten years...so the stress and intensity of ten years compared to around 2 gave me less sympathy for Billy as the movie progressed, drama and all.  Dignam is brand new, never was there and so in the original there was no one to help after the shocker death scene which made it more intense for the hero to be alone. There are other differences but these are my personal main ones.It's sad that America can only bring in Asians kicking people to the big theaters and any other brilliant non martial arts work has to get copied.  I guess we cannot see Asians doing anything else...?  It would be nice to see original films in theaters like The Ring, My Sassy Girl,  City On Fire (Reservoir Dogs), Shall We Dancu, Anjaane (Strangers), Riding For Thousands Of Miles as examples.  At least make a re-imagination like Magnificent Seven was of Seven Samurai and Road to Perdition was of Lone Wolf & Cub...BONUS NOTE: I can't forgive Godzilla. So I am guessing one day we may see some version of Oldboy in America or The Man From Nowhere which had only one copycat scene from Dark Knight not like Priest which was a constant copycat scene filled film...not going there today! I do feel that if we can appreciate the same stories from other countries, why not appreciate that film instead of remaking it as if never to bother? Or we can only see what we so much of whatever from whoever?I don't usually like remakes much and I really don't like copycats (revamps are OK after a time/redemption). I wish Raging Bull or Taxi Driver brought Martin his past due award instead of a remake. Martin Scorsese is long past due many awards in the past.  I do give props to the film makers as they did credit the ones who made the story.  Film makers who copy some one else's work without giving credit like Sanjay Gupta (Diablo Cody is in question in my mind with her 'take' on Jeni Juno, innocent or guilty, I'm not sure, hmmmm).Remakes and copies that are not even re-imaginations or revamps sit weird with me.  This movie is cute and if you have never seen the original like any other remake, you may enjoy it.  Why compare the two films that have been brought up in my talks with film buddies is simpley because they are connected, one is a remake.  Gotta give props and credit for where credit is do.  Even if you do like the remake more than the original, thats cool too, but it still wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the original.3 Stars because it is a good film, just not original."	3.0	it's a cute remake, but not for me and here is why	2011-10-03	4	2	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A35B8H3Z0IU9PK	T. A.	"The DepartedThe Departed is the type of film where people walking out the theater will feel as if they have embraced a long lost friend.  After The Aviator, few knew what direction Martin Scorsese would be heading in.  Although it was a superb film worthy of its many Oscar nominations, many were bewildered to how loosely it resembled anything Mr. Scorsese had put on screen.  Fans need not panic.  Scorsese has returned to his roots of mobs and violence in his new film.  And what a return it is!The Departed scores big on almost every possible level.  Let's begin with the cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg all perform magnificent in their roles.  It's almost surreal having all these actors together for one film.  Not satisfied...want more?  Toss in Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin into the mix.  Both actors obtain small roles but deliver on screen monumental results.Discovering the plot is half the fun, so not much should be given away.  Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) has infiltrated Frank Costello's (Nicholson) Iris mob.  Not an easy task when one realizes the bloody and deranged nature of Costello's boys.The Massachusetts State Police should be more careful as well because one of Costello's men, Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), has penetrated the police force.  Two rats...one nasty result.Jack Nicholson continues to prove why he is still one of the best actors in the business.  Mr. Nicholson chews and devours every scene he is in.  His character, Costello, is psychotic and fascinating.  It's a character made of pure evil, yet you can't get enough of.  One can easily tell from Nicholson's eyes that he is relishing into his character and loving every minute of it.  We too can't help but share the same excitement.It's important to note that The Departed is the American version of Hong Kong's beloved masterpiece Infernal Affairs.  It seems like every time an American remake of a foreign classic comes out, it stinks to high heaven.  For some reason American remake's never get it right.  We are currently witnessing this  with our lousy remakes of Japanese horror films.  The Departed reminds us that remakes can be done well and can be done right.  A remake from a foreign film hasn't been this good since Christopher Nolan's Insomnia.In all of its 151 minutes, The Departed is lavished with brutal violence and contains pervasive use of colorful words.  It's crucial to understand why this film should not be slandered for its persistent use of violence.  What separates this violent feature from other ferocious films such as Crank, is that The Departed handles its violent nature with maturity.  It demands the language and violence necessary to the environment of characters we have been introduced too.  It is treated with maturity and therefore, elevated to an art form.  Examples like Crank are dumb and merely throws in violence just for the sake of violence.  A ""trick"" conveyed simply for an, ""Awesome!"" or ""Cool!"" factor, not for purpose.  In reality, the audience is the only one getting bamboozled.  Many have walked out of The Departed recognizing it as a violent film, yet are not disgusted by it.  It is because it is handled with maturity.  It is much in the same metaphor as a nude art painting in comparison with porn.The Departed is a brilliant film which boasts a triumph return to Martin Scorsese's roots.  A gorgeous display of cinematography by Michael Ballhaus, a slick cool acoustic guitar score by Howard Shore, and magnificent acting all-around by some of the best in Hollywood make The Departed one of the best films of the year."	5.0	Welcome Back	2007-03-02	10	5	5

Excellent cast with DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen, and Wahlberg...Although, people failed to realize that it was originally, I believe, a Chinese script.  Nonetheless, very good movie that has an excellent twist at the end.  Not your average 90 minute long movie. This movie is 151 minutes long and it was perfect.Scorsese takes the audience from the beginning to the end of how crime and criminals don't go hand in hand and earning trust is a very big gamble.  A cop (DiCaprio) is working for the mob and a mob (Damon) is working for cops. Both are under covers trying to reveal the ""rat"" before the other person does.The movie was set in Boston and coming from the East Coast, Scorsese was right on the money.  The accents, attitudes, and back grounds were perfect. Not recommended for children.

You don't know who will end up coming out on top as there are a variety of levels of cat-and-mouse going on in this picture. Will the undercover good cop (DiCaprio) survive the efforts of the cop who is actually an ""undercover bad guy"" (Damon) who is trying to find the identity of the rat? Will the mob boss (Nicholson) outsmart the good cops in charge (Wahlberg, Sheen)? There are more questions than these you will want to know the answers to as the movie progresses, but then you find out amidst much blood and gore and dead bodies (there might be only two main characters out of close to 10 that actually live until the end of the movie) and that is that, all your questions are answered and maybe you are satisfied and maybe you are not. No matter what, you know and that is what made this movie even mildly interesting. Watching it again would be a bore. This movie has ridiculous violence. I do not mean excessive, I mean ridiculous to the point where if you have a strong stomach you'll probably just laugh at some of the bloody parts because they are so over the top. The acting is okay. I thought only Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon pulled their weight in this picture. DiCaprio does the worse accents in movies that I wish he would just stop trying. Wahlberg is okay in the movie, but certainly not deserving of an oscar nomination.Basically, this movie is over-hyped and watchable once and only once."	3.0	Decent movie but overhyped and not worth seeing more than once	2007-03-03	8	2	6

I'm sure at this point, you already know whether or not you like the movie so let's just skip all of the plot synopsis and back and forth on whether or not this is Scorsese's best film in God knows how long and get to the point of these user reviews.I have to say that the quality of the HD side of the disc (the disc has a regular DVD side, which I didn't bother watching in all honesty) is simply astounding. There was a moment near the beginning of the film during a funeral where I honestly felt that I could put my hand through the screen past the bagpipers in the foreground to touch the people all the way in the far background. The picture is unbelievably clear throughout and not once did I spot any iffy picture issues or anything detrimental to the presentation.Sound mixes come in DD 5.1 and Dolby True HD and to be honest, I couldn't tell the difference. Both mixes are great, if not overly active in the rear speakers. Surrounds kicked in from time to time but being that this isn't an all out action picture, most of the audio activity takes place in the front speakers. Don't worry though, the mix is just right for the film and I didn't feel it was lacking at all.Extras are the same as the DVD edition, with a couple of interesting mini-docs on the Boston Mob, Scorsese's filmmaking influences, deleted/extended scenes and a theatrical trailer. It's not as feature packed as I would've liked (guess I've gotten a bit spoiled over the years) but what's here is enough for the casual viewer.So, bottom line:If you have an HD-DVD player and you liked the film, get this HD-DVD. As it is, there isn't much else to buy for HD-DVD at the moment and this is pretty much a no-brainer."	5.0	You already know the movie is good, but what about the HD-DVD?	2007-02-25	5	2	3

However I would say that the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was for Scorsese having Damon and at parts Leo try there pathetic attempt of an Irish acent they both sound nothing like an Irishman. Jack the man Nicholson carried most of the movie on his shoulders with Jack your always going to get your comedy and you do here in this movie as well. Mark Walhberg  does the better acting out of Damon  and Leo trio, and plays his part to key and convinsingly.  The movie itself  I would give 5 stars I just cant get over the Damon and Leo Irish acent thing.  Jack is the head honcho mafia boss selling microchips to wanna be asian gangsters and Leo is working in his crew undercover . Damon is the head police guy or sergant something like that to bring down Jack.  Walhberg is one of only two people that know that Leo is undercover in Jack's crime orginization.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1KMG1AIUS00DC	"The Movie Man ""tenebre89"""	"Martin Scorsese has never won an Academy Award.  He has directed ""Mean Streets,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""Gangs of New York,"" and ""The Aviator,"" among others.  He was nominated six times for the Best Director Oscar, yet never managed to snare one.  For his last two nominations, there was a contingent of show-biz folks who felt he was a shoo-in.  His time had come, they figured.  But Scorsese remained a bridesmaid.In ""The Departed,"" Scorsese's elegant new feature about good guys and bad guys, the director has chosen subject matter that fits him like a glove.  Once again, he returns to the underworld and toys with the complexities of right and wrong in a society in which ""Might Makes Right"" rules and bad and good are painted not in black and white, but in shades of grey.Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston gangster who learned early that you have to take what you want; no one is going to give you a free ride.  He's applied this principle in his day-to-day dealings, terrorizing rival thugs and his own crew.  Despite an ongoing investigation of Costello by the police, they can't seem to get anything solid enough on him to make an arrest.Having established the criminals, Scorsese switches to a graduating class of police recruits.  Among them is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who, as a kid, was taken under the wing of Costello, and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a smart young man trying to escape his family's criminal ties.  Both will figure significantly in the Boston police's plan to infiltrate Costello's inner circle.  Only two men on the force, Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his tough-talking second-in-command, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), know who that infiltrator is.""The Departed"" has a superb script by William Monahan.  It is riveting, never predictable, and provides solid roles for its four stars.  The dialogue is rough, as are the men -- both cops and mobsters -- who work the mean streets of Boston.  And there is violence -- a lot of it.  When it occurs, it is often shocking with little buildup.  This tends to shake up the viewer and keep him on his toes.Nicholson is an actor it's always fun to watch, but he can be excessive and allow his trademark quirks to run away with his performance.  In ""The Departed,"" Scorsese keeps Costello in focus, never letting that devilish Jack wink at us.  Nicholson is immersed in his performance.  As an aging gangster, his Costello hasn't lost any of his bravado, his ruthlessness, or his ability to kill.  Nicholson plays Costello with dimension.  He doesn't resemble any crime figure seen on screen before.  His Costello is unique.Di Caprio turns in his finest performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""  His Costigan is a deeply conflicted guy, placed in a dangerous situation by higher-ups who have faith in him to accomplish a difficult mission.  He wants to succeed, but his personal safety is compromised with each day, causing him to balance his fear with focus on the job at hand.  Di Caprio brings an intensity to the role that audiences haven't seen in his previous work.  This is surely an Academy Award-worthy performance.Damon and Wahlberg, both natives of Boston, draw upon their own background to provide characterizations of two very different kinds of men.  Damon's Sullivan is a smart cookie who rises quickly in the ranks of the police department.  He is secretive, authoritative, often arrogant to those under his command, and calculating.  Damon gives Sullivan a preppy edge.  His Sullivan is a man who's gone far and is capable of going even further.  The combination of his intelligence, drive, and cold-heartedness makes him a deadly person.Wahlberg's Dignam contrasts with the laid-back demeanor of his boss, Capt. Queenan.  He mouths litanies of profanities as fluently as an announcer would do play-by-play for the Red Sox.  He's a cop, but he's never exorcised the tough streets of Boston from his being.  He calls things as he sees them, without tact, political correctness, or artifice.  What you see is what he is.  Wahlberg brightens an already stellar picture by sinking his teeth into this role and running with it.  Like Di Caprio, none of his earlier screen work matches his intensity in ""The Departed.""The cast is rounded out by Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga, who portray a police captain and a police psychiatrist, respectively.For the last five years, I've been squarely against excessive running times.  Often, such long movies can be trimmed, benefiting the overall film.  Yet directors continue to give us overly long, padded movies that outstay their welcome long before the final credits roll.  ""The Departed"" runs 149 minutes, yet there is never the feeling that any of those minutes is extraneous.  The screenplay is crafted so deftly that every scene, every bit of dialogue, every close-up has a significant role to play.I've seen many movies in 2006 and ""The Departed"" is easily the best.  No question.  All the elements come together perfectly.  The film's editing is quick and exciting, never sacrificing characterization in the process.  Not since Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" has a director managed to corral such talent in a single film and come up with a winner.""The Departed,"" plain and simple, is masterful movie making.  Director Scorsese has assembled a letter-perfect cast in a movie that showcases both that cast and his own ability to fashion intriguing cinema."	5.0	The Best Film of 2006	2007-02-24	5	4	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1CYRTQ04LYI55	"therosen ""therosen"""	The Departed puts a new twist on classic cop/gangster movies (think Scarface, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way & LA Confidential) with an all star cast (Matt Damon, Jack, de Caprio, and a Baldwin in a role you don't hate him for).  The Irish mob has a mole in the state police, and the police have a mole in the mob.  Who finds who first?  How are their positions mirrors of each other, and how are they divergent?The name of the movie comes from a preoccupation with death.  Death of family, death of characters (guess what, some die!) and death as motivation.  This theme is one of the unique spots of the movie.The move also has the breakout role of Mark Wahlberg.  Despite having seen Invincible the night before, this viewer didn't reaize he was in the movie until after.  He disappeared THAT much into his role.  In a sense it was a subtle show stealer - and he showed himself an elite actor on the level (above the level?) of the other stars.More than just a gangster/cop flick, this joins the gallery of the great gangster/cop flicks.	5.0	Strong movie, new twists	2007-04-12	3	0	3

Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers; however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against.  He is discharged from the police and serves a one-year prison sentence and upon his departure, join the crowd of Costello made up of scandalous thugs and convicts, in order to gain information and evidence to convict the felon. But Costello has some tricks up his sleeve and his infamous nature is guarded by the inside of the commandment. Many years prior to Billy's infiltration, Costello befriends a young boy and makes him his own personal messenger and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Colin Sullivan. Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information. He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department.  The two men accept their tasks and we are thrown into the ultimate story of corruption, deceit and loyalty. Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy has his own personal demons and is in constant battle within himself from his crimes with Costello to his loss of humanization. Billy seems to lose himself in the film and is in long search of redemption of his misdemeanors.DiCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from ""Titanic""; his ""Billy"" is perplexing and utterly haunting. DiCaprio's performance is the best of the star-studded cast. His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable. I just don't feel his character can be appreciated and admired the way it should be.  Matt Damon has been trying to show us a different part of him each time. Colin is the most hated man of the film, hands down. From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis. Colin Sullivan is greedy in power, arrogant in thoughts, and degrading in aura. The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be. The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made. Director Martin Scorsese (""Taxi Driver"", ""Goodfellas"") builds scenes with so much suspense that it's terribly hard not to become knotted in the film and be at the edge of your seat.  Frank Costello is one of the most malevolent, immoral, sinful men of recent film history. Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar. Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello. He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor; he chews scenery so well that he bleeds out the screen. There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time.While the film is jammed packed with suspense and thrills, there is a huge flaw that befalls the film and it's its extremely weak ending. The film builds you up to a climax you cannot wait to see and experience but unfortunately, the end result is rather dull, flat and bland. While it didn't destroy the film entirely, it did enough damage to not make it a cinematic gem. Also, the entrance of Vera Farmiga's character as Madolyn, the police authority psychiatrist who starts to date Colin and ends up webbed in a love triangle with Billy is rather forced and unneeded. It's a bit too cheesy to suffice and the dramatic elements were enough without bringing in a tedious romance.  Martin Scorsese once again creates a beautifully constructed motion picture, leading the audience down a path of suspense and true grit.  Unfortunately, the final, violent scenes seem forced, as if Scorsese was attempting to recreate the shock of Travis Bickle shooting up a whore house, but instead leaves us with an exceptional film for the first two hours and fifteen minutes and a down-right ridiculous one for the last fifteen minutes.  Similar to the mold of ""Donnie Brasco"" (also portrays an undercover officer getting in good with a mob leader) but with a Scorsese twist; however, some viewers and critics, including this one, thinks that ""Brasco"" may be the more complete film.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18XF4Q8Z3NF7D	Thiago Macedo	"To take down South Boston's Irish Mafia, the police send in one of their own to infiltrate the underworld, not realizing the syndicate has done likewise in Martin Scorsese's Oscar-nominated crime thriller, for which he won a Best Director Golden Globe. While an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) curries favor with the mob kingpin (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal (Matt Damon) rises through the police ranks. But both sides soon discover there's a mole among them.Remaking the 2002 Hong Kong film, ""Infernal Affairs,"" screenwriter William Monahan keeps a lot of the plot details the same, but Martin Scorsese's take on the material results in a much darker, more brutal, illicit, and devastatingly tragic film (not to mention even more rambunctiously entertaining, filled with great dialogue, great editing, great performances, and great music). It's the first Scorsese film that could be considered a ""cop movie,"" as we're all more used to Scorsese's pure-bred gangster fare, but the film exists in a world so ubiquitously infested with violence, debauchery, and betrayal among cops and criminals alike that Nicholson's character can't help but ask, ""What's the difference?"" In the beginning Scorsese has a good time observing how DiCaprio's and Damon's characters fit into the roles they have to step into for the benefit of the organizations they have sworn allegiance to and for the downfall of the ones they are now a part of. Damon is conniving and working his way up the ladder, given respect and admiration by the people he is fighting against. DiCaprio is violent and desperate, living in fear, living the life of a criminal to try and contribute to their demise. It's this type of dramatic irony that Scorsese has the most fun with in this film and the movie succeeds as a fascinating examination of these lifestyles of grandeur and of disgrace and of the lies these men are living.As the film progresses it becomes steeped in twists, turns, and deceptions, none of which are the type of annoyingly contrived plot points so common in today's thrillers. As the audience, we are on our toes from beginning to end as the tension becomes tighter and tighter. At the end of it all, Scorsese's film is intense entertainment as well as a perceptive and intelligent film that scrutinizes the desire to serve the law--in whatever way that may fit--versus the desire to live in glory of doing so. This is an outstanding movie."	5.0	A remake by Scorsese cant go wrong!	2007-02-10	10	6	4
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ADIHXLFBAXXOK	T. Hickey	"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The cast are some of the most talented actors in Hollywood today. The Departed put Matt Damon on the map for me. And Leonardo Dicaprio...forget it. He is absolutely amazing as the tortured William Costigan Jr. I have seen this movie no less than 50 times. I'm actually watching it right now. I'm not a huge fan of ""gangster"" flicks, but this one is perfect. As the viewer, we know everything that the characters are trying to figure out, but what keeps us on the edge is wondering how it's going to be played out. Will the cops figure out who Costello's rat is? Will Costello figure out who's undercover? There is so much cursing, too, which is wonderful!! Personally, cussing is a constant in my circle, but if you have sensitive ears, you might need to steer clear...The soundtrack is also terrific. The Dropkick Murphy's Shipping up to Boston is a key element and just seems to fitting to this movie. I love everything about this movie.!!!"	5.0	Awesome!	2008-02-20	5	3	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""The Departed"" is one of those films you need to savor. Full of rich performances, attention to detail and lots of plot, you will probably need to see this new Scorcese film at least twice to be able to fully appreciate everything. One of the best films of the year.Young Colin Sullivan lives in a poor, rough neighborhood in Boston. As he struggles with life in this neighborhood, he notices a gangster by the name of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who seems to have the world in his pocket. Costello helps the young man and soon, Colin (Matt Damon) has enrolled in the police academy. Also entering the academy, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), another young man from the same neighborhood, has joined the police for a different reason; he wants to do some good. Upon graduation, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), two officers in the Massachusetts State Police, approach Billy and ask him to go undercover in Costello's organization. They are running a secret operation and no one but Queenan and Dignam will know Billy's true identity. Soon, each is working their way up through the individual organizations, providing information to help the other side. Then, one day, Colin learns of a possible informant in Costello's organization and informs his benefactor. Frank becomes skittish and asks Billy to help locate the mole. At the same time, Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), Colin's supervisor, asks him to help locate Costello's mole. Will each learn about the other?Directed by Martin Scorcese and featuring a wealth of actors working at the top of their craft, ""The Departed"" is a great film. Based on a Hong Kong movie called ""Infernal Affairs"", Scorcese and company have added moments of humor, violence, sexuality, twists and suspense creating a very different experience. The original film featured a number of long cat and mouse chase sequences which are hinted at here, but are largely forgone in favor of more character development, creating a richer, more interesting film.Any time you have a film and Mark Wahlberg is the fourth lead, taking a co-starring role, you know you are in for at least an interesting experience. This film has an incredible cast. But there have been many flops with incredible casts. The difference here is that each and every one of the leads could be in a film about their character alone and that film would be very good. But combining all four has created one of the best films of 2006.Nicholson is outstanding and back in fine form, playing the over confident, powerful, sociopath gangster Frank Costello. Costello runs the neighborhood where he grew up and when that becomes too confining for him, he moves into other areas of Boston. Ruling with an iron fist, using fear and intimidation to control, he works with a loyal crew, but he is not without his problems. Exhibiting erratic behavior (a kind understatement), Frank will kill you before he asks questions if he suspects you of informing on him. The performance is just slightly over the top, scary and menacing. There is a beautiful scene in which Costello enters a bar from a backroom to address his crew who is hanging out. His lower shirt sleeves covered in blood. He addresses Billy and his team and then yells ""Bring a mop"" and heads back to finish the business he started off-screen.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a young man with a troubled family past. Upon graduation from the academy, he is approached and asked to take on this dangerous assignment particularly because of that troubled past. DiCaprio does a great job as well. Most of the time, this type of role would be played with a poker face, nothing getting through the rough exterior of the character, but DiCaprio plays the role with more emotion, making him more human. Every time he witnesses a murder, it shocks him. If someone double crosses him, he can't figure it out and is taken aback. In other words, every emotion crosses his face. In a way, this makes sense. If I were Costello, I would want someone who was a human working for me. It would make them more vulnerable to threats, should the need arise.Later in the film, as Costigan becomes further isolated, he turns to the one woman he knows, Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) for comfort. Their relationship is passionate, but Madolyn is in a relationship with another man, so she can't fully commit to him, even though she would probably prefer to.Matt Damon plays the other Southie, Colin Sullivan. As Costello's plant, he walks a fine line throughout; he has to keep his boss happy, and keep him informed, but he also has to do his job and make sure he is never suspected. Throughout the film, Damon brings a believable sense of nervousness to the character, making him always appear on edge. Also, as Colin is promoted by his supervisor, Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), he has to hide his sense of contempt for his superiors; he can't believe how dumb they are.Damon also does a great job of turning on the charm as Colin. Setting his eye on Madolyn, a police psychologist, he flirts with her and literally charms the pants off of her. As they build a relationship, his conflict increases.These are easily two of the best performances from Damon and DiCaprio. Each has had an impressive career, but in Scorcese's hands, they show they can handle difficult, multi-faceted roles. We don't necessarily like either, but Damon is especially susceptible to our scorn. Yet, somehow we care about both. Even as we watch Damon's character doing despicable things, we have seen the influences in his life and recognize how these have shaped him.Mark Wahlberg is memorable as Dingman, the foot soldier for Sheen's Queenan. They have worked together for a long time to erase corruption in the department and to catch Costello and have a strong bond. Dingman has little time for questions and doesn't believe a lot of people. The first meeting between he and Costigan is especially memorable, as Dingman does little but swear. Even so, he gets his feelings across.Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone round out this great cast.  What more can be said of Martin Scorcese that hasn't already been said? Easily, one of the greatest filmmakers ever, he has had some missteps in his career, but overall, you can count on a Scorcese film to grab you by the throat and take you for a ride. ""The Departed"" is no exception.Just about every great director can be easily associated with one or two frequent collaborators who have helped them achieve their status. Hitchcock had Cary Grant, James Stewart and Bernard Herman. John Ford had John Wayne. Billy Wilder had his frequent screenplay collaborator I.A.L. Diamond. Scorcese has Thelma Schoonmaker, his longtime editor. This is frequently one of the best things about Scorcese's films, the editing. It always successfully helps to evoke the mood of the feeling. In ""Raging Bull"", they created a unique style for each fight. In ""The Age of Innocence"", the editing was slower, more languorous to match the tone of the film. In ""The Departed"", they create a frenzied, visceral experience, cutting back and forth between the two characters and their lives. Sometimes, we watch the two people in different worlds at the same time. Yet, Scorcese and Schoonmaker always keep us in the thick of things. Throughout, there are brief glimpses of crime scene photos, murders, etc., providing us with a brief, but memorable visual match to what the characters are talking about. These shots are so brief; we have to wonder if they actually appeared. It is almost as though the filmmakers are giving us a test, to see if we are paying attention. Showing these things for such a brief period is akin to the experience of reading a book; our mind has to fill in the details and our mind does a frighteningly good job.My one complaint is that during a montage of scenes, the last frame of each scene is held for a couple of seconds, giving the feeling of stop motion. It doesn't seem effective and draws us out of the picture. Thankfully, this is only done once. But this is a small complaint in a film this good.There has already been a lot of comparison between this film and ""Goodfellas"". I think this does this film a disservice. ""Goodfellas"" is an acknowledged classic and I don't think ""The Departed"" has had enough time to rise to that level. Yet. Perhaps, with time and upon reflection, this new Scorcese film will earn a place alongside the other. I'm not sure yet. They are very different films. ""Goodfellas"" told a story about one group. ""The Departed"" follows two separate groups working against one another. I'm pretty sure ""The Departed"" will be remembered as one of Scorcese's best, but that comes with time. No film is a true classic when it is first released. We have to wait. And see how they hold up."	5.0	Scorcese is back, Nicholson is back... I'm gushing like a little school girl	2006-10-11	3	2	1

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KJ6JAZPH382D	"Tim Brough ""author and music buff"""	"Forget what any naysayers here say. Yes, Martin Scorsese has made gangster/mob movies before, and yes ""The Departed"" does ride the coattails of ""GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)"" and ""Casino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition)."" But you are - just as you did in those classics - getting to see a Director in his element as he guides an excellent cast through some of their best work.The three principles here, DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson, all give committed performances, and this may be DiCaprio's finest film. Even Mark Wahlberg comes off looking like he is an actor. The smaller roles punch through (Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, who has the best lines) to make everyone in the cast come across convincingly. While the film has serious continuity errors for those of you that like to pick for that stuff, the pace is so rapid-fire that I only noticed a few while watching. What you will notice, though, is how Scorsese manipulates the gore and the corruption to the point that it creeps into every frame of the film as ""The Departed"" charges forward. (You got problems with splatter or the F-Bomb? Leave this one on the shelf.)That is a lot to say about an almost three hour movie. The twists start flying so thick at the end that you may have to back track through the DVD to make the connections. There is plenty of suspense to be had in ""The Departed,"" and it was worth Scorsese's finally nabbing that Oscar."	5.0	Departed Delivers	2007-06-04	6	4	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3P1A63Q8L32C5	T. Lobascio	"Having watched Martin Scorsese's Oscar winning film The Departed twice now, I am  ready to offer up my opinion of the film.The Plot: Set in South Boston, this crime drama centers around the state police force, and its all out war on organized crime.Young and somewhat troubled undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy is quickly gaining Costello's favor, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a hardened young criminal who has found way into the police department as an informer for the syndicate--Quickly rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit.Each man finds himself deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of operations he is made privy. But when it becomes clear to both the gangsters and the police that there lurks a mole, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy -- and each of the two men must now race to uncover the identity of the other, in time to save himself.My Take: Based on the 2002 Japanese film, Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs), The Departed has all of the ingredients that one would expect from a Scorsese film in the mob genre. Of course, William Monahan's script gives the director plenty to work with...Does it rise to the level of perfection that is, a Goodfellas, (1990) Taxi Driver (1976) Raging Bull (1980) or Cape Fear (1991) ? The answer to that question is that the movie ultimately lands just behind all of those classics I mentioned in the great one's filmography--but miles and miles ahead of the worst, just the same.Three things that really nudged at me about the flick-- taking away from an otherwise flawless film...--There's a point in the film where DiCaprio and Damon's characters engage in a game of cat and mouse as they try to expose each other without getting taken out...Under normal circumstances, this sequence would have been the centerpiece, made memorable through its staging and editing. I don't know what happened here, but this scene yielded, little tension or surprise. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker usually knows how to make this work but the pacing seemed off somehow. You can't have a great set-up and then blow it a crucial time in the story. I felt like I was watching a re-run of a 70's era TV cop show. I can't believe I just typed that about a Scorsese picture--Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, the woman who comes between Billy and Colin, shares little chemistry with either Damon or DiCaprio. As pretty much the only female in the ""men's room""...She should have sparks with someone.--The Bostonian accents--Some cast members sounded really bad...and and that was really distracting. Damon, who's originally from Boston, is perhaps the worst offender. Leo fares much much better with his accent. I find it ironic though, that DiCaprio gets Oscar attention for Blood Diamond but not for The Departed--When by all account--his performance in the mob pic is better then that of BD-I digress...The film succeeds though thanks to everything else. Yes, Jack Nicholson is playing a character he's done a thousand times before, but gosh darn it it works here. Also doing yeoman's work is Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and of course, Mark Wahlberg. And the ending is just spectacular...The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD offers up some great extras, even though not a whole lot of the stuff, actually focuses on the film.A 21-minute featurette titled ""Stranger Than Fiction"" about Whitey Bulger, the legendary South Boston mobster on whom the film's Frank Costello was loosely based is first up. Bulger's tale is told by various folks in the know. According to this featurette, Bulger has been on the lam since 1995 and is number two on the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted List. Interesting real-life drama.The best bonus material in the DVD set is ""Scorsese on Scorsese,"" an hour-and-a-half documentary made for Turner Classic Movies by Richard Schickel . Scorsese talks about his life and work. Taking us through his earliest days through 2004's The Aviator ending with that TV commercial he appeared in for American Express .A 24-minute featurette ""Crossing Criminal Cultures"" takes a look at the how the gangster film has evolved over the decades--with Scorsese at its center.There is a collection of nine deleted/extended scenes--complete with intros from the director. Some of these scenes are quite good, but were rightfully omitted, for time and pace.The theatrical trailer tops off the set.Overall: I may have had some unexpected issues with The Departed, but none of them bothered me enough to be really critical. This is a must see movie for sure...Definitely buy or rent, depending on how much you like Scorsese"	4.0	When Facing  A Loaded Gun	2007-03-04	6	4	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"Cursed are those unfortunate souls who decide to experience the original version of something before experiencing the remake, be it an adaptation of a novel or, in the case of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED, a remake of a previous masterpiece.  That masterpiece was 2002's MOU GAAN DOU, or INFERNAL AFFAIRS, directed by Lau Wai Keung and Mak Siu Fai.  The premise of the two films is the same, but the styles of the respective films are vastly different.  I am one of the unfortunate souls who watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS long before THE DEPARTED came about; naturally I could not avoid constantly comparing between the two, which gives me a rather biased opinion.  However, as a lone film rather than a remake of INFERNAL AFFAIRS, THE DEPARTED is truly stellar, and probably Scorsese's best effort since his masterwork, GOODFELLAS.The plot is delicious: in the slums of Boston, one cop (Matt Damon) is a mole within the police force, working for criminal ""rock star"" Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), while another (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a mole within Costello's gang of thugs, working for the police force.  Their objectives, however are the same: find the mole and smoke him out.  Damon's character has high aspirations, and a very successful relationship with a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga).  DiCaprio's character is gradually drawn deeper and deeper into the blackness of the criminal underworld, and begins to fear that he can never return.  His is the character the audience really sympathizes with, the character who fights to do what's right no matter what, but who seemingly cannot win.  After all, when you lead a double life so convoluted, how do you decide which side is the reality and which side is the facade?As THE DEPARTED is a Martin Scorsese picture, it should go without saying that the acting is great, but it goes beyond that: it's exquisite.  Matt Damon, in his first role as a villain, is supremely sleazy, more and more so as he becomes increasingly corrupt.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a far more attractive role in a far more attractive fashion, that of a tormented man with nothing to lose who has no choice but to continue fighting the good fight until his end.  DiCaprio, who could easily have been dismissed as just another pretty face when he first appeared in the late 90s, has come a long way since, exercising his dramatic chops over the years until finally peaking with his marvelously sympathetic performance in THE DEPARTED.  Aging Martin Sheen, surprisingly tough Alan Baldwin, and impressively rude Mark Wahlberg head up a fine supporting cast.  The star who shines the brightest, though, is no surprise.  Jack Nicholson's performance is a career highlight, ranking alongside his knockout performances in classics like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and THE SHINING.  Nicholson burns with intensity, and his performance is the very definition of ""devilish"" (there is a sumptuous scene in which Nicholson's character attends an opera, during which the lighting bathes him in a hellish shade of red, and in which he could easily be mistaken for Satan himself).Martin Scorsese is as much of a star as any of those on-screen.  He's at his finest in this film, using some new techniques while producing some moments that are pure Scorsese (namely a few sudden outbursts of violence a la GOODFELLAS or CASINO, and a breathtaking scene in which a character is thrown to his death from a rooftop).  Through the picture, Scorsese uses swirling camera angles and randomly increases the volume of certain things, such as background voices or songs, only to cease those sounds abruptly and cut to something new.  This rapidfire, nauseous editing style adds a certain surreality to the film that brings to mind shady old crime classics starring Humphrey Bogart, like THE MALTESE FALCON or THE BIG SLEEP, or even DARK PASSAGE.Toss in a great soundtrack (including a delightful theme by the Boston-based heavy punk group Dropkick Murphys and songs by The Rolling Stones and Roger Waters) and a screenplay by William Monahan that recalls Greek tragedy and includes dialogue destined to become classic, and you have one hell of a film.  THE DEPARTED is a masterpiece of filmmaking, and a whopping achievement for Scorsese, as well as his best picture since GOODFELLAS way back in '90.  The question of superiority between THE DEPARTED and INFERNAL AFFAIRS is easily solved: THE DEPARTED is, hands down, the better film.  Still, it doesn't quite have the kick that China's INFERNAL AFFAIRS had, and the ending of America's DEPARTED adds considerably more closure than that of AFFAIRS.  Yet although justice is, more or less, served at THE DEPARTED's end, it still ends on a relatively sour note.  For the moviegoer, however, that's cause for joy, because as Martin Scorsese has proved again and again, those films without happy endings are often the finest."	5.0	Infernal affairs	2007-03-02	9	5	4

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2UNMXBJSVIXFB	Tony Khamvongsouk	"Movie - 4.5Gangster movies were not something I watched a lot of, at least as a kid. All the grit, violence, drama, complexities, etc. were way over my head. But in growing up, I came to acquire a taste for these things and eventually learned to like them a lot. I still haven't seen any of the Godfather movies, but I've recently been catching up on Scorsese. And in being one of the few that's actually seen and can appreciate Infernal Affairs (the original inspiration for The Departed), I have to say I was pretty excited after initially hearing Scorsese was attached to direct this Western adaption. When I first saw The Departed on DVD some years ago, I'd never seen a whole Scorsese film in any kind of entirety, but I knew his films by name and heard he was a great director. After finally watching his most renowned work in Goodfellas, I could see why he earned such praise. With that said, upon this subsequent viewing of the The Departed I definitely like it a lot more than I did initially. It's the story of two moles: a gangster in the police and a cop in the mob. The two work their opposing bosses into trusting them, but the bosses are on to the fact that there is, indeed, an enemy mole within their own outfits. Violence, deception, drama, and thrills ensue as each mole gets closer to finding the other. In terms of comparison, I'd have to say Infernal Affairs makes for a more entertaining and fast-paced story with its kinetic score and attention to subtlety in both narrative and characters for the viewer to fill in on their own (along with 50 minutes less in running time). On the other hand, Scorsese does a wonderful job in making his version more of a character drama with the elements of the aforementioned on the side and set on the mean streets of South Boston that works very well, though tends to feel a bit cumbersome and underwhelming at times (like the love triangle, the lack of empathy for Nicholson's character compared to his Chinese counterpart, or the overuse of record label songs as opposed to an actual score). However, the film more than makes up for these shortcomings through a wonderful script and some excellent performances with an A-list cast, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, and a very foul-mouthed (though funny to listen to) Mark Wahlberg. Both are excellent movies in their own right that should cater to either side of the spectrum depending your preference for flash and execution vs. grit and progression, though I'd personally lean a little more towards the original just because it doesn't feel as tedious in certain aspects.Video - 4.5For being one of the flagship BDs from Warner Brothers' early days into HD home video, the video quality actually looks pretty good. Compared to other flagship titles released from around the same time, in which some of them do or don't still hold up to today's standards, The Departed presents itself very well. The first thing that caught my eye during Nicholson's little prologue speech were the black levels and shadow delineation. As you see his silhouette walking through with a white background behind him, it instantly set the tone for me and made for some lovely foreshadowing to the film's narrative about the deceit, secrets, and hiding to occur throughout. Colors aren't very bold, and are even a bit drab, but still manage to put some real-world depth into the picture making the audience know full well that the grit and dirtiness are there. Blues, grays, and blacks tend to stick out the most in the form of police uniforms, gangster attire, and various low-lit settings, while red tends to show themselves a bit more towards the end when people start getting off'd. Contrast is also excellent and helps to accentuate some very fine textures and facial features from the creases in shirts and lining in suits to the stubble of unshaven mob goons and the wrinkles under their eyes. Overall image detail has a great deal of clarity and sharpness with near-reference quality outside of some artifacts and debris that pop up on occasion and the every-so-often instance of overly red skin tones. But all things considered, audiences should be pleased with the picture quality and that it didn't end up as badly botched as say.. Batman Begins or V for Vendetta was.Audio - 4.5Using that memory-eater of a codec in Uncompressed PCM , The Departed outputs at a constant bitrate of 4.6Mbps and sounds just as excellent as one could hope. The movie starts off silent and fades into Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter at a very adequate volume that gives the film some ambiance, but never overpowers Nicholson's opening speech. Dialogue throughout remains clear and discernible from the center channel, and I was very.. amused at how well I could understand those Bostonian accents (still had to turn the subtitles on, just to be safe). Directionality is a bit sparse, but does take advantage of the clarity of lossless audio by giving off some very fine subtleties in sound effects like the opening and closing of doors, the churning of cars plodding down the street, the ringing of telephones across the room, and the approaching footsteps of people off screen. Music varies between a lot of cuts of Gimme Shelter and Dropkick Murphys' I'm Shipping Up to Boston and a little bit of score from Howard Shore here and there. For the most part, it's a fairly music-less sound scape with the dialogue doing most of the work, though gunshots and fist fights make themselves known when need be. Separation is handled perfectly between all of these elements with a lot of the music staying in the front and guns and punches panning between the fronts and rears, most notably during a raid scene towards the end. The only downside to this audio presentation is the lack of any potent LFEs, which obviously don't have very many moments to shine aside from some bass in the music, but it's still a fine movie without them.Extras - 3.5With just over 45 minutes of special features, there are two of them presented: one talking about infamous Southie gangster Whitey Bulger (whom Nicholson's character is based on), and another featurette talking about Scorsese's history in film as well as his previous experiences in the gangster genre. The Whitey Bulger segment adds an intriguing sense of realism. There are various interviews with news correspondents, former law enforcement officials, and even former mob men that talk about the scope and influence of Bulger, the power he possessed for almost 30 years, and a little bit of the of stigma a person like him carried around. I'm still a bit new to the gangster genre myself and found this to be a pretty cool piece of information. It wasn't overly factual, but still managed to tell me enough that I could relate it to the movie and give it a more objective view. The Scorsese ""portfolio"" segment was a very great watch. Like I said, I'm just now getting into him as a director and it fascinates me to learn about his history growing up, the kinds of films he made, and a lot of the similarities and influences those works share with one another. I see him as being quite charismatic, and I'm a bit disappointed they didn't include a commentary of some sort for the movie itself. Then finally, there are also deleted scenes in SD with introductions for each one. All in all, there aren't a lot of specials in terms of quantity, but I personally enjoyed them for the outright quality.Overall - 4.5The Departed is a fine adaptation of Infernal Affairs that really works for western audiences. It's not as flashy or well-executed in terms of screenplay, but it makes up for those losses in gritty atmosphere and more fleshed-out characters. And who better to portray this than a man who's certainly becoming one of my favorite directors in Martin Scorsese. I was shocked that he never won an Oscar prior to this film, but I'm glad to see he got his just due at some point. If you like cop/gangster thrillers, this would probably be near the top of my recommendations (though I would also say you try Infernal Affairs if you don't mind subtitles). With excellent video and audio specs and a good amount of informative extras, The Departed comes highly recommended."	5.0	The Departed (Blu-ray)	2010-09-07	7	5	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A220FJEQNGMSRN	Trevor Willsmer	"First time round I found The Departed a disappointingly average film, but on a second viewing it's clear I misjudged it: it really is a quite bad one. Scorsese's weaknesses as a storyteller have often been discussed, but he's not helped here by a remarkably poor and horrendously overpopulated script from the usually much more interesting William Monahan that at once dumbs down the original Infernal Affairs and simultaneously overcomplicates the storytelling. For all the additional characters and running time there's no grander design at work here to compensate. It may strain for grand opera but it simply comes across as off-key light operetta sung by people with sore throats.The chief problem is the film's funereal pacing, which the clumsy editing and energetic camerawork increasingly fail to hide. The film takes forever to set up its plot - the film is half over before Matt Damon's undercover mobster who has worked his way into a Boston police task force is ordered to find himself - but never compensates by fleshing out the characters or adding any substance to the story. If anything, underneath all the bloat and bombast the film has seriously dumbed down the Infernal Affairs trilogy's underlying themes of identity, role playing and the need to find some kind of redemption in a world that requires you to be corrupt in order to live with yourself in some kind of peace. Instead, it's become a star vehicle in the worst sense of the phrase, where the central duo of police mole in the underworld and underworld mole in the police are effectively sidelined for so much of the picture that they almost become bit players.Yet while we get seemingly endless and often incredibly long scenes of Jack Nicholson grandstanding, doing rat impersonations, waving sex toys around, insulting priests and generally impersonating Long John Silver as the cardboard mob moss, they really tell us nothing about either the character or the story. For all the constant repetition of his catchphrase ""The point is,"" there simply is no point to most of these scenes other than padding out a minor supporting character (who in the original had no particular personal relationship with either main character) enough to attract an A-list actor and in the process unbalancing the film so much that he actually becomes the leading role. Scorsese has always shown a tendency to relentlessly hammer home the same point over and over again at great length despite making it perfectly well early in the film, and too many of Nicholson's scenes seem to be like hearing exactly the same joke very slightly paraphrased over and over and over again.Unfortunately the problem isn't limited to Nicholson's resolutely unmenacing cartoonish villain. While both Leonardo DiCaprio and Damon (looking so much like James MacArthur that at times you keep on expecting Jack Lord to turn up and say ""Book him, Dano"") give stronger performances than their poorly written characters deserve, too many of the supporting roles have been beefed up or created purely to add more star power. There's no narrative reason for Ray Winstone or Mark Wahlberg's clich&eacute;d characters (do Nicholson and Martin Sheen's undercover chief really need sidekicks, especially when Wahlberg's mere presence makes the last act isolation of DiCaprio utterly nonsensical?), while characters like Alec Baldwin's Steve McGarrett figure just leave the film feeling horribly overpopulated with too many people competing for screentime at the expense of the story and what should have been the central duo's dilemma. Not that there's much dilemma left. DiCaprio's undercover cop fares best, but Damon's undercover crook is much less interesting than Andy Lau's equivalent in the original - no longer torn between playing a good cop and genuinely wanting to change and become the good person he pretends to be, he's reduced to a rather bland half-dimensional stereotype while the contrived and underdeveloped romantic triangle is straight out of 30s melodrama, not helped by Vera Farmiga's tendency to change her expression every syllable in what increasingly looks like an impersonation of Corinne Bohrer. With characters this thin it's hard to get involved in the film as more than a disinterested observer and consequently there's not even any tension to any of the setpieces - the surveillance operation that goes wrong tipping both sides off to the moles in their ranks, the failed attempt by one mole to identify another at the cinema or a warehouse shootout all fall surprisingly flat even as exercises in technique.All this would be forgivable if the film was more interesting or even sporadically exciting, but sadly it's a very dull and drawn out affair that never justifies two-and-a-half hours of screen time. The original was a tight 100-minute thriller with a great pulp premise elevated by good writing and fine performances by two directors with barely a fraction of Scorsese's talent. There's absolutely no reason that it shouldn't have been the basis for a terrific American remake that could even have improved on the original, but sadly this is a case of far too much talent for the film's own good. Distinctly Mediocrefellas.Aside from the Scorsese on Scorsese documentary, extras are surprisingly light for a two disc set - some deleted scenes, a couple of short featurettes and a trailer."	2.0	Mediocrefellas	2008-04-28	4	2	2

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	"Not having seen some of other critically-acclaimed films of 2006 yet, I am not sure whether Martin Scorsese' Oscar-winning ""The Departed"" really better than they are, but it is safe to say that ""The Departed,"" good as it is, is not Scorsese' best. His Oscar would be one of the numerous cases of `better late than nothing,' and it is true that Academy should have awarded him one (or more) Best Director award much earlier.Having said that, I must say I found myself drawn to the violent world of ""The Departed."" The remake of Hong Kong noir ""Infernal Affairs"" has many plot contrivances like its original (which I won't repeat here), and the film requires suspension of disbelief at times. Foul-mouthed detective Mark Wahlberg is convincing, but some say Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy, touch undercover cop is miscast, and Jack Nicholson's portrait of gangster Costello sometimes becomes caricature. Yes, I know these things.But what attracted me most is not the acting of the cast - don't get me wrong here because I think they are all good - it worked for me because of its grim and dark shadow hanging over the doomed characters. From the first sequences in which Costello talks to a little boy Colin in South Boston to work for him, we can smell death with the Rolling Stone song ""Gimme Shelter,"" grainy footages of the 70s and Nicholson's sneering voiceover. The boy's fate is sealed as he becomes a police officer who is actually a mole.From then on, the story of ""The Departed"" goes on with twists and turns. The pace is not fast, taking time to explore the theme represented by a phrase the faithful departed. Billy and Colin are both haunted and tormented by their father figures they are strongly conscious of - Billy by his dead father and Colin by profane Costello. They both seek solace in the same woman while sticking to their faith. In fact everyone in the film stick to their faith and belief whatever it is, and get what they get.Perhaps you don't like the occasional bloody violence or the slow pace of the film (it runs 150 minutes) and I think the film overlong, too. You cannot actions here for obviously Scorsese is not interested in shoot-outs which another director like Michael Mann would have taken more time to describe. Some may say Scorsese remake pales compared to Hong Kong original. I found the change to the ending is unnecessary, and remembered Andy Law, original's star's interview with Japanese press in which he said that he found (or regretted) the remake does not have the Buddhism philosophy of ""Infernal Affairs."" He is right and Scorsese knows it, infusing another theme instead, with frequent reference to the themes of faith and betrayal in the characters with hazy morality in ""The Departed,"" the themes to which I couldn't help being attracted."	4.0	Grim and Dark Gangstar Film; Very Good Though Violent and Not Scorsese's Best	2007-03-08	6	3	3

I had spoken to about 20-35 different people who had seen this movie in the theaters and not once did I hear a single negative word towards it. The cast couldn't get any better, this is the best cast Scorcesse put together since Goodfellas. Matt Damon Boston native extrodiare and Leo DiCaprio put on probably their best performances of their careers and each were in two very well put together movies on their own this same year. I was shocked that neither got a nomination for best actor for this movie. Eventhough DiCaprio got a nomination for Blood Diamond it was a stll a shock. The great Jack never lets you down with his intimidating on screen presence and his signature wit and classic quotables. Probably the best performace in this movie was Mark Walberg. He was a power house and really knew how to do that Bostonian accent to a tee.All and all if you are a fan of great mob movies its your movie. If you are into big casts its your movie.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2M75Q5OAOHAWR	Victor Lauterbach	Great work from director Scorsese with standout performances by DeCaprio (Billy) and Damon (Colin Sullivan). Nicholson drives the film with sadistic glee as the arch villain (Costello), but it's the numerous lesser evils that pile up around his character that give this story its intensity. The supporting cast is every bit as good as the leads, notably Sheen (Qeenan) and Farmiga (Dalton). The only weakness, and it's minor, is the twist ending that's too neat and changes Wahlberg's character (Dignam) too suddenly. In summary: a fine script with performances to match. CAUTION: Unlike some rather mild R-rated films, this one is definitely inappropriate for children.	4.0	Visceral Crime Drama	2014-01-14	0	0	0

Di caprio and Nicholson performances were flawless, I don't like Matt Damon that much, because the only role that fits him is Bourne,he is so inexpressive that kinda get boring after a while.I would give the movie 5 starts but we watched in a group of 10 people, and only 4 of them were delighted, the rest was like 'Its OK'The HDDVD version is beautiful but there's ot much in the FX department to really tak advantage of the HD goodies.Its a worth buying Mafia film!!	5.0	Great Movie!!!	2007-03-24	3	0	3

Great action, great dialouge, great characters, great music.. etc. Yesterday I read three reviews in a row on here that basically said Scorsese should hang it up and called this movie an abundance of negatives.... I think someone should order them a cranberry juice (thats an inside joke if you seen the movie)... today I read three that claim it's better than Goodfellas.The movie was pissah'... comin' straight from a boston bred, I of course ate up every second. I can't say its Scorseses best, but I did fight the hordes of consumah's at Newbury's to buy a copy last Tuesday. Obviously the movie won't win any academy awards, because Scorsese always gets the shaft (remember when Chicago beat out Gangs Of New York...ugggh!) but Scorsese movies ain't made for the academy. Martin Scorsese makes bad ace movies for people who like bad ACE movies. If you like movies that f****in rule, this one is for you... unless you have your period, then maybe you should go order yourself a cranberry juice.Real quick footnote... top notccchhh job on the boston accents. Matt Damon and Mah-ky Mah-k obviously have it in their blood, but Martin Sheen, Leo Dicaprio, and Jack Nicholson really must have worked at perfectin' the speech. Alec Baldwin sort of recycled his Rhode Island accent from back when he did Outside Providence, but he still had the Boston attitude down pretty good. Thumbs up!	5.0	WHY?

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KXV8AFQ550DY	Wayne C. Rogers	"The Departed is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and deserves all the accolades that it has received since last fall.  It's certainly Martin Scorsese's best film since Casino.  This movie also does for the Irish mob what Goodfellas and Casino did for the Italian Mafia.  It gives the viewer a close look at the horrible violence, gut-wrenching fear, and unexpected betrayal that comes to anyone involved in this type of business for any length of time.The Departed deals with Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson and based somewhat loosely on the real James ""Whitey"" Bulger) who is the head kingpin of the South Boston criminal underworld.  He's smart, charming, and utterly ruthless in how he conducts business.  You never screw around with Costello because he'll kill you in a heartbeat.  Planning ahead for the future, Costello begins grooming a young Colin Sullivan (the older Colin is played by Matt Damon) for a life of crime and to eventually enter the Boston Police Academy so that he'll have a mole inside the police department.  Once Colin makes the grade, Costello helps him to achieve career-making arrests and to advance up the ladder inside the department.  While this is happening, Billy Costigan (played by the underrated Leonardo DiCaprio) strives to rise above his Boston heritage and to make it into the Massachusetts State Police.  Two higher-ups in the state police (played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) see Billy's potential and offer him the opportunity to go undercover and to hopefully infiltrate Costello's criminal network.  To achieve this, Billy is expelled from the State Police Academy under false charges of assault and sent to jail for several months.  When he finally gets out, Billy starts selling drugs on the street with his cousin and quickly comes to the attention of Costello.  Costello remembers Billy as a boy and admired his straightforward father.  This leads to a job offer from Costello, enabling Billy to get his foot inside the door.  From this point on the movie is basically about Billy and Colin doing their jobs as a mole and trying not to get caught.  It won't be long, however, before the two young men realize that both the Mob and the police have come to the conclusion that there's a rat inside their organization.  Both Colin and Billy then play a cat-and-mouth game as they each seek to discover the identity of the other.  The hunt for the mole's identity is intense.  This is the heart of the story and what keeps you glued to the edge of your seat.  You never know what's going to happen next.  And, no matter how you think the movie is going to end, you'll be wrong.  In fact, I was totally blown away by what happened as each twist caught me by surprise, leaving me completely unprepared for the next one.  I was finally left sitting on the couch with my mouth hanging open at the final scene.  Few movies have the audacity to end in such a violent mode.  Only someone like Scorsese could actually pull it off and not lose the audience in the process.The Departed is a tight, fast-paced, character-driven film about the life of crime, betrayal, and the emotional drain it has on everyone involved.  No one is left unscathed.  The performances by all the main actors are superb and deserving of an Academy Award, especially Leonardo DiCaprio.  He captures the emotional turmoil and fear that can literally overwhelm an undercover agent, who teeters on the edge life and death each and everyday.  Martin Scorsese once again proves that when it comes to crime drama, he's one of the top directors working in the business today.  This man finally deserves to win his Oscar for Best Director.  If he doesn't get it for this film, then there's someone very wrong with the Academy of voters for The Departed is one powerful, violent movie that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled.  One last comment that deals with the Irish music that was played at different times during the film.  Whenever I heard it, I kept expecting to see Michael Flattery from Lord of the Dance appear, doing his version of the Irish folk dance.  I know that it made me want to get up and dance, which I don't think was its intended purpose.  Finally, the two-disc Special Edition is the one to buy.  The second disc is loaded with extras: a 25-minute featurette on the Real Boston Mob, a 90-minute documentary with Martin Scorsese discussing his life and his most famous films, another 25-minute featurette on how New York City's Little Italy affected Scorsese and his work in the film industry, and a look at several scenes that were deleted from the movie.  The Departed is so good that I'm going to watch it again in just a few minutes.  Usually I like to wait a couple of weeks before seeing a movie for the second time.  Not this one!  Highly recommended!!!Congratulations to Marty Scorsese for winning Best Director for The Departed!!!!"	5.0	A powerful, gut-wrenching, violent movie about the Irish mob!	2007-02-17	5	3	2
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"It's a tricky business adapting a foreign movie for an American audience. Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" captures all the best elements of the original film ""Infernal Affairs"" and works traditional Scorsese themes and material into the film making it very much his own and every bit the equal to the Chinese film. Featuring outstanding performances all around perhaps this film will finally earn Scorsese the Oscar for Best Director that he deserved for ""Raging Bull"" over twenty years ago.Two state trooper academy graduates one an undercover officer named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a mole in the department Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) working for crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson)have opposite goals. Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) charge Costigan with gathering as much dirt as possible on Sullivan so they can finally take him out. They work up a false history for Costigan which includes a brief stint in prison to create credibility. By comparison Sullivan is a boy scout who rises to the top of his department rapidly working for Ellerby (Alec Baldwin)in a rival department. Both are charged with ferriting out the mole in their respective organizations and both are romancing the same woman (Vera Farmiga) without ever meeting.It's a brilliantly constructed game of cat and mouse with each playing the respective role at one point in time. Filled with brilliant visuals that echo the themes of the script adapted by William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"")from the script by Siu Fai Mak and Felix Chong the film manages to stay true to the elements that worked best in the Chinese film while incorporating elements unique to ""The Departed"". DiCaprio and Damon give complex, compelling performances as opposite sides of the same coin. Nicholson plays Costello with psychopathic intensity at times without going too far over the top. The entire cast gives stellar performances but I'd like to note tree actors in particularly who do the most with their limited roles--Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen (who replaced two other actors that had to drop out--Robert DeNiro and Gerard McSorley)and Mark Whalberg all three give intense performances and inhabit their characters fully. Vera Farmiga handles her role of Madolyn equalling the big boys despite the fact that her character isn't given as much screen time by comparison. Special note should also be made of actor Ray Winstone (""The Proposition"", ""King Arthur"" and ""Cold Mountain"") who gives a nice edgy performance as Mr. French.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes. Scorsese uses every minute to allow the actors to build their characters or for brilliant set pieces. The film does sag a bit towards the middle but that's partially due to its complex set up for the story during the first twenty minutes of the film."	5.0	"Brilliant remake of ""Infernal Affairs"""	2006-10-13	83	75	8

This movie tries too hard to be like other movies.  From the beginning long shot with Nicholson voice-over to the Joker-esque facial musings, Matt Damon sounding like he just stepped off the Good Will Hunting set, it was just kind of sad.  There's some spirited acting but that didn't help the story.  There was nothing scary or disturbing about this picture.

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AHTEDRC5XLKK0	"WebViking ""WebViking"""	"I Like Martin Scorcese as well as anyone, but The Departed is far from his best.  This movie had the potential to be really promising, a great premise, an awesome cast, and a fantastic director, but none of it lived up to it's potential.  Please be warned, though, I can't talk about why this movie is as bad as it is without talking about it's end.  I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but some people may feel the way I describe the ending as a spoiler, so if you don't want to risk reading that, don't go any further.The premise is that two kids grow up in Boston and go to the Police Academy.  One of them, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon is befriended at a young age by arch mobster Frank Costello, played Jack Nicholson.  He ends up as Costello's mole in the Police Department, eventually being assigned to the Special Investigation Unit whose main goal is to bring Frank Costello down.  The other kid, William Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio is pulled out of the Police Academy and sent to jail with the purpose of going deep undercover to eventually get close to Costello and gather enough information to bust him.  So Costello's mob and the police both have a mole in each other's operation and, in a way, it becomes both mole's jobs to find themselves or each other, or something like that.Great premise, but except for the very interesting and perhaps even ground breaking use of cell phones in making a thriller, the execution was sadly lacking.  Yes, the first part of the movie covers a lot of ground, and it has to.  But it was still more confusing than it needed to be.  While I enjoyed Decaprio and Damon's performance's, except for the South Boston accents that faded in and out depending on how hard they were concentrating, Nicholson's performance was just too extreme.  Someone seriously needed to slap him and remind him that he wasn't playing the Joker in Batman anymore.  The rest of the cast was pretty good though.Even the soundtrack in this movie was annoying, weird Spanish music when the Joker, er, Jack, er Frank Costello came on screen, and a cover band's version of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb.""  I don't understand that at all, if you can't get the rights to the original, don't put it in the movie, find something else.  Don't hire a cover band to do the song, at least not a song that well known.  And the Spanish music that came on for the entire first half of the movie whenever Nicholson was on screen.  What's up with that?  I also thought this was an Irish mob, isn't Costello an Italian name, or is the music implying he's Spanish, maybe with a hint of Creole.  Who knows?As bad as this movie was, it was still watchable, until the ending.  This has to be the worst ending of any movie I've ever seen.  The envelope Costigan leaves with the police psychiatrist is never mentioned.  A lawyer you've never heard about supposedly appears from nowhere and hands Costigan a bunch of tapes Costello made incriminating Sullivan.  Another mob mole on the Police Department that you never saw before shows up out of the blue and kills one of the main characters you've just spent the last two hours sympathizing with.  And finally a last mobster kills off another main character, who, get this, really wants to die.  It's almost as if they got to the 2 hour and 15 minutes mark and decided, oops, we got 15 minutes to tie up this film, let's just kill everyone.  It's ridiculous, and totally pointless.  I was enjoying the movie for the most part until the end.  After the ending, I really wished I hadn't wasted my time."	2.0	A Complete Dead End	2007-02-15	34	11	23
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2W7GQG04QCEVT	Wendell	"This film grew on me as I watched it over a couple of evenings. The first half seemed just fine, but didn't seem that different than fairly good HBO dramas - like the Sopranos or the Wire. It's competently acted and filmed, but there wasn't a whole lot of personality to the filmic language. In a way, it didn't feel like it was an obvious Scorsese film.The second half engaged me a lot more, though. Seeing the threads of the characters' fates pulled together was compelling in a ""can't look away from a car wreck"" sort of way. I did like how Matt Damon was the amoral center of the whole thing - kinda like the character he played in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Leonardo is solid, and Nicholson is hard to resist. I could see how people would be disappointed with the ending. If you start asking Why? Why this story? Why should we care? What is it teaching or exploring?... Well, maybe it's better not to ask. Just watch the competent filmmaking, the action, the bullets flying and don't ask for too much more.The contrast between this and such distinct and unusual films as Mean Streets and Raging Bull and Taxi Driver is huge. Back then Scorcese couldn't get the Academy Awards that he deserved - maybe because he was so unique and so Italian. Now, when he's more mainstream - and when his actors are the cream of the Anglo-Irish crop - he gets the recognition. Doesn't seem quite right, but so be it. Scorcese's legacy won't be pegged to this film, but at least he has the Academy Award on his resume now. That's what we'll remember in the future as we watch his classic films."	4.0	It grew on me.	2007-03-03	6	3	3

It was.Scorsese was never an ""in your face"" director, but in ""The Departed"" he reaches a new level of disappearing altogether. (That's a compliment.) This film has ""style"", but one is not consciously aware of it. As with many great artists (think Fred Astaire or Miles Davis), Scorsese's work gets simpler as he matures. And ""The Departed"" is perhaps the most brilliantly edited film I've seen, its layered complexity complementing the acting and direction's simplicity. Thelma Schoonmaker richly deserved her Oscar.The most-controversial element of ""The Departed"" is Jack Nicholson's performance, which, good though it is, seems rather more ""emphatic"" (shall we say) than the other performances.Watching ""Five Easy Pieces"" on a flight more than thirty years ago, I heard two passengers arguing whether Jack Nicholson was a great actor, or simply ""playing himself"". My feeling is that he's a very good actor, but not in the top rank, because he seems incapable of disappearing into a role. We're always aware we're watching ""Jack"" -- not the character he's playing, however well-rendered. * Compare his work with Robert Duvall's or John Hurt's (see my review of ""The Proposition""), and the gulf is plain.Perhaps the fairest judgement of Nicholson's performance in ""The Departed"" is that it's neither good nor bad -- it's simply the sort of performance Scorsese wanted, and he cast Nicholson to get it.""The Departed"" is one of Scorsese's best films, but I wouldn't rank it above ""GoodFellas"" or ""King of Comedy"". If you're in the mood for a double feature, the last scene makes a great seque into ""Ratatouille"". Really.* His worst performance is arguably in ""Prizzi's Honor"".

B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1ACZLAKFO6H4Y	Will Pearce	The Departed is a consistently engaging crime thriller from director Martin Scorsese. It's also the Scorsese film that I've been waiting for since Goodfellas, and I'm sure others feel the same way too. This film is a remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, however this review will make no comparisons to that movie. Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play two moles. Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a rookie cop who goes deep undercover to take down mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the man working for the state police as Costello's mole. The film also features Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career and nobody can play the sinister bad guy like Jack Nicholson.Martin Scorsese is the master of the crime drama, as he as proved time and time again. His previous two films (not counting the Bob Dylan documentary Nor Direction Home) The Aviator and Gangs of New York had their merits, but they were missing something that the classic Scorsese films contained. Aviator was an interesting bio pic. while Gangs was defined by an Oscar worthy performance from Daniel Day Lewis. The Departed however is a return to form. Its main strength lies in the story telling, Throughout the film and especially in relation to the Damon and Dicaprio characters. You don't exactly know who's good or who's bad. It constantly keeps you guessing as any great Drama should.	4.0	A long awaited return to form	2008-08-20	2	1	1

Its been quite a few years since a great mob movie has come out, and this one is up their, likely to fall with the classics some day.  Although the film is 2 1/2 hours long, I found that it flowed well and the plot kept me interested.  I must say, I didn't see this ending coming, really well diguised until it happens. I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to see how the film arived at the circle ending it did, and some of the hints are subtle.  Essentially in the end, it goes to show, don't trust anybody when it comes to organized crime...they would sell their grandma's out of house and home if it would save their own hides.  A great role for Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Decaprio was actually good in this film, and I agree with the Oscar nomination for this one, although blood diamond was decent as well. Even Matt Damon fit in well.  So check this one out, I think if you like movies like Reservoir Dogs, this one will rank up their.	4.0	"""Don't laugh, this ain't reality TV"""	2007-02-13	6	4	2

He covers familiar ground with this film, and its been done with greater effect in movies like Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The performances are quite good, especially DiCaprio, who tackles a ""tough guy"" role for once. Nicholson, however, is over-the-top in several scenes and is channeling Jack Torrance from The Shining. I just don't buy his Whitey Bulger-type character in this film. Damon is quite good, as is Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. But none of these roles are anything new in a Scorsese film, and I couldn't help but think I've seen this all before. In addition, the romance angle between Damon/Farmiga/DiCaprio seemed quite contrived and not very believable. I found her performance to be quite weak, considering it was the only role in the film for a female. The film certainly keeps your attention for 2 hours or so, and there are some shocking scenes of violence that ramp up the excitement, but Marty has made better films. If he wins the Academy Award for this film, it will be the typical Academy ""make up"" award for past endeavors."	4.0	Nothing New For Scorsese	2007-02-22	2	1	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1DOEL69Z9KQTV	"Wynand Meyering ""reader"""	The movie is a very good crime drama. Sometimes it is even funny. Especially Jack Nicholson. He is a tremendous actor. The movie script is excellent. It is about police officers and criminals that all want promotion and recognition. But in life, to succeed, some people will turn into rats ...In the end, we are ALL EQUAL HUMANS ONLY when we DEPART this world of injustice where the rats thrive.Others can relate the story line much better.	5.0	Excellent	2007-02-13	9	3	6
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AOW2JHZFG05JV	"Xera ""xerafin"""	This movie is entirely pointless and a basic rehash of many films before it.  How this won an Oscar is beyond me, but the Oscars have been going down for years as many of the actual best pictures are never even nominated, let alone win.  It's truly tragic when such rubbish is held in high accolades.  I would like the 2 hours of my life back spent watching this tripe.	1.0	Horrible Movie	2011-12-29	10	1	9
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NLOZ0X376Y3O	Yepthatsthetruth	"I was wary of this movie because of the ""all-star cast,"" which too often in movies means that egos clash and you're left with a half-made film that still makes money because of the names involved.  However, my fears were swept aside within the first ten minutes, which indicates that this is a new take on the classic gangster films in the vein of The Godfather, and by the end, I was convinced that this film is destined to become a classic.The dialogue is a lot like the violence - visceral and unforgiving without getting in the way of the central plot or themes.  The acting is simply superb, and every member of the cast deserves recognition.  The pacing is near perfect, and there are several twists at the end.  Again, though, this movie does not revolve around its twist, unlike other recent films, and it's amazingly re-watchable even when you know what's coming.I gave this movie five stars because you get exactly what you pay for - a gritty crime drama that uncovers new territory for its genre while still delivering a solid film."	5.0	A Modern Classic	2010-12-27	3	2	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A21WYCCP6FOQJO	"Yoshi ""PSn ID Ben Hawkins"""	Not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but it still delivers. The story is pretty much the same with a few differences! The acting is grade A and the blu ray delivers spectacular sound and detail!!! Fans of the film will be pleased. Matt Damon gives and excellent performance. Martin won the Oscar for this film but it's nowhere close to being as good as some of his earlier work.	4.0	Good but not as good	2007-08-06	1	0	1
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2G2SAM49N7KF8	Zecon	Everyone raves about this movie.  It won an Oscar.  My wife and I finally saw it.  We simply could not finish it.  The movie goes over the top with its reliance on vulgar language.  There is nothing special about a movie that relies upon the overly gratuitous use of offensive language.  The cursing and profanity laden dialogue simply gets in the way of the plot and, in fact, makes even the good characters, if there was one in the movie, unlikable.  I've learned a simple lesson in life that this movie confirms.  If the critics love it and Hollywood honors it, it is not worth seeing.  Stay away from this garbage.	1.0	Profanity Laden Trash	2007-03-03	42	16	26

Was it because they wanted to give it to Scorsese?	2.0	I'm weighing the pros and cons. Cons are winning big time!	2007-04-05	6	4	2

The plot was a bit confusing, and it just seemed like a typical cop movie with all the same gangsters and police coruption scandals we've all seen in hundreds of law and order and csi tv shows.  Martin Scorcese has done better films like ""After Hours"", ""Casino"" and ""The Aviator"".  At least those films were original and quirky.  ""The Departed"" was ORDINARY!! Get it out of here!"	2.0	The Farted	2007-11-20	7	2	5
B000M341QE	The Departed (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AU61CID785ACB	Zuberdeen	"I am Irish and I grew up in Boston. Whenever a movie is set in Boston, I simply cannot enjoy it if the accents are off -- it ruins the whole experience for me. Those of us who know the regional accents (and there are many) can be very harsh when sizing up those actors who attempt the local patois. Wahlberg and Damon are from Massachusetts, so they get a bye. Leo DiCaprio does an okay job; I understand that Wahlberg told him he'd be laughed off the screen if he didn't manage an appropriate accent. Jack Nicholson, though, is terrible! He kind of drifts in and out of his accent. There is also no way I bought him as an Irish crime boss. They are way more menacing and scary. Trust me.Despite Nicholson's performance, though, I really enjoyed the movie. It is worth watching for the interplay between Wahlberg and Damon alone -- I got the feeling that Mark has always wanted to pop Matt and he gets to do it big-time here. Unlike some people, I loved the ending. It's all about retribution . . . the Irish never forget. And, we really do say ""Sorry for your troubles"" at wakes! Lots of nice touches like that made this an authentic enough portrayal of Boston. I subtracted one star for Nicholson, but overall I think Scorcese did a ""wicked good"" job."	4.0	Wicked good	2007-08-08	4	2	2
