B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3REMH83Y0EV76	Abby Berman	Outstanding ensemble cast. Shows the innerworkings of a democratic presidential administration attempting to pass good legislation in the light of right wing Republican opposition. Sound familiar? Great storylines, charming relationship between President's daughter and AA Presidential Aide, with realistic racist ramifications including assassination attempt.Excellent writing. Shows the interplay between the staff, the press, the President and First Lady (Stockard Channing), the congress and the public. This show is way ahead of it's time as it is still extremely relevant. Martin Sheen never ceases to delight. Rob Lowe, Alison Janney,Janel Maloney, and the Chief of Staff, (can't remember his name) are especially brilliant. Highly recommended for those who like fast paced political drama.	5.0	A Window Into the Oval Office	2013-03-21	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	"This was the show that began the 'Government Craze' in television. The West Wing was truly original: a compelling drama, a trendsetting program, and a look into the inner workings of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue through the lives of the administration's most powerful people. That a show like this, without explosions and seldom a gunfight to be seen, could become so wildly popular is a testament to the ability of the American People to spot quality artistry. It certainly has renewed my hope in this country.The premise of the show is that the viewers would see the inner workings of the executive branch through the most powerful people working there. Martin Sheen plays the President, Jed Bartlett, a highly principled and highly educated man who is nevertheless idealistic about America. John Spencer plays his Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, Bartlett's closest adviser and confidante. Bradley Whitford plays Josh Lyman, McGarry's deputy and occasional loose cannon. Richard Schiff plays Director of Communications Toby Ziegler, a humorless, no-nonsense administrator. In the first few seasons, his deputy was played by Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, who often brought humor and warmth to the show. There are countless other guest stars who would contribute to this show and deeply enrich it, making a show about politics both incredibly informative and deeply character-driven.Some first season highlights include the Pilot, which introduces the characters in their element rather than just settling for lengthy exposition and has a few of the characters in trouble immediately with various groups. One need only watch the famed episode ""In Excelsis Deo"" to realize what a special show this would become. Other good shows include ""A Proportional Response"", in which the president learns the virtue of, well, proportion in foreign policy. ""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" is the story about a politician who actually makes decisions according to facts and conscience instead of polling and party lines. ""The Crackpots..."" features the first ""Big Block of Cheese Day"", which would become a kind of tradition in the show and afforded some humor as well as an examination of the fringe groups.In short, The West Wing combines entertainment with education and, for what will perhaps be the only time, doesn't compromise either ideal. No wonder it's the most respected show on television. This belongs in everyone's DVD library."	5.0	Splendid Presidential Drama	2003-09-29	7	6	1
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3EXQE3575HYMO	Adam Garber	The west wing is a truly amazing television show. The writing is witty, quick, and funny, with a huge amount of depth. The politics is incredibly interesting, constantly applicable to the real world, and most of all, accurate. Finally, the acting and directing are both top notch. I've searched for years to no avail to find any show that comes close, if you haven't seen the west wing, you owe it to yourself to try.	5.0	A show written for an audience that doesn't exist.	2013-01-10	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2KYCV4FF8LO7I	"A. Hobbs ""26 letterproductions"""	I can't begin to tell you just how incredible this series was/is.  It's perfectly exquisite.  Far and away the best political drama that's been on television.  The cast is phenomenal, the drama and plot realistic and thoroughly captivating.  Granted by season 7, with the loss of so many of the original characters, I was not nearly as enamored by a long shot, but that original cast was superb.  I won't even proffer a guess as to how many times I've watched the series, little marathons, if you will, but suffice it to say, it's quite a lot.  If you are looking for a political drama, THIS is the one.  Seriously, there has been nothing at the caliber of acting and writing and just plain awesomeness since.	5.0	Far & Away, the best political drama on television	2013-11-19	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2LOSVV27BFSTS	"""airstrike1"""	I am a writer and, in my own opinion this is the only television show to achieve the level of perfection sought after by countless dramas, that end up adding up to nothing more than soap opera drivel.  Aaron Sorkin is the one writer on television worth admiring, I dare you to compare any of his scripts to the best of any other tv show, and then make an attempt to prove to me that Sorkin's isn't the only one you would want to see performed and brought to life.  Add to that, the best ensemble of actors in the history of commercial television and you have pure gold.  I don't agree with his (real-life) politics, however, Martin Sheen proves here that he is the only man who could pull off such a rich and distinct character.  While, Rob Lowe plays an idealist with a sense of absolute good, unseen on network television for being able to transform those ideals into being able to change and improve his country with what he sees and feels is right.  This succesful imaginative concept is breathtaking in its finished form.The season being aired now, season 5, is absolutely horrible, and it's not the actors fault.  Aaron Sorkin left the show after the fourth season, and now John Wells took over! Are you kidding me his pervious show, ER, is one of the dramas of soap opera drivel that I was reffering to earlier.  All of season 5's scripts are horrendous, and just downright sloppy.So stick to only getting seasons 1,2,3, and 4 on DVD.  And by the way season 2 was just announced for May 18th! and in widescreen nontheless.  However it'll be on only four discs like the 1st season, so that means that they'll be two sided again which i hate, i have a 300 disc dvd changer and what's the point of having a piece of tecnology like that, if you have to keep flipping the disc's to watch the next episode. O well, for this show I'm will to take the punishment.	5.0	The Best Ever	2004-02-06	3	1	2

It has not only lifted up the true spirit of politics, but it has brought me hope on what our politics could be, not only in the US, but in the world. The West Wing has been able to reach in to me and has thought me the true value of patriotism, tenacity and heart. I've been a follower of this TV series for quite some time now and have grown addicted to what this series offer.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3VKA5RSQLJV5M	Alexandra Durant	"After missing 1/3 of The West Wing's episodes when first aired, I decided to do the whole series after its last season. Once I started watching, I couldn't wait for the next discs to arrive (via online rental).  I saw the whole 7 seasons, progressively over the course of 3 months.  When I was done, I felt as if I had just finished one of the most intellectually and emotionally satisfying novels I had ever ""read"".  Now, a year later, I decided to acquire the The West Wing so that I could watch it whenever I felt like it.  I reserve the watching for that No Man's Land of TV seasons--the holidays.  I am enjoying the nuances missed the first (and second) time around--that's how complex this show is.  There isn't anything on TV today (and not much more in the movies) that's written, acted, and produced better. Thank you, Aaron Sorkin, the cast, and directors for providing us with the best example of how TV can entertain, instruct and inspire."	5.0	An annual event...	2009-12-29	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A11BR3YP7SEKJT	Alfred R. Bailey	I have an excellent tv set, but for five seasons I've complained that most of the West Wing scenes were lit at very low levels, and much of the time the actors seemed to be walking around in the dark. The DVD version, however, is beautiful! Apparently the episodes were transferred to the DVD medium with loving care, for they are a pleasure to watch.Unfortunately, there is a place or two (at least on disk 1, side 1) where the DVD sticks and skips. Back it goes for a replacement.If I have to wait another year until season 2 is released in the U. S., I may have to move to England. Here's a thought: Can one order a version that's sold in the UK that will play on a U.S. DVD player?Incredible stories and cast.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A16FDY9JSVYJXR	Aline Sar	I am a fan. Yes, my political views coincide with this administration but the wonderful interplay of the lead actors is what kept me glued to the series. The opposition ( the republican view ) was refreshingly represented by Ainsley ....I simply felt a part of the crew and identified strongly with each character. Though the beginning of the 5th season was less sparking, it finally picked up pace in the final episodes. Yes, the Aaron Sorkin four years were splendid but season 6 and 7, though a vastly different style satisfied. All in all, a definite 5 stars and worth every penny.	5.0	Smart and a delight to view	2013-02-26	0	0	0

First, I want to remind you that this series is a fictional depiction of life in The West Wing. You will forget.  You will be pulled in and start to believe.  The cast is wonderful but painted too nice, too smart and too insane to be real people.

Now, after finding several unplayable discs in the sets, I find I am not the only one to receive such poorly produced products. How can such a wonderful TV series sink so low as to have such...alright, I will say it...crappy discs? I am sure that Amazon is not to blame, but somebody in quality inspection sure messed up.  These are going back immediately.	1.0	I should have known better	2011-03-12	23	17	6

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A277XNW8XQCO1D	A. Prassas	This show took a great concept and ran with it. The idea was to cover the people and situations behind the Oval Office and there is no show better at looking at the way politics works. If that isn't your thing, there's still great drama and comedy here, but it's especially delightful if you are interested in government.The first season is arguably the best. The show pioneered the 'walk and talk' meeting with the camera following various characters as they walk through the White House. The President is interesting to watch but the behind-the-scenes snapshot of the West Wing means the President isn't necessarily the most interesting story of the week.Acting is brilliant and many of the series regulars who were unknown when this first aired have gone on to bigger things, but this probably remains their best work. It's impossible not to watch Josh, Sam, Toby, C.J. and be fascinated with their strengths and many weaknesses. John Spencer's Leo is pitch perfect as he manages the chaos. The show is so totally quotable, it's hard to get into a discussion of politics today without referencing an episode.	5.0	Best show about politics	2014-04-26	0	0	0

He is probably the best short-form script-writer of our generation. He is biting, witty, satirical, amusing, profound, deep, and I would vote for him for any office he choose to run for. I want Bartlett for my president, flaws and all, and that says something incredible about both the writing and the acting. The first season was amazing and the series just got better (until Sorkin left) after that.That he got such a talented group of actors, to speak dialogue that would choke Shakespeare, and make it look both natural and easy is a joy and a wonderment.

Thought provoking ideas about issues America faces or faced and how the President (played by Martin Sheen) and his staff handles the issues of the day.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A28Q0JA9H8WZOD	Bichon Mom	Since I am retired, I spend my treadmill time catching up on many award winning tv series that I never had time to watch when they first aired.  The West Wing was one that I really wanted to watch and have just finished all of the seasons.  In one way it was surprising how many of the plot lines corresponded to today's headlines.  While the players may change, politics seems to stay the same.  The actors are all talented and the writing is superb.  Although I limited myself to one episode a day during treadmill time, some of the episodes were so good that I was tempted to do another treadmill session just to see what happened next.  ;)  The quality stays consistent through all of the seasons so if one likes the show at the start, one can be reasonably sure of liking it until the finale.	5.0	Just as relevant today as when it was made	2014-04-20	1	1	0

Because it drives me crazy that much, if not most, of the dialogue takes place why they are walking frantically down hallways. I'd say half of the conversations are conducted that way and I hate it. Conversations are interrupted while they walk to yell at someone passing them at an intersection of corridors. I just don't understand why they have to do that.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1DKVW33AJAAAS	"Brian Murphy ""brianmur"""	I abhor the practice of releasing fullscreen versions of widescreen original releases more than most, but I must challenge a previous reviewer's ire.  After some research I've confirmed that the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; was shot in 1.33:1 (full screen) aspect ratio and later seasons are in 1.78:1 (widescreen).A 1.78:1 widescreen verison would need to be cropped from the original 1.33:1 full screen version and would lose part of the original image, something that viewers with multiple display formats offered by plasma screens can do already.  I recommend being happy with what we have - a faithful copy of the original program.The West Wing is quite simply the best television that I have seen in a several decade of viewing across two continents.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Premiering in September 1999, the original NBC series West Wing built an instant cult following with its seemingly realistic weekly excursions into the inner sanctums of the White House. The series became such a hit that some pollsters claimed that certain people actually believed Jed Bartlet was the real president (although, if true, this is more of a negative reflection on the intelligence of the electorate, and not necessarily an indication of West Wing's realism). But regardless, the truth of the matter is that West Wing definitely strikes a chord with certain audiences, providing entertaining brew of action, suspense, and drama on a weekly basis...Seasoned Hollywood actor Martin Sheen plays the lead role of President Jed Bartlet. The day-to-day affairs of Bartlet's administration are run by a number of individuals who surround him, among them are: Claudia ""C.J."" Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), Leo McGarry (John Spencer), and Charlie Young (Dule Hill). West Wing follows these dedicated staffers as they work extended hours behind-the-scenes to help keep the White House running smoothly. Along the way, the stress of the job and the characters' personal lives make for an interesting glimpse into what many believe is an accurate portrayal of a real-life White House administration...The West Wing (Season 1) DVD offers a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere in which we meet each of the recurring characters for the first time. The White House has their daily routine interrupted when President Bartlet falls off his bike, and Sam realizes the girl he picked in a bar the previous evening was a high-priced prostitute. Meanwhile, several members of the administration become embroiled in an ongoing feud with the ""religious right,"" prompting President Bartlet to personally condemn a group of fundamentalists known as ""The Lambs of God""... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Crackpots and These Women"" in which administration staffers spend their day listening to a number of crackpot, single-issue groups lobbying for federal favors, and ""Take This Sabbath Day"" in which President Bartlet grapples with the decision to commute the death sentence of a convicted killer following a Supreme Court ruling upholding his sentence...Below is a list of episodes included on the West Wing (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc)Episode 3 (A Proportional Response)Episode 4 (Five Votes Down)Episode 5 (The Crackpots and These Women)Episode 6 (Mr. Willis of Ohio)Episode 7 (The State Dinner)Episode 8 (Enemies)Episode 9 (The Short List)Episode 10 (In Excelsis Deo)Episode 11 (Lord John Marbury)Episode 12 (He Shall, from Time to Time)Episode 13 (Take Out the Trash Day)Episode 14 (Take This Sabbath Day)Episode 15 (Celestial Navigation)Episode 16 (20 Hours in L.A.)Episode 17 (The White House Pro-Am)Episode 18 (Six Meetings Before Lunch)Episode 19 (Let Bartlet Be Bartlet)Episode 20 (Mandatory Minimums)Episode 21 (Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics)Episode 22 (What Kind of Day Has It Been?)The DVD Report"	5.0	A fascinating series...	2005-04-21	6	4	2

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1F1JOB6CZKQWB	Bruce K Thaeler	When The West Wing started in 1999, I had not yet retired; and was thus not as addicted to TV shows as perhaps I am now (72 years old). The episodes I did watch I found fascinating, but by no means watched them all (too many other things going on).Six days ago I started to watch again and find I cannot stop, binge-watching often until 3:00 in the morning. I am now well into Season 2. What I never realized 14 years ago when the show first aired was how far ahead of the times the writers were. The political climate and the issues presented in the story-line are pertinent today. In a way it shows how little progress we have made in many areas of our politics in the last decade and a half. But at the same time, there were writers that foresaw the ever increasing stagnation of our political system so apparent over the last 8 years.Not to mention the humor that permeates each episode...	5.0	Superb Show	2014-04-10	0	0	0

Interestingly, Amazon UK West Wing on DVD (albeit for a hell of a lot more money than my (store) locally (even with the postage).I have spent literally thousand of dollars on Amazon DVDs (US) and up until now thought they were unbeatable in terms of movie range.

What a poor show, this is one of, if not the finest drama ever ot come out of US television. The writing is sharp, the direction splendid, the acting and casting tremendous! The only bad thing about the West Wing is the depressing feeling you get after it when you realise that Jed Bartlett ISN'T the President! Get this DVD, its gripping stuff! And by all accounts, despite your wait, it seems you are getting a far better deal in the Extras department, so enjoy you guys.....

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2O9R897K0FZVZ	chazberg	This program is dearly loved by us.  It brings to the forefront issues faced by the nation and individual citizens.  With humor and sensitivity it presents both sides of thought in regards to humanity and world issues. I Wish this show had continued through the start of the new millenium.  If more people would try to think issues through, listen to others thoughts and beliefs without arguing and ridiculing, we could possibly resolve several issues with compromise and compassion for our nation, our citizens, and the world.	5.0	Wonderful Program	2013-12-29	0	0	0

The characters are complex, brought to life by the great cast.  You feel like you know these people and are inside the White House.  If you're still not sure about this series, watch the episode titled &#34;In Excelsis Deo&#34; - where a homeless vet freezes to death overnight in the Capital, wearing a coat with Toby's business card, very close to Christmas.  This show ends with editing scenes between a beautiful Christmas event at the White House, juxtaposed with the Arlington military funeral that Toby arranged.  When you stop sobbing, go back and listen to the commentary regarding those scenes.  The episode is a real work of art, as is this series.	5.0	Terrific Writing!	2014-05-05	0	0	0

Watching it now, it doesn't hold up well. The acting is excellent - great cast. But the stories are rather boring and the show, over all, is preachy, pretentious and very sanctimonious.  Also, when you realize it ran at the same time as the Bush administration, you realize how absolutely unrealistic the show is. Overall, a nice distraction, but not a great show.  I think HBO's Veep is probably a more actuate portrayal of politics in Washington.	3.0	Doesn't hold up over time...Excellent cast	2013-09-06	1	0	1

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A220NZ9UT9UWL0	"""ciccia"""	Since a couple of people have made this complaint, I would just like to point out that the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; was NOT originally shown in widescreen, as subsequent seasons were.  Therefore, there is no reason for it to be in widescreen on the DVD.  In fact, if it wasn't shot in widescreen to begin with, it may not even be possible.That said, &quot;The West Wing&quot; is simply one of, if not the most, intelligent shows on television.  It has a perfect blend of drama and comedy to make it believable.  In my opinion the best part of the show is the depth of the characters and how we really see many sides to them. None of them are caricatures of people we think would have their jobs.  You will learn something from every episode you watch, whether it's something about public policy, government structure, social issues, you name it.  If you haven't been watching all along, I know it can be daunting to start in the fifth season with the new episodes, so start here with the first season and see what you've been missing.	5.0	&quot;West Wing&quot; in fullscreen, and in full bloom	2003-12-23	1	1	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1NA7ZDDPM2GAI	"C. Leahy ""Ingot"""	This show is the best and the most addictive television in my memory, and I remember watching first runs of the old Star Trek and Dick Van Dyke.  It portrays U.S. Politics as I wish they were, and is founded in a deep love and respect for our country and its principles.Additionally, although it is unabashedly liberal in its viewpoint, it does not make the mistake of being unthinkingly partisan.  Issues are examined from both sides, some Republicans are portrayed as reasonable men of principle, and some Democrats are portrayed as hollow shells more interested in getting the job than doing well in it.  There is true balance that only the most dogmatic media watchers would fail to recognize.As a recent convert to this show, my addiction to it is overwhelming, and I must admit my frustration with the fact that it is released in the U.S. slower than elsewhere.  This is the price we pay for having such a well developed entertainment infrastructure.  Companies release television shows slower here because they can run them on our many cable channels and pick up extra profits.  Obviously Bravo (where they are being re-run now) would pay less for the rights to broadcast West Wing if all its fans owned the entire thing on DVD.Even so, it's worth the wait.  I record each show and watch it 2-4 times every day it is broadcast because the dialog is so good and so dense it generally needs repeat viewing to understand all the nuances.Not only is this show a brilliant brass ring for us to strive for in our politics, it is equally a goal for our media companies to strive for when it comes to quality entertainment.  Add it to your wish list, it would be worth it at three times the price asked.	5.0	American Politics as they SHOULD be	2003-09-19	5	4	1
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3Q7BVS513UXNV	cleansince1988	I hate politics and avoid the news... but I LOVE this show.  These characters portray the noble people we wish our elected officals were. The show brings up complicated and sometimes emotional issues, often voicing both sides of it, and reveals the real life challenge of actually passing lesislation or providing political asylum or taking military action.  It shows the 24 hour nature of the Presidency, the personal challenges of a person and his family in that role, how he depends upon good advisors, and the myriad of ways that a good intention from someone in power can be thwarted by another or exchanged for a greater good.Another appealing aspect is the way that the characters are developed... they are likeable, have flaws, have histories and their relationships with each other interesting.  It's tv for the head and heart.  The education is presented in a very palatable manner and the emotional content is almost never sappy.	5.0	head and shoulders above most television programming	2004-08-26	8	8	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AQ8Y8OSQA6HWV	CLS1970	"With all the rave reviews for ""The West Wing"", I decided to buy The Complete First Season since it was on sale.  The box design looked great, and since I really like Martin Sheen I felt very good about this purchase.  But disappointment immediately set in when we began playing the first disc.  On both of our expensive Samsung 46"" TV's, this TV show looks appalling. It has not been digitally transferred as it states on the box. It looks like a regular TV station broadcast without the digital quality or HD of what we've become accustomed to.  Sure, this first season was created in 1999 but that is no excuse.  If older TV Series such as ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Leave it to Beaver"" can look great on our new TV's, then there is no excuse for the poor quality of this DVD set.  ""The X-Files"" which began in 1992 looks great on our TV's so once again, there is no excuse for the poor quality of this DVD set. I sort of knew we were in trouble when I opened up the box and saw that they were cheap double-sided discs.  So there, you have been warned.  I hope this helps to save others from wasting their money on a poor product."	2.0	Box says All-New Digital Transfers but this is Not True	2013-02-18	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3OEECMCM2T4KQ	C. Middleton	"It has now become television legend that when the creator of The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin, pitched his idea about a show concerning American politics to the executives, he was almost laughed out of their offices. Absolutely no average American TV viewer would have an interest or the intellectual capacity to appreciate a series that expounds on political policy and the political machinations behind the scenes in the nation's capitol. A show about the president? Please, the American people have had enough ""real life"" drama during the impeachment of president Clinton concerning his deceptions about his sexual exploits in the oval office. Well, these savvy television executives were dead wrong. At the end of its first season, The West Wing won more awards and was the most watched debut television series in memorable history, continuing to produce many more seasons.This series set a new benchmark for television drama. All said and done, however, this wonderful series is not about ""real"" American politics and their politicians; The West Wing is about how we would want our politicians to be - smart, ethical and human. This show is about wish fulfilment. President Bartlet may not be everyone's idea of a perfect president, but he certainly comes close. He is a Noble Prize winning economist and a politician with a family tradition that extends back the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He is ""presidential"", commanding respect, and is much too honest for his own good. Bartlet has surrounded himself with an exceedingly intelligent and loyal staff. These people bleed for him every day and would certainly die for the man. But the entire cast is strong, each character unique, contributing to the magical mix that makes this show so dynamic and personal to the audience.The first season hits the ground running building momentum until its final episode, leaving the audience hanging and chomping at the bit for more.Aaron Sorkin is an exceptionally talented writer and informed about world affairs, issues and American politics in general. I was astounded at one episode where two characters are discussing civil rights and possible monetary reparations for the great grandchildren of African American slaves. The amount worked out to be in the trillions of dollars. This discussion was simply an education and opened my eyes to this issue. Sorkin is a first class writer with a scary talent.The West Wing Season 1 includes 22 episodes with extras of interviews with the crew and cast. If you are a fan of this show, having these DVD's at your disposal is a treat and well worth the investment."	5.0	How we'd like it to be...	2005-07-12	6	5	1

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	The West Wing has deservedly won a number of Emmy awards over the past few years - to the actors and as best drama.  Compared to shows of similar popularity, only Law and Order and ER can consistently boast the same levels of performance.  But both of these shows are becoming stale - there are only so many ways to commit a crime and so many different patient problems to fix.  On the other hand, the West Wing can be about anything since the President and government of a country will be involved in all aspects of that country's affairs.In the first season we cover some of the standard ground that a president is likely to cover.  We have a war between India and Pakistan (two countries that are putatively allies of the U.S.), selection and confirmation of a new supreme court judge, discussion on whether to pardon a man sentenced to death, a hurricane, a couple scandals, and the passage of various laws.  However, what happens is not so important as how it happens.  We get an inside look at wheeling-and-dealing between the parties in Congress (and between Congress and the White House), arguments between staffers on the best way to implement policy, and the agony of a president forced to order troops into harm's way.  It doesn't hurt that the dialogue is often very funny, the political arguments are impassioned, and the characters are lovable.The pilot is the first show on the disc, and the characters are almost fully formed.  The feel of the show - quick cuts, walking-and talking, constant bustle in the background of scenes - give the show a hyperkinetic energy that is surprising if you consider that most of what happens is dialogue.  The employment of several former White House staffers give the show a feel of authenticity (it's no surprise that Allison Chaney's performance as press secretary C.J. is the lynchpin holding the show together, as Bill Clinton's press secretary is one of these consultants).The first few episodes are a letdown compared to the pilot.  There are some growing pains and the show moves a little more slowly, which robs it of its momentum.  Likewise, characterisations sometimes go off-character (Sam the socialist and Josh the pragmatist seem to switch philosophies in one episode).  It's not really until Episode 9 (The Short List) that the series settles down and becomes regularly interesting every show.  A second early problem is that the writers weren't always sure what to do with its female cast - the First Lady, Mandy the spin doctor, and some of the female guest stars are not well-written or interesting characters.  This also irons itself out by having C.J. and Donna rise in prominence while dropping Mandi after this season.The show itself is worth having on DVD, because it is a single continuing storyline and it gives you new appreciation to see the shows close together.  That's good, because the DVD extras are not very interesting or useful.  The possibilities for extras on a show like this are endless - why not a commentary by a retired judge on the process of appointing a judge?  Why not an article comparing the Clinton White House to the one in the show?  Why not a Republican commentator to offer an alternative policy point of view to the Left-leaning Democratic president of the show?  Why not poli-sci profs or ex-Congressmen talking about the political process?  No, instead we get multiple narcissistic featurettes and commentaries on designing the style of the show, on how wonderful creators Sorkin and Schlamme are, and how much fun it is for the actors.  One such featurette was fun.  4 of them, along with 3 commentaries, was tedious.  That said, it was nice to see some cut scenes and to put a face to some of the behind-the-scenes people (especially the creators and the composer).	4.0	The best drama on network TV - now commercial free!	2005-02-03	12	10	2

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1KPSX2W6H2Q4S	Cynthia Yeung	This review refers to the Region 2 (PAL) versions of the DVD. The UK market gets a headstart in seeing the release of Season 1 of The West Wing in 2 DVD box sets (Set 1-Episodes 1-11 & Set 2-Episodes 12-22). The show itself is fast paced and brimming with intelligent dialogue. Once you put it in your DVD player, you wouldn't want to stop until you get to the end of it. Special features for Set 1 include TV spot & short interviews with major cast members and Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the show & DVD-ROM enhanced features. Set 2 extras include several TV spots and 'Making of' featurette for all TWW fans & DVD-ROM features. Extremely satisfying TV viewing. Can't wait for the new seasons to come out on DVD.	5.0	The Best Series I've Seen in Years	2002-09-01	46	40	6

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A21ANNM4384JJH	dantebenedetti	White House life is an interesting setting for a series. some of the dialogue is witty (though it tends to get repetitive).  but, the liberal political bias is ham-handed; the writers and actors keep hitting the viewer over the head with it.  politically, the characters are one-dimensional; virtuous liberals versus intolerant, obtuse, unethical &#34;conservatives.&#34;  so, if your taste runs to pablum, well garnished, this is for you. the acting and direction are generally very good.	3.0	rarely rises above liberal political pieties	2013-10-22	1	1	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2714MXV7W3YNQ	DAVID BURKE	"It's a shame.  This is one of the best written dramas of all time.  And Amazon's price for SD streaming and downloads is very good.  BUT, in our household, we manage our video collection and viewing using a 27"" iMac and two 2nd gen Apple TVs.  Everything works flawlessly and wireless where needed.  iTunes makes organization dead simple and the whole system always works flawlessly.  Unfortunately, Amazon has decided not to produce Mac software to allow downloading to Macs for use in iTunes.  (And I bet if they do ever create Mac software, it will require using a specific and poorly designed Amazon app to organize and stream directly from a Mac to an attached HDTV - no standards-compliant, iTunes compatible file formats.)

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	"I, like many other people, am very glad Aaron Sorkin created ""The West Wing"". Seasons 1 through 4 of the series (written by Mr. Sorkin) represent, in my view, the best drama program on commercial television since ...... umm ...... give me a few months and I might be able to come up with something (but it won't be an easy assignment).It would be extremely difficult indeed to come up with a TV series that had a rookie season as spectacular as ""The West Wing"". Each and every one of the 22 first-season episodes located on this 4-Disc DVD collection is truly memorable. Not a bad apple in the bunch, in my opinion -- which is remarkable for any series that was just getting its feet wet.This tremendous batch of programs includes ""Five Votes Down"", ""Enemies"", ""In Excelsis Deo"", ""A Proportional Response"", and ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet"". These episodes, and all the others in this 1999-2000 campaign, are so darn good, I felt like re-watching each one of them two minutes after viewing them via these DVDs.The crafting of each episode is absolutely remarkable and worthy of high praise. The effort (and obvious care and precision) that goes into shooting just one scene is amazing. Take for instance one of the very first scenes ever filmed (for the Pilot; which is discussed by actor John Spencer in one of the very informative Making-Of documentary pieces contained on Disc 4 of this set) -- As Mr. Spencer explains in the featurette, the scene in question (one of those long, walking-the-White-House-corridors-while-talking-a-mile-a-minute type of scenes, a ""West Wing"" speciality) was originally written by Aaron Sorkin to be EIGHT different shots! But, instead, they filmed it as just ONE continuous ""hallway walking"" scene....and it's simply amazing.The acting on ""The West Wing"" is equal to the excellent writing of Mr. Sorkin. Every character is drawn well and realized to their full potential by the great collection of actors and actresses that were assembled for this TV series. It's very difficult (I would imagine) for ANY ""West Wing"" fan to choose his or her ""favorite"" character on this show. They're ALL favorites. They're ALL that good.We're not likely to see a TV program this well done for a long, long time. And it's a privilege now to be able to own these hall-of-fame-caliber shows on the DVD format.These episodes look and sound just fine on DVD. Video is in the originally-aired television ratio of 1.33:1. (NOTE: Season Two's DVD set goes to Widescreen, even though that season, like this first season, was also originally shown in the Full-Frame (1.33:1) ratio. Season #2, however, WAS ""composed"" through the camera lens for EITHER a Full-Frame OR a Widescreen ratio presentation. And Season 2, just like #1, looks great on DVD.)Sound comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround tracks. Even though the shows are Full-Frame here, the Menus are anamorphic in nature.A very nice bundle of Special Features is served up here, including Audio Commentaries for five episodes (in which Aaron Sorkin participates). Many other bonuses are located on Disc 4. Here's a look ...........>> Two terrific behind-the-scenes Making-Of documentaries, entitled ""The Primaries"" (17 minutes long) and ""The Inauguration"" (29 minutes), which both give us interviews with many members of the cast and crew, including Mr. Sorkin and ""President Bartlet"" himself (Martin Sheen). Fabulous stuff here.>> Two other shorter featurettes are ""Capital Beat"" (8 minutes), which includes interviews with real-life political ""consultants"", who helped put a true-to-life political face on the series. And ""Sheet Music"" (6 minutes), which talks about the show's music.>> 4 Deleted Scenes (total run time of just over 5 minutes). These scenes can be accessed individually, or played back-to-back via a ""Play All"" selection.>> ""Gag Order"" -- A three-minute gag reel of bloopers and assorted oddball on-set happenings. There are a couple really funny screw-ups presented here. But this is way too short. It leaves you yearning for more. But -- it's fun while it lasts.>> ""The West Wing Suite"" -- This is a montage of some scenes from Season 1 of ""The West Wing"", with appropriate musical accompaniment. But I'm not entirely sure what purpose this bonus is supposed to serve here. It's nice, I guess, as a kind of ""trailer"" for Season One. It has a running time of just under 2 minutes.>> ""Off The Record"" -- This bonus segment (of 3.5 minutes duration) is a collection of outtakes from the four featurettes/documentaries on the DVD.>> Easter Egg -- There's a nifty little 2.5-minute ""Egg"" hidden on Disc 4 (the ""Special Features"" only disc). It highlights ""Manny: Head Of Security"", who is in charge of keeping people off the West Wing set when scenes are being filmed. This is a really fun Easter Egg, which also shows West Wing actor Richard Schiff having fun with ""Manny"" while riding around aimlessly on the studio lot in a golf cart-like vehicle. Kind of neat.You access the ""Egg"" by hitting your remote's Left Arrow key followed immediately by the Right Arrow key from any of the eight Special Features Menu choices on Disc #4. After performing this ""Left then Right Arrow"" combination you'll see a ""Star"" come on the screen. Pressing ""Enter"" or ""Play"" with the star on the Menu screen will access the ""Manny"" Easter Egg.Overall, it's a pretty satisfying batch of supplements offered up for this boxed set. But, in the end, this DVD collection would have been worth the price even if the 4th disc of bonus materials was excluded altogether. For it's the twenty-two magnificent episodes themselves that are truly the stars here."	5.0	One Of The Best Dramas Ever To Grace TV Screens!	2004-06-19	7	7	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2B1GZIRD6W646	David W. Nicholas	OK, let me start this out with some personal information. I'm a generally conservative Republican. The conservatism is more economic and financial than it is moral (I tend to be more libertarian on social issues). So, when it comes to the political aspect of things, I like the West Wing (which I at times sarcastically referred to as the Left Wing) more in spite of the politics than because of them.Having said that, the series is wonderfully written. The dialog is sparkling, the plot twists are at times wonderful, amusing, and fun. The characters are well-drawn, intelligent, and the whole thing is as good as television's ever gotten. The series deals with various issues that the creative minds are interested in, and they make those issues interesting and present both sides of things more than you would expect. Though the writers usually take the liberal position, they're actually honest enough to present the opposite side of each of the arguments, and let the issues be argued back and forth. The episodes often don't resolve things, completely or at all. After the middle of the season the president gets more successful, though the assassination attempt at the end of the first season sidetracks the characters somewhat.I enjoyed this series a great deal, and this first season has some of its best moments. I would recommend the whole thing to anyone interested in politics, or well-written television.	5.0	An excellent series	2007-03-13	3	3	0

They come, they go and by the time you get interested, they are cancelled.  I enjoy movies, but series often just do not have the quality that I seek.I resisted this series.  I am not fond of politics; the processoften is more PR than real substance.  It frustrates me, so why would I seek out a series about a subject that makes me want to toss a brick at the screen?  Due to my husband getting hooked on it, I ended up catching bits and pieces as I would pass by.

Most people hate watching presidential races live, why in God's name they chose one for the topic of a season 6-7, let alone a show.  I just watched the pilot and there aren't two more arrogant, dislikable characters than Toby and Mandy.  No wonder she didn't make it, and Toby's character was unbelievably arrogant right until the end.  The pilot sucked.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A293HA28PN3VO4	":::DIGITAL BABE::: "":::DIGITAL BABE:::"""	"This show started the year after I graduated college. I did not have a chance to see it at the time, but recently purchased the entire series, as I've always known it would appeal to me. I am in season 2, and will rate each season in turn, as I watch them.This show is one of the best pieces of television ever created. Not only does the fast pace of the show, and complex story lines, intertwining of characters lend itself to quick,and meaningful character development, but the shows many political topics are unraveled with provocation and eloquence.This show is a MUST see! It's intelligent, beyond any other show that I've recently seen, and the breadth and depth of topic examination remains relevant for our society today. The characters appeal to a broad audience, but each has his/her own eccentricities that makes the show interesting, and emotional.From another angle, I've learned a significant amount about the ""behind the scenes"" political negotiation process, and the level of issue examination makes this a great conversation starter, and catalyst in really thinking about tough and fascinating issues, facing not just the US, but the world.Fantastic set so far-don't miss this show, under any circumstances!"	5.0	One of the best shows I've ever seen-a lesson in more ways than one	2008-12-13	0	0	0

I had also read good reviews on 'The West Wing' so I thought I'd see for myself. I was not disappointed! It's well cast, certainly well written and, although I've not been in The White House, the sets seem realistic.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3ODVYRIERNB4O	D. Marvin	"I never fancied myself the type of person to, after watching a television show, pump my fist in the air and use the expression ""Now that's good television"". That was before ""The West Wing"", creator Aaron Sorkin's second foray into television and the first to be billed as a straight-up drama (but don't kid yourself, there are plenty of belly laughs to go around). Like its predecessor ""Sports Night"", TWW is built on an impeccably-casted ensemble group of actors and actresses, only this time they're in The White House. Also in typical Sorkin fashion, the series thrives on fast, punchy dialogue -- complete with wonderful Dr. Suess-like speech patterns and Chayefsky-like monologues.In the first season, the drama and the stakes are never actually that high (until the cliffhanger season finale, that is), but you grow to believe they are as the staff works its way through various obstacles (from nominating a Supreme Court Justice to working past an information leak regarding the Chief of Staff's stint in drug rehab), sometimes triumphant and sometimes failing miserably. The fact that every little thing the staff does is so nationally scrutinized is the brilliance behind the show that can make the issue of passing one small piece of legislation into a what seems like national crisis.The first season includes remarkable guest appearances, including Stockard Channing (who later becomes a regular), CSI's Jorja Fox, Edward James Olmos, hearing-impaired Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin (in a sexy recurring role), Karl Malden, and several bit parts for actors any ""Sports Night"" nut will surely recognize.This Region 1 DVD release, which is being produced on 4 double-sided DVD-18 discs (in similar fashion to Warner's August 26th ER season 1 release), will surely be worth the wait for North Americans who chose not to order from the UK (since they've had theirs for about a year now), as this edition is set to include a host of special features not found on the R2 release. The greatest of these features is sure to be the commentary on select episodes from Aaron Sorkin (who wrote all 85 episodes of the series before his departure at the end of the fourth season) and producer/director Tommy Schlamme. I, personally, am also looking forward to the documentaries, gag reels, and deleted scenes.I generally regard the last 10 to 15 minutes of each episode as some of the best television ever written, produced and acted. Fans of smart television shouldn't miss this one."	5.0	Smartest show on TV now coming to the smartest format!	2003-09-16	5	4	1

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2FSJY5Q9CDEFM	Donna A. Montero	This is really a good drama on the inner workings of the White House. The charcters are believable, including the Prsident. There is some comedic moments to relieve the tension (i.e. the Presient trying to get 15 minutes of alone time with the First Lady) There even some touching ones. I started watching this series 2 seasons into the show. I am glad I can now catch up on the ones I missed and review the old ones. What I like about the series is that each show is stand alone and comes to an end each week. It is not an on-going soap opera type of show. The character og C.J. Crag, the press secretary, is based on Dee Dee Myers of the first Clinton adminsitration. She is even a consultant for the show.	5.0	Must See!	2013-05-10	0	0	0

Now I am beside myself that I missed ""American Idol."" Oh, the humanity!Watching the character, Toby Ziegler get caught up in a funeral for a homeless ex-marine veteran of the Korean Conflict was poignant and thrilling. Add the character of Mrs. Landingham and her story of what happened to her many Christmas Eves ago, and you have a classic. It reveals how you would like our government to treat and support, and I mean really support the veterans of our conflicts that is so sadly missing today.As usual, ""The West Wing"" knows how to deliver a Christmas episode with a message of peace and caring for others who are simply our fellow Americans. No one sought to find out the dead marine's politics or beliefs. He was just accorded the honor that should be given to all our veterans. And this was just one episode. Wait until you get to Lord Marbury!If I had to tell you which year of The West Wing to buy, I'd tell you only to buy one through five.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1MHEOURO9USY6	Eric Kuhn	"Words cannot describe how great this collection of DVDs are.  ""The West Wing"" during its first seasons is possibly the best television ever seen.  Everything from the directing to the writing to the acting is so amazing.  Leading the cast as the President, Martin Sheen is wonderful and he shines during the first session.  Every episode is something new and I have learned so much about the White House and about America.  But every episode also bring something that I have never experienced in front of a television screen: tears.  There are many episodes that I have sat in front of the television with tears running down my face.  It is only tribute to the wonderful show and I only have one complaint, why aren't all the shows on television this good.  God Bless the Bartlet America!"	5.0	Just Amazing	2004-01-10	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A100UD67AHFODS	"Expressed Reviews ""Expressed Reviews"""	My wife and I recently started watching The West Wing. We're only 3/4 way through the first season, but already know that we'll be watching the entire series. Now that we have A Roku player, we get to stream this directly from Amazon. I can't remember a TV show that is as captivating as this one is. The character development is superb, and the quality of the acting is extraordinary. Every time we sit down to watch 1 episode, we end up watching 2 or 3. It's a masterful TV series and I can't believe that it took us this long to find out about it.	5.0	Recently started watching this and can't believe how good it is	2012-11-03	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A14SF5SOJBZGT2	E. Yeager	Really good drama. Only wish Hollywood wasn't so angry and pushy of the democratic agenda. It seems to be a propaganda story for the democratic party. Who in this fantasy world is always right and always wins out at the end. If you dismiss the political brainwashing of the writers, the acting is good. The premise of non-elected people running the country seems to me (an independent) to be over blown. They are pushing the thesis that Americans who voted do not have a brain and cannot be trusted to have a real say in the governing of the nation.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A25N94UF9SXH8Y	feminaformosa	The first season of West Wing shows us how good television can be. If you've seen the movie The American President, the look, feel, and sound of West Wing will seem familiar to you, because Aaron Sorkin also wrote the screenplay for the movie.The focus for the West Wing is mostly on the staff, though, and that's what makes the show so interesting. The character development is absolutely superb-- you care about the characters, so you care about the storyline. In addition, the writing is so clever, and you will find yourself busting out with belly laughs at points.If you have missed the first two or three seasons, and have only seen it in the last couple of years, you may be extremely underwhelmed and not see what all the fuss was about. The first season will answer that question for you. You can now catch reruns on Bravo and sometimes in syndication, but it can be hard to jump in in the middle without knowing who everyone is and what they do. This set gives you the perfect opportunity to see it from the very beginning.	5.0	Great writing, great acting	2005-01-11	3	3	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1BMA9LZSKTVJT	FightForWhatsRight	I don't understand why you keep selling these sets when people complain about big problems with the disks and packaging.  You just lower the price on junk instead of replacing it with a quality product.  It is as if you hope no one will check out their disks in 30 days and not be able to send them back.  When you have a considerable number faulty disks, it it time to create better contracts with your providers/producers so they eat any faulty and returned disks.  I went through the same thing last year when someone bought be the piece of junk pink Sex and the City set and then had problems and found everyone had problems.  Yet you just kept selling it!  Stop selling junk.  A DVD you can not watch is not worth half price!  People want good, quality DVDs to watch one of the highest quality dramas ever on TV.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A34XCRCIIHN2AN	florianna48	Not being much of a television watcher I missed this show when it was current, but heard great things about it. In early January 2014, I started going to the gym regularly, and I know how quickly I get bored when it comes to exercise. Music or the constantly running television won't do it for me. So I decided videos was the way to go. I download the episodes to my Kindle Fire, pug in my earphones, and watch them while on the treadmill.This show is excellent, with a great ensemble cast and a story line that keeps me interested. There have been a few times when I stayed on the treadmill a few minutes longer because I wanted to see what happens next. I highly recommend this, and will be buying the next season soon.	5.0	West Wing First Season	2014-02-02	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3BA5ISHG5AHF2	Frank Gregg	First of all, I'm a political science/history major and I'll still be the first to admit that I was a bit sceptical of this series.  I just didn't think that they could make this show as interesting, informative, and especially funny as it ended up being.  After watching about the first disk of the series, I was hooked and it had become my favorite show.  The first season just blew my mind.  I've now watched the rest of them, and they haven't let up a bit.This is anything but watching an hour of Capital Hill voting on CNN, though.  There's an incredible cast including Bradley Whitford, Allison Janney, Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe who take you into the show and the world of politics.  It's nowhere near stuffy; full of humor, love interests, and interesting information.  From the first frame of the episode, you'll be glued to the TV.  If you're interested in politics, or even if you're not, give this series a chance.  You won't be sorry you did.Martin Sheen is my President.	5.0	Excellent Series.	2005-03-04	6	6	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3PKBACC7DTWOP	"Georgianna Lafebre ""Avid Reader"""	"This is an EXCELLENT SERIES! Like others I absolutely recommend purchasing any of the series. However, I wanted to offer a warning.I have all of the seasons. I received them all from Amazon (most were Christmas gifts).4 of the sets had defective disks. There would be at least one episode that you could not play without it skipping. Please make sure you watch the episodes completely within the 30 return period to be sure that there are no defective disks. Amazon is very good about replacing the set if there are defects but there is a time limit. It is hard to get through 20+ hours of tv watching in 30 days!Also- Sets 1-3 (and maybe 4) have programming on both sides of the disks. Seasons 1 & 2 are my favorites and have been watched many times. Over time the disks seem to ""split"" in the center and skipping occurs now throughout the programming. There are no scratches on the disks and the skipping is inconsistant (always happens on the disks now, but not always in the same place).This issue does not seem to occur with the later sets (programming only on one side). There is no way to replace the disks once this starts happening. If you have a way to ""backup"" the first few sets I would recommend it if you plan to watch them often. Not an issue if you are only likely to watch them once."	4.0	Buyer Beware, Faulty Disks!	2008-04-29	7	7	0

I have the entire series on DVD and I cannot tell you how many times I've watched it. This series has massive replayability so it's worth the buy. It is also not ""dumbed down"" so they deal with a lot of hot-button topics and you can actually learn a little of how the government actually works and how cutthroat life is like in Washington, D.C.The first few seasons and the last two seasons are the best.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A16EAKILNT8A0E	Hope - California	"After watching ""The Kennedy's Miniseries"" on DVD, I needed to watch a more in-depth view of the Presidency and how it functions for our country. So I read many reviews and decided the ""West Wing"" was worth purchasing.  I loved the emphasis on the President's daughter so that the viewer could get a feel for how the Presidential family is impacted by the Presidency.  Also, Rob Lowe was such a refreshing part of the mix that I really missed him when he left.  The fact that the Republican female character who resided in the basement in the White House kept getting replaced made the show a little choppy for me, especially the character from the Deep South, who was intelligent, witty and a great asset to the show.Through about Season 4, I was pretty fascinated and pleased with the series.  So I purchased the remaining DVD sets of ""The West Wing."" Unfortunately after Season 4, I realized I was burnt out and had gotten tired of the constantly clipped language of the players and bored with the show in general. I'll probably finish it in this next year.All the actors are excellent, especially the President and the First Lady.  With 4 stars, I definitely recommend the series--just don't purchase too many DVD sets ahead as you are watching it."	4.0	The West Wing, Complete First Season (DVD)	2012-09-22	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AB6JIK0YGMRMC	Ian Heath	As a UK resident you would think that I would not be interested in American politics. You would have been right, that was until I began whatching The West Wing on UK TV. A soon as the DVD was avaialble I had to have it, I now have Season One and Two. In Season One we get to meet the characters that form a close community who strive to provide us with an insight to the everyday goings-on in the White House. You immediately begin to warm to people whom you have never met before yet feel you could hold a conversation with if you met them. Season 1 leaves you with needing to know more, Season Two will not be issued quick enough for you. Season One starts well and finishes even better, well worth buying even if you are not a political fan but someone who enjoys strong story lines about people, places and events that surround one of the most talked about residences in the world.	5.0	The West Wing Series 1	2003-10-09	46	41	5

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2QQH7MF1HM3NF	Izzy Smith	The West Wing is one of the best shows that ever aired. Start at the beginning. It is dialogue heavy but after a few episodes you will become as engrossed as you would an intense action packed show. Each season has its own vision. You will learn to view each season for the significant events and you just roll right along with them. The characters are amazing without being patronizingly obvious that they are smart or beautiful or that we should like them. The story lines are great.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2QZBDTO9F5J06	"Jack Pripusich ""Doctor Pretorius"""	"I only watched occasional episodes during ""The West Wing""'s prime-time run...but loved it when I had the chance to be at home and enjoy the show. On the strength of that somewhat limited evidence of liking the show, I recently (on an educated whim)took the plunge and purchased ALL of the individual seasons when they were (all) ""on sale"" at Amazon.com.!Am I glad I did! I am completely hooked! Over the last few months I have devoured the first 4 seasons, and can't wait to complete the journey...and then start over again. It is THAT GOOD!It will be great to re-watch the entire run of the show, because the dialogue is often quick and poignant, and it really is a challenge to pick up on everything said on the first go-round. Also, what attention to detail set-wise and situation-wise...authenticity abounds! Why not? Dee Dee Myers being a consultant for the production, and all. If a former White House Press Secretary doesn't know the score, who does?!This show has a truly ""blast cast""...and the character development, sometimes via flashbacks, is so rich. It is the acting and interacting of the stars that make this show go.Get to know these people at the West Wing stage...their strengths, as well as their vulnerabilities. If Martin Sheen isn't our absolute greatest all-time actor, he's in the top few! He IS President Bartlet! John Spencer as Leo....Awesome! Tobey, Josh, Charlie, Donna, Margaret, Sam, etc., etc.. Stockard Channing makes a great First-Lady, and the ""occasional players"" each bring their own magic to the episodes where they are featured.There is little I can say that hasn't been said before about this masterful body of work. It's intelligent, clever, touching, humorous, poignant....brilliant! The actors are superb across the board, and the writing/acting are so carefully ""character-consistent"". Completely convincing that the roles they portray are NOT roles, but the actual people involved. That's the truest mark of GREAT acting.While this review is technically positioned as describing the First Season, it really applies to the first 4 seasons I have seen thus far(and very very likely the entire run of the show). Great ""extra"" features (though not too many)...and consistently sensational episodes. I would say that Season I is probably my favorite...but they are all gems. Not a single episode was ""phoned in"".I have noticed a few ""glitches"" in the discs...I think one episode had a moment when the picture ""froze"" momentarily, and on the Sony Blu-Ray player I have the ""prequels"" to the episodes at hand...""previously on ""The West Wing""...tend to be shown in a condensed screen image....recovering to ""full size"" image when the actual episode starts. Kind of strange, and I don't know if that's an oddity of my player or done intentionally(or accidentally) by the producers of the DVD's. The sound is awesome, the picture quality great (on the first 4 seasons which I've viewed). I've read other reviews commenting on disc ""issues""/""glitches"". Speaking only for my own experience, and the individual seasons I have purchased and enjoyed, I'd say the technical difficulties have been few...and a small inconvenience for the thrills of this landmark television experience!

The one flaw to the package is that the they combined the DVD's into double-sided discs, instead of spreading them out over 6 as is more usually for TV-Series' translations to DVD.  The first 3 DVDs contain the 22 episodes, approximately 4 to a side. The 4th DVD has the bonus materials on side one, but is blank on side 2.Overall, a good collection, but take care of your discs when putting them in the player...since both sides need to be readable.	5.0	A Must For West Wing Fans!	2003-12-06	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A363RAQ1NTCXTW	jasonhad	This is American TV at its finest - lush cinematography, precise and detailed sets, rapid-fire dialogue scripting of the first order, intelligent characters with every human trait and foible imaginable. They rise to the occasion, sometimes falling to the floor, picking themselves up with as much dignity as possible and getting on with the business at hand. The directing is tight and clean, the camerawork superb, even if a little rapid as characters plunge through the White House West Wing.And the acting! Every character is superbly cast, the interactions are as convincing as is possible in a staccato action drama, and the liberal (politically) slant to the story is consistent with many American Administrations. The entire &#34;feel&#34; of the first series is that this is as close as it gets to the reality of the high-pressure existence of staff in the West Wing.My fiscally-conservative socially-liberal Republican philosophy rejects some of the positions of the depicted Administration. But the brilliance of the series is far too great to allow that minor clash to diminish the enjoyment I get from watching the denizens of the West Wing dance through the waltz of infinite themes that rise to the highest levels of government, occasionally stumbling over their personal weaknesses, but generally showing compassion, intelligence, humanity and astuteness.I heartily recommend spending the time to work through the series, at your own pace. I'll wager that few who do will regret the experience. Like me, they will undoubtedly become addicted, and embark upon the full range of series, eager to see what next befalls the remarkable cast of characters.	5.0	Addictive from the outset, Fascinating to the Core	2014-03-11	0	0	0

Many of the situations being faced by the Bartlett White House are echoing through the news media and the halls of Congress today. Moreover, the political maneuvering and horse trading necessary to get things done in Washington appears not to have changed at all.From the intermittent reading of the Constitution to the trade-offs between idealism and practicality, this is American government writ large. I am certain that Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln would recognize the maneuvers and necessities as being the same ones they faced.

"" part before the episode starts.  This series does have that, and you sometimes need it to get caught up, since one obviously doesn't watch ALL of the 30 episodes at once.It's packaged beautifully, and has some good special features including commentary, the making of the pilot, behind the West Wing, Deleted Scenes, and a Gag Reel."	5.0	A great DVD set of a fabulous series	2008-12-21	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A306MBVBAVFZ3T	J. Flink	Unfortunately, very few shows on TV have the remarkable writing and character development that The West Wing has.  I don't know if it is the fault of the networks since they are running very short seasons so the audience just starts to get interested and then it is &#34;The Season Finale&#34; after 10 shows or because they allow very little time for a show to catch an audience or it is immediately cancelled.  Maybe it is partially the fault of the public for devouring the &#34;reality&#34; shows and badly written, predictable 30 minute comedies.  Whatever the reasons, although there are still some well written and produced shows available, The West Wing is one of the most  witty, engaging, thought provoking and entertaining series produced.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2QPNLFW8FC6DN	"J. King ""skyking@carolina.rr.com"""	"First this show is a masterpiece, in spite of the fact that it portrays an often bigoted view of the political ""right"" and make no mistake, many positions presented are exagerated.  One reason given for Rob Lowe leaving the show was that he was the only Republican member of the cast.Despite occassional token flashes of Conservatives protrayed as acting in an honorable way, Sorkin's view of Republicans is drawn strictly from the furthest extremes of the party and does a disservice to the majority of Americans who refuse to subscribe to the fanatical fringe of either side, left or right.That being said, it is an extremely entertaining show, even for Republicans, if you can choose not to let yourself feel offended by the stereotyping.  Sometimes, in fact, I find myself chuckling at the irony of Martin Sheen portraying a president often resorting to military force while the actor himself is so publically critical of President Bush's use of force with far more provocation!Pres. Bartlet by the way, if far from being without flaw... he has lied to the American people by concealing the fact he has MS, and he has sanctioned the cold blooded murder of a foriegn dignitary and then conspired to conceal that fact.  They are flaws which make the character more human, and Bartlet often seems a man aware of his limitations... a trait it wouldn't hurt Mr. Sheen to learn.By all means, enjoy... just remember always that the white hats are not always so white, and the black hats not always so black.  And seldom does one man, or one party have all the answers.Alas, the current season, without Aaron Sorkin at the helm is proving to be disappointing so far.  Perhaps this will make the earlier seasons that much more of a joy to own."	5.0	Outstanding Writing/Acting Overcomes Stereotype Plots	2003-10-31	49	11	38

Every review I've read, both on Amazon and elsewhere, and my own immense enjoyment of the set attests to its quality.How disappointing then that US fans of this show must look outside their own country to buy the DVD set. I went to Amazon.co.uk (the British local site for Amazon) and found the West Wing Season 1 set there. Be forewarned, however: These are Region 2 discs, meaning they can be readily played only by folks in Europe, the Middle East and Japan. If you are in the US, with a standard (i.e., non-region free) US player, you are out of luck. Your only recourse is to buy  a ""Region Free"" player (many Web sites hawk modified low market players that can play any disc), modify your own player (don't even think about it), or try getting your computer DVD drive to play it.This last option is what I've accomplished, and though I'm happy to be able to watch these West Wing episodes whenever I like, it's  a bummer to have to view them on my computer monitor.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1YCPY7NN6YSEM	JMK	This is a show all about politics, obviously. But it's so much more. It's touching, inspiring, witty, funny, intelligent, and thought provoking. And with all that it offers insight into all kinds of people's lives and political ideologies and helps to recognize that there are many different valid viewpoints, but underneath that we can still find common ground and work together.  It might be the best television show I've ever seen. I lean conservative, but as far as empathizing with the difficult lives and jobs of the white house, and thinking about how morals apply in difficult situations, this is it. But if you're looking sheerly for entertainment, every episode is quick paced, funny, and snappy.	5.0	A Show for any political view and so relevant to our time	2013-03-14	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2W1379NIAATM2	Joemikehap	"Lots of people like to intone the words of A. Lincoln by calling on our ""better angels"" to bestow upon us wisdom, compassion and strength.  Rarely does one find an entertainment vehicle that consistently aims for those exact angels.The West Wing is a wonderful, complex and daring series that creates complicated, flawed characters placed in equally complicated and flawed circumstances.  Aside from some over-the-top preachiness from Richard Shiff (Toby Zeigler)and long-winded, wonkish monologues by Alison Janney (C.J. Craig), the show takes great strides to avoid patently obvious conscience-raising lectures and polemics designed to shove liberal dogma down the throats of the great unwashed.It is true that religion and conservativism take a bit of a bashing from time to time.  However, a philosophy or faith that cannot withstand scrutiny is hardly worth the effort.  As a Christian, I usually draw strength from the criticisms leveled against people of faith in this show.  The points they raise force me to take a long, hard look at what I actually believe.The characters, all interesting archetypes we see reflected through the media, move through a set specifically designed to give the viewer the effect of following them around the most powerful building in the free world.  The dialogue is crisp and the pace of movement is spectacular.  Conflicts are rarely resolved in the usual manner.  Oftentimes, characters that are warring will remain at odds with each other at the end of the episode.  Martin Sheen (Jed Bartlett), in particular, is a fantastic realization.  He is taciturn, contrary, arrogant and pious.  He is neither always right or always wrong.  I love how his character is portayed.  So much power in the hands of one person can be daunting and this weight is used to the writers' advantage.More than enough has been said about this show.  It's a singular event in TV in that it offers contemporary stories dealing with issues we can all understand without forcing contrived resolutions or dream-like, deus-ex-machina endings that make no sense in the real world.I give this show the stongest recommendation"	5.0	Our Better Angels	2006-06-01	2	1	1

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	ABX7SEE84DMLU	John P Bernat	This is the big one:  certainly the best writing, acting, character development, execution, continuity, directing - just the best in ten years.If you're bored by politics, you'll like this series anyway.  Operating in a cynical system, the people of the senior White House staff are portrayed as fundamentally decent and idealistic people, above all incredibly intelligent.  At times they're shown as falling victim to their own vanity, arrogance or insecurity.  My favorite moments:When press secretary learns her Secret Service code name.When the president greets children for Christmas.When a senior staffer arranges a veteran's burial in Arlington (you'll cry just like we did).When we meet The First Lady for the first time (I've always been a sucker for Stockard Channing).When the team pulls together and maximizes their incredible talent and wit.The show refuses to apologize for being unsentimental and intelligent.  That alone makes you so proud to have people like this leading our country.I don't like politics, really.  But I loved this show.	5.0	Best Network TV Series in Ten Years	2004-11-23	3	3	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3RMQCOX3CLDOS	Jonathan Tu	Sadly enough, one of the few things that inspire me about American politics happens to be completely fictitious. But that's alright because I like Jed Bartlet, and we can pretend can't we? This series is absolutely incredible. Fantastic acting coupled with truly incisive, thought provoking episodes - you can only ask for one thing more, but unfortunately Bartlet can't run in 04. The West Wing has a decidedly left leaning stance, but more often than not the show tempers that with - and don't snicker - a fair and balanced view of the right. Though overall the politics of the show are quite liberal, the writers never smear it all over the place. I love the willingness to change things up in the plot, and to take on controversy head first. And really, this is one of the few shows I can watch and feel as if everything wasn't dumbed down for the lowest denominator.Some of my favorite episodes: when the NASA probe is lost (including one of the best speeches ever about why the hell we still send men and materials up into the cold nether of space), and when an old politician filibusters his way into your heart.I can't wait until November to realize I don't have enough money to buy the DVD, and then go out and rent it for three straight days.	5.0	Straight to the gut	2003-09-17	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AVA6S5SQQA1KT	Jon P.	The West Wing is one of the only shows worth watching on TV these days.  Unfortunately, our citizens have become politically apathetic, and seem to be criminally ignorant of how our country's government works.  And, while possibly not a 100% accurate, The West Wing is about as close as you are going to get to a real look at the goings-on inside Washington and, more importantly, inside the White House.  What is unique about this show, is that, although it takes place (mostly) inside The White House, it does NOT focus on the President.  Instead, it goes beyond any other attempt at political fiction, and focuses on the actions of the hard-working, and under-appreciated staffers that support the President and carry out his orders.  This show has everything... romance, political drama, suspense, humor, fast paced dialog, and most importantly, deep, intelligent, and easy-to-like characters.  Buy this for your collection and be sure to watch the hit on NBC!	5.0	The BEST show on TV, hands down!	2004-07-30	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A29RGW1L9IU9E6	Karen Sullivan	"I have the whole series on DVD and have watched it (the entire series!) 3 times.  This is the most intelligent, best written show I have ever seen.  When I see the actors today I can't help but refer to them by the names of the characters from this show:  CJ, Toby, Josh, Charlie, Donna, Margaret, Will, President Bartlett and the rest.  And I miss the late John Spencer, our beloved Leo.  This series, a spin off of ""The American President"", is nothing less than superb.  The political issues addressed in the series are the same issues being addressed in politics today.  This keeps the episodes relevant but is also a sad reminder that we continue to argue about the same thing over and over without resolving anything.  Regardless, this series is a treasure of outstanding writing and wonderful acting.  I say ""Yea to thee Aaron Sorkin and yea to thee, the entire cast of The West Wing""."	5.0	The greatest TV show of all time	2012-09-03	3	3	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A325UFNBINST5	karl	If only more people in the real world could live up to the idolized versions of Aaron Sorkin's world, maybe, just maybe, politics wouldn't be such a dirty word or filthy business.  The portrayal of an true outsider to the political scene being willing to listen to reason, change his mind (and his vote) based on logic and reason, instead of clinging blindly to party loyalty and politics, is a wonderful dream worth watching.	5.0	One of the best episodes in the best series ever	2012-08-11	0	0	0

I'm so glad that I started to watch this now as a virgin viewer of the show.  It's smart and funny and as politically relevant today as it was 15 years ago.  Even if you were a viewer when the show was on TV I highly recommend that you revisit it today.  This is what made great television.	5.0	First time viewer of the West Wing	2013-12-20	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	ASIE1GK62KXGY	Kevin	I had heard about The West Wing through many mediums. Though most denounced it as a terrible show as nothing more than liberal propaganda, I was curious. I had fallen in love with Aaron Sorkin's lesser known show Sports Night so TWW couldn't be too bad right? Let's just say it was less than bad. I had watched an episode on syndication and thought it was pretty good. Then next week I watched two more, and then again the next week and I slowly began to care about the characters and like the writing. So for Christmas I asked for the Season 1 DVD set. I've only watched the first 3 episodes (twice each) and I must say, this is an amazing show. As one review I read put it, it may butter the bread on the democrat side of things but as long as it's wildly entertaining and almost educational, who cares? I would ask all republicans to do themselves a favor and give this show a chance. You won't regret it. This has already become one of my favorite TV on DVD sets.	5.0	Even republicans can't help but love The West Wing	2003-12-26	1	1	0

Gittins	"I had only seen perhaps one show, about a year ago (to catch Danica McKellar's character), before I bought the first season.I must say this was a pleasant surprise. Well-written by Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote two Rob Reiner films ""A Few Good Men"" and ""The American President"", the depth of the political and social subject matter is very good.As most people know, the series has garnered many Emmy awards. I believe one was for episode #10 ""In Excelsis Deo"", in which a homeless vet dies overnight on a park bench wearing the coat Toby (Richard Schiff) donated to the Goodwill. This deeply unnerves Toby, who is determined that ""no one in the US should be left behind"". In a later scene, Toby is trying to arrange to have the man buried at Arlington national cemetery with an honor guard. President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) at first is against it and asks...""Toby, if we start pulling strings like this for everybody, you don't think every homeless veteran will come out of the woodwork?"" Toby replies ""I can only hope, sir.""There is humor in the series as well. In one funny scene, the president had taken some medication for his bad back, and was higher than a kite. ""You mean you're not supposed to take them both?""I've just finished season two...waiting for season three."	5.0	Thinking persons TV	2004-06-12	6	6	0

I was most excited about the comentaries and the extra features having seen all the episodes and watched them multiple times on BRAVO.  The only thing for me that keeps this from getting 5 stars is in listening to the comentary a lot of it especialy from Aaron Sorkin was copied from his interviews.  His comments weren't usually specific to the episode or the shot, they were general statments that left a fanatic like myself wanting for more.

I can't wait for the subsequent seasons to be released. The West Wing cast is tight right from the get-go. I love Allison Janney's CJ Cregg, Bradley Whitford's Josh Lyman and Moira Kelly's Mandy - she is perfectly crazy! The flow of the episodes is superb, especially without commercials! Sorkin's President Bartlet likes to drive his staff crazy with inane trivia and the dialogue is witty, smart and clever (3 words that mean the same thing, but you'll get it if you watch).The bonus features and commentaires are stellar (have you found the easter egg? I have). There are some similarities to &quot;The American President&quot; and one episode has the same title as a Sports Night episode, but all is forgiven because Sorkin really seems to have his finger on the pulse of DC. With former Clinton Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers as a consultant, Sorkin strives for authenticity. It's realistic without being a documentary, fictional without being a total cartoon and I for one enjoy the heck out of it!	5.0	Sorkin does it again!	2004-02-15	4	4	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	Watching the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot; again from the perspective of fifth it is interesting to reconsider how the show began, especially now that creator Aaron Sorkin is gone.  When watching the pilot episode you have to remember that originally that President Jed Bartlett (Martin Sheen) was going to be a minor, recurring character, and that the series was really going to be about the staff in the West Wing: the authoritative Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry (John Spenser), the wunderkind Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), the cranky Communications Director Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff), debonair Deupty Communications Director Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), and Press Secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney).  However, getting Martin Sheen to play the President was just too good of an actor in too good of a role to ignore, and &quot;The West Wing&quot; became something else.One of the best ways of noting how the series took off in a direction that was not originally anticipated would be to note how Public Relations Consultant Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) never became part of the family, while the role Donna Moss (Janel Moloney) became increasingly more significance, and she was added to the main cast for Season 2.  That was mainly because of her comic relationship with Josh Lyman, although I have to add that Marlee Matlin as Joey Lucas was a much better fit for the group as well.  Ironically, the Josh and Donna tag-team combined with the additon of Charlie Young (Dul&eacute; Hill) as the personal aide to the President, derailed the idea that Josh was the son that Jed Barlette never had (the idea was to bring a person of color into the mix of the main cast).  The President refers to Josh as his son in the second season in his rant to God at the National Cathedral after the death of Mrs. Landingham (Kathryn Joosten), but clearly Charlie assumes that role, even without taking into account his dating Zoey Barlett (Elizabeth Moss).All of this underscores the fact that the supporting cast is as good as the main roles.  Not only Donna and Mrs. Landingham that first season, but John Amos as Admiral Fitzwallace, Timothy Busfield as Danny Concannon, Roger Rees as Lord John Marbury, Tim Matheson as Vice President John Hoynes, and, of course, Stockard Channing as as First Lady Abbey Bartlet M.D.  That is without starting to check off the impressive list of guest stars like Karl Malden, Ken Howard, Edward James Olmos, and CHH Pounder.The biggest flaw in the first season is the idea that the Vice President would be so out of the loop.  Even with the history lesson of the animosity that existed between JFK and LBJ, no New England intellectual elected to the White House is going to waste having a powerful former Senator from Texas in his administration.  Every since Jimmy Carter thoroughly vetted the cream of the Democratic party for his Vice President it has been an imperative that the spot be picked by somebody qualified to be president from day one, and other that Dan Quayle that has certainly been the case.  Gary Cole is a nice addition to the supporting cast, but Bartlett being 0 for 2 on Veeps is not a good thing.That is why the idea this season that the Republicans would force some junior Congressman into the position is so offensive.  The key historical precedent would be the selection of Nelson Rockerfeller: qualified to be President and approved with the caveat this would be his final government job (i.e., he would not be on the ticket when Ford ran in 1976).  But if the show was intended to not be about the President but his staff, then the Vice President is a minor concern.  So it is interesting to be revisiting that idea this fifth season, just as it is watching Josh get into and out of the doghouse the same way C.J. does in a minor story arc in the first season.Best Moments from Season One:  the first appearance of the President, quoting the First Commandment in the &quot;Pilot,&quot; Danny bringing C.J. a goldfish on the advice of Josh, Charlie coming to Zoey's defense in &quot;Mr. Willis of Ohio,&quot; the President getting a gift from the one Cabinet Secretary who will not be attending the State of the Union address in &quot;He Shall, From Time to Time...&quot;, and the prophetic father's worst nightmare that Bartlett lays out for Zoey in &quot;Six Meetings Before Lunch&quot; (which also has the classic fight between Sam and Mallory on school vouchers).Final Thought: It would be interesting if when Barlett's second is up if the show continued with a Republican Administration.  It will not happen, but it would certainly be interesting.	5.0	Aaron Sorkin turns the Presidency into a weekly TV series	2003-12-04	29	25	4

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3JWYVYM2E8LL0	"Marilyn A Stolze ""Marilyn Stolze"""	The acting demonstrates what TV should be.  Every scene is so real. I haven't seen a show that held my interest this much since &#34;The Thornbirds.&#34; Now I know what all the fuss was about and I regret not watching it first time around. I honestly can't say that one actor is better than another. They're all that good. I feel like I'm really in the Oval Office with the President of the United States. The dialogue is fast paced and not only is it high drama, there is a lot of humor. &#34;The West Wing,&#34; is proof that incorporating vile language is not necessary to write an intelligent and remarkable program. I look forward to watching all 6 seasons.  Thanks Amazon for making it available to those of us who were too dopey to catch it originally.	5.0	NOBODY DOES IT BETTER	2013-06-10	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3BBCZP3LHBXQW	Marilyn Cobert	"We originally ordered Season 1 because we had taped a favorite episode (""In Excelsis Deo) which we watched each December, and we were afraid the tape would wear out.  We watched the entire season, of course, and were hooked.  We ordered Seasons 2 and 3, and then we went ahead and got 4 through 7.I think we watched most of these episodes when they were aired, but seeing them in order, without commercials, makes them so much better.  They are intelligent, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but certainly the best portrayal of Washington politics I've ever seen.I think it was a good investment if only for our present enjoyment, but I know we will watch the series more than once.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2XJYQ2V3ZVZFL	"Mark A. Baron ""mark3905"""	I am much of a diehard Republican as the President on West Wing is a diehard Democrat.  Even though the show is pretty much a weekly free 60-minute commerical for the Democratic National Party (sure, Sorkin says he puts in some Republican views on issues, but those are few and far between and someone on the show is always pontificating on how awful Republican points of view are), it is the only show I sit down and watch without distraction each week.  All other shows I watch, I watch while reading a book or working on the PC or something.  Don't do that with this show.  If you do, you'll miss some of the best (if not THE best) acting on television.  Great acting, great direction, great dialog when they are not bashing Republicans and conservatives, great casting.  There is a reason why this show has won so many Emmys.  Talent.  Loads of it.  Watch these DVD's and you will agree.	5.0	These are worth paying attention to.	2003-12-29	9	6	3
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Season one of The West Wing opens part way through the first year of the Bartlet Administration.  President Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) is a first term Democrat from New England, and he has a strong staff helping him.  That is, when they aren't caught up in personal issues.  For instance, Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn's (Rob Lowe) new friend happens to be a prostitute.  Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) is having problems in his marriage.  And Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford) is upset that they have hired former girlfriend Mandy Hampton (Moira Kelly) as a political consultant.  Never mind the fact that she is the best in the business.But along with the personal drama, there are also plenty of politics as The White House seeks to get various bills through Congress, or even a Supreme Court Nominee.  Fortunately, CJ Cregg (Allison Janney) is on hand to properly deal with the press during all the ups and downs of the first year.I know this show was popular when it aired, but I never even tried to get into it.  In fact, I only watched this season because my best friend passed it on to me.  The pilot confirmed my worst fears as conservative Christians come out of that looking like complete hypocrites.  But I pressed on.  Even from there, the show was a mixed bag.I must admit, I have grown to love these characters, especially President Bartlet.  The one exception is Mandy, who is just too sanctimonious for her own good.  On the other hand, the conversations that Josh has with his assistant, Donna Moss (Janel Moloney), are often the highlights of the episodes for me.  While the show does present a liberal agenda very favorably, it does begin to have a more balanced portrayal of conservatives as it goes along.However, the storytelling is very weak.  This is most noticeable in the first few episodes.  We are just dumped into a story and not really told who any of the players are.  I had to look them all up myself.  Multiple episodes are completely predictable, and not just because of a formula but because of cliches used too many times before elsewhere.  Several of the episodes are more a chance to preach to us then entertain us.  And some of the best potential storylines of the season are abbreviated for no reason I could find.And, of course, the show is always praised for its writing.  Yes, it is fast paced, but I also found it too smug.  And the walk and talks?  Seriously, I was about ready to tell the characters to stand still several times.Despite the weaknesses, I must admit, I need to know what happened next.  I am looking for ways to continue the series cheaply.I didn't find this season to be as wonderful as everyone else, but there is still some entertainment value here.  I'm probably alone in this assessment, but you might want to catch some reruns before you buy this set.	3.0	Look Behind the Writing and See Weak Stories	2009-03-10	11	5	6

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A36EW68H08UOCS	"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!"""	"The West Wing is a show so delicious to watch - it is difficult to imagine that there are 22 feature films made in any given year that are as well-done and entertaining to watch.It's wonderful to watch these episodes with a digital transfer and no commercials - my wife and I feel spoiled.  After watching a few hours of ""West Wing"" it feels like a real step-down to watch other network television, and it's the RARE movie that is as entertaining, thought-provoking and heart-warming.The characters in this show seem very real, and even better, they seem very fundamentally ""good"" and concerned about each other, the country and their fellow man.  Time and again the characters take a step out of ""the usual"", but never with the intention of benefitting themselves.  Although this White House is democratic, you get a sense that they consider ""all sides"".  Every so often an event happens where various characters have the opportunity to ""do the right thing"" versus ""look good"", and invariably they err on the side of ""doing the right thing"".One of the great things about this show is that it presents and ""teaches"" some of the fundamental political debates in our country in a way that is much livelier than a dry textbook or lecture.  For example, when C.J. pulls aside Sam and admits she understands basically zilch about the national census, Sam gives her a quick ""Census 101"" that make it very clear to C.J. - but also makes it clear to the audience as well.  We get to hear political debate - and although the Bartlett White House is full of liberal democrats we usually get a pretty good look at the opposite side.  Example: Donna discovers that there is a budget surplus of over 30 billion in this first season (at about the same time that the Clinton administration unexpectedly discovered the same thing). Donna thinks the taxpayers should get a refund. Josh, her boss, explains to her that democrats have a much better plan for the surplus and it just wouldn't be a democratic party kind of ""thing"" (any event or idea is a thing to these characters.)Opposing viewpoints are not ridiculed for the most part.  Although a fictional account who wouldn't feel comfortable with a team like this leading our country?Accompanying the complete first 22 episodes is a disc of ""behind the scenes"" documentaries that make it clear that the genius behind the madness is writer/creator Aaron Sorkin.Seldom does writing, directing, setting and acting come together so in a manner so completely satisfying.  Mr. Sorkin says in one of the included interviews that one of their goals is to make every episode as good as the best one.  Everyone has their ""favorites"" among the episodes - me too - but in this first season every one is excellent."	5.0	As good as television gets	2005-03-14	10	8	2

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3A2GF4FMNZ6X6	M. DeFazio	"Critically appraised throughout its seven year run, The West Wing is widely regarded as one of the best dramas of recent years. With fast-paced and witty dialogue the show is one of those that will be cherished and, now, sadly missed. This review will be centered on the DVD itself instead of the show though.The DVD packaging is rather good for a show. The discs are double sided, but episodes are not presented in widescreen. Inside is a booklet containing episode descriptions and a list of characters. On the flaps are lists of awards the show received in its first season as well as a list of special features. The special features including ""Making of's..."" and a gag reel as well as a few other treats. The audio commentaries are rather well done with Sorkin appearing on pretty much all of them.If you are a fan of the show you will not be disappointed by this release."	5.0	One Of The Soon To Be Classics	2008-12-15	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1FJCJJ6YLIU2K	"M. Derby ""drone45"""	"The range from light to dark provided by a good DVD player is analogous to the dynamic range (loud to soft) of a good stereo system.  Being more of a music than a film person, I'm saddened by the increasing use of ""compression"" (in the audio engineer's sense--I don't mean JPEG or MP3 compression) in music.  It makes CDs sound better in car stereos and on portable players.  But for listening on a good hi-fi at home, much of the music's drama is lost if there isn't much difference between the quietest and the loudest passages.One of my favorite things about West Wing has been that it's unusually cinematic for a television series.  It isn't bright and day-glo.  Unlike most TV shows, which more and more seem to be converging with the techniques of television advertisements.So, yes:  great cinematography.  But it was Sorkin's scripting which was crucial.  His ability to weave multiple subplots both within a show and from show-to-show remains unmatched by any other writer for television.  Some may object that what I've described is merely the ""soap opera"" formula:  but what soap opera ever had this kind of substance or emotional impact?[SPOILER alert -- covering the next two paragraphs]Think of the show where Josh is on stage narrating ""a day in the life"" at the White House:  the time he filled in at a press conference after C.J. had an emergency root canal and could barely speak.  Josh jokingly told the press corps that the President had a ""secret"" plan to fight inflation, and the reporters all take him seriously!  His verbal performance is cut in not only with shots from that past fiasco -- but also merges with the developing story -- which Josh follows via his cell phone, occasionally interrupting his talk -- that story taking place in parallel, in the present, where a teetotaling Supreme Court nominee is arrested on a groundless DWI charge, which was in fact the crime of ""driving-while-Hispanic"" in what must have been a very-white Connecticut town.If only the judge had followed through with his initial intention to stay in prison, not only so that he can see the justice system from the other side, but presumably also develop a better cause of action to sue the racist cops who arrested him.  Yes, the plot might have slowed down too much...but what a spectacle it would have been.[OK, this is where you can start reading again, if you didn't want to hear too much]Most television producers imagine the audience can't possibly keep track of so many characters and plotlines.  Especially not timelines!  The success of West Wing has proven them s-o-o-o wrong.I suppose it's too much to ask.  To expect that kind of brilliant writing to appear on TV again.But we can always watch the Sorkin seasons on DVD.  Even on widescreen, although that wasn't done until Season Two."	5.0	Brilliant - I only wish Season One were also widescreen	2005-12-01	7	5	2

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2TLQP6QUE5T28	Melinda Hart	"1997. Penn State University. Michael Hauge was holding a seminar there on ""How to Write Screenplays that Sell."" I was about one year out of high school and really interested in the prospects of a screenwriting career.For anybody who attends any sort of seminar, there is usually a certain film, script or work that an instructor uses to demonstrate the points of a successful story and/ or film. The script Michael Hauge had chosen was ""The American President,"" written by Aaron Sorkin.I had no idea at the time of the calibur of storytelling I had in my instruction manual. I knew I liked the movie, but I didn't know why until the seminar had concluded and the film had been dissected to its core. I went on to learn that Aaron Sorkin had also written ""A Few Good Men.""Those two screenplays alone are an education, brilliantly crafted, riveting in both plot and in the dilemmas and conflict of character, but the stamp of Aaron Sorkin's style comes in his use of dialogue. There are few other writers capable of crafting the intelligence, heart and wit that gets fired out of the mouths of Hollywood's most gifted actors.West Wing provides time to focus on issues, life and love in a way no feature film can and each season leaves you wanting more. Aaron Sorkin was able to take one simple idea of a behind the scenes look at Senior Staffers in the White House and turn it into an extraordinary hour of television year after year. Due credit should be given to John Wells, Tommy Schlamme and other contributors who helped make the West Wing come alive and to the actors for giving those people heart as well as wicked tongues. So, in conclusion, the West Wing provides entertainment as well as an education whether you are a democrat or republican - an aspiring writer or director or maybe just someone in the mood for a well told tale."	5.0	My Education and My Entertainment	2006-09-19	3	3	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2YFEFOS79ORXI	Michael A. A. Schall	"In 2013, TV viewers can watch reality TV, reveling in the banality and downright crudity of the common man, talent shows which are a moderately successful attempt to play upon the Horatio Alger myth, tugging on the public's heart strings by weekly parading the hopeful and the ne'er-do-wells in front of group of successful, but often overbearing or vulgar judges, whose behavior either adds comic relief or more drama to event that is ""staged"" in more ways than one.  The remainder of the ""watch list"" is either formulaic cop's shows combining Sisyphus with a Rube Goldberg script contraption: complex, lots of action, but little accomplished, and each week the process is repeated again and again and again, or comedy that plays upon the mundane to modest effect.While there are legitimate criticisms of the West Wing, these pale in comparison to the endeavor and its context.  The West Wing never played to crudity, banal sexuality or ""guffaw"" comedy when most shows did, and still do.  It offered a window, albeit a rose colored one, on the presidency and those supporting the office in the endeavor to govern fairly.  Better said, it was people coming to together to ensure no one got left behind.  Full of soaring, and sometimes saccharine rhetoric, it explored many issues of the day with insight and humor.  High-minded without being pretentious, the West Wing consistently provided food for the mind and soul, rare at the time, nearly impossible to find now.TV offers us so little in terms of vision.  Shows like the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and Desperate Housewives, while well done and entertaining revel in the worst, or at least the commonplace, in us, whether it was greed, hatred, lust or desperation.  If we heap plaudits and awards upon those shows that glory in people at their most base, vile and malicious, then certainly we must take a moment to praise those that try to achieve something  better, endeavoring to show people motivated by what is best in us: compassion, insight and the desire to serve .  The West Wing reminded us that while government is flawed because we are flawed, it can be, as we can be...an instrument of good."	5.0	TV striving for a higher purpose	2013-12-07	1	1	0

I can't add anything to the praises in other reviews, but I will repeat that the writing and camera work are without equal. That said, I need to correct some misunderstandings.  Comparing it to the Simpsons, as one reviewer did, is silly; it's like comparing Robin Williams's standup routines to Kenneth Brannagh's Henry V. Both are brilliant, but they're entirely different creations, and are incomparable. Second, calling for a widescreen release of Season One is clear evidence of ignorance. Season One was shot for 1:33-1 showing; it was only in the second season that it was shot for widescreen. This collection is as it was meant to be seen. As for the extra (or lack thereof), with a show of this quality, extras are just that: extras. The show alone is worth the price.	5.0	Widescreen would be a travesty	2004-06-20	1	1	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A214DG8Y09M3W9	"Michelle Devon ""~~Professional Dreamer"""	I had forgotten just how much I had enjoyed this show the first time around. I started watching this again on Amazon Prime because my best friend had never seen the show, and I had a feeling she would like it. She did! This show is super fast-paced, and it is absolutely hilarious in sarcasm, irony and subtly. You have to pay attention, because it blows over the jokes fast, but there is a lot of humor in this drama. I'm not a political person, and you really don't have to be politically savvy to enjoy the show--in fact, someone who is really into politics might not really like the show as much. It does require people to not take things too seriously to watch it for the entertainment value. It's also sort of neat to go back in time to see the 'headline' crises going on in the world when the show originally aired.Definitely worth watching or re-watching again... I'm planning to slowly go through all the episodes, catching up on some that I missed first time around. Enjoying the series quite a bit.In this second episode of the first season, we get to know the main characters a bit more, diving deeper into their interworkings, friendships and associations, learning who is on whose side, who works for whom, and more. The humor still stands out strong, but the serious headlines of the time are dealt with in a respectful way, without degrading it to slapstick. Sarcasm and irony are strong throughout this episode, which is one of my favorite parts of the entire series.	5.0	Which Came First, Chicken or the Egg - in Latin!	2012-04-11	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A241MUOZIJK9MF	Midsomer Mama	I highly recommend watching.  It's a great ensemble cast. The plots are are believable and the characters have faults. I really enjoy being able to watch more than one show at a time. The show makes you feel as if you have a spy glass into the White House and the West Wing. The fast pace of the shows have an almost dizzying affect as the camera follows characters when they traverse the maze of offices and assistant pools that are in the West Wing. You really do feel as if you're there. The subjects of the plots are very close to many of the problems the White House is dealing with right now. I do realize it's another message show, however, it does entertain. It does make you think. It also makes you angry at times. Angry at some of the characters, angry at Congress, angry at the President. Any show that can produce emotions on that level is worth trying.  West Wing did leave me wondering how close to real life it is.	4.0	Highly Recommend	2014-03-27	0	0	0

My biggest criticism is that, just like every tv show of the last 20 years set in DC, the POTUS is a bleeding heart liberal and everyone to the right of Stalin is portrayed as evil incarnate. Just about every episode has some preachy message, delivered in a way that's about as subtle as a mugging. Guns bad, gun control good. Religion bad, 'pro-choice' good.

Gay rights, race relations, the death penalty, military spending, aid to education, just to name a few.

Just joined Amazon to see if they were an alternative to Netflix.  At least not as far as streaming old TV shows.  Will now check Hulu - altho you have to pay them a monthly $8 fee, so that might not work.I can, possibly, see a nominal charge.  Maybe $5 for a season's series.  Not $1 or $2 per episode.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2ML0BCB78KV14	"M. Thoma ""MJ"""	When WW came out I was a SportsNight viewed. Loved the cast, characterizations and stories. I then heard that Aaron Sorken was developing another show and let this one drift off course. I resented the heck out of WW for just that. A few summers ago I caught the last of a run on cable but only got to see about a week's worth. That was more than enough to get me hooked. It truly spoke to me. My mission was to search for the Dvds for all the seasons which I did through Amazon.  The Dvds all came quickly  and in great condition. Then the fun began. I went through 3 viewings immediately. Everything I loved about SportsNight was quickly surpassed by the WW. These well used Dvds were viewed at least 3 to 5 more times until I purchased my Kindle Fire a year ago. Naturally I bought a subscription to Prime and saw that they offered the WW FREE! I was in hog heaven for now I could watch it anywhere and any time at my own convenience. What a bargain Prime is! The quality is as good as the Dvds and they download quickly.  I can truly say I have NO complaints about either format or their prices. BTW by using Amazon I saved a lot on the Dvds by buying used and new from their independent sellers. I encourage you all to do the same.

Writer Sorkin is so good at writing touching moments that you hear with your ears and feel in your heart.  The actors are superb at communicating these moments with words, but  also with their faces and bodies.

From Mr. President, Martin Sheen who moves from the Oval Office to Situation Room where all the ranking Military meet to make major decisions, Charlie, his 21 year old personal aide, who does everything from getting coffee, to keeping unhappy problem visitors occupied until the President can get back to them,  C.J.,the Presidents Press Secretary, giving out news to the reporters assigned to the White House while keeping  Danny, the Head White House Reporter up to speed, on to Toby, Josh, Sam and all their secretaries,who know their bosses inside and out. There is no time too run out and get snacks and a drink unless you are watching reruns and can put it on hold. Rapid movement is the word for the show. Presidents of other countries, Commanders, Generals, and local heads of major companies around the country, find that the White House is busy and work long hours to 'make it all work' as best they can while also trying to meet and come to agreement with Senators and Representatives of Congress. Throw in travel to meet their constituents, around the country, bullets flying from groups with long term anger issues, and the daughter of the President dating her fathers personal aide, who happens to be black and you have a reason to 'Don't touch that dial' or makereally quite dashes to the kitchen and back.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A327G5982ELWNT	Nathan	Rumor is that Bravo recently bought the US rights to the first season for $1 Million an episode. So, to us here in the US, that means not only will NBC most likely not be replaying any episodes from the first season over the summer hiatus, but also that until that Bravo contract wears out, we wont be seeing any DVDs. The only way to get them now is to reinvest in a region free DVD player and purchase them through the UK. On the other hand, if we do ever get them, they'll probably be better (more features) than the ones they are seeing now. Small consolation, I know.	5.0	A great show...	2002-05-24	9	9	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AOV5BX24NBV29	"N. K. DeBoer ""Road Warrior 8411"""	This series is funny and can also really pull the emotions from a viewer at times. A lot of comedy and good laughs in it. But the series also looks at some very serious and thought provoking issues of our time. It makes you think about those issues. And some episodes can also bring a tear to the viewer's eye. It attempts to show how decisions are made at the White House. The politics and so on. And I think it does a good job of it. Not sure it is that accurate as I have never served on the staff there, of course. We will have to hear from someone that has for that view.Overall, it does what a good movie should do. And it does it time after time. Very good series. I missed it on the original release on TV. I am very glad that I watched it on DVD.If you have not watched it, give it a try. I think you will be glad that you did.Oh, by the way, I ran a business for over 20 years and I tend to be somewhat conservative. So this review is not because I am a liberal democrat. Whatever side of the fence you are on politically I think that you will probably enjoy the series.	5.0	Just Great	2004-05-02	2	2	0

They do a very good job balancing the politics.  If you are a true politico I guarantee you will enjoy this show no matter what your political leanings are.  There is a lot happening in every episode and it is very fast paced throughout the show.  If you aren't very familiar with politics and how policy is created there are things that will go over your head.  But don't let that stop you, it's still a great show but if you know the inside of politics you will like it even more.	5.0	One of the best shows ever written	2010-10-12	3	3	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A25AJJ89JOO4P	Philip Hurst	As a resident of the United Kingdom, I am fortunate in being able to buy not just the first season on DVD, bit the whole of the second too. I thought that I might find the third (which is nearing the end of its run on cable/satellite television here) might be available in the US. No such luck! Nevertheless, while I'm here, I would like to record the pleasure and entertainment I derive from the series. If only the real West Wing were as Platonically high-minded and morally irreproachable as the Bartlett administration.I do, however, have one real gripe about the show. There is a recurring character, &quot;Lord John Marbury&quot;, who appears as an old friend of the President. Though shown to be a masterful political operator, not only is he portrayed as an arrogant, braying, upper-class English twit whose favourite pastime is putting down Leo, but the scriptwriters clearly have no idea about the realities either of the English nobility or the appointment of ambassadors. For the character to be &quot;Lord John&quot; he would be the son of a duke or a marquis, holding a courtesy title, i.e. not a &quot;real&quot; lord in his own right. Second, this &quot;Lord John&quot; is made British ambassador to the US, but it's clear from his earlier appearances that the man is no diplomat, and he is about as likely to be appointed ambassador to the US as President Bartlett is to be struck by a meteorite! And finally, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II would never be referred to as &quot;Her Royal Majesty&quot;; if Marbury [sic] were presenting his credentials as incoming British ambassador, they would be signed by &quot;Her Britannic Majesty&quot;. Details, I know, but as a Brit I get tired of caricature on American TV or in Hollywood films. But the series is superb overall.	5.0	Superb - even from 5,000 miles away	2003-11-24	9	6	3

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1TUDEC66M9FO3	Preston C. Enright	"I was torn between giving this 2 or 3 stars.  I decided to give it three because it is better than so much of what has been on the main corporate media.  I also am an opponent of the militarist and exclusionary ""Christianity"" of the right-wing and share other political sentiments of the show.  Having said that, this characterization of the West Wing glorifies an executive branch (liberal and conservative administrations) that is thoroughly corrupted by big money.  This series gets liberal points for arguing for gun control and that sort of issue, but when it comes to the issues the Clinton administration was quite reactionary on - ""free"" trade deals like NAFTA, the war on non-corporate drugs, the demonization of Arabs who our empire has been targeting for generations, welfare ""reform,"" boosts in corporate welfare and privatization schemes - the show is really quiet on those issues.  Very quiet on important issues, and very heavy on the sappy patriotic music and constantly putting a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt or a bust of some other founder on the screen.I don't like that term ""founding fathers,"" on top of diminishing the role of women and the general public, it's a slap in the face to the indigenous people, and the slaves and the migrant & native workers who truly built the country. See,People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present (P.S.)Some of the characters in this show just kind of annoy me, the manner of the dialogue, lots of posing and trying to be cute.  Although, I think the writing gets better in later seasons.Some reviewers have called this the ""best show on tv.""  That's not my feeling.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AG627MWOJWQCU	R. Barmore	Intelligent television.  It seems like an oxymoron.  But, as with his earlier series Sports Night, Aaron Sorkin again shows that he can write dialogue as good or better than anyone in television today.  The first season of The West Wing is cleverly crafted, fast moving, and politically idealistic.  One thing many people not familiar with this drama may not realize, the earlier episodes of The West Wing were funny.The ensemble cast works great together from day 1 as if they'd been doing it for years.  Throughout season 1, you can see Rob Lowe in action at the time when he was considered a central character.  Of course in susequent years, Martin Sheen and others gradually took the spotlight which ultimately led to Lowe's departure.Good acting.  Great writing.  Some of the best television in the past 10 years.	4.0	The West Wing - Intelligent Television	2004-06-10	1	1	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AL8VNVT01YWGU	Richard M Estel	"I did not watch this show when it aired but heard good things about it (from a friend who is very conservative!) Finally ordered season 1, and it is my new favorite drama. I've already ordered the next three seasons so that I don't have to go through withdrawal when I finish the first one. The characters are first rate, and the actors, mostly not that well known, are very good in their parts.The story lines hold your attention and seem plausible, and make me glad I never became President.There's a bit too much of the ""too cutesy"" dialog where two characters repeat the same lines several times...same problem that happened with Sorkin's ""Sports Night,"" but they toned that down in that series, so I'm hoping it will slowly fade away in this one also. Otherwise, the best indication of how I like that series is that I watch one a day unless I am away from home.MAY 2013 UPDATE: I'm now making my way through Season 6, with one more season to go, and I'm already feeling ""pre-withdrawal"" symptoms knowing that I won't have new episodes to watch in a few weeks. I'll watch it all again in four or five years (at my age I can forget a LOT in that amount of time).Season six has a sequence of episodes that deal with the next presidential campaign, following three Democrats and one Republican, none of them Jed Barlett of course. I'm finding this ""campaign trail"" stuff less captivating than the usual day to day White House operations, but I'm sure we'll get back there soon. And they DID in fact tone down the ""cutesy dialog.""I have to say I miss Rob Lowe, who was excellent in his part. His departure is balanced by my discovery of two actors I was not familiar with, John Spencer and Allison Janney. (Janney fans can see her in a sitcom coming in the fall of 2013, but of course, she won't be equal to CJ Craig.)"	5.0	First Time Viewer, Hooked Forever	2012-12-03	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1MIFU0YKLG40T	Rick Galati	I never watched &quot;The West Wing&quot; when it aired on broadcast TV simply because I wanted to enjoy the show from season one, and more importantly....in ORDER. Each of first season's 22 episodes are only 42 minutes commercial free minutes long and not one dog in the bunch! This show defines creative writing at its finest. It matters not what political persuasion you happen to be to enjoy this show for what it is, but for dramatic purposes the show's writers naturally had to pick a political party and run with it. So, like the proverbial coin toss, &quot;The West Wing&quot; happens to depict a fictional Democratic administration. Thanks to excellence in writing and acting, you may even learn some arcane details about our political process in a highly entertaining ways. The writers constantly challenge your intellect with amusing asides such as the President saying &quot; Four words in the English language begin with the letters dw. What are they?&quot; The rapid fire delivery of dialog by this superior ensemble cast is verbal poetry taking a brisk walk. This show is broadcast television striving hard to reach its finest potential. All the Emmys it has garnered speak for themselves.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	ALD1CRUBY1365	R. L. MILLER	"They might learn something. Maybe. Look, I'm a situational drama junkie--I have to confess that right away. Cop shows, Doc shows, lawyer shows--I'm on board for the first season, unless and until seeing a few episodes shows me I have better things to do with that hour. I didn't know beans about Aaron Sorkin--his name didn't resonate with me like those of Dick Wolf, Jerry Bruckheimer, Stephen Cannell. But what I was hearing about this one intrigued me. Back in 1999 I wasn't under the constant onslaught from people I know of anti-gov rhetoric which back then was still pretty much the province of militia gun nuts. And the more this ""neo-anarchism"" grew, the more defiant I got. I was supposed to watch mean-spirited sitcoms instead? And I got nowhere (and still don't today) when I said to Washington-bashing friends; ""You guys are talking about our own capitol the way people did 20 years ago about the Kremlin."" So I tuned in to this series, and when it started bagging Emmys I wasn't surprised. You get dynamite characters like Rob Lowe's Sam Seaborn, Bradley Whitford's Josh Lyman, John Spencer's Leo McGarry, Richard Schiff's Toby Zeigler, a really likable girl-next-door type like Donna Moss played by Janel Moloney, who I later found out was the woman who as a kid had played Tiny Tim's big sister Belinda on a version of ""Christmas Carol"". And avuncular Martin Sheen was cast to type as a less-sexy New England version of Bill Clinton. And as the series progressed, we saw the President Of the United States, played by the guy with the biggest matinee name, as a supporting player. It was instead like the title suggests--about the lives of those who work in the White House, down to the grandmotherly presidential receptionist. In 1999 I was becoming a disafected Democrat, who later registered as a moderate Nelson Rockefeller/ Jerry Ford Republican. And you know, I never did tune in to boo at the bleepin' Democrats the way some people do with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Because although this series does not ignore partisan zealotry, it isn't dominated by it. It's about America the way Aaron Sorkin, a producer who obviously intensely loves his country, insists it really should be."	5.0	Knee-Jerk Washington Bashers Need Not Apply...or maybe they should	2010-12-19	2	1	1

This show has the right cast and chemistry. The screen writing is superb, witty, funny, and educational. The first four seasons are great and I enjoyed the last season. Seasons 5 and 6 got a little stale. They should have added some new screen writers in conjunction with the original ones to add some spice. But if the show does not captivate you by episode 8 of season 1 (my favorite), then you probably should move on to something else. No disrespect intended, but if you are not addicted by episode 8, the show is just probably too intelligent for you to grasp the stories.	5.0	The most intelligent screen writing	2014-02-17	0	0	0

Next the episode name &#34;Noel&#34; and I remember after 9/11 the episode named &#34;Issac and Ishmael&#34;  still overwhelms me with emotion.	5.0	Best show of all time	2013-07-24	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1YJQ537RB8JVK	Rs6096	This series is the best written and acted available.  You need to listen intently to hear every word of dialogue to follow the plot.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2YDOU71RW8NCY	Ryan Esposto	Good to see The West Wing finally released on DVD in the states. It's one of the most re-watchable shows on television, at least until Season 5 started.  I've owned the Season 1 &amp; 2 DVDs (available in the UK, but they're Region 2) since they came out and watch them all every couple of months.To those who wonder why the Season 1 DVDs are not in widescreen: the show was not produced in widescreen until Season 3.  So all of the Season 1 and 2 DVDs, no matter if they come from the UK or US, will have the standard TV aspect ratio.	5.0	'bout time (oh, and about the widescreen...)	2003-11-24	4	4	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1KFPIT4VID3VQ	Ryan Strauss	I was blown away by the first season of this spectacular dramatic series, near the end I could barely peel myself away from the TV! Sheen, Lowe, Spencer, Janney and honestly the entire crew was just mind boggling in their performance. The commentaries were insightful, funny, and truly informative for anyone who's seen even one episode of the West Wing.Overall, I can't praise this DVD enough, the people in and behind the scenes put on a spectacular performance, one which I plan on watching again and again over a period of years.	5.0	Amazing	2004-01-14	2	1	1
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2QDPJRVXL7P4F	"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile"""	I was never really interested in watching this show. I often saw it playing on TV while I was living in Toronto, Canada, but was never captivated to sit indoors and watch it (I spend most of my spare time in outdoor activities).Then one day Bush junior took office. Then came September 11, then the US invasion of Afghanistan, followed by the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Then Moore's Fahrenheit 911 hit the screens to become a box office hit. Then came Bush's second term, which I did not expect he'd win, followed by the lowest approval ratings in US history. Iraq was a disaster; Afghanistan was becoming another problem as the Taliban regrouped and regained strength; and Bin Laden was still evading capture.Suddenly I found myself interested in American politics. I wanted to know more about what goes on behind the scenes. What makes a US President popular? How are decisions taken? Does the President act on his own or as a team? Can the President sleep at night when US troops and innocent civilians are dying? How does the secret Service protect the President? My questions could fill several pages. I could easily have gone on the internet and typed each question on Google. Better still, I could have gone to the Library, a trip few of us take today with the advent of the internet. But I decided to watch Season 1 of the West Wing, and am I glad I did.The West Wing will give you an inside look at the American Presidency. You will really learn a lot about American politics. Did you know, for example, that the American Eagle holds thirteen arrows in the left talon and an olive branch in the right talon? When at peace, the Eagle faces the olive branch. When at war, the Eagle faces the arrows. In the halls of Congress the carpets are actually changed to reflect this.Did you know that the Secret Service is aware at all times of the location of the President, even while he is in the White House? A Secret Service agent radios the Central Command when the President enters the Oval Office and when he leaves it. A Secret Service agent is practically positioned at every door in the White House, radioing where the President is at all times. There is little privacy for the President in the White House. Maybe being the President of the US is not as glamorous as we all think if one has to forego his privacy and freedom.Every word the President utters must be well thought off, and the consequences of the words calculated ahead of time by his team. A US President goes through rehearsals before giving speeches and before standing in front of journalists. He is always surrounded by a team of experts advising him of how he should answer questions, and which questions should not be answered. One wrong word could mean a slide in approval ratings.The Secret Service also protects the President's family. Could you imagine an unfriendly country kidnapping the President's daughter? What would the President do in such a case? Would he make the wrong decisions in order to save his daughter? Would his daughter come first, or the country? Would the President be relieved of his duties in such a situation as not to compromise US security? This series will answer a lot of these questions.This series will also show you the relationship between the President and his staff. The Vice-President is not necessarily always on the President's side, and he often has his own agenda. Sometimes he would act to his own benefit in order to gain popularity for a possible run at the Presidency. Politics can be a dirty business, and a very selfish one.I enjoyed learning about the press core in the White House, and how they retrieve news. I now watch CNN in a new light.The characters in this series are well thought off, very believable, and likable. There is one character I did not particularly like, and I think he was later replaced in other Seasons. Martin Sheen plays the President, and I don't think anyone could have played the part better.This series is exciting, with many twists. The series ends with an attempted murder at the US President and his daughter, and someone is shot, but we don't know who. You'd have to watch Series 2 to find out.If you've always wanted to learn more about the US Presidency and US politics in general, this series will be a great start.  Get your notebook out and join US Presidency 101! You are going to enjoy this course.	5.0	An inside look at the US Presidency.	2007-10-28	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AI2DVCXEEZEYE	SallySaysSo	I loved this show when it first aired and I honestly cannot believe how well it's held up 13 years later. You already know that the West Wing is a fascinating, tremendously well-written, well-acted, behind-the-scenes look at the day-to-day life of the President and his executive staff. What you probably don't remember is the optimism, hope and pride you felt watching it. This is the perfect antidote to a long, dirty, partisan political season. Likely to freak you out: We still face nearly identical political, military and social problems.  Cherry on top: lots of nice little civics lessons from the absolutely charming Martin Sheen! Highly recommended -- especially for political junkies.	5.0	Extraordinary	2012-11-23	0	0	0

The sets, characters, dialogue, storyline and acting is some of the best ever presented. I saw every original episode and felt it was time to view them again.I have gone from Plasma to LED/LCD and am getting a little too much 'blurring' and 'jittering' which of course is a technical problem.Anyway I am totally satisfied with the commercial-less production.	5.0	As government should be...	2014-06-28	0	0	0

I have been hooked ever since.  playing them in order, and I am currently in the beginning part of season 3.  However, after watching Season 1, I immediately went on line and luckily found Season 1 DVD being released.  I will watch Season 1 episodes in order from my DVDs.  I think I will still enjoy now I know the characters better.What hooked my on the show was the acting.  Just about all the actors have awards, they are all top notch.  You know they are just actors, but I find myself really caring for the characters.  There have been multiple times when an episode has made me burst out load with laughter and there has been times when this show has bought me to tears.Josh and the President are my favorite characters, but I really am impressed and enjoy all the characters.

I am now watching the entire series for the second time.  This is a human point of view rather than a governmental point of view.  I think I didnt watch it when it was on TV was because I felt it would be too polical.  It is funny, witty, romantic, dramatic....each character will tell you their story and you watch them evolve and grow.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A373LY69LKT8CA	shopgirl76	I'm too young to say this, but I'm going to say it anyway: they just don't make tv like this anymore. This show was epic in the same way that Friends was epic (even had a tiny cameo appearance by Matthew Perry!) - just a different genre. The cast was amazing, and both the writing acting was of such an uncommonly superior caliber that the show remains one of the best there is.Yes, you have to have a passing interest in politics to enjoy this. Personally, I think it's best if you occasionally take a break to watch something else so you can appreciate it again, rather than continuously watching it without interruption. Either way, solid gold performance by the main cast, including the dearly departed Kathryn Joosten, who played Mrs. Landingham, and John Spencer, who played the iconic and unforgettable cornerstone character of Leo McGarry.Just an amazing show.	5.0	Remains one of THE BEST tv shows EVER	2013-08-08	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1VY2CG81I1JRR	SingingDesigner	"I've been watching the series streamed on my Amazon Prime.  Having never seen the show prior to this stretch, and really not following the critical acclaim for the show, I'd really never felt inspired to tackle the series until after watching and enjoying ""The Newsroom"" by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin.I'm sure that the one or two of you that happen to stumble on my review, and have bothered to continue to read it, are probably more familiar with the show than I was, and regardless of what I have to say, have or will watch it regardless.  All I can say is that it is a real kudos to NBC that they let the show be produced with such a magnificent standard of intelligence that one has to either be sharp as a tack to follow it live, or else they rewatch a recorded copy.  Nonetheless, it moves fast in it's dialog and presumes that folks will keep up.I'm currently now into Season 4.  I have no idea what's to come (other than I'd heard in advance about changes in the Presidents staff due to health and contractual issues with certain actors) but I'm thoroughly engaged in the action.  I'd also heard that Season 4 was the last for Mr. Sorkin; if the series noticeably suffers as a result, I may drop out of the series.For now, I will say that the acting and writing is absolutely terrific, the flow of the action works well, and (perhaps the greatest compliment) that the show's various stories not only arc from episodes and moments within the season, but even moments from earlier seasons.  Which means that, to follow certain story lines, you really need to watch the whole series.  I so admire that in a series.  It works on it's own terms, and expects it's audience to comply.For all of my heaps of praise, I will add that it's not perfect (thus 4 stars).  While NBC does deserve it's kudos, it remains a very idealized version of American politics.  So far anyway, it tackles some complexities but avoids others, such as the influence of money in politics and various matters of corruption.Also, President Bartlett and his staff seem like an immensely likeable and extraordinarily intelligent bunch, fast thinking and amazingly clever, it's a bit irritating that there's hardly any noticeable deviation from this characterization.  I know this is Sorkin (I see it on ""The Newsroom"" as well) but it still makes the show feel like a show... contrived.  I start with shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad"" as the 5-star bar, where the characters are much more complex and fully realized.  On West Wing, the characters are simply less believable as real people.So, to sum up, after 3-1/2 seasons, I'm really impressed with the groundbreaking standard of quality for West Wing as a network TV series, but for all of it's admirable qualities, it's not as great as some of the non-network TV shows I've seen."	4.0	Review for seasons 1-3	2013-02-13	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A16N5JS79WO5DD	Sissy Kirsteen	The West Wing is one of the best TV series ever &#8211; a real classic. The characters are so well defined and brought to life in an extraordinary way.  One of the things I really appreciate about Aaron Sorkin is how he presents men in deep relationships of respect, loyalty and love with strength and commitment: the relationship between the President and Leo is one example. Actually, all the characters are excellently formed, leading one to get more and more invested in them.  One could write pages about the characters!The writing, the photography, the acting &#8211; all really first rate.  The fact that you may not be interested in politics is not important; the show will draw you in without insisting that you agree with anything.Highly recommended!	5.0	First Rate!	2014-02-22	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1FTP05X2884ZW	"SJ ""aussieindy"""	"This is my favourite show of the past ten years and to have the entire first series at my fingertips is outstanding. The extras are interesting but to have each episode to watch again (and again) further reinforces how excellent the entire production is.The writing,as is often acknowledged,is A1 and in the frantic pace of the first viewing a couple of years ago, some of it was accidently missed. Now I can catch every word and expression and it adds so much to my overall liking of the show. It has also taught me a great deal about how the government ""works"" in the USA....very educational! Bring on the second series as quickly as possible, it is unfair to leave us hanging. If you are already a fan of the show, get the DVD's and relive the magic. If you have only heard a whisper about how good the show is, it's not too late to become a fan, grab the DVD's and find out for yourself what all the fuss is about.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	`The West Wing: Season One' is a political TV series that is made with intelligence, humour and gripping storylines. Following a Democrat president and his team of senior staff, this series explores various issues of American politics and world affairs. You don't need to know a great deal about politics to enjoy this show as there is a strong human element to the stories, but some background knowledge would only serve to heighten your enjoyment. This covers events such as the making of and controversy surrounding gun laws, privacy laws, the death sentence, reaction to terrorists and a conflict between India and Pakistan and that is just in the first half of the series! This is fast paced and intelligent and you need to keep your attention on the events on-screen or you can quickly become lost in the story, but this is a positive element in my view. This isn't dumbed down and the audience is treated with respect throughout. Although this is stylised, it does give some idea of what life must be like in the halls of high level political decision making and it makes for fascinating and gripping viewing. Once you buy this you will want to get the rest of the series' and keep watching the various stories unfold, especially after the end of series cliff hanger. This was highly lauded for a reason and is top TV making at it's best.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	5.0	West Wing 1	2011-01-13	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A31N0XY2UTB25C	Stephanie Sullivan	The west wing is one of very few series I can watch over and over again. I get sucked right in every time and love it.The outstanding dialogue and incredible acting made the the west wing seemed more real than our actual president at the time. It came out in 2000 just after the supreme court had decided an election rather than the voters. The real presidency seemed more unreal than the comfort-food presidency of Jeb Bartlett.More than being comforting it motivated my politifcal involvement in the real world. That government might just be full of good people that want to do the right things to make the country better, but may disagree on how to do it. The inspriation of the west wing help me shake the words of President Regan when he said &#34;government is the problem&#34;. It isn't the problem, unless it's made to be. Government can be a solution and I want to help it succeed in making things better for all of us.That's what the West Wing, especially season 1, means to me.	5.0	One of the very best shows ever	2013-02-10	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2I2A7N3OCPNW4	"T. A. Daniel ""Alex"""	The West Wing is one of the best shows to have aired in the past 20 years, and probably in all of television. It is an hour long drama that focuses on the inner workings of the White House. The pilot finds the White House's staff still adjusting to their newly won roles: a deputy chief of staff makes a gaffe on television, the president injures himself in an accident, and most pressing, over 1000 Cuba refugees are currently making their way to Miami, Florida.  Viewers can expect similar plot lines packed into each episode.Creator Aaron Sorkin (who writes almost every episode in the first four seasons of the show) does a fantastic job keeping the drama interesting and realistic. The characters are well developed, and the dialogue is spectacular. It's hard to keep up with what it is exactly everyone does here in this first episode, but it quickly comes together in subsequent episodes. There is political rhetoric here, and while the administration featured here is Democrat, much of the sensibilities here are populist rather than partisan. Republicans won't be angered, etc... Sorkin does a great job straddling the line and giving both sides great platforms.The first season ends with a pretty massive cliff hanger that will leave viewers scrambling to watch the next season.  The ending isn't completely unexpected -- there are hints to it earlier in the season, but it is shocking nonetheless.The West Wing is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys television dramas.	5.0	One of the Best Television Dramas Ever	2012-08-12	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A1DIAO0YY7HJW9	Tat2dLady	I have really enjoyed this series and it has helped to open my eyes to the processes in which politics work. I realize that there isn't quite as much sunshine and happiness as is shown on television, but I have learned more about the deal-making and backstabbing that goes on - they certainly didn't teach us about that in civics class (how old am I, right?)  Anyway, what I thought was supposed to be a show about a noble profession has become just as drama-filled as any daytime soap opera.  So, it's enjoyable to watch, there's lots of things going on, constant crises and hardly any of them have to do with running the country.I love it!  LOL	4.0	Great series!	2013-02-13	0	0	0
B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A31Y9DLKVASJQY	"T. Bratz ""gwfeds0"""	West Wing is my all-time favorite TV show, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this collection.  I was pleasantly surprised by just how good it was.  After Aaron Sorkin left the show it seldom came close to the quality of the first few seasons.  The writing, acting, lighting and attention to detail made this show great.  Watching the first season after the first post-Sorkin season was quite a shock.  The difference in quality made it seem like a completely different show.This collection also has some great extras.  There are interviews with cast and crew and some outtakes, but the best are the episodes with commentary from Sorkin, Tommy Schlamme and some of the other directors.  Any fan of the show will enjoy this stuff.  They talk about a lot of the little things, like the goldfish bowl on C.J.'s desk, which always has something in the bottom that is related to that particular show.  The viewer normally can't even see it, but they did this to ammuse themselves.This is what TV should be.	5.0	Best Show Ever	2004-10-19	3	3	0

The writing is at times humorous and at other times inspiring. Finally, I learn something new about government, or people, or the world at large every episode.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AP9RVNCXHB3OB	Thayer	"I have always been interested to political dramas. And ""The West Wing"", episode by episode, gives the audience those kinds of stories and more. From the witty and sarcastic  one-liners to the character driven stories, the show always delivers. It created a tapestry of characters that are individually and collectively engaging.Here are my personal top 5 favorite episodes of the season:1. In Excelsis Deo - A great episode that has a very positively Christmas feel. The White House staff had to deal with different things, CJ with her position on hate crimes, Sam and Josh protecting Leo from the drug scandal, Toby inexplicably affected by the death of a homeless man. Ironically only the president seems to be in the Christmas mood with his holiday shopping. The episode ended with a great montage with the white house staff all lined up while listening to the Christmas carol and then the funeral of the dead homeless man.2. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet - A great ensemble episode that showcased the unity and loyalty of the staff to the administration of Bartlett. It's a poignant episode that strengthens the viewers attachment and involvement to the characters. You root for them and you want them to succeed.3. Celestial Navigation - I love this episode. Probably the funniest episode of the season. There's so many great scenes like Josh being hounded in the press room, Sam and Toby in the prison, and CJ with the root canal. Nice use of flashbacks.4. What Kind of Day Has it Been? - I love this kind of style of storytelling. The episode opened with the last 5 minutes of the episode where nothing makes sense because we have no idea what happened prior to the scene. The opening scene ended with a cliffhanger. Then we get to see things that happened before the opening scene. I often see that kind of storytelling style in Alias, and I really like it. The last few minutes of the episode were suspenseful. A great season ender.5. Pilot - A solid series premiere that established the mood of the show as well as introducing the White House staff.Grade: A-"	5.0	The West Wing: Season One	2005-09-07	8	6	2

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AJYGQV81FSFE2	Timothy P. Scanlon	"Tendentious I was when I gave this set to my spouse for Christmas. Neither of us is a TV watcher. Most of the television scripts are as if written by 11 year olds who think they're funny or romantic. We got into this series right after the first season. So we are both seeing most or all of the episodes for the first time.First, Bartlet is the way a president SHOULD be. In fact, I talked with many a Washington ""progressive"" who watched the series during Clinton's tenure wishing he'd learn from Bartlet. He's compassionate, listens to his staff--who'd give their left leg for him, and, after a while, he recognizes that. He's bright. He thinks of others outside of his own family and circle of cronies. Most of all, he struggles with the difference between morality and politics. (No, I'm not endorsing Martin Sheen for president. His is a character. He may even be a great guy in real life, probably is. Which means he'd probably be eaten alive by my neighbors in Washington!)The casting is fabulous. (I'm a little confused as to why they don't interview Rob Lowe like they do the others, unless they put together the whole set after he'd decided to leave the cast.) In fact, the one whose character is closest to the opposite of his personality is Richard Schiff (Toby). He's so bitter, even self-absorbed in the script and seems to laugh and joke around freely while off camera, somewhat like Jonathan Frakes in ""Star Trek, the Next Generation"" first season. One of my favorite lines of his occurs in the pilot when a fundamentalist preacher suggests  what would attract teens to indecent thoughts. Watch for yourself to hear Toby's response.The rest of the cast gives constant accolades to Allison Janney (CJ). I'll take their words for it. I think she's good, but the others are too.Well, Rob Lowe--while good--seems to take himself a little too seriously. I do like his stands in favor of the call girl he met in the pilot. He stands on principal rather than on what others are supposed to think of him. That's among the examples of how the stories are real-life. I mean, people do have inappropiate relationships for which they have to answer; the do have power trips. You get my drift.Oh, if you're looking for bloopers, there are some in the last disk. But fortunately, they're not overdone. (That's where I see Shiff, Sheen, and Janney break into laughter frequently.)Forgive me for not mentioning the others. You're all good, you really are.For what it's worth, my favorites are probably ""In Excelsis Deo"" and ""Let Bartlet Be Bartlet,"" not necessarily in that order, with the episode dealing with the death penalty (I can't remember the title) ranking just a little behind. In fact, that death penalty episode is characteristic of the value of the scripts: the mix of humor and seriousness is pleasantly done. Most TV drama scripts are such that, if life were really that way, most of us would be suicidal or anti-depressant users. Lots of funny things do happen. They fit well into the spectacular scripts.The only thing I have against the script is that there is too much focus on the 12-step model for Leo McGarry's constant ""recovery."" That's why I only give this fabulous set 4 stars. I was inclined to speculate here why the writer, Aaron Sorkin, stressed that but I don't think Amazon.com likes it when critics do that. Suffice it to say that that model is at least controversial. One might rationalize it for dramatic effect, but it would be just as solid for Leo to say, ""Look, I used to drink too much and I did some valium. I'm in control, don't do it any more, so get off my case!""May I add what is probably common sense to most: when one watches interviews and commentaries such as the ones in this set, it's very hard to distinguish between reality and hype. Oh, well, what sells is hype. Take it all with a grain of salt, but enjoy this series. It's a great show, and the whole set is a real prize."	4.0	One of the best ever TV scripts.	2004-01-18	6	4	2

I didn't tune in when it first started because I just couldn't picture being entertained by politics, but I was wrong. I caught a 1st season episode on Bravo one weekend (the show had probably been on the air for several seasons at that point), and I was hooked instantly. It's so smart and informative. And whether or not you're a Democrat or a Repulican etc, they make valid arguments for each political party. My favorite characters are Sam, Josh, and Toby. Although they can be arrogant at times, they're such good guys overall. I fell in love with all three of them. Anyway, my favorite episode of the entire series is in this first season--Celestial Navigation. It's so funny how badly Josh mucks things up the one time he takes over for C.J. during a press briefing. Plus, the seasons after continue to be just as clever & intriguing to watch (except for being annoyed by Donna from the very start).	5.0	A Nice Surprise...	2007-03-31	1	1	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	This DVD has the first eleven episodes with a bonus of interviews with the writer Sorkin and most of the cast.West Wing is one of the better ensemble dramas ever screened on television. However it was only after seeing the interviews of Sorkin and the cast members that one realised how it was done. Sorkin is clearly highly intelligent and his scripts are powerful and the basis of the show. This becomes clear when you hear the cast members talk. They lack the presence of their on screen personalities and although they are talented actors one realises that it is the structure of the plot and their lines which creates the characters.Sorkin also indicates how in reality the plots have a high level of sentimental resolutions. One doesn?t pick this up in watching it. Sorkin explains how he uses humour to break up the flow of the story and to prevent the material becoming mawkish. He also indicates that although the White House portrayed is a Democrat one, he interplays conservative and liberal story lines. On first viewing the show it appeared to be moderately liberal but on re-watching the episodes on the CD Sorkin is right. The second episode is highly nationalistic and the last scene is the character played by Martin Sheen regretting that Americans cannot walk the earth with the same protection that was afforded the ancient romans. In other episodes the character Donna argues strongly the Republican line on taxation.Watching these eleven episodes after watching them on TV some years ago, one is still struck by the strength of the characters, the frantic pace of the action and the fact that the scenes are seldom static. Even though one begins to see that there is a sentimentality which initially slips by you, one can still be moved when Toby arranges the funeral and honour guard for the homeless war veteran. It is however the humour and intelligence which is the driving force of the series and what makes it so watchable.	5.0	Best Show on TV	2002-08-26	122	103	19

I beleive this to be one of the most intelligently written and acted television shows. Im a huge Sopranos fan and I think it rivals even that. The dialogue is brisk and you do have to listen carefully to what they are saying, but, thats a benefit of owning it on DVD, you can reverse it and listen again. I think the cast, beginning with Martin Sheen and John Spencer are at the top of their game. This was a show that once I watched an episode I wanted more.

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2RZRJ3HBN3I4C	True Independent	The West Wing is smart, emotionally intelligent, dramatically coherent, and a worthy civics lesson. So much of what we hear in political debate is about undermining the other side that we forget that our democracy is set up to invite people of principle to pitch in, to use their brains, to engage with others in a shared endeavor that makes policy that improves people's lives and makes a freer future possible. This show focuses attention on that aspect of the hard work of doing politics: people of good will, sifting through the frenzy of challenges and blind-side distractions, trying to find ways to get it right, so that their work does good things for other people. This is not fantasy; it is what drives most people to get involved in the process in the first place.	5.0	An Inspired, Dramatic, Far-ranging Civics Lesson You Can't Stop Watching	2014-03-08	0	0	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	AFMCVTV7YGZ2J	"Videoman ""VDman"""	The first season of The West Wing definately gets you hooked.  The great thing about this show is the characters.  The show picks up about a year into the Bartlett Presidency, and this season ender is the kind of shocker that leads nicely into season 2.  I liked the West Wing on NBC, and I bought season one because of the episode In Excelis Deo.  This episode is, in my opinion, the best one ever made.  I got sucked into the lives of Josh and Donna, Leo, and Sam Seaborn.  The end of every West Wing season is a cliffhanger leading into the next.  Before I knew what was happening, I owned all 7 seasons.I don't really have much of a life, so once I had all 7 seasons, I took a vacation from work, and marathoned all 7 seasons.  I don't recommend doing that, but it was cheaper than driving somewhere, and more entertaining than my relatives.  Check out season one.  Put it in your Netflix cue, or whatever.  Once you watch it, you'll want more.  It's intellectual candy for the dummy box.	5.0	Gets you hooked	2007-11-16	2	2	0

B00005JLF3	The West Wing: Season 1	A2AAI6XEUZBY4W	yodaslink	"It's hard to find something satisfying on television nowadays. Given the girth of tiresome reality shows and the straining, over-the-top ploys of hospital and other ""dramas,"" its a good thing that the first season of ""The West Wing"" is preserved on DVD for those times when whatever is on the tube disappoints.The season begins with an introduction of the various senior members of the White House staff, who help President Bartlett (Martin Sheen) with his job of leading the country. It continues with a focus on the staff and all the work that they put into running the country before things even get to the President, while offering plenty of glimpses into the charismatic and good-hearted President as he tackles the unique joys and responsibilities that come with the most important job in the world. We get a glimpse of Washington Politics and the extraordinary-yet-everyday people fighting the good fight to help make the country better.This first season of ""The West Wing"" has it all - witty dialogue, moving and suspenseful story lines, and superlative acting and direction. From the introduction of the President in the first episode to the cliff-hanging ending, you won't be disappointed with a single of the twenty-one episodes in the first season. In addition to its pure entertainment value, its hard to watch ""The West Wing"" without becoming excited about American politics and our potential for great leaders, if only for an hour at a time. Easily 4.5 stars out of 5, with certain episodes worthy of the highest rating (""Mr. Willis of Ohio"" and ""In Excelsis Deo"" in particular)."	4.0	Excellent Executive Drama	2007-06-14	2	2	0
