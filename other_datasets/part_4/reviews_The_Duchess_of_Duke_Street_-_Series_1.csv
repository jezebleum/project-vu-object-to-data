B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A18NIX1QH8L1Z9	Abio	I was in a &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; frame of mind, hence my selection of this series....Love, love, love period pieces (like Downton Abbey) and this series satisifed that  yearning.  The main character, Louisa, was entertaining and brilliant.  She kept my interest in the series going from one episode to the next and from series one to series two.  The Duchess... was educational, informative and entertaining.  I learned that  the issues women faced back in the day were surprisingly, similar to the issues  women face today... whether the issue centered on a career minded person, like Louisa, or leaned towards the domestic, stay at home care taker.  Louisa, was exception to the rule, for she chose to have a career and  life path ...she was true to herself and to all who surrounded her...excellent series to involve yourself in for a turn of the century experience.	4.0	In a Downton Abbey Frame of Mind	2014-01-16	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AEKZL04PZT00E	"Alberta Camus ""AlCa"""	This is a magnificent Cinderella tale, though to characterize it as such does it no justice.  After having first seen it years ago on Masterpiece Theater, I saw that videos were for sale (Parts 1 and 2).  That was years later and the cost was exorbitant.  Then it was offered a few years later and the price was something like $100.  I didn't go for it.  I am so glad it is on Netflix.  Gemma Jones who plays Louisa is fabulous.  The acting, the storyline (taken from true events), the costumes, the sets, all transport one into a wonderful world of life drama.  This is a no-miss hit.	5.0	Still one of the best series around for those who like period works.	2014-02-22	0	0	0

The lead character is brassy, beautiful, bold & has a softness that rarely comes out. She takes care of her foundlings just like a mama bear would her cubs. She doesn't always do things above board but has a moral center that's unshakable. The supporting cast is colorful and adds the spice to the soup that is this show. I really hope they continue to make new episodes. It's rare to find period pieces on tv that work & this one definitely works. Huzzah!	5.0	Huzzah for Duchess	2014-01-11	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1V7AA5P6JX09D	"Amazon Customer ""bookend"""	Well, the poor girl with a lot of ambition to be a famous cook/chef, becomes just that, but more. The trials and tribulations are very dramatic, and this actress is great in the part. I would never have recognized her in her other roles,eg as Morse's fancy, never realized, in &#34;Morse.&#34; (Gemma Jones) Her personal morality portrayed is modern though, ie lack therof. I doubt very much if that was the kind of morality a young lady of her caliber would have had in her day. A tough risk-taking, no nonsense girl would have much more likely been a strongly religious type! Ladies (and men) of wishy-washy morals, at least in the post-Victorian era, contrary to movie-makers portrayals, rarely shine as heroines or heroes. And she insisted on strict morality in her employees, if not in her clientele. Well written, brilliant acting and directing, very entertaining, if you enjoyed Downton, Upstairs, Sherlock, you'll enjoy this!	5.0	Duchess	2013-12-16	0	0	0

It's different from Dowton Abbey or the new Upstairs-Downstairs in that first few episodes seem disjointed rather than a continuous series.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2YWKFKQ0L42AJ	Ann - North Carolina	I saw this series on PBS years ago and fell in love with the characters.  When I saw that the entire series was for sale at Amazon, I bought it immediately.  This series is one of the earlier Master Piece series when they really were master pieces and based on a true story.  The main character is a woman of Cockney (poor) descent who desperately wants to learn to cook.  After a rough &#34;internship&#34;, she because famous for her very sophisticated cooking and comes to the attention of the current King of England.  It is hinted that she had an affair with the King.  She opened her own &#34;boarding&#34; house still serving excellent food but also quietly providing private rooms upstairs for very rich gentlemen who want an evening alone in a bedroom with their lover.  I can't go very far into this because there are cool twist to it that are impossible to explain in a few sentences.  If you remember this series, by all means buy it.  It holds up beautifully.	5.0	Master Piece Theatre on PBS - True Story of Rags to Riches.  Riveting.	2013-11-07	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A34XJ34R5GTT5O	Barbara Albert	I am watching this series on Amazon, and have been watching an episode nightly,almost through season 2. It is very charming, and I find that even though the character of Louisa Trotter is front and center in every episode, Gemma Jones manages to hold my attention and command it. The writers have developed her in a consistent and believable fashion, and her eccentricities and pluck never become cloying. There are a few great supporting male roles too, and Merriman, the waiter, and The Major, come to mind. They both add so much to the series. I particularly like the understatement of how much a woman could achieve in the days before suffrage and well before women's lib. The script actually points that out in one episode when Louisa acknowledges that she is very aware that she herself has no gender issues when it comes to achieving what she has set out to do. The few things that annoyed me, watching this series in such condensed time, as I say, nightly instead of weekly, were the squeaky shoes of Starr, the doorman, and Merriman, as they cross the Bentinck 's lobby, and this is frequently and in every episode. It is like scratching a fingernail on the blackboard, but on some level it adds to the charm, I suppose, and I am almost certain it was intentional. This is a hotel with no pretenses, afterall.  I was also less than satisfied with the portrayal of Fred, Starr's fox terrier and constant companion. He holds the place of the Bentinck's mascot, a permanent fixture in a basket in the lobby, but he has the least personality of any fox terrier I have known. The breed is known for its quirkiness and sociability, but poor little Fred , chained to that lobby bed, has almost no chance to strut his stuff, and it made me feel sorry for him. All in all, this is a very entertaining production with some very fine performances.	4.0	Some great performances	2014-03-25	0	0	0

The &#34;Dutchess&#34; is from the working class, but with clear goals, and a ton of hard work and determination, she makes a good life for herself in a vocation that was not particularly welcoming to women.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2PWUIQG57O1AZ	Beverley Strong	"I have just finished a marathon viewing of this collection of 5 DVD's. not having seen it since it aired on Australian television, many years ago. I love it more this second time around for its' sheer quality of production, acting, furnishings and dressing, all of which are absolutely first class. Louisa Layton is a working class girl of humble background who is determined to raise her place in life by becoming the first famous female cook in a world dominated by men. Under the tutelage of a French chef, she does exactly this and, while working as a free lance cook, comes under the notice of Edward, Prince of Wales. A notorious womaniser, Edward insists that his ladies are always married, thus avoiding a scandal should any ""little"" accident ocurr, and so a marriage is arranged between Louisa and Gus Trotter, the butler of one of Edward's friends. Louisa at first objects strongly to the whole idea but is overwhelmed by royal attention and the promise that she would always be under the royal protection, even when the affair faded. With the money earned from her working as a top chef under royal patronage, she buys The Bentinck, a private hotel where she allows only the cream of Society to be guests. After a brief and disastrous marriage to Gus the butler (who squanders all of her money)she meets and is given financial backing by Charles, Viscount Tyrell, later Lord Hazelmere, and a passionate love affair begins. Louisa has Charles' daughter, Lottie, who is boarded out with a couple on his estate in Yorkshire, while Louisa and Charlie agree to have just a friendship as he lives almost permanently at the Bentinck and their love affair is too disruptive to her business life. Charlie is also aware of his need to marry and provide an official heir. I am now waiting impatiently for Series 2 to be released here on DVD, so that I may continue to enjoy the lives of the guests and staff of the Bentinck and to continue to drool over the magnificent gowns worn by Louisa, which are gems of perfection to anyone who has a love of fine costuming in movies."	5.0	Impeccable!	2007-06-02	4	4	0

Audio management is somewhat worse than that captured with any parent's digi-cam at a high school production of &#34;Oklahoma&#34;. Video quality? Well... after all... it was the BBC in the 70's.Nonetheless, compared to most of today's network fare, the Duchess rocks. Several characters were wrought well enough to capture interest and entertain.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AWR80FA3IQ633	Bookworm	The beginning episodes are better than several of the last ones.  During the earlier episodes the family background of the &#34;Duchess&#34; is revealed, and I felt a great deal of sympathy for her and developed great admiration for this Cockney woman who became very successful in spite of her background in the class-conscious environment that still exists in the UK, and was particularly at play during Edwardian England. She did what she had to do to reach the considerable degree of  success that she did, including marriage to a man she barely knew and, briefly, was mistress to the Prince of Wales (an affair which he ended when Queen Victoria died and he became King Edward VII).She was not always easy on her own staff, which is an understatement, but is typical behaviour of people who have had to prove themselves by becoming perfectionists. However, she was kindness personified when she encountered people in distress, and when she was particularly harsh to staff members, she didn't always apologize for her rudeness but made up for it in her own way.Once her identity and character were established, the storylines wavered off track at times.  One episode (No.6, I believe) involved an American who was duped out of a considerable amount of money by one of her hotel guests who was an imposter. The storyline wasn't very interesting, and the actor's American accent was all over the country. In the same sentence he might sound like someone from the Deep South, then from the Midwest, New England, the West and from various levels socio-economic levels.While I wasn't spellbound by this series, it did hold my interest enough that I'm going to watch the second season of the show..	3.0	A BBC series from the 1970s, based upon a real person	2014-04-04	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	APLJ9R85ES702	breezy0413	"The unfortunate lower class circumstance, and how it was so often manipulated to the benefit of the upper class, is the thematic backdrop to this John Hawkesworth series. In the same vein as other soap-opera-type dramas of the 70's, this one will hook you at the first episode, and have you calling up your local librarian to scout out the elusive Series 2.Strictly speaking, I am not a fan of ""based-on real life story"" t.v., but this is a winning example of quality BBC dramatic production. So much was done right in the way of depicting the social mores and economic conditions of the early 1900's, that the viewer feels sympathy for the trials and tribulations of the characters; but humor is not left out.  There are some hilarious exchanges between the porter Starr (John Cater) and head waiter Merriman (John Welsh), and Gemma Jones does not disappoint as the headstrong hotel proprietor Louisa Trotter.  Historical significance of the times is not merely implied. Political events such as the rising of the suffragette movement to the national mourning at King Edward's death are woven into the storylines of the episodes themselves.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A220NA6UD58PPR	Bright Star	Amazon Prime is becoming even more of a joke than it used to be.First Season 2 was not available, now they start charging $2 per episode for Season 1 as well. At least Netflix has a lot more choices, for the same price.I have the feeling Amazon is being the Trojan horse of the streaming industry, drawing users away from Netflix, then moving titles to pay-per-view (as is the case here). Once Amazon becomes a popular venue, the content providers can simply remove titles from Netflix (which they have done with this show).And yes, the show is good, so I am giving it 5 stars. But I will NOT pay Amazon $2 per episode to see it, and in fact will never support Amazon over Netflix, for the reason I stated above.	5.0	Good Show -- But Bad Deal For Consumers	2012-05-20	3	1	2

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"After the hugely-successful ""Upstairs Downstairs"" came to an end, writer/producer John Hawkesworth crossed over to the BBC to create another weekly period series, THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET, set against the backdrop of London in the Edwardian era, leading up to the outbreak of the First World War.  The series was partially-based on hotelier Rosa Lewis, the legendary Chef de Cuisine and owner of London's Cavendish Hotel.For a woman, unmarried and with no independent fortune to support her, London can be a dangerous place.  Armed only with a fierce determination, Louisa Leyton (Gemma Jones) aims to become the greatest cook in the city - if not the entire country.  Studying under the supervision of esteemed society chef Monsieur Alex (George Pravda), Louisa learns the tricks of the trade, but, against her better judgement, finds herself pressured to get married, if only for the fact that most lady cooks, for respectability's sake, go under the moniker of ""Mrs"".  Thus, Louisa Leyton becomes Louisa Trotter, but her husband, former butler Augustus (Donald Burton) hits the bottle when his wife's career overshadows his own small ambitions - to say nothing of Louisa's clandestine affair with no less than the Prince of Wales himself!  Louisa believes she has found the ideal solution to their various problems when she takes over the lease of the Bentinck Hotel in Duke Street - there, Augustus can take the spotlight as manager whilst Louisa whips up her culinary marvels in the kitchen, but it's not long until Augustus begins abusing his power, driving the business into the ground by squandering most of the profits on drink.  Louisa throws him out, and with her usual ""roll your sleeves up, just get on with it"" attitude, attempts to turn the fortunes of the Bentinck around single-handed...Series 1 of THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET takes a few episodes to properly gather momentum, but pretty soon you'll be hooked on the daily dramas of Louisa, her staff and the various guests of the Bentinck.  Gemma Jones was born to play Louisa, the steel-cast ""duchess"" of the title.  The character can often be quite unsympathetic and rough-edged at times, and it's largely thanks to Ms Jones' performance that she remains so ""likeable"" despite her harsher moments.Co-starring as the Bentinck's unflappable staff are Victoria Plucknett (Mary the chamber-maid and Louisa's long-time confidante), John Welsh (elderly waiter Merriman), John Cater (doorman Mr Starr); and Richard Vernon (Major Smith-Barton, the hotel's main permanent guest).  Christopher Cazenove is Lord Charlie Haslemere, Louisa's great love.In addition to John Hawkesworth, THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STRET also reunited several of the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" scriptwriters (Rosemary Anne Sisson, Jeremy Paul), composer Alexander Faris; and directors (Bill Bain, Simon Langton, Raymond Menmuir)."	5.0	landmark BBC series remains an absolute delight	2012-06-17	1	1	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1XXZBXPK09LZL	Caffarelli	This first season of the two-season BBC period drama of 31 episodes from 1976-77 has staying power. It could be broadcast on PBS next Sunday night, and it would be a crowd-pleaser. The sets look good, sometimes lavish; the photography of food and flowers is sensual; and the acting's captivating. At the center of the drama is Louisa Trotter (brilliantly played by Gemma Jones). A Cockney working girl since the age of 12, Louisa has one aim in life: to become the best cook in England. She largely succeeds, at some personal cost. Along the way she becomes the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London, discreetly and exclusively catering to the wants and desires --- not all of them culinary --- of Edwardian swells. That service leads to a number of the series' episodes. The most enjoyable and fascinating episodes, however, are the ones that focus directly on Louisa, a complex, flawed, but very appealing character.	5.0	The Girl Still Has It	2014-01-10	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AK1VX5TCQ3OR0	C. Anderson	Excellent series.  The court room scene is hilarious.  I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs?  In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic.  What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century?  Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them.When will series 2 be released?	5.0	Anti Americanism in British TV dramas	2006-03-03	4	3	1

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A19F105LFK9JFS	Carol Darling	Loved the show. Just to see the period dresses and outfits are fun. Gemma Jones has played in Bridgette Jones, as the Mother, and the mother in Sense and Senibility with Kiera Knightly. She is a seasoned actor and I wanted to watch her as an actress in her younger days. She sings and reminds me of an old Vaudville stage performer. I'm sure she started that way. I was very surprised how deep and loud her voice was but I guess she learned that on stage because she had to project her voice to the very back of the theater. It made me more interested in WW I and why it lasted so long and why it started to begin with years ago. I learned a bit of history and love seeing series that take you back in time and it does teach you about history and what people of that era thought and felt during that period. It was a wonderful period piece and I not done watching it but will be sad when it's completed along with my journey into the early 1900s.	5.0	Loved the show	2014-07-06	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1QQBR1UPS2SME	Carole Eberhardt	The stories are completed with each episode so it is not as if you are watching a serial and can't miss out on one.  The only requirement is the first couple of episodes so that you can see how such a rough character came to run such a very posh establishment.  I like the episodes but frankly Mrs. Trotter's voice is rather grating. Her accent never softens and her grammar does not change although exposed to the upper classes in society. It is made to appear that she never learns to speak with an accent that is less cockney which is hard to believe. Maybe the writers thought that was what would make her endearing but I personally find it hard to believe that rubbing elbows with the gentry did nothing to improve her use of the language. Also since she came by her position in life by being somewhat immoral it is strange that once successful she is very critical of others  personal failingsAnd enjoyable series all the same.	4.0	The Duchess is Far from Regal.	2014-02-14	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A28WJWCDYZE9RD	"C. Mattoon ""christymatt"""	Being a regency and victorian book fan I've often thought that I would like to have lived in an earlier era.  But it goes without saying that I would have to come from the priveledged classes.  Now I've become fascinated with the Edwardian period; the emergence 'upstairs' on one hand from the rigid Victorian and into the more 'casual' of the new period while those below-stairs are pretty much locked in the past.  We in the 21st century truly have no idea of how people lived then; the strict class system, the drudgery of those who were employed to wait on them hand to foot and the lack of ability to speak up, to demand rights, to have a day off when desired, even to be ill.  A glimpse back in time which confirms how very lucky we are to live in this day and age.	4.0	Another interesting view of downstairs	2014-03-20	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A18SL6NV2RU0Z5	Colin Harrison	"While for me ""Upstairs,Downstairs"" remains the finest Masterpiece Theatre series of all time, this one runs it a close second.  Gemma Jones is superb as Louisa Trotter, the Cockney Cook/Hotelienne who never loses her blunt common-sense ways or her heavy cockney accent even after she becomes Hostess to Edwardian England's Rich and Famous.  The earlier episodes focus on Louisa's rise from assistant cook to mistress of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII).  But most of the series concerns the doings at the Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive, private establishment in London owned and run by Louisa.  With few exceptions, one's family has to have been listed in Debrett's Peerage for at least 100 years before one can book a room at the Bentinck.  And yet, Louisa's selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery on her part as it is of her passionate commitment to being The Best at whatever she does.Thee entire series is rich in characters and incident, and in fact Jones/Louisa is very much in the background in several of the episodes.  But she is unquestionably the dominant, and dominating, character in this series.  You haven't seen Unbridled Righteous Indignation until you've seen Louisa, in the last episode in this collection, testifying at trial on behalf of her friend, Lord Haslemere, pouring forth diatribe after diatribe in all her cockney glory.  Now THAT'S a Character!This wonderful series deserves to be much better known than it is.  Do not hesitate to acquire this set.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A36DJJ4Q8WSWFM	--corinne--	"After I spied this series on my local library's shelves & saw that it was about a female aspiring chef set in 1900-1910 London, I scooped up all the volumes.This series really surprised me: It has strong writing and attention to setting. Louisa Trotter is a outspoken, cockney chef who works her way up in her profession and British society with lots of elbow grease, an understanding of human nature, and some luck. Gemma Jones is great as Louisa Trotter and the supporting cast is very solid as well.I wasn't sure at first if this series was a miniseries or a TV series (It's TV), but it is rather Dickensian in that each episode builds on the previous. And I can pay a series no higher complement than to say that the conflict resolutions are neither trite nor perfunctory. Many allusions to historically accurate events, politicians, and contemporary culture are weaved into the storylines. I feel that I learned more about English classism and social mores from the ""Duchess"" & the Bentinck Hotel than from my semester abroad in London.If you like period drama (and comedy) & strong, nuanced heroines with many battles to fight, then you will like ""The Duchess of Duke Street."" This series stands the test of time. My only complaint is that I did not learn much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so above standard that my complaint is rendered inconsequential.Although this series began filming in 1976 the production values make it difficult to place. The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to BBC's 1979 Pride and Prejudice."	5.0	Wonderful Period Drama/Comedy of 1900-1910's London	2006-05-21	17	16	1

I'm sorry but Gemma Jones was in her late 30's when this was filmed and it showed. She would have been almost on her death bed for 1900 and clearly a spinster. I'm just having a lot of trouble considering her a beauty. She's not very attractive in this at all. Also I'm not liking how cheaply made it looks. It looks just like The Young Ones. It reminds me of a stage show. Finally, Gemma Jones speaks so loudly that I'm more annoyed than interested. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that she was once a great stage actress?

The Duchess of Duke Street has been somewhat enjoyable up until this episode (1.4)...showing the despicable side of life in early 1900's Victorian England.  With episode 1.4, however, I finally began to LIKE the lead character  --  her hard work and perseverance is something that many of us can recognize and agree with...but not until ""they're working girls, just like we are"" did I start to like the lead character.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2ZIWI1P272M4A	Elyse G. Drexler	An excellent and addictive series. Pre - Downton Abbey and a contemporary of Upstairs Downstairs, the characters in the Duchess are as compelling and maybe even more so than the other shows'What is wonderful and most interesting are the styles, lifestyle, and mores of the time. The stories are more contained in scope and therefore the characters take front and center stage. Thus far at least, WW1 and sweeping English countryside are of less significance than Louisa,her staff, and the hotel traffic that impact upon them.Some great loves, some great fights, and most of all a woman to admire, respect and peek in on as she makes her own way in a time when that was not the way to do things.	5.0	Blimey!

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2UE4BNO4730HB	Fatimah A. Rahman	This series offers an interesting and historical perspective into the class system of British society and specifically how a working class women was able to move her way out of her assigned status up into the world of the British gentry.The Duchess of Duke Street is a terrific period drama wrought with all kinds of twists and turns, surprising incidents and sardonic humor. It is inspiring because despite her cultural trappings, Louisa was not limited or afraid. Rather, she is shrewd, pragmatic and focused. She had a dream to become the best &#34;cook&#34; in London and did what was necessary to get into the right places and realize her dream. In a world when men are in charge, she manages to befriend and gain the respect of many of them. She treated all men the same, including her lovers, servants and customers- with respect and dignity...I rated the series at five stars because of the great script, the beautiful decor and fashion and the wonderful performances by the actors.Fatimah A.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A294FHLZHPTFW2	Faye	The Duchess is a pretty good story, but I find some of it on the boring side.  This series is supposed to be about Louisa learning to be the best cook in London ( which she does)...but half way thru the first season it's more about the characters that come to stay in her hotel.  The point is...I miss Louisa cooking and teaching others as well.	3.0	The Duchess	2014-01-09	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1W52YZMBXV6XF	FelineFriend	The show started off with really good potential, but by the 4th or 5th episode, it lost it's spark.  It was teased as the 'rise of a scullery maid to chef for the rich and royal.'  That rise was shown in 2-episodes, then she buys a hotel and the whole plot stagnates.  The lead character is rarely seen in the kitchen or even talking about great cooking ability.  Once in the hotel setting, the plots center mostly around that week's guests or some of the staff.  And while Gemma Jones is an excellent actress, she her character shows very little growth or change between episode 5 and 15 when season one ends.Good costumes and set designs, and the writing is fine, but the plots leave something to be desired.  I would not recommend it.	3.0	Loved the start....then it faded	2014-06-15	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1O1249K51D46A	"F.Lea ""Explorer"""	I've only watched 6 episodes so far - it is entertaining and a glimpse into the Brit way of life but sometimes the Duchess gets a little too overbearing. Starting as a scullery maid and becoming a biggie so quick is sort of a stretch but hey! gotta give her credit. Would recommend if you like drama relating to fictional accounts of British life.	3.0	It's o.k.	2013-07-31	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A361AOKAIPGRZ6	Fly4u	This series told its story through a timeline of when it was really hard for women to do what Luisa Trotter did --- own her own business. Although this was the dominant storyline, the sub-stories gave Luisa a lot of credibility as a human being, and they really showed her as a human being. I watched a couple of these episodes in the 70's and lost track of it. I'm glad I found it again on Amazon Prime and was about to watch both seasons. I must admit, I expected a different ending to the series, but the way it was ended was okay, too.	5.0	The Storyline Is Credible	2013-10-31	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AV4XC2JAJLIXW	Frank H	I have just acquired Roku and am learning how to stream various offerings through Amazon Prime. In scrolling through the Free TV programs, we happened upon the Duchess of Duke Street, and watched the first episode of Season I. It was most enjoyable, and although the program was done back in 1976, I thought the script, the acting and the various sets were every bit as effective and impactful as Downton Abbey...of course, The Duchess of Duke Street takes place in London in the early 1900's, but I thought the writers captured the class issues very well, and the stark choice given to the main character is done in almost a matter-of-fact manner, but is life altering to the one given the choice. I'm looking forward to following her exploits.	4.0	A wonderful surprise	2014-01-05	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2Z2VL2UT1TWK1	Freckles	I would give this series only two stars but it started out interestingly enough.  I had hoped for political intrigue, class struggle, and triumph of spirit in the main character.  Instead, the series settled into a boring routine of boring characters.  Suffice it say that if you were hoping for a series as interesting and enjoyable as Downton Abbey, Mr. Selfridge, or Pride and Prejudice, you will likely be disappointed.	3.0	Started off interesting enough but the Duchess became a rather one dimensional, uninteresting, unappealing charade.	2014-04-05	1	1	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A24BBCNDGEXGEC	from Oregon	Just loved this series!  Much grittier than Downton.  Each episode reveals more of each character.  Has 'upstairs, downstairs' characters: from aristocracy to cooks and maids.  Gemma Jones, as Louisa (the Duchess), from working class backgroun;  and Christopher Casanove, as Charlie, Lord Haselmere, are both endearing, irrascable at times, fantastic, as are all of the supporting actors.  Hard to believe it aired in the 1970's, it is not dated at all, and somehow seems more British than Downton.  The main plot moves slowly through the episodes, don't skip any!	5.0	As good as Downton Abbey, only better	2014-01-03	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3PUIS0PCJXB0J	Gaelyn Larrick	The Duchess of Duke Street is about a woman who is ahead ahead of her time, in that she has little interest in defining herself by a husband but instead aspires to become the greatest cook in all of England. The casting is impeccable and the lead role was played by an actress wirh whom I am unfamiliar, but she did an amazing job: I completely believed her character as authentic. The ensemble all did a remarkable job and took me right into the period that they were supposed to be in. I felt that lagged a bit towards the end of the second season but season one was really wonderful.	4.0	A wonderful ensemble piece.	2014-05-17	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AWL5W0EBD7DBV	Honey46	I've recently become enamored with British TV drama and ran across this series while searching on Kindle Prime.  I was hesitant at first because the series premiered in 1976 and I was afraid it would be outdated.  I was delighted to find out I was wrong.  The premise is like a version of Upstairs/Downstairs with &#34;Louisa Trotter&#34;, the main character, who has worked her way up from a servant in an uperclass house to a renown cook and manager to the upscale Bentnick hotel.  Each episode revolves around Louisa (The Duchess) and the hotel guests and the staff. The roles of Louisa and staff for the most part remain the same each episode with the hotel guests changing.  Perhaps because it is a period piece, taking place from 1900 to the 1920's, after 37 years it holds up very well.  Gemma Jones as the Duchess delivers a wonderful performance and the supporting actors play well off of her. Costuming is wonderful and I enjoy the small glimpse of life in London at the turn of the 20th century.  I laughed, cried and sympathized and cheered with and for the characters.  At some point I will definitely watch this series again.	5.0	Holds Up Well	2013-07-24	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AX7R31MBXPP29	Hon	I was very excited about this show in the beginning . I loved the poor girl makes it aspect and found the cooking scenes fascinating. But then it turned more soap opera-ish and became about how awful people can be to each other.The main character is still a strong woman with good business sense and an understanding of how to deal with people. However, about episode 5 I began losing interest and am only on Episode 7 now. I doubt I will finish the series.I will say, the acting is good and I enjoy seeing the ways of a different era.	3.0	Started out strong but tapered off	2014-02-04	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AJU9AJ2PMIG9E	Jaci Cybul	Louisa Trotter is a person you will not soon forget. From a young girl put into service, making it up the ranks to a famous chef, which at that time, was an all male profession. Forced to marry to remain a chef, she was very unhappy, but muddled through and made a substantial living, which she entrusted to her husband. She bought him a hotel and placed him in charge to boost his ego which was a tragic mistake. He lost all her money by his poor judgement. Louisa chucks him out and she works her way up to the top again. Falls in love and things just get more and more interesting. From start to finish you will love this feisty, determined, lovable woman. She shows all, that determination to better yourself pays off in the long run. It is all based on a true story. I bought the complete series and have watched it several times. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommend it!	5.0	Wonderful Series! Based on a true story!	2014-02-28	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	ATFA7FNCYU3AQ	"Jacqueline Bale-Johnson ""Jacque Johnson"""	This story is so close to the real life of London from 1900 on. Everything is so authentic down to the last details. It makes a good study piece. The characters are authentic and the language is just right. The Duchess is a wonderful portrayal of a Londoner of that time, she is proud, funny, charitable, and has the indomitable spirit of a Londoner. It is the story, well told, of her rise from a poor child to a famous hotel owner, her ambition to be the best cook in the world and her success. Along the way she overcomes great sadness and experiences that only make her stronger yet kinder. You will fall in love with the character and never want the story to end. For a rollicking good time watch every episode- you won't regret it. It made me homesick for London.	5.0	The Duchess of Duke Street	2014-01-29	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A38E9DTXFMQ5B4	"J. B. Keast ""Storyteller"""	Others have objected to to Emma Jones' character being so &#34;stoic and icy&#34; and how &#34;annoying&#34; she is. I concur.  Aside from her unrelenting ambition to be a famous chef at any cost (allowing herself to be prostituted to a prince)&#8212; a move that seemed at odds with her basic character, it was also hard to see how she could be considered so desirable and such a &#34;great beauty&#34; to so many men&#8212;especially to the one man who could have had anyone (and pretty much did): Edward, Prince of Wales.First, while she has lovely eyes and an enviable mane of hair (if that was really all Emma Jones' hair), that's pretty much where Mrs. Trotter's feminine allure ends.  Her gestures and mannerisms (especially the way she walks and hold her arms) are very tomboyish&#8212;make that bordering on deformed.And that voice...ugh. I realize this is not My Fair Lady where the screeching, unkempt cockney flower girl is gradually transformed into a stunning, lady-like beauty, but really...after all that time in the company of lords and ladies, one would hope that Mrs. Trotter  would have picked up a least a modicum of sophistication and refinement.  Not over the top mind you&#8212;we certainly would not like her any better if she were pretentious and full of airs. I just would like to her be a little easier on on the ears&#8212;and more alluring in the best sense of the word.Of course at her core she was a good person: kind and compassionate, and refreshingly candid, direct and no-nonsense.  But the visual and audio on Mrs. Trotter was enough to almost send me trotting off to another British show (of which I have watched dozens).In short, the only reason that I didn't tune out this series completely was the otherwise excellent cast of characters as well as great writing.  Do wish they had picked another actress for this role.	4.0	Great characters and writing&#8212;but Mrs. Trotter? Too Eliza Doolittlish for far too long.	2014-04-04	0	0	0

It has better quality than the present day trash on Cable TV.  NBC, ABC and CBShave all degenerated to garbage networks turning out low rent, low class drible not worth paying for at any price.

Rather than make the heroine a blase person, the creators flesh her out to make her reflect what London was like from late 1800s through early 1900s.  They examine the different levels of English society with a microscope, then present it to the viewers who are enchanged and reviled by what they see of the Victorian Londoners.

Perhaps a feminist story, perhaps a class struggle, perhaps a single minded determined individual.The surrounding characters and plots are all full of idiosyncrasies and a little whimsey  - at the same time totally believable both as a period piece and as well observed examples of human nature.Like a slightly more realistic and gritty Downton Abbey!	5.0	Super Blast from the Past	2013-02-10	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2RRF1THJ95KHJ	J Wilson	I was intrigued with this show - plot line and character development especially, from the opening episode up through episode 6 or so. It offered a unique view of English life through the unlikely eyes of a woman servant who works her way up in life. Overcoming cultural challenges and class distinctions made the main characters rich and worth following through the ins and outs of every day life in England at this time.  It was as if the underside of readily-known history was being revealed through the life and trials of the protagonist and those characters in her immediate circle.I was surprised and a bit dismayed when the story line began to change as the life of  the &#34;Duchess&#34; stabilized and the character I had come to admire and enjoy was relegated to a periphery role!  I gave the show 4 stars, because the story line is still interesting and well-done.  I just find it disappointing that the main characters, whose lives so attracted me initially, have been moved out of the spotlight.The show is enjoyable. I still watch it.  I am not so passionate about it now, however. I recommend persons do not get too connected to the main characters...they fade into the Victorian wallpaper much too soon!	4.0	Loved It, then I liked It!	2014-03-03	0	0	0
B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3B4UUN68843ZP	JY	For lack of anything interesting to watch on TV, I checked out The Duchess of Duke Street from my local library on a whim and was blown away by the quality of the production - the storylines, writing, acting, and direction are all top-notch. The series really does represent the very best of Masterpiece Theater.  From the first episode, my husband and I were engrossed in Louisa's story and by the time we finished watching the final episode of Series 2, it was almost like losing a member of the family, so attached had we grown to the characters. Throughout the series, Louisa and the permanent residents of the Bentnick Hotel provide countless memorable moments, some hilariously amusing and others serious, sad, and thought provoking, all the while highlighting the historical context of the period. Each of the 31 episodes more or less stands alone, but there are overarching storylines, most notably the love affair between Louisa and Lord Haslemere.  As captivating as Louisa is, her character would not be as appealing without the presence of the handsome and ever charming Lord Haslemere.  Their tragic romance reminded me of another heartbreaking couple on film, Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein in Funny Girl.  I can't praise this series highly enough.  It is a treat from beginning to end, and I would urge anyone who enjoys a well-told and superbly acted story to watch it.	5.0	Excellent mini-series!

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1GSLQM81UYUDL	Kakie	Duchess of Duke Street Season 1 was playing when my 3d child was born.  Who knew? I surely didn't have TV time.  So now, I am so enjoying quality unlike much of what is available today.  The historic period of the setting I enjoy as well as the cooking!  I do wish the Duchess continued to show her kitchen skills in more episodes, but I guess she got past that by becoming the Hotel owner.	4.0	Quality TV on my terms	2013-09-30	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AZRNGDUE0TPZF	Kathleen Hawk	"Given the age of this series, more than three decades old, and the somber tone of the main publicity photo, I wasn't exactly wild with anticipation when I started watching it. By the end of it, I was truly sorry to leave it.I'm sure other reviewers will detail the main story line of the poor and abused young girl who -- by determination, talent and the willingness to forgo everything else in life -- became the greatest cook in England. Her romantic life was extremely difficult but also, largely glamorous and enriching in many ways. Her family and coworkers were unforgettable characters. (Her parents and brother being particularly noteworthy, and her mother especially being a brilliantly acted monster of thwarted dreams and mean spirit.)To say anymore about the most interesting characters would, I'm afraid, chase potential watchers away.  And not do justice to the story lines. Suffice to say that everyone is very real, and very much a product of the times.The era is the early part of the 20th century up to and immediately after World War I. One of the powerful values of this series is how well it creates vignettes of the lives of people in both high and low positions. Louisa, the ""Dutchess,"" spends her working life serving the aristocracy and royalty, as a purveyor of cooking and later hotel services. She becomes close to them. But she is also surrounded by her own employees, whose lives are much more precarious as well as more grounded in reality. The integration of these class differences is skillfully handled by the script writers, and the acting is perfection.One of the notable aspects of the writing is how the episodes are constructed. With the exception of Louisa's life story which of course progresses through the series, the episodes are very self-contained and concern issues that rise and are resolved in the episode. While there may be multiple characters in challenge during a single episode, the structure is more play-like and focused on one important story arc, compared the the more novel-like style of multiple independent personal stories that is so common today.At first I found this a little antiquated and naive, but later I came to appreciate it for the scope it gave the designers of the show to illuminate the circumstances and details of life at that time. It created a sense of natural story-telling, rather than the artificial  and jerky cutting back and forth in modern drama that keeps the interest high but makes it almost impossible to study the scenes.The era is as much a part of this story as the characters, which is true in any period piece, but particularly so in the Dutchess of Duke Street. Where people were located and what was happening there, as well as who they were in social and economic terms, were the inseparable foundations of the entire drama. The richness of the scenes and details made me glad when particular environments were revisited in different episodes. I can't imagine the effort and expense involved in creating these scenes, as well as developing the wardrobe. But whatever it was, it was worth it. I will go back to watch this again just to study that world.Finally, no review would be complete without some comment about the character of Louisa. She is an odd protagonist for a series, and very hard to characterize in broad terms. The woman you see in the photograph that promotes this series has an expression that you will really understand only after watching the series  Toward the end, a journalist attempting to write a book about Louisa's life asks people around her what characteristics made her so successful. One resident of the hotel said it was her endless compassion and generosity. A long-time employee said it was that she was a heartless bully. Both were right, and it wasn't just because they were in the positions of customer and employee.The series borders on being ""chic flick"" material, but not really. It's not soap opera, not sentimental or cheap in any way. Love is certainly an issue but not the dominant theme (often by sheer dint of Louisa's refusal to bend), and the wartime episodes are some of the best I've seen, heart-clutching scenes of the horrors in France.I heartily recommend it as a great piece of theatrical work, but especially for armchair anthropologists who want to know what it was like a century ago for a woman who made the toughest decisions to pursue her vision of greatness."	5.0	Startlingly good period drama	2014-01-29	0	0	0

Instead, the &#34;Duchess&#34; winds up as an &#34;innkeeper&#34; but the inn is more a boarding house than an hotel. Except for staff and stars, not much weaves the weeks together. Enjoyable and commendable for a series of 70s.And yes, I admit, &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; has spoiled me for loving much of anything else!	4.0	Good but not Great	2013-09-20	0	0	0

I loved the tie in of early 1900's history to this story of Louisa Trotter, master chef and hotelier. Each episode of this 2 season PBS Masterpiece Classic has a sub-plot to the entire series which starts with Louisa's desire to become the best cook in England and ends, well I won't give that away. Duchess of Duke Street is my all-time favorite PBS series.	5.0	A Masterpiece Classic	2013-06-24	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A25TUS0K5MXF6S	LCat	I came upon this series by accident and gave it a try. I gravitate toward period pieces.The main character is indeed 'a character'.  Louisa isn't titled but she is allowed inside because of her skills as a cook. (A hard earned livelihood.)  While, at times the Louisa character is a bit 'over the top' with her loud, shrill voice, I found myself really caring about her happiness.  And the Charlie character is a nice balance for Louisa.  Their relationship is interesting and endearing. In fact, all the characters are well written and presented in various episodes.  This series was a pleasant find. If you liked Upstairs, Downstairs, and Downton Abbey you will probably enjoy this series.  It's not as polished but it is entertaining.	4.0	Step Back in History	2013-03-30	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3CSDBDV77Z0VI	lily t.	Don't let the release date and the stagy production values put you off. This is a wonderful story about a very strong minded and determined woman who rises from servant to cook to chef to royal mistress to the proprietor of an exclusive hotel. And you will be rooting for her all the way, despite the fact that she can be abrasive, annoying, and a perfectionist who is terribly judgmental and misogynistic. Add to that, her indulgence of her upper class guest's whims and her almost brutal treatment of her staff and you could almost loathe her--except that she does have character and a kind heart, along with a willingness to apologize when she knows she is wrong.Louisa does many things which are less than womanly or thoughtful--she abandons her child, she passes out white feathers during the war, she is opportunistic, and hypocritical towards the mores of other women--but that's what makes her so real and the character so great.If you know Gemma Jones only in roles roles as kindly mothers and nurses, you'll be surprised by the power of her performance. She might not be a beauty in the modern sense, but in Edwardian England with her lush auburn hair, willowy figure,oval face,  perfect complexion and clear blue eyes--she was quite the thing. Add to that her independence, outspokenness and her masculine turn of mind and I could see how she would appeal to upper class men who were accustomed to a very different type of woman whether reticent lady or shallow and spoiled.Most of the stories held my interest, were very realistic and sometimes heartbreaking. Great supporting cast and I particularity loved Mary, the quiet, dignified Welsh girl who becomes Louisa's right hand. The over the top menus, tablescapes and wine selections  are wonderfully interesting as well.	4.0	Draws you in despite the the fact it was released in the 1970's	2014-05-12	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AG7RTXB2YXWTL	Linda Davis	Before there was BBC America, there was PBS. I have many fond memories of family viewing &#34;the Duchess of Duke Street.&#34; It seems British TV gave America examples of &#34;women before their time&#34; (also think of Emma Peel on the Avengers).&#34; The Duchess&#34; knew what she wanted to do with her life and by golly no one was going to stop her. Neither her mother or a handsome aristocrat was going to stand in her way. I remembered, as I watched the first episode, that my son loved the porter's chair just inside the door of her establishment. He would say with every episode how he wanted a chair like that, because one could hide in it and no one would ever find you. Now that these chairs are available maybe that would make a nice Christmas present. If you like all things British, do watch the The Duchess in action. You won't regret it!	5.0	"Linda's Thoughts on ""The Duchess of Duke Street"""	2014-04-16	0	0	0

The story shows how lives were meant to be lived but how some would come to be known as pioneers in their world.

My problem was understanding the duchess's heavy cockney accent, and I missed much of what she said.  That would have been no problem had their been sub-titles.  None.  That really disappointed me, since I suppose I expected it on DVD.  Since i had the whole set in video, I expected the DVD to have subtitles.  It didn't.  Also scenes have been cut. The format of a DVD is certainly easier to use than video, but sometimes you do lose some of the story line with the easier access.  Too bad.

But, in my opinion, what would be an interesting storyline is ignored, and unrelated storylines are highlighted--almost like something out a 1960s comedy show that relied on unrealistic scheming.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A13TB5JHNR6V8J	Lyndi	I originally watched The Duchess of Duke Street back in 1976/77 on CBC television.  On nights that the show aired, I used to tuck my little ones in bed and then settle down for an hour of good TV.  When I &#34;rediscovered&#34; The Duchess of Duke Street on Amazon, I immediately started watching the first episode.  I was pleased to find that even though the show was made 37 years ago, and I (of course:-) am 37 years older, The Duchess is still gold.  I highly recommend it for anyone who doesn't have too much difficulty with a variety of English accents.  The series doesn't have closed captions, so I expect that being comfortable with accents, other than your own, would be a prerequisite to getting 100% enjoyment out of this wonderful television series.	5.0	A Series That Holds Its Own	2013-03-26	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AV24LPZTXX4M	Marie	"Season 1 was moderately interesting, season two was simply too boring.I think that the authors while writing the script used fro the close reference, the work of Jerome K Jerome ""Stage-Land"", a hilarious guide to the clich&eacute;s of late-Victorian theater, with cynical commentary on all of the character types and situations that plagued most plays of the era.""She is very good, is the stage heroine.  The comic man expresses a belief that she is a born angel.She reproves him for this with a tearful smile (it wouldn't be her smile if it wasn't tearful).""Oh, no,"" she says (sadly of course); ""I have many, many faults.""We rather wish that she would show them a little more.Her excessive goodness seems somehow to pall upon us.Our only consolation while watching her is that there are not many good women off the stage.Life is bad enough as it is; if there were many women in real life as good as the stage heroine, it would be unbearable""And so on.Read the Stage-Land and you don't want to watch Dutchess from Duke street."	3.0	semi-interesting	2013-03-08	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A275WJBGGUHC89	Marilyn M. Green	This show was based on a real person so I don't know how much of the plot line was real or made-up. The first season is the best of all the seasons. It was not the happiest life but she knew what she wanted out of life and pursued it with all her abilities. Ironically, she did not always allow others the same thing. Without giving away some of the important facts in the story she formed an odd sort of family in which she was the taskmaster and an unforgiving one at that if you did not meet her specifications. The Duchess of Duke Street is a glimpse of another time. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys an English drama.	5.0	The Duchess of Duke Street Season 1	2013-06-02	0	0	0

I am very disappointed in the low quality of the translations in the subtitles.  I am not familiar with British colloquialisms so rely on the subtitles to fill in on a term I am not familiar with.  Many times I have understood what was said and when I read the subtitle it says [Inaudible] or something totally wrong or misspelled.

Great stories in each episode, human interest, hard decisions, subtle humor. Louisa wants to be &#34;the best cook in England.&#34; Early in the series she gets great promotion help opening her hotel from Prince Edward, who wants her as his mistress if she'll marry a man she doesn't love (the prince wouldn't, of course, in those Victorian years, have a single woman as a mistress). She does marry, then loses the arrangement when the prince becomes the king and has to be more careful. Her marriage fails, she falls in love with a Lord (her first sentimental feelings), then is heart-broken when she must give that up. There are many episodes involving all sorts of people coming and going from the hotel. Her staff is a fresh, funny, well-meaning bunch, each with his/her own story.	5.0	Take-charge ball of fire	2014-01-11	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	AUKD6NSFHQ8RD	NCShopper	I had already watched The Duchess of Duke Street once a long time ago, and I've thoroughly enjoyed rewatching it.  The story of a talented, ambitious working-class woman who parlays her cooking skills into a place in society is fascinating.  Louisa Trotter isn't a typical storybook character -- she has flaws, including being a snob and having a fiery temper.  But she' s determined, loyal, a good employer and better friend.  Her storyline starts when the then-Prince of Wales takes a fancy to her.  The show makes it clear that, really, Louisa has no choice but to acquiesce to his plans to make her one of his many mistresses if she wants to cook for high society, her only path to respectability and financial security.  I think the scene where she asks her soon-to-be-husband (she has to be married; the Prince of Wales couldn't possibly &#34;ruin&#34; an unmarried woman) if he doesn't mind the Prince's plans for her, and he asks her what other choice people like them have.  That one brief scene highlights the cold-blooded reality behind Edward's affairs.When Victoria dies and Edward becomes king, he ends his relationship with Louisa, and she's on her own.  Watching her work herself literally sick and rise in status and wealth makes for fascinating television.  The plot might seem impossible, except that the series is based loosely on the life of a real-life woman who ran the Cavendish Hotel in London.	4.0	A Rising Star in Edwardian England	2013-09-19	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1YJHAOVQE9IGP	Pamela A. Franckowiak	I just finished the series The Duchess of Duke Street.  I thought it was an excellent example of the many struggles that people in that era faced.  It touched many aspects of the human conditions, pre WWI, during, and after.  The Duchess's fiesty and sometimes stubborn nature were the character traits that provided her and her employees a decent life in very challenging times.  I especially enjoyed how each individual character grew and changed throughout the seriers along with the relationships within the establishment.  Although the Duchess tries to show a hard shell of herself, she has a soft heart.  I recommend this series for anyone interested in England during that era.	4.0	The Duchess of Duke Street	2014-01-30	0	0	0

The young Gemma Jones is fantastic-- and her long career continues to present day.  She was notable in Bridget Jones' (no relation) Diary and Sense and Sensibility as well.  Great cast, great evolving storylines.  I feel like I stumbled upon a lost work of art (for myself at least).  On to Season 2.	5.0	The Duchess of Duke Street is Doubly Delicious	2014-02-21	0	0	0

I would recommend this series to anyone that has the time and patience tolisten closely as the cockney accent is very thick. Louisa's mother and daughter were the twomost annoying people and I was waiting for Louisa to smack them down each time they appeared ina scene. As strong as Louisa appeared to be, she just never seemed to put them in their place when sheshould have.  Apart from that the whole series was outstanding with superb acting.	5.0	Extremely Captivating!	2014-02-21	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1VTW3P87LJK41	Patricia M. Mccommas	I've seen The Duchess of Duke Street many times.....when it first was shown on PBS, I use to sit on pins and needles week per week very anxious to see each and every episode.....The characters are very interesting, if you like people who struggle day in and out to make something of themselves....The characters are always developing as the series continues, you get very involved in the fact that Louisa, who starts out with virtually nothing in her life going her way.....wants to be a chef.....a good chef...the best in London!! She is extremely clever in working hard, taking a beating in life from the people around her, especially her parents.....she's knocked down again and again and even with compassion she continues to succeed in life despite many many many obstacles...most of these obstacles would flatten the best of us....still she proceeds, this admire greatly as great character....This story is NOT soap-opera type in any sense of the words.....These are real, genuine people, with many character flaws.....as you watch them grow, some failing in their pursuits...some succeeding.....you can't help but get involved......The actors are absolutely wonderful performers.....the best ever!!! Not once are you thinking, like most viewing I do of films, are the actors acting......what a beautiful treat to watch these episodes over and over....Thank You	5.0	Keeps your interest	2013-04-06	0	0	0

With so many great period pieces out in the last 10+ years, I was concerned that one from nearly 40 years ago (!) would seem dated and be hard to watch.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1CZ186VC9X1H3	PharmDMom	So I came across this by accident, but I love period pieces so I thought, why not......It is a great, great series of shows.  It is about a woman who starts out as gentry (working class back in the day), and with pride, determination, and a great head on her shoulders, makes a success of not only herself, but her business and life.  She makes some amazing friends along the way.  Each show deals with trials and tribulations that she overcomes.You see the star always hard-headed and practically emotionless, but there are those times you get to see her vulnerable, which makes you fall in love with her character and stay loyal to the show.I highly recommend watching all the seasons.  I especially love the last show....it isn't sad like most other endings can be to a television series.	5.0	REALLY GREAT SERIES!	2014-01-13	0	0	0

As the younger cousin of &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34; it makes &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; appear as very thin stuff indeed. The writing is soapy and soppy but perfect for the genre. The period and food is picture perfect. The ensemble playing is a joy of performance with unforgettable characters coming to life before your eyes.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A10GGTA9XQ1P8G	reader9	I love this long detailed story of life detailing the class structure of the time. The actors are perfect. Louisa Trotters character, complicated, disciplined and hard working is inspiring. Her story could take place in any time. This setting is detailed in its time period . It is an outstanding work, well developed, and presented. Louisa and Charlies love story is magical and so very sad. WHat a pity they never married when they wanted to all along.	5.0	Great Story.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2MF0BIIPMCWS	Rebecca Housley	Gemma Jones is probably more known for her more modern works which include Mrs. Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility, Bridget's mother Jones in Bridget Jones's Diary and Poppy Pomfrey in Harry Potter Series, however it was her starring role in the British television series, &#34;The Duchess of Duke Street,&#34; which kick started her career as a talented actress.What is so surprising about this series is that it ages pretty well and stands firmly on its on two feet against more modern popular series such as Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife.I highly recommend this series to any BBC series fan.

They are a nice pastime but would not want to watch again.  Gemma Jones is excellent as a working class girl who wants to be a cook and weasels her way into a kitchen with a chef who reluctantly agrees to teach her.  She is a good student and learns well becoming a sought after chef in London.  Follow her life in each episode and learn about her faults and victories.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1H17JPU5BJ8VX	Sandra K	When it first aired in the 1970's, I remember I enjoyed &#34;The Duchess of Duke Street&#34;. Now, many years later, I'm enjoying it again, having forgotten much of the details. It holds up well, due largely to the acting ability of the ensemble led by Gemma Jones. Louisa Trotter is strong and works hard to get where she wants to be, in spite of being used by the rich and powerful for their own ends. She comes from the lower class with a fiery temper, but is a snob herself. But she will fight for those she believes in, no matter their background. And will fight against those who wrong her, no matter their power. The story of the ups and downs of her rise to ownership of the Bentinck Hotel is the most compelling part of the series, but the &#34;soap opera&#34; of lives intersecting at her hotel is also entertaining.	5.0	Still feisty	2014-04-27	0	0	0

However, the secondary characters, with the exception of the ladies maid who becomes manager of the hotel,  are tiresome and take away from the main,characters.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1M03LEAHM933E	S. Kittle	This is a series about how a feisty young woman worked her way to the top by her own sheer will and determination to be the greatest cook in England.  Women didn't become cooks during her time.  Women were only maids.  Eliza didn't accept that however and fought for her chance to become a cook.  Once she got her first shot, the rest was history.  She cooked for royalty and even made her way to owning her own hotel...with the help of a special friend, of course (you'll have to watch to find out whom).  She deals with love, friendship, and even learning to be true to herself.All in all, I give this five stars.  The theme music is awful, but the series is definitely addicting for one like myself who loves period dramas.  I hope you enjoy.	5.0	If you like period drama, you'll like this	2014-02-13	0	0	0

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3D8QYSC2YD2BU	SM	I've just seen series 1 for the first time and was quite impressed. Considering that it was filmed 30 years ago it managed to hold my interest. I generally don't like tv/films from that era due to the inferior quality of production and lack of historical accuracy. However, Duchess manages to look authentic despite some minor filming flaws and being done mostly on stage-like sets. The most important feature is the first rate acting by all the stars. Gemma Jones provides a strong performance that binds everything together. The supporting roles and guest appearances also seem genuine and intriguing. At no point did I feel restless when the main star is absent from a scene or episode since so many unique aspects of life during the Edwardian period are explored. The dialogue and behaviors seem to be consistent with the period. I find it fascinating that much of the plot was derived from real life events. As for the DVD - the quality of the show seems clear with a few flaws here and there. Meaning, at the beginning of one episode I noticed a blur/contrast in a partial scene, but in general seems ok. A continuity error was spotted at the beginning of episode 12 - (As the major enters Trotter's office the view out the door is not of the hotel lobby as usual, but seems to be a modern city street?) Someone mentioned the lack of subtitles, however my dvd had closed captioning which your tv has to have as an option and needs to be turned on to view. Only the first disc has a few special features, mostly textual background info. Overall, very enjoyable with much emphasis on the wonderful acting and unique plot lines.	5.0	One of the best historical dramas filmed	2006-12-17	16	14	2

But this one throws me. I would like to be able to see in the lead character some of what these men see--are they attracted to her abrasive manner, her anemic look, her tough boxer stride? I liked her steely determination to be the ""best cook in London"", that was the admirable thing about her, and I respected her temper and outspokenness, but my admiration was undermined by this unbelievable premise that men would fall head over heels for her at first sight. Wow. It just doesn't fly. And so no matter how good the representation of the era, if the story doesn't ring true, interest wanes. Mine did by the end of the second episode--the very thing I admired most about this plain Jane with the irritating voice was her unwillingness to compromise, but then she compromised.

You will get to know each character so thoroughly--Mr. Starr's squishy shoes, Mary's lilting Welsh dialect, Charlie's warm blue eyes, and Louisa's tough-on-the-outside but creme brulee-inside--as you would know all the family members at your Thanksgiving table.  The stories are sweet, funny, tender, and sometimes painfully sad.  Over the years, Louisa ascends from lowly kitchen maid to London hotel owner to canteen manager in France during the First World War.  I will be so sorry to reach the end of this series.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A290PZRIX3V40S	Suzy	Loved the premise of this series. Gemma Jones is a fabulous actress. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the film or sound recording plus the added difficulty of her cockney accent it is extremely hard to understand what is being said. Also, the closed captioning is done in white lettering which is very hard to see as there are so many white backgrounds. I think we have missed more than half the dialogue and it is very well written. We are into our second season and I was hoping the film quality would be better but NOT. Will continue to watch, however, as it is a very interesting storyline.	4.0	What did she  say?	2014-06-28	0	0	0

She seems to have paved the way for other women to follow their dreams, not let anything get you down, and keep on keeping on. The only thing I didnt like is she seems to be a bit too brash and discomforting at times. But then again, at that time in England, she probably had to be. My most unfavorite episode is when Mary and Louisa get into a row and call each other a most unsavory name.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"""The Duchess of Duke Street"" is the first series I remember watching on Masterpiece Theater, on PBS. Considering I was 8 or 9 at the time it aired, I think that's pretty fantastic. My mom and step-dad regularly watched programs on PBS, but nothing up to that point interested me. Perhaps it was the budding Anglophile which drew me to the series.  I think a large part of what kept me interested was the strong performance by Gemma Jones as Louisa Trotter, a woman in Victorian England, who works very hard to make a living, dealing with many difficulties as she builds an exclusive hotel from the ground up.The series, originally shown in 1976, was recently released on DVD and it is a welcome addition. Involving stories, great acting, attention to period detail and a story spanning decades helped to create one of the most memorable British television series ever. Watching it again on DVD, I was struck by a number of things. The first is the series is very long. Long for British Television. When the creator of a British television series goes to work, they generally create 6 or 8, maybe 10, infrequently as many as 12 episodes at a time. Each time they go in front of the cameras, they are creating a new ""Series""; British shows are measured in terms of series, some add new series every year, some do a couple of series, take some time off and then return a few years later, presumably after some fresh inspiration. Some shows, like ""Fawlty Towers"" run for 12 episodes and that's it. So watching ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" again, I was struck that the series includes 31 episodes, more than a traditional ""season"" on U. S. television. Also, they only did one series. Perhaps Gemma Jones was exhausted.The series begins with Louisa interviewing with a famous French chef in a large household. The chef is dubious, but Louisa convinces him to give her a try. Soon, he is happy and her place is secure. She begins to soak up information like a sponge. The Head of the House returns from vacation early, while the Chef is still away, and Louisa has to put together a meal quickly. She comes through with flying colors, attracting the attention of one of the guests, the Prince of Wales. They begin an affair, but the Prince can not be seen consorting with a common chef, so an elaborate ruse is created. Louisa will marry the Head Butler. In exchange, they will receive a nice home and ""assistance"". The Prince will continue to meet Louisa in secret. Along the way, she meets Charlie Tyrrel (Christopher Cazenove), a member of the royal family, and the definition of `playboy.' Their initial meeting doesn't go well. Soon, the prince becomes King Edward and a new era in England begins. Their relationship ends and Louisa decides to open the Bentink Hotel on Duke Street, catering to a very exclusive clientele. During a difficult period, Charlie convinces her to let him lease a suite of rooms, for his use, and helps her keep the hotel open. She will only take in the most exclusive clients, hire the most discerning staff and build a grand reputation. Over the years, Louisa and Charlie develop a relationship which creates a sort of roller coaster ride of its own.A lot of the power of ""Duchess"" comes from Gemma Jones performance. Louisa is very strong, able to deal with any of the many problems and situations dealt her throughout her life. A working class girl who recognizes there is more to life than doing laundry or scrubbing floors, she wants to become a cook, despite the scarcity of female chefs in the country, and gets a job with a renowned chef. Working hard, struggling, she learns as much as possible. Soon, she becomes head of her own kitchen, but then the Prince of Wales enters her life and her career ends. Forced into an arranged marriage, for the sake of propriety, she continues to see the Prince of Wales and her husband becomes more and more irritated by the constraints of their marriage. Louisa puts up with very little, but she endures her husband for longer than she should.After they decide to open the Bentink, against Louisa's better judgment, she begins to see the benefits and puts her all into this project as well. When her husband almost runs it into the ground, she runs him off and struggles to pay off his debts.The key to Jones performance is she is a very strong woman. She doesn't take a lot of guff and is unwilling to compromise herself or her life for anyone. She doesn't suffer fools gladly. On the rare occasion she does let down her guard, it almost always causes another problem. You might think that she would become even more stoic, even more guarded, and, to a certain extent, she does, but she also still occasionally makes mistakes, adding more problems and drama to her life. In other words, she is human. And Jones does a remarkable job of creating this character, presenting her as a strong-willed woman, capable of making mistakes, but also capable of fixing them.The two supporting characters who influence her life the most are Charlie and her husband. Both are played well, but Christopher Cazenove has the more romantic, dashing role of becoming Louisa's love.Another thing that struck me as I watched the series again was that some situations were resolved very quickly, too quickly in some cases. The series runs for 31 episodes, so there is time for the narrative to take its course. It isn't necessary to rush the story. In one episode, Louisa learns she is pregnant. In the next scene, the Hotel staff is making due with her absence while on `vacation'. We learn that her vacation was a ruse to cover her extended stay at a hospital, where she has had a daughter and given her up for adoption. We never meet the daughter, never even see Louisa pregnant, and after this Louisa only mentions the daughter again, very briefly, in a much later episode. Perhaps unwanted pregnancies were taken care of this way in Edwardian England, but the series was shown in the mid-70s, at the height of the Woman's Power movement. It would seem a little more helpful, empowering and more to actually see Louisa deal with this problem in a little more detail.When the character played by the star takes a ""vacation"", or is ""on assignment"", leaving the action to focus on supporting characters, it means one of two things. The star is either directing the episode and can't be in both places at once, or they needed a break. This happens three times over the course of ""Duchess"". I think the length of the project, and the fact that Jones is in practically every scene of the series, caused her to need an occasional break. So, at one point Louisa is on `vacation', getting a much needed rest. On another, she is off to France to cook a meal for a client. Unfortunately, Louisa is the force of the series, driving everything else. When she isn't around, the supporting characters do an admirable job, but the show is much less captivating and a lot less interesting. These characters are simply not as engaging as Louisa. An episode concerning an affair between a man and women, whom we have just met, proves particularly annoying. Thankfully, these are few and far between.The series is only slightly dated. The credits and titles are very rudimentary, screaming their origin during the mid 70s. Also, on the few occasions when the story moves outdoors, the footage seems shot with another system completely. If they shot the interior footage on film (which I don't believe to be the case), it looks like the exterior footage was shot on video. The two don't mesh and haven't held up well, so even the interior footage looks slightly glossy, like it was created on early generation video.These few complaints aside, ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" is a great series to watch. Gemma Jones gives a forceful, fascinating performance as one of the strongest-willed women you might ever encounter in a series filled with great attention to detail, presenting a fascinating portrait of life in Edwardian England."	4.0	Great Television Series.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A2Z13QAST1E7Q9	"Tiggah ""the Anglophile"""	Produced and co-written by John Hawkesworth (best known for his role as producer and co-writer of Upstairs Downstairs), The Duchess of Duke Street (which was produced between 1978 and 1980) tells the story of Louisa Leyton Trotter, a young Cockney woman from a working-class background with aspirations of becoming the finest cook in London. The series open in 1900, with Louisa landing a job as a cooking assistant to one of London's finest chefs. It's the chance of a lifetime for her, but her outspokenness threatens to be her downfall.Nevertheless, she indeed rises to become a first-rate and much-sought-after cook and the proprietor of London's exclusive and very expensive Bentinck Hotel on Duke Street. Louisa owes much to Bertie, the Prince of Wales, with whom she has a brief affair. But she owes the bulk of her success to her own hard work and determination. The series spans some 30 years, throughout which we are privy to everything the hotel has to offer--from encounters involving aristocrats to the personal problems of the servants. Of course, it is Louisa's life that is at the forefront, and she must make some tough choices as she deals with crises of her own at both a professional and a personal level.A feisty and independent young woman, Louisa is more than capable of taking care of herself, and she's played to absolute perfection by Gemma Jones. So convincing is she as Louisa Trotter that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. As a point of interest, the character was based on a real-life individual named Rosa Lewis, a mistress of the Prince of Wales who set up a London hotel called the Cavendish. She died in 1952 and was personally known to John Hawkesworth.Louisa is joined by a motley group at the hotel. The oldest servant, a butler named Mr. Merriman, came with the hotel when she bought it. He's a perennially wingeing old codger who one expects will keel over at any given moment. Then there's the new doorman, the mysterious Mr. Starr, with his trademark squeaky shoes and fox terrier Fred (upon whose supposedly unerring judgement Starr bases his opinion of potential guests!). Another fixture on the show is the Major (Richard Vernon of Sandbaggers), a decent and well-connected but destitute old war horse for whom the Bentinck has become home. Of course, one mustn't forget Louisa's right hand, the devoted Welsh servant, Mary; or Charlie Tyrrell, Lord Haslemere, a man with a permanent residence at the Bentinck and to whom Louisa owes much. In addition to the regulars, fans of British television will enjoy guest appearances by Robert Hardy (All Creatures), Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited), and Joanna David, amongst others.In conclusion, the entire series is available on two dvd boxed sets, and it is one of the best period dramas ever produced. Fans of British period dramas in general--of shows like Upstairs Downstairs, for example--are sure to enjoy it. But I'd go so far as to recommend it to anyone looking for a captivating, well-written, and consummately-acted series. This truly is quality entertainment at its very best!	5.0	An Outstanding British Period Drama!	2006-08-09	86	82	4

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A3KDMQT2V77UDH	"Tinkasstuff ""Book Maven"""	The story of Louise Trotter, an amazing woman for her time, the late Victorian era, is thoroughly intriguing.  Becoming the best cook in England is her driving force and it takes her all the way from scullery maid to her role as proprietress of the most exclusive and prestigious hotel in London.  The cast of characters, both upstairs and down is superb with Gemma Jones as the indomitable Louise Trotter.  Don't miss this!	5.0	This is a must watch if you like upstairs downstairs drama.

You learn to love and care so desperately for Louisa, Mary, Merriman, Starr, Smith-Barton, and Charlie.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A34TU0R7NWG0DO	up-and-up	I'm currently watching the first season of this series, and it is wonderful!  I was hesitant at first because it was televised back in 1976, but rest-assured that this is a top-notch show!  It took myself the first couple of episodes to get to know and like the main character, Louisa Trotter played by Gemma Jones.  She's a straight-shooter from the get-go who doesn't fear or hold back on what she thinks or wants despite class and more importantly gender restrictions of early 1900's Britain.  It's refreshing to watch in any production, much less a British one.  There are also unexpected comedic moments peppered inside the episodes in lovely British style.  I would recommend this series for anyone who has interest in British historical drama.  I gave this series 5 stars for the quality of content and service.

I had seen Jemna Jones in other works so it is lovely to see how good she was even as a young person.  I think if you're a Downton Abbey fan you would enjoy this as well.

B000A6T1X6	The Duchess of Duke Street - Series 1	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	The Duchess of Duke Street was a BBC period drama set in London circa 1900-1925. The lead character, Louisa Trotter, was played by Gemma Jones, an actress who made the role her own, and mesmerised audiences in the role of a maid who works her way up to becoming a famous cook and eventually the proprietress of the Bentinck Hotel in London. This story is loosely based on the real-life Rosa Lewis who managed the Cavendish Hotel in London.In the first season, we are introduced to the cast of characters, with Gemma Jones in the lead role of Louisa Trotter. She plays a fiercely determined, independent, strong-willed woman who is bent on making a success of herself. She wants to be the most famous cook in London, and gets employed in the household of Lord Henry Norton, to the detriment of his French chef. But Louisa's determination sees Monsieur Alex relenting and eventually developing a grudging admiration for her cooking skills. Louisa's attractiveness garners her the attentions of many men - ranging from her employer's nephew, Charlie Tyrrell[Christopher Cazenove], to the household's butler, Gus Trotter [Donald Burton], and even the Prince of Wales himself!The first season sees Louisa's struggle to get to the top - she is pressured to marry the butler, Gus, a disastrous union, and eventually finds herself getting the lease on the Bentinck Hotel, and making a name for herself as a famous hostess in London society. There are many light-hearted episodes here, and also poignant ones - and the wonderful co-stars make the show truly enjoyable - there is the porter, Starr [John Cater] who insists that his little terrier Fred works alongside him, the very old but steady waiter, Merryman [John Welsh], Louisa's steadfast friend and employee, Mary Phillips [Victoria Plucknett], and Major Toby [Richard Vernon], a gentleman who has fallen on hard times, but is brought into the fold of the Bentinck family.Those who love period dramas will love this series, and not just for the high quality of the acting. The attention to period details is wonderfully authentic, and the sets and location shots are beautifully done, given the time this series was made, circa 1970s. All in all, highly recommended.	5.0	The Duchess rules!	2012-07-04	0	0	0
