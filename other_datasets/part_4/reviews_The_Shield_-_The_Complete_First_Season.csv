B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A19I6IE5EAW6FM	Adam Brandt	this show is about a pudgy bald guy and his 3 white trash buddies who supposedly rule over and intimidate all the gangs in LA.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1TY3NNXNUH2K8	"Adam Ruining ""My reviews are genuine."""	"A stirring examination of the duality of man, ""The Shield"" follows detective Vic Mackey, head of the Strike Team in the fictional LAPD district of Farmington.  Along with fellow detectives Shane, Lemonhead, and Ronnie ""Moustache"" Dobbs, Vic navigates the back alleys of LA, committing criminal triage, allying himself with a wide array of characters like the two-bit drug dealer Rondell, the drug running rapper Kern, and drug cartel businessman Tio.The underlying question of the series could be, ""What sacrifices, man?""  What sacrifices, man, indeed.  Through the continual snowballing of smaller infractions, the Strike Team finds itself ever more mired in the seedy underbelly of the streets.  Planted evidence here, blackmail there, and suddenly Vic has gone from sterling detective to ultimate supercop, capable of bringing in and bringing down the most horrific of criminal offenders.  What sacrifices, man!  I applaud Vic for making the difficult choices others cringe away from, and making them in a manner that brings the most harm to alleged felons while protecting some innocents.That's not to say the show is perfect, mind you.  There's an entire infrastructure of other, more law-abiding police Hellbent on preventing Vic from violating a street thug's 5th Amendment rights and stopping crime in the streets.  Fortunately, the bulk of these officers aren't that bright and even if they do wise up to Vic's war on crime, there's nothing they can do about it -- Vic cleans up his own messes, if you catch my drift.*Spoiler* Vic kills some people to cover his tracks. *Spoiler*Also, Vic's wife doesn't deserve Vic; man, you have got to get away from that girl.For fans of Greek tragedies, some of Shakespeare's more grim plays, and people who love watching cops beat the ever living Hell out of punks."	4.0	It's okay.	2008-09-02	15	4	11
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	ABGAL4ZQ7ZG0Z	Adelaidian	I remember this show being on Australian TV a few years back but didn't watch it. After recently seeing the DVD sets on sale at a local department store, I decided to give season one a go. Boy, am I glad I did, as every episode blew me away. I received a buzz similar to that of watching Hill Street Blues on DVD for the first time or seeing NYPD Blue when it premiered on television. The Shield though doesn't have anywhere as much humour as HSB and is somewhat more violent than NYPD Blue.There are only 13 episodes in the set but the drama and action is in your face. There are times when the strike team cops are heroes and times when they are villians. They'll do almost anything to get results but often leave many loose ends along the way, which have to be attended to in future episodes. Michael Chiklis was born for the role of Vic Mackey.Soon after watching season one, I went out and bought season two. Took me just a few days to watch all the season two episodes and am now in possession of seasons three and four. Only gripe with my Region 4 DVDs is that I've come across a couple of faulty discs (occasional vibrating/whirring sounds on more than one DVD player) and have had to exchange two of the sets. Still gave my review 5 stars since Amazon.com is not selling Region 4 discs (although did notice that previous reviewer (American?) experienced some problems - is Sony having problems worldwide with these sets?).Anyway, hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride! One suggestion though: you may want to keep the remote control close by in case you need to refer back to the subtitles after missing some quick dialogue, and so you can turn down the volume of the closing theme music. While the theme suits the show, I do find it quite loud and annoying.	5.0	Not for the faint hearted	2009-05-16	2	2	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2GMQQIMLGYLD2	Ali Hesami	I enjoy the fast pace and grown-up nature of this show. It deals with issues that, while often show their age, still speak to the ills of our society, and often even the world, and it manages to accomplish this without either becoming an over-stylized action show or bogging down in righteous self-reflection. The camera work is a bit inconsistant, which is sometimes fitting and other times jarring. I think it works over all, but it probably is a matter of personal taste.One slight disappointment is the lack of a back story in the first season. It's there in the second season, but it feels a little too late, and at that point it feels like filler.All in all, a very strong and enjoyable first season. I'm very glad this show is finally available through Amazon Prime, and look forward to the other seven seasons.	4.0	No-nonsense but not dumb	2013-04-27	0	0	0

Well, one day they had a marathon of The Shield going on, and I finally had nothing to do, so I sat down and started watching it. I got through the second episode on the marathon and I knew I was hooked. I rushed right out and bought the first season on DVD so I could see the entire set in the correct order and without missing anything. The show is great. I would put this show right up there with The Sopranos, but unlike Tony and gang, the cops in The Shield are trying to do good things....as long as it doesn't interfere with profits. The moral ambiguity in the show really helps make it believable and work for many people. You might find that you like a cop like Mackey being able to get the answers and information that no regular cop can, but you might find that you dislike him for using the methods he does to get them. The show presents the question ""Is a win for the good guys a win no matter what the cost?"" and then leaves you to answer it for yourself."	5.0	One of the best shows on TV right now!	2004-11-06	3	3	0

But I'm only half way through Season 3 and he's already become one of my favorite actors. The character he creates, Vic Mackey, is remarkable and any time he's on screen something interesting is happening.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3LRNSI9QM1RMV	"Antonio A. Roblero ""hung over"""	All I gotta say is wow. I'm a big fan of TV on DVD and have been searching for my next show to get into. I have all the 24 seasons, all the Lost seasons (my two favorites...until now), and was looking for something to watch since I'm all caught up on those two shows and prefer serial type shows.I decided to give Shield a shot remembering the glowing reviews (and controversy) it had when it first came out back in...well, whenever it came out (sorry, currently too lazy to dig for that particular fact).I can say that the first season of The Shield was probably some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a TV  show. It is on par with some of the best movie dramas ever made. I highly recommend this show to anyone who has not seen it before (those folks like me looking for TV on DVD they haven't seen before). I can only hope that further seasons live up to this first one.	5.0	Wow!	2008-10-02	17	14	3

However, as you watch more, you begin to feel for the 'bad guys', and you seem to be able to separate their mis-deeds from the troubles all of them live with.Loosely based on the LAPD ""Rampart"" division, this show will keep you watching.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A19VMQDCB4HZ9P	"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen"""	Shawn Ryan's raw, gritty and excellent The Shield on the FX Channel gives the well-worn cop-drama genre a lethal dose of adrenaline. The Shield is not your dad's old type of cop show. Where shows like Law and Order (and its many spin-offs) shows cops at their honorable best, Ryan's series shows that there are also tragically flawed men who wear police blues.The Shield and its main character Vic Mackey (excellently played by Michael Chiklis) shows the dark, seedy underbelly of police work in a multi-ethnic district of Los Angeles. The show uses the real-life, scandal of the LAPD's RAMPART Division and runs with it. Instead of South Central, the show primarily uses the fictional LA district of Farmington as their base of operation. It is an area rife with gang activity, violence and drug-dealing. There's also the racial divisions between the Latino and black communities always in danger of bursting into open violence. Through all this lies Vic Mackey and his RAMPART-like Strike Team. Right from the pilot episode we see that Vic and his men are the true power in Farmington as they try to hold the peace between rival gangs and drug dealers. The Strike Team's intentions are noble, but they've also become so much a part of the problem that they do not see their amoral and corrupt tactics as anything bad. They see things in their district on the verge of anarchy and decided that the only way to save it is to use any means necessary.The Shield pushes the boundaries of basic-cable shows and teeters right over the edge. All the episodes are well-written with stories and topics seemingly ripped from the headlines. The first season runs the gamut from police corruption, child pornography, rapes, murders, gang violence and cop-killing. These stories are not doen with the aim of titillation and gratuitous violence and sex just for its sake. Ryan and company create the stories to show that all the news of downtrodden neighborhoods and Wild West-styled policing are all too real and can be ignored. The ensemble cast surrounding Michael Chiklis also needs to be commended for keeping the gritty and realistic tone of the show from ever becoming over-the-top and sensationalist. Stand-out performances by Walter Goggins as Vic's reckless, racist partner in the team and that of CCH Pounder as the mirror opposite of Vic just shows that all the accolades heaped upon this show has been well-deserved and well-earned.I can't say enough about The Shield to convey how excellent a show it is. The show doesn't pull its punches in dealing with its characters and its controversial topics. Instead Shawn Ryan and his actors infuses the show with realistic grit and uncompromised storytelling. A new series usually grows on me overtime as the early episodes tries to find the show's personality, but the pilot and its shocking cop-killing by a major character hooked me from the start and I have been a loyal devotee of Vic and his Strike Team. The Shield and Vic Mackey have become the Dirty Harry of the new millenium.	5.0	The best cop-drama series on TV bar none	2006-02-15	31	30	1

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1NSMQIF1C2VCE	Beau Yarbrough	Very few police dramas expand or redefine the genre. Dragnet, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue and CSI are among the few that have. Add to that very select list, The Shield.Although Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue featured police officers straying into gray areas of morality, in The Shield, cops operating outside the law are the center of the action. Like in the Sopranos, viewers are challenged by these characters: Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) isn't a good guy, he isn't a bad guy, he's something in between. To Vic, his rogue behavior serves the public interest. To everyone else, a cop with a pet crack dealing operation who murders, plants evidence and savagely beats suspects is a danger who needs to be taken off the street. But Vic is an old pro at this, and viewers get to watch him attempt to out-maneuver the forces trying to take him down, and not always for the best of reasons.But the show is an ensemble, as the best cop shows have been, and everyone from beat cops to detectives to the police captain get their moments to shine. Especially impressive is Detective Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder), who radiates morality, maturity and wisdom. Claudette has to deal with an over-eager partner (who, on paper, the audience should love, but who in practice practically invites the abuse the other officers heap upon him), a politically minded captain and, of course, the Strike Team, led by the obviously corrupt Vic Mackey.Bear in mind that the series, which will begin its fifth season in January 2006, is constructed in 13 episode arcs. At times, the first few episodes will seem slow, but it's always building to a shattering conclusion at the end of each season.This is one of the few television shows that can justly be called a classic. More importantly, The Shield redefines what audiences can and should expect from police dramas in the years to come.Strongly recommended to fans of police dramas. Be warned that The Shield skirts an R rating much of the time, especially in the adult and dark subject matter.	5.0	A towering masterpiece among police dramas	2005-10-12	6	6	0

You know a show is great when too many people 'dispise' it &amp; that's what happened with the finest episodic tv show ever, &quot;The Shield'!!Sure a 'few' liberties are in the writng of &quot;The Shield&quot; but it's the closest thing you'll ever see on tv to the realities of both life on the street of an inner city, &amp; the way REAL POLICE get necessary things done. BRAVO.I live in this 'type' of environment &amp; 'know' detecives just like those that appear in &quot;The Shield&quot;. Most people won't admit to the reality this show brings out, but that's the way it is.Reality TV is a joke, &quot;The Shield&quot; is closer to reality than ANY show on television, but critic's &amp; 'tv watchdogs' &amp; most viewers don't want to face a &quot;REAL&quot; tv show. This IS reality tv folks. Deal with it &amp; enjoy it like I do.I must give some credit to the &quot;tv censors&quot; for allowing the language &amp; violence that &quot;The Shield&quot; portrays(to keep it as real to life as tv will allow) because this 'fictional' tv show gives you what the reality tv  show &quot;COPS&quot; is 'supposed' to but doesn't.Where &quot;NYPD BLUE&quot;(which I still enjoy, &amp; is close to reality)tried to break in the door of what is accessible for adult tv viewers, &quot;The Sheild&quot; blew the doors off it's hinges and should be applauded &amp; recognized for it honesty, &amp; fine performances &amp; writing!Frankly, after watching Shawn Ryan's 'hokey' tv effort &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; I had no faith in a new 'cop show' with his name attached, but like all great artists Ryan has a 'dark' side to him &amp; we now get the pleasure of watching special tv when viewing &quot;The Shield&quot;!NO IT'S NOT FOR CHILDREN, or for adult viewer's with the mentality of a child, but that what's so great about this series, it's complicated &amp; deals with ADULT issue's and dare I say therefore it probably won't survive the 3rd season. Sigh.I say this because the 2nd season outshined it's premier, &amp; should Ryan &amp; Chiklis(et al)try &amp; push the 'tv boundries'even further in the 3rd season, the people with power will likely crush this great show. Sadly most great things are limited, &amp; not appreciated until they are gone(painters/writers/musicians/ect)but HOPEFULLYthe stark genius of this show will survive &amp; i'll have at least 1 hr of GREAT tv to look forward to each week. Sadly writing &amp; acting of this caliber cannot sustain more than a few weeks out of each year, but I can't wait until March rolls around!Thank you Shawn Ryan-Michael Chiklis-CCH Pounder, hell everyonethat is involved with the creation of this fantastic show! It proves you don't 'have to go to' the movies for a magical momentbut in all likelyhood it's greatness spells doom for futher sucess.	5.0	Too close to reality for critics &amp; average viewers!	2004-01-09	3	2	1

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2JYJJTA1EM1U	"Bobbi ""Roberta"""	It took a few episodes for me to get the lay of the land with the characters, but all new series are like that in the first year. I appreciate that they are all gray and none black and white.Toward the end of the first year, it dawned on me that these are all modern studies in the old Kant v. John Stuart Mill argument about means v. ends. Do the means that the cops use - cutting all manner of constitutional corners - justify the ends of getting off the streets known bad guys. Vic always goes too far, and he knows he does. At first, I thought Vic was a dumb jerk, but Chicklis plays him with demons, great love for his family, and a man tormented by his inability to establish realistic boundaries for himself.I began watching on Amazon after the 5th season of Justified ended. I knew that Walton Goggins who plays Boyd Crowder in Justified was in the cast of The Shield. I didn't know how much smaller his role was, or how little the writers do with the incredible talent of Goggins. He in large part drives the entire series of Justified, and seems underused and one-dimensional on the first season of The Shield. I'm hoping that will change because he can bring stunning nuance to the good guy/bad guy role. If for no other reason than to see Goggins develop over time, watch The Shield. It also gives an idea where Goggins' crazy hair comes from.In all, it's a 5-star series. It's just different from Justified.But best thing? On Amazon, no commercials!	5.0	The Shield as Kant v.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1WKSD6VY77RQ7	Booch Paradise	I feel like the story may have gotten a little away from them in later seasons, but this is a great show.  I'd even go so far as to call it high art, as there are valid lessons here about human nature and institutions that I doubt the creators even intended.  But when you have writers and actors like you have on this team, people just have a sixth sense about how to portray things in a real way, and the result is a show works, entertains, and communicates at levels that go beyond the creator's original vision.	5.0	Great TV	2014-01-31	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2L2OERT7VXXYV	"Brett B. ""BB"""	I am a TV sitcom watcher from the 80's. I grew up on shows like 21 Jump Street, Dukes of Hazard, The Hulk and Knight Rider. Come to modern day and how can you not be a fan of Lost, The Office, My Name is Earl and the 200 reality shows. With all on TV, I never was able to watch The Shield. About 2 months ago I purchased season 1 and a few short weeks later I am almost done with season 4. This Show grabs you from the first episode and before you know it you have watched three or four of them in one sitting. You can't turn your attention to something else until you know what happens with Vic and his team.

Wilson ""Christmas Lover"""	Unbelievable...I barely even know what to say about this show that can do it the sort of justice that it has earned.  To be honest, I came across this show by chance and never even remembered it being on during its tenure on FX.  I was basically getting tired of the movies that were On Demand, so I decided to hop on Amazon and see if I could find something that I might be able to get into.  I don't exactly remember how, but I ended up checking out this series and figured I would spend the 15 bucks on the first season.  Knowing what I do now, I would have spent a million!!  This show is just absolutely terrific.  After the first show of the first season I knew I found something unique as my jaw dropped to the floor.  The writing is just bar none and the acting is just so damn real that every time I watched an episode I was just sucked in and could not be bothered for that 47 minutes or so.  If you are into the kind of show that leaves you staring at the blank screen after the show is over in complete and utter shock and awe, then look no further because you have found what you have been looking for!	5.0	This will go down in history...	2012-08-29	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	"Cop dramas have been with us since the days of radio, first there was ""Dragnet"", ""Police Story"" in the 70's, ""Hill Street Blues"" in the 80's, and ""NYPD Blue"" in the 90's. With each decade the format has grown and changed, usually for the better. Along with ""The Wire"", ""The Shield"" has not only evolved the format for this new milliuium, it has turned it on its ear. Characters are flawed. The good guys aren't always good and the bad guys may not be that bad. In ""The Shields"" first season we're introduced to a broken down sub section of L.A. where a dilapidated precicent struggles with success, failure, and corruption.Much like ""Hill Street Blues"", we follow the work of beat cops, detectives, a strike team, and the precinct's Captain. Michael Chiklis plays Vic, head of the departments counter strike team. It is usually Chiklis' tough domineering mug we see when the show is promoted and it's easy to think that this show is nothing more than a testosterone fueled hour of blazing bullets. In reality the show is far more melodramatic, there's a rookie cop who can't admit he's gay...even to his boyfriend, a arrogant but smart police detective who craves the respect he thinks he deserves, an ambitious precinct Captain who has his eye on a city council seat, and of course there's Vic's task force; who bully there way through the streets of L.A., planting evidence on suspects as quickly as they place on the cuffs.""The Shield"" leans towards shock value (maybe too much with victims getting their feet nailed to floors and pedophiles who trade kids like baseball cards). Even the last few episodes of the first season looks like Faluja Street Blues, but for the most part these moments of jaw dropping awe usually kick-start each show before the blaring Latino music pounds away and a broken police badge reassembles itself with the opening title. What makes this show really work is how it creates complicated characters that we end up caring for. Vic is a corrupt cop that should be off the street, but then you imagine the streets without him and you see that even a corrupt cop has his place. It's dark thinking like that which you don't expect from a police drama and that's when ""The Shield"" shines."	4.0	It  Raises the Bar	2005-02-03	3	3	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Nominated for 4 Emmys and 4 Golden Globes, including Best Television Series - Drama, The Shield is one of the top police dramas of the past decade. The brainchild of creator Shawn Ryan, writer for such hit shows as Nash Bridges (1996) and Angel (1999), The Shield made history in 2003 by becoming the first basic cable series to win a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series (in the past, only non-ad supported shows such as The Sopranos and Sex And The City have done so well). The hour-long drama boasts a strong, well-rounded cast who, along with the writers/producers, have managed to make The Shield the longest running series on the FX Network...The Shield centers around an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. An ongoing power struggle between a group of corrupt, yet effective, cops and their new boss, Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez), remains the focal point of the show. Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, of The Commish) heads up an elite unit known as the Strike Team. An effective leader who bends the rules when they fit his aims, Mackey often butts heads with the by-the-book Aceveda who weighs his own political ambitions against the cost of bringing down Mackey and his associates. Veteran Det. Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder, of ER) knows the ropes, admires Mackey, but also knows how to play sides of the game. For the 2005 season, Glenn Close - star of such films as The Natural (1984), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Air Force One (1997) - joined the cast as Capt. Monica Rawling. Together, this celebrated cast maintains an internal tension among themselves while carrying out a unified fight against the criminal element - a fight that keeps the streets of L.A. safe...The Shield (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere in which the Strike Team has tightened its stranglehold over the precinct. Capt. Aceveda tries to crack down on the corruption in his force by recruiting an insider (Det. Terry Crowley) to help take down Vic Mackey, but the operation only results in the Crowley's death. In the interim, Det. Wyms and her partner Det. ""Dutch"" Wagenbach (Jay Karnes) investigate the murder of a woman only to discover that her missing daughter was sold off to a child molester by her drug addict father... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Dawg Days"" in which Mackey attempts to establish a cease-fire between two rival gangs whose ongoing feud threatens the peace, and ""Dragonchasers"" in which Mackey tries to help a crack addict quit so she can maintain custody of her son while Dutch tracks down a serial killer...Below is a list of episodes included on The Shield (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (Our Gang)Episode 3 (The Spread)Episode 4 (Dawg Days)Episode 5 (Blowback)Episode 6 (Cherrypoppers)Episode 7 (Pay in Pain)Episode 8 (Cupid & Psycho)Episode 9 (Throwaway)Episode 10 (Dragon Chasers)Episode 11 (Carnivores)Episode 12 (Two Days of Blood)Episode 13 (Circles)The DVD Report"	5.0	A fascinating series...	2005-07-19	6	4	2

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AZCK686PNC66F	bzbx	&#34;The Shield&#34; began in 2002, the same year HBO released their groundbreaking series &#34;The Wire.&#34; Both series portrayed police, politicians, criminals and ordinary people as complex, completely fleshed out characters who lived in worlds where concepts such as 'right & wrong', 'good & evil', or even just 'good & bad' often overlap in gray areas of legal, moral, and ethical quandries. The good guys weren't always good, the bad guys weren't always bad, and it was often hard to tell which was which. In fact, they sometimes switched roles.Both series were ground breaking in their writing, directing, acting, and production values. &#34;The Wire&#34;, being part of a pay cable network, was able to be more graphic in its language and violence. &#34;The Shield&#34; was part of basic cable and thus unable to depict certain acts and their ramifications in quite as detailed a manner. But, the series was nonetheless extremely successful in drawing the viewer into it's world. It held onto the viewer's attention, and emotions, throughout its entire run.&#34;The Shield&#34; laid the groundwork, and set a high bar, for other TV dramas that followed. Diverse series such as &#34;Sons of Anarchy&#34;, &#34;Justified&#34;, &#34;The Killing&#34; and others followed in the path of &#34;The Shield&#34; in depicting people from all walks of life and professions, be they police, politicians, pimps, store owners, mechanics, teachers, students, or whatever as three dimensional beings who are more conflicted and complex than what one normally sees on TV.Actors from &#34;The Shield&#34;, some already established stars, have gone on to appear in many other TV shows and movies.	5.0	Not your typical police/crime drama	2014-05-07	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	I agree with all of the other reviews here at Amazon.com that this is a marvelous series.  Hubby watched it with me and agreed it was brilliant BUT, incredibly, he bailed out on the last two episodes.  He found the series way too violent and didn't want to see any more of it.  There was no way I could stop watching though.  I was absolutely hooked.  The writing here is exceptional.  Plus the editing is the best I've ever seen on TV.  When lesser talents would belabor each point in the plot, drilling it home, this series cuts away and moves on.  Fantastic! The jist of the series is an embattled inner city LA police station and the wars it fights both inside and outside the department.  The lead character, Vic, is a dirty cop.  He is on the take and he does some horrific things.  Yet he's awfully good at getting the roughest police jobs done.  You are constantly divided in your feelings about this character.  The other characters are also complex with Vic's chief, David, being the next most complex character.  Wildly ambitious politically, he will do almost anything to get into L.A. political life, yet he too has moments of redemption when he is marveouly effective as the guy in charge.  The only viewers I caution to stay away from this series are those who are upset by a lot of violence.  This series is very violent but it would lose a lot of its power if it weren't.	5.0	I Loved It (but Hubby Wimps Out)	2003-03-28	1	1	0

Starting with season 1 -a much different story! This might not be the best show for people who can't separate reality from fiction and get upset at the depiction of violence, but the main characters are very interesting -there are at least two that (by the end of season 1) I can't figure out - good but flawed or flat out psycho? Well meaning or terminally self-interested?  Maybe they're one thing but will morph into the other? I don't like characters to be too easy to figure, and this series delivers on that score.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AIXWU9UK6WQUY	CherylY1	Being able to stream this show has turned me into a Shield binger.  It is a fascinating series with lots of action and edge of your seat suspense.  I like the fact that the protagonist is a man with many sides to his personality.  He's a dirty cop who solves cases and puts away bad guys.  On one hand you are appalled by what he does and on the other you cheer him on for getting the job done, however he needs to do it.  He ignores regulations and protocol on the job, he has a complicated home life - his wife is about at the end of her patience with him, he cheats on his her with one of the other cops, but he loves her and his kids and is fiercely protective of his family.  He commands a passionately loyal little group of cops who are his team, each of whom has his own quirky personality.  There is just so much going on in this show - the chief, the other cop teams are all compelling characters as well.  The Shield is often raw and violent and it's not something I'd normally choose to follow  but I love it and it's easy to see why it lasted for so many seasons.	5.0	Do not watch this show just before bedtime!	2013-10-11	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3PVPIIQDGB1RA	Chuck	I originally found this show by accident while channel surfing while home in bed sick one day. At first I didn't notice I had tuned to Fox FX instead of Fox until someone called someone else a vulgar name and it wasn't censored. That caught my attention. I started watching and later realized I was watching the first installment of the second season.That really didn't matter as even though the show builds from season one, episode one, it's possible to start watching in the middle without feeling behind or that you're missing something.The lead role played by Michael Chiklis is as good of a good cop with really bad moments than any tv show I've ever seen. The only other lead character I'd seen him play was in a series that didn't make it called the &#34;Comish&#34; and it was a total bomb. The character he plays in the The Shield is the total opposite of his previous character but Chicklis makes you believe every second of it and you forget the old series in ten minutes. At least I did as I had to google it because I couldn't remember the name of the previous show.I rate this show as high as I would NYPD Blue maybe better if it had lasted longer than the three seasons.I hope my opinions were helpful.	5.0	The Shield, It's Fantastic!!!

Are we helping people in our community without playing God.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	This edgy series takes us into the fictional, violent LA community of Farmington and introduces us to the morally conflicted cops who police it.  Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) is the volatile leader of a special squad (Walton Goggins and Kenny Johnson) whose members are not above supplementing their incomes by ripping off the dealers they bust and using threats, intimidation, and violence to get results.  The character of Vic Mackey, as conceived by Chiklis and the show's creators, is an astonishing balancing act; although he commits morally indefensible acts during the course of the season, he never completely loses our sympathy, perhaps because of his genuinely passionate desire to stop dangerous criminals.  When he points a gun at another major character in the series finale, I honestly didn't know whether he would pull the trigger or not.  It's rare that the main character of a TV series has that kind of unpredictability.Lest it seem that the whole thing is about Mackey, let me point out that this is really an ensemble show.  There's an ambitious captain with political aspirations (Benito Martinez), a conflicted rookie struggling with his homosexuality (Michael Jace), a brilliant young detective who craves respect (Jay Karnes), and much more.

These 13 episode seasons took forever to watch on FX, when they would take 4 -6 week breaks in the middle of the season, it would take away from the plot and the pacing. But here you can watch back to back. If you love good cop shows and like watching anti-hero's, check out this show.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A24YPDXUI25I4X	Dean Sherrill	Excellent writing and acting, the characters really come to life, lots of action. The criticism I have is that every cop on the show is on the take, or cheating, or lying, or all of the above. Being former law enforcement (14 years), I am well aware that there are bad ones, but they are greatly in the minority. There are many great people in law enforcement, that are generous and caring, to the point of sacrificing their life for someone's else's....even a complete stranger's. Kurt Sutter is something of a genius, I just wish he had spent a few weeks with real law enforcement officers to understand how much they give and what they have to up with. I also realize it is entertainment, but to those who already have a negative view of law enforcement, this show does reinforce that idea. Just a few good cops in the cast, is that so much to ask? In spite of that, enjoyable to watch, my wife and I look forward to every episode.	4.0	Great acting and writing! But no heroes....	2014-02-01	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"The Series:Vic Mackey is ""a different kind of cop""--one with a morality different than yours or mine. He's intensely loyal to those he cares about... but don't get on his bad side.The Shield is about the adventures of Mackey and the other officers and detectives of the fictional Farmington District of Los Angeles. It is a gritty, in-your-face cop drama which pulls no punches and asks questions most other cop genre shows don't even think about. In its first season, The Shield deals with (among other things), gang warfare, a serial killer and a potential riot. Every episode is laced with several subplots, every one compelling, filled with colorful characters. The main characters of The Shield are, without exception, deep, interesting and incredibly well-acted. Seriously--these characters rock.In terms of quality, The Shield not only sits atop ""cop shows"" but television in general. Most series take a little while to get on their feet--often, the first season of a show isn't as good as the ones to come. Not true, here. The Shield knows exactly what it's about from episode one, moment one. It hits the ground running hard. Watch the first five minutes of the first episode, and you'll know that this show is quality, quality, quality.The DVD Release:Every episode (Read that again: *Every Episode*) has an optional commentary featuring, essentially, the entire cast (depending on who is featured in the episode). The special features on the final disk has a ton of material, including audition tapes (!), featurettes and a seemingly endless reel of deleted scenes. It's awesome--one of the best DVD releases I've found.Warnings:Amazon.com has Glenn Close listed as one of the actresses, here. She does later appear in the series, but is *not* in Season One.This almost shouldn't have to be said, but The Shield is an intensely adult series. Parents' discretion is necessary, here.In General:This is one of the best series that television has to offer. Even if you normally have no interest in the cop show genre, you owe it to yourself to give this explosive program a try."	5.0	One of the Best Television Has to Offer	2006-06-11	2	2	0

Not even on El Cinco De Mayo.""""I'm not the good cop, and I'm not the bad cop.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3D61XXZTWVW5M	Dougpound	Whenever critical reviews of the best shows of the last 20 years are discussed, especially those with a anti-hero in the lead (Tony Soprano, Don Draper, Dexter, Walter White), The Shield is always part of the discussion.  Michael Chiklis' Vic Mackie was one of the original, if not the original, anti-hero charismatic lead.  After years of hearing about it, I decided it was time to catch the whole series.  One season in, it definitely lives up the hype.  The traditional commercial TV structure doesn't lead itself as well to the binge-watching as shows of more recent vintage, and the basic station-house cop dynamics aren't that different from NYPD Blue, Hill Street Blues, or any number of cop shows, but Chiklis' Mackie is worth the time.

Keeping in mind that this series is 10 or so years old, I still must only give it a 3 out of 5.  Perhaps I've seen too many great series along the way?  Or, perhaps my expectations were too high?  But I found this series to be unrealistic.  No police district would keep such a band of rouge cops.

I have watched seasons 1-3 so far and cannot wait for the rest. This is not just another cop show. You get attached to the characters quickly, despite their many moral flaws. Also, the storyline changes in unexpected ways so each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. Highly addictive.One word of caution, this is for adults only.

Oh, am I glad she made me watch this, as it's unlikely I would have found it, mired as it is on FX.  Other reviewers here have mentioned that this is a great cop show.  It is.  But it's more than that.  It is one of the very few shows where you can feel your guts twisted in ethical knots when you see the dilemmas faced by the Strike Team.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A35JR4D6FLXYRQ	Geminigirl	"The editorial review of Season 1 of THE SHIELD is so on point! When this series began my cable provider didn't carry F/X so I missed the first two seasons but kept hearing rave reviews about the show, particularly the performance of Michael Chiklis as the amoral detective, Vic Mackey.I was drawn in to this 13-episode season from the beginning as the fast paced storytelling allowed me to get to know the exceptional supporting cast who act as the various ""planets"" who gravitate around the burning sun, that is Vic Mackey.  As a viewer I found myself squirming at times as I rooted for Vic & his Strike Team while at the same time hoping for their downfall.As someone who has always enjoyed cop dramas where the leading characters are morally upright and the villains clearly defined, it was quite interesting to watch this series with so many morally ambiguous characters struggling to do the right thing as they define it."	5.0	The Shield - Season 1	2012-01-12	1	1	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AEVS7RZ667VH4	Geoff Oldham	This isn't Hill Street Blues, Law and Order, or any other program which show cops to simply be overworked yet loyal and dedicated to their job. We see corruption, strange alliances between cops and crooks, and a violent environment into which anything can and will go wrong. The center of this universe is Vic Mackey, a detective who is willing to not only bend the rules but break them in order to bring order to Farmington, and peace is not always achieved by bringing the bad guys to justice.There are many out there that laud NYPD Blue as the premiere cop show of the last twenty years. I call shenanigans on that. Watching Sipowicz suffer through virtually every problem possible TWICE and the revolving door of partners only served to gradually dilute what was once an edgy show. When the only surprising event is whose butt is going to be bare next you know a show is no longer worth watching.In contrast, The Shield in its six year history has kept up an environment where one is never sure exactly what is going to happen. People die unexpectedly, are raped, robbed, beaten: this is the real streets brought into your living room.If you want a glimpse of what the thin blue line is really protecting you from, I suggest you take a look. After this series, I can never go back to Law and Order.	5.0	Willing to portray cops as less than idealistic	2007-06-06	1	1	0

He and the others responsible for this landmark series are most deserving of the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards that they have won.Be warned, however. This series makes ""NYPD Blue"" look like Saturday Morning children's fare. It is neither for the squeamish nor the prudish. But if you like your crime drama straight and tough, this is for you.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3PWF2AQ5XYALW	G. Reid	"""The Shield"" made history by earning the most Emmy nominations ever for a basic cable drama series, with Michael Chiklis winning the coveted Emmy Award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. I am now halfway through season one on DVD. The show is outstanding for many reasons. It is a police show. That is not uncommon. What is unusual is that the characters in the show are complicated human beings who have both good qualities and bad qualities. As in real life each person is not all good or all bad, but they are complex human beings capable of bravery, generousity, and other good qualities on one hand, and greed, deceit and even murder on the other hand. It is an excellent drama with good writing of the scripts and good acting. Another plus, is, of course with the DVD one does not have to sit through many commercials."	5.0	More Realistic Than Most TV Shows	2005-02-09	5	5	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1LW3XGXYP98BW	H. Pace	"The Shield lets you know in its very first episode that it is a very different kind of cop show and Vic Mackey is a very different kind of cop.  The pilot is so good Michael Chiklis (Vic) had to take a shower after first screening it.  It only took one episode (episode 9 of this season) for me to be hooked.The Shield is set in the LA and based heavily on the Rampart scandal from the 90s.  It follows a new, experimental station opened in the gang-infested, fictional neighborhood of Farmington.  In a departure from the standard police procedural approach, instead of a single focus the show follows a couple uniformed cops (the weakest portion), the politically ambitious police chief, two homicide detectives, and most of all Vic and his Strike Team.  It takes elements from different shows--Gangs + Law & Order style murder and sex crime investigations + beat cops--and puts them together.  All interact at times, and stories and investigations often span episodes.  There are some ripped-from-the-headlines storylines, but The Shield doesn't go to that well nearly as often as Law & OrderThe Strike Team is a four-man anti-gang unit operating in essence autonomously under the unquestioned authority of Vic.  They are the sort of cops whose absolute belief in their own superiority to criminals and the righteousness of their mission allows them to pursue justice in a brutally effective manner, all while making a little extra cash on the side.  Some of the things Vic and his team do on The Shield are shocking, but if you've read much about the Rampart scandal, you know what actually happened was just as outrageous.  The real difference is that while the cops involved in the Rampart scandal were under little to no supervision, Vic and his team are under constant pressure from their captain.  But that creates a wonderful inner-conflict for the characters that aren't members of the Strike Team.  They hate Vic, but not as much as they hate the criminals they both fight.  And Vic is too good to ignore.The Shield pushes the envelope for basic cable.  It may not be as violent or feature as much nudity as an HBO drama, but it certainly squeezes as much past the censors as it could have been expected to.  To put it another way, if you showed it to me and told me it was an HBO drama I would not have expressed surprise.  It's shot in a voyeuristic style that gives the show a certain realism.The Shield has a great ensemble cast, but Michael Chiklis as Vic makes the show.DVD extras: Apparently there is commentary on every episode (there is no way I'm watching that many commentary tracks).  Chiklis and showrunner Shawn Ryan provide a parting message after the final episode.  Special features include: Making of ""The Shield,"" ""The Shield"" FX featurette, the pilot script, casting tapes (for Michael Chiklis, Catherine Dent, Walton Goggins, Michael Jace, Kenneth Johnson, Jay Karnes, Benito Martinez, and CCH Pounder), and 17 deleted scenes.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AAG24OU9IBZ3Z	hry89n	Fantastic show!  I never watched it when it was actually on TV, but I am really glad I found this on Prime.  It's original - not at all formulaic like many shows on TV these days.  It reminds me a lot of the sopranos in the sense that it is very hard not to love the main character even though he's a bad person.  He struggles to be a good man and often falls very (very short).	5.0	why did i not watch this when it was on TV?!?!	2013-03-14	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1H14HYRSIWJ5A	Iconic	The Shield was the best show on TV. Wish it would have gone longer then 7 seasons, but I understand why most shows don't. What made The Shield #1 and still hasn't been beaten, is the realism. It's not a show about 1 man saving the world from nuclear disasters multiple times (24). Instead it's about corrupt cops, that try and walk the line of good cops, but their humanity & errors of judgement force them to become men who bend and break the laws they swore to uphold. It's the classic struggle we all as people go through between good and evil, their struggle just has higher consequences. This show will never be trumped in my opinion.	5.0	The Best	2013-08-21	0	0	0

Kocienski ""Jan the Man"""	"To be clear, this is the DVD set of Season 1 re-released in 2008:I broke down & bought the new Sony release of Season 1. Here are my nitpicks about the differences with the original release:The new set is in widescreen, which is a night & day difference from the old set on my HDTV.... The ""Previously on The Shield"" segments absent on the original Season 1 set are here. But, the 1st chapter stop is after the opening credits, not the recap. What a bunch of duki! Also, there are no chapter selection menus. All the original extras are here, minus the original script of the Pilot. The credits all replace the Columbia-Tristar logo with the Sony logo....The menus use the same design as the original R1 set. The cover is also the same, without the gold reflective effect the original had.Overall, the technical presentation is much better on this set. Plus, since they're a slim cased set, getting these Seasons will save me space on my shelf....On a side note: This is the best TV show ever made! The characters are real and you get attached to them.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AHHLSE9AYX3V8	Jason A Covert	I would have been just happy with having the first season but having just a little more is so incredible. All the audio commentaries are great and reveals that for a group of people who do such heavy stuff they are really a fun bunch. Even the little season two teaser which is just Michael Chiklis &amp; Shawn Ryan isn't bad either. Both behind the scenes featurisms, including the one from FX are bother excellent. My only complaint is that &quot;The Shield&quot; is not presented in wide screen. The deleted scenes are pretty cool to and check the after math of the child molester. Over all the audio commentaries are fairly enlightening as we learn to really appreciate the music of the show as one of the characters.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1V75KOW75YRHF	Jason S Robinson	I rented the first four episodes of this series because of the hype I had heard about it. After viewing the first four episodes I went out and bought the entire first season and watched the rest in one sitting. This show really is that good! I really don't watch that much TV and the little I do watch isn't one hour dramas but I do watch and like the Sopranos. Ever since I watched The Shield though the Sopranos seems dull to me. The Shield has charecters that grow as the series moves on and they are deep and rich in personality. Every episode has action and will keep you at the edge of your seat, just waiting to see what happens next.I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone who likes action/drama and I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this show and does not love it.	5.0	Amazing series!

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3BUFAGPDKONX1	Jeff Howard	The way to watch this award winning FX TV show is one episode after another, but be prepared for graphic violence and rough language.  These are not the kinds of cops you grew up with.  Michael Chiklis stars as Det. Vic Mackey, who carefully toes the line between good and evil, and steps all the way across every so often.  Vic is the kind of cop you would want investigating a crime if you were the victim.  He is not the kind of cop you would want after you, because you will most likely end up robbed, beaten, dead or all three.Watching the entire series provides the viewer the luxury of watching not only for episode by episode contact, but the story and character arcs that cross from the first episode to the season finale.  Whenever it looks like Vic and the Strike Team are about to bite the dust, Vic finds a miraculous but plausible way out.When the show first came out I was somewhat offended and put off by the amoral/illegal behavior of the police.  But when Glen Close joined the cast in Season 4, I decided I needed to play catch-up to get up to speed and see what this show was really about.Each episode is its own gem.  Literally unlike anything ever on TV before.  Chiklis is mesmerizing to watch.  His Emmy is well deserved.  The rest of the cast are no slackers either.  Each one adds their own little something.  CCH Pounder is particularly watchable as a sage detective paired with the astute, but goofy Det. Wagonbach.This gritty show has to be seen to be believed, but it is no Adam 12.	5.0	VIOLENT, ROUGH, & GRITTY: THIS IS NO ADAM-12	2005-03-26	5	5	0

Taking that fact into account gave me a whole new sense of understanding.Shane Vendrell might be my favorite character on the show (played by the excellent Walton Goggins, who's now playing Boyd Crowder [another excellent character on another excellent FX show])At times I had to suspend my disbelief (like when Vic and Gilroy place the dead body of a gang member in rival gang territory to make it look like a gang hit, but any forensics team worth their salt would know that the victim died in one location and was moved to another), but these moments were few and far between.I'd say this show is only second to The Wire, a least as far as police crime dramas go, and ""The Shield"" is definitely an equal to ""Breaking Bad"" (with perhaps Breaking Bad Ahead by a hair) in terms of basic cable drama.As my title states, this first season was so excellent in that it's made me want to see this series through to its end, and I think that should be every drama's main goal."	5.0	Made me want to buy the rest of the series!	2013-06-03	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AK7S5D65PPVL9	John Dutton	My wife and I watched Season 1 and abandoned The Shield in Season 2.  There is nothing redeeming in this show.  If one believes everything/everybody is corrupt, that violence reigns accross our police forces, that our officers of the law are no better than the thugs they brutalize, that politicians are as insensitive as the newspapers make them out to be, then one may like this series.I haven't watched television for years, but agreed to watch these tv series because of our Prime benefits for video streaming. Clearly, I haven't missed much.  The language used as now being acceptable for a TV audience, the ongoing brutality among the cast members, and the repeated one plot line with each storyline author trying to outdo his predecessor on pushing everthing non-redeeming up several notches, turns this series into a BIG MISS for us.	1.0	The Shield will not sheild you from Despair/Violence!	2014-02-02	5	3	2

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AO9J9F3O1BT7B	John	"I was first skeptical when I first heard of this show when they first were advertising it on FX as ""Rampart"". I remember watchig ""X-Files: The Movie"" and seeing this ad, then they said coming in 6 months. I was like ""Yeah right, that won't work"". Then about two months later more ads came on but the name had changed, and much for the better. This Emmy winning show would be named ""The Shield"".After I watched the very first showing of the series premeir, I was completely stunned. The first episode brought so many things that normally would not work: Drama, action, violence, nudity, language, drugs, and even some Kid Rock music. Needless to say, the last four minutes were amazing. They come busting into the house perfectly rythmed with the Kid Rock music and then actually showed that guy get shot in the chest.Amazing.This show puts nearly every other cop/detective-related show to shame. The acting is top-notch (Chiklis got an Emmy), the action is some of the best ever done on a cable show, the conflicts between the characters is very believable, Chiklis doesn't play a hero, he has many more problems than anyone else in the show, and the story's most likely have happened before (this is NOT fiction).I am very pleased this show is getting an early, Box set release, unlike many new shows like ""The Dead Zone"" which have started to produce DVD's that come with only 2 episodes on each disc. The re-runs were basically the only thing to hold me over the summer seasons besides Farscape. I am VERY pleased with the current winter season show line-ups, on all channels. FOX has ""24"", FX has ""The Shield"", CBS has ""The Amazing Race"", WB has ""Angel"", and NBC has ""Fear Factor"". This is going to be a very busy, yet very pleasing winter for TV viewers.I highly recommend watching this show. I would NOT recommend kids under 13 watch it though. It IS rating TV-MA. It's just that now and then they show some really brutal and nasty things (remember the scene with the rookie cop and the juwish guy?) That one kept me explaining to my 7 year old sister for hours....My final words are: Buy the DVD, watch season 1, and get ready to see even more intense drama with season 2 starting January 7th."	5.0	This defines *AWESOME* TV	2002-10-01	5	3	2
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX	John	I still remember seeing promotions for this show when watching repeats of The Practice on FX, months before it premiered.  It really had me pysched to see it, it was shown as a tough, gritty, no holds barred cop drama like we have never seen before.  The problem was the dates kept getting pushed back and I forgot about it until after the season had already started.  I came in during the middle, but since then I have never left.  The Shield delivers on it's promise.  It is the not only the best cop drama on television, it is the best drama of ANY genre.  Like Vic Mackey, The Shield pushes boundaries and sometimes breaks them, when it comes to censorship.The first season has many highlights, but for me there are a few that stick out in my memory.  First is when the serial killer case is finally solved.  Jay Karnes, who plays Dutch, the detective on the case, is in top form in this episode.  It is an unforgettable, award worthy performance.  Second is the season finale.  The riots that break out are the perfect backdrop for the chaos going on in the LAPD and specifically Vic Mackey in that episode.Vic Mackey is a character that is hard to know how to feel about.  On the one hand, he does many many good deeds and is all about justice.  On the other hand he has committed horrendous crimes himself, even killing a cop (the Internal Affairs informant).  We should despise him, yet I find it impossible to do.  Michael Chiklis (many of you may recognize him from The Commish, although he has gotten in shape since then) plays Vic flawlessly.  There is no fault in his performance, not in any episode.  He deserved the Emmy, but it was still a surprise win.  To beat out HBO's Six Feet Under AND the West Wing AND 24 is no easy task.This DVD has many extras, but the main thing for me is the commentary.  It is rare to get commentary from the cast at all, but to get commentary from cast and crew on EVERY episode is amazing!  Deleted scenes and outtakes are also on the DVD, as well as cast auditions which will be interesting to see.  Overall this DVD is well-packed with extras and above average as TV show DVD sets go.This show is recommended for any fan of serious drama.  It is never formulaic, never repetitive, never normal.  It will blow you away.	5.0	Breaking barriers on and off screen	2003-01-07	9	7	2
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1EFGZKKH2GOHN	John Mackey	OK, already... I never gave it a chance, totally dismissed it when it was on television. Like some others on this list, fell in love with the Walton Coggins character in &#34;Justified&#34;. Found out he had a leading role on &#34;The Shield&#34;, so had to check it out. I'm now a Fan... half way through the 1st season and totally loving it!!! As a long time Film fan, ex-theatre manager/showman, now freelance video and independent film producer... I refuse to watch any show with little or no substance. &#34;The Shield&#34; has all the aspects contained in a very successful series... great production value, writing, acting, directing, editing, etc. The characters are well developed as is the story line, delving into and addressing matters that address us all in this day and time. The show just grows on me and I can't wait to watch the next episode. Sorry cast and crew for initially dismissing this great show...

Linnell	"It is my loss that I don't spend more time looking at what is on TV other than news, commentary, sports and an occaisional special. I was facing knee replacement surgery a little over a month ago and wondering how I would use the down time I would have while recuperating. Little did I know what I was in for when my son, knowing I would have some time on my hands gave me the above DVD saying, ""I think you might like this and I know you won't forget it."" He never spoke truer words.To say I was drawn into the world created by this show would be an understatement. At first you say to yourself, ""this is too over the top to be real"", but before long you are totally invested in the various personalities and situations. There is little point in my detailing what others have already done very well. However, if you are a fan or crime stories and police procedurals, all I can say that there is none better. I was delighted to find that the series I watched was the first year of the show and that there are more out there. I'm on my way to get them."	5.0	This is a Masterpiece of Writing and Acting - A Must See	2005-10-29	4	4	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	"Thank God for cable TV!""The Shield"" is the most intense new cop series in a decade.  The action centers around an proto-experimental police precinct in South Central L.A.  The action is violent and intense and pulls no punches.  Series lead Michael Chiklis stars as Vic Mackey, leader of an elite squad within the precinct.  Mackey is corrupt, amoral, but a great and effective cop.  Even when you want to hate him you can't help but root for him.  The precinct house's new Lieutenant makes no secret about wanting to bust Mackey as part of his political aspirations, but Mackey isn't going down without a fight.  And he certainly has the fight in him.The final scene in the first episode set the tone for what kind of cop Mackey can be.  But throughout the whole first season viewers are treated to a level of grittiness and action rarely seen on television.  Always intense!One particularly satisfying story arc in the first season centers around one of the precinct's new detectives trying to catch what he thinks might be a serial killer.  He eventually gets his man, and some unexpected respect from his fellow officers, but the psychological price he pays is what will resonate long after the case file is closed.And ""The Shield""'s visual style (namely the art direction and use of color) is unlike any other cop show you've seen before.  That sounds kind of odd if you haven't already seen the show, but it gives the show a distinctive look to go with its already distinctive sound and feel.Watching this show gives me the same charge I got from watching the first season of ""N.Y.P.D. Blue"" -- the David Caruso season.That whole first season is also available from Fox TV on DVD in early 2003.  Too bad the ""...Blue"" box set won't also contain the first four episodes from Season 2, the episodes that wrapped up David Caruso's character story line through his exit from the show.**** Easy instructions for watching ""The Shield - Season One"" on DVD:Point, click, buy, watch, enjoy, pick jaw up off floor."	5.0	Mercilessly unflinching L.A. police drama!!	2002-12-18	27	25	2

Many of the conventions of precinct ensemble dramas live on in The Shield, and the show feels slightly dated a decade after its inception, but this show's writing is utterly unconventional with respect to treating its audience like adults, even if not all characters in it seem to qualify for that designation.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AGNK9ATZTSVH6	Kathy_in_NEO	My husband mentioned that The Shield had high ratings on various websites, so I agreed we should try it out.  I didn't want to like it because most Cop shows I find to be too &#34;glossy&#34; - Perfect looking actors, that sort of thing.  That is not the case with The Shield.I find the characters to be very believable.  They look like real people and are all flawed in some way (well, except for Det. Claudette Wyms - a strong female character perfectly played by CCH Pounder).  Michael Chiklis does an excellent job portraying Det. Vic Mackey - a very complex character.  He is as flawed as a Cop - a human - can be yet, he does have a caring side that causes me to not be able to fully dislike him.The Shield is one of the more violent TV shows I have seen.  There are times when I have to look away as it it too much.  However, none of those scenes feels like it was created just for the sake of portraying extreme violence.  The incidents, unfortunately, are taken from real-life, particularly, the scenes involving drug dealers.Overall, if you like Cop shows, you can't go wrong with The Shield.	5.0	One word - INTENSE	2013-08-23	0	0	0

Michael Chiklis brings a raw intensity and a complicated morality to his cop character that you will never see anywhere else on television--even in the movies! After watching him, it's easy to see why he won an award for it.. The storylines are intriguing, almost shocking, but always fascinating because it will leave with many questions to ponder about in our law enforcement system.Possible downsides for some: disturbing themes/plotlines, languageAdvantages: unique cop show, writing, Chiklis' performance	5.0	Props to Michael Chiklis	2003-01-15	5	4	1

He sells every thing he's does on screen and you never see him doing it and he makes you care.  The writing is great.  The supporting cast is great.  Watching it is like riding a giant roller coaster, lots of tension and lots of thrills.  I saw an interview with Kurt Sutter about Sons of Anarchy.  He was asked if he was going to write a part for Michael Chiklis for Sons.  Kurt said he would write Michael Chilkis reading the phone book if that's what Michael wanted to do.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3LWH8DJNFX0PQ	"Kman6 ""Kman6"""	To say that I view anything from the F/X network as suspect would probably be an understatement.  It's probably my belief that Fox tends to overhype even the worst of what it does.  Upon seeing reviews of The Shield, instead of giving it a shot, I counted it's cutting-edge and breakthrough monikers as a result of using profanity and showing more skin than what we would see on the big networks.Boy was I wrong.  The characters are strong and the characters are deep.  The pure cinematic effect of the camera work are more in line with what you see on the big screen than your normal cop show.  The racial tension is palpable and no one is a clear cut good or bad guy.  It's good to see a show dealing in shades of gray rather than just plain good and evil, because we all know the world is never really a clear cut measure of right and wrong.  There's something to be said for the series putting you right there in the mix and being forced to make your own call as to who was right in each situation and then wondering if your gut reaction is really what you had hoped it would be.I won't go into storylines or any synopsis, because that's not what I look for in a review.  If you want to get sucked up into a show and not leave the house until the last disc has played then this is one for you.  I cannot recommend it enough.	5.0	Totally Suprised & Engrossed	2006-01-06	0	0	0

Important things are the Captain's quest for a city council seat, the Strike Team trying to keep it together, Dutch and Claudette investigating serial killers, and Julian Lowe's training.	5.0	A different kind of police show	2013-04-26	0	0	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3K1LK6DJCVPUK	K. Palmer	"I didn't watch ""The Shield"" when it was shown on TV its first season, but when Michael Chiklis carted home the Best Actor Emmy for his performance that season, I took notice.  I decided to purchase the first season DVD set and I was hooked!  This is a rare show where I like every single character in the cast.  All of the cast, from Chiklis' Vic Mackey to CCH Pounder's Claudette Wyms to Jay Karnes' Dutch Waggenbach to Cathy Dent's Danny Sofer (and the others I haven't named), all have significant roles in the story and you can sympathize with them all, even when they are not on the up and up (especially Mackey's Strike Team).There isn't a clunker in this 13 episode set.  Highlights include Dutch's obsession with finding a serial killer, the Strike Team's reaction after Mackey kills a cop who he finds out is out to help shut him down and the struggles of rookie cop Julien Lowe (played by Michael Jace) to figure out his sexuality. The chemistry of the various cliques (the Strike Team, Claudette and Dutch, Danny and Julien) makes this show riveting.This is a great DVD set to have as there is cast and crew commentary on every episode.  Just about every actor in the cast makes at least one appearance for commentary and show creator Shawn Ryan is very informative about the various goings on with the show.  Plus they seem to have fun together which probably helps explain the show's success.Season 2 was great as well and I can't wait for Season 3 which heats up soon!"	5.0	The Shield Rocks!	2004-03-04	3	2	1
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AABB80K42R49H	Kray O. La	The Shield is primarily about a special gang unit who deal with the worst elements of society in Farmington, I had to look up where this is and Google maps shows it is in Northern California although the location is obviously in the LA area and they refer to different cities and neighborhoods in LA all the time.I started watching this series on Crackle.com because I thought it was one of their own productions and I've watch some pretty good shows on there in the past. However, they play the same commercial (sometimes three times in a row) multiple times during every episode and there is no way to skip them. I checked on Amazon Prime and the series is available there for free.I don't typically watch cop shows like CSI, NYPD Blues, Cops, or anything like that although I used to watch 24 and I liked it a lot.  However, I've been watching this series when I can. This may just be me, but I think cops behave just like these folks. They want to take 'bad' people off the street but in order to do that, they have to break the law, plant evidence, beat people, murder, etc. and sometimes mistakes are made and good people are harmed.The series is a bit crazy for me because it contains torture, rape, murder, kidnapping, child sex offenders, and essentially the sickest elements of society. I don't like seeing this type of stuff. I know it is just a show, but it seems realistic. Another interesting aspect of the show is seeing the interactions between cops on the same police force and how they harass one another. Some are racist, misogynistic, anti-gay, etc. and how they have to deal with these things in their work environment.I can understand why some police officers seem to be distrustful of citizens. I guess when you deal with lying, deceitful, criminals on a daily basis and are duped by those you trust, you keep your guard up and assume the worst from those you encounter. The Shield shows that some cops are criminals, some turn into criminals, and some try to do the right thing.It's a sick show. I can watch horror movies, combat, or shows with killings because I know it is not real. However, when the violence seems real, it sickens me and I don't want to see that stuff. However, I guess I have this penchant for peeking - kind of like driving by an accident and looking at a corpse. I keep watching this series and have just finished the 3rd season. It's too bad there are 7 seasons because I may squander my time watching more.I haven't seen it stated, but this show should be for mature audiences.Enjoy peeking into the sick world where hopefully most of us don't live.	5.0	Addictive	2013-05-19	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1MXIZY6XV8DUG	Kyle Garrett	"Tuesday nights at 9pm,I'd drop everything to watch this show. If I had to work,my VCR was set to record it,even sacrificing watching a new episode of ""Law & Order:SVU"". It's that good,people.What with all the hype that you hear about the NBC ironhorse ""Law & Order""franchise(and I love all the shows,don't get me wrong) and the slickness of the ""CSI""shows,it's a shame that the best cop show on TV since the first season of ""NYPD Blue""gets such a low profile. And maybe that's a good thing. ""The Shield""is so raw yet has brilliant writing and character development that it transcends the writing that you usually see on the aforementioned TV shows. Michael""The Commish""Chiklis plays anti-hero cop Vic Mackey with such a razor sharp precision,you can't help but lock your eyes on his performance. Balancing between volatile powderkeg and good guy softie,Mackey is the best character to hit TV(cable or network)in years.The story arcs are compelling,the rest of the cast is amazing(shouldn't CCH Pounder get an Emmy nod?)and the dialogue is crisp and edgy.With the benefit of basic cable on the writers' side,they can use profanity with much more freedom that the network cop shows,thus giving it a much more realistic angle. Hands down,it's just one of the best shows on TV to date. The first season is brilliant and by the middle of the second,you'll be beyond hooked.I wouldn't be surprised if ""The Shield""fills the void for when ""NYPD Blue""ends this year."	4.0	The remedy for your standard TV cop fare....	2005-01-06	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AGT1L2V2GJIY5	Landon Reed	I found this show sometime during season 2 and was immediately hooked. The pacing is such that the 50 minutes or so each episode lasts seems closer to about 15 minutes. You're given a sizable collection of characters, the vast majority of whom are flawed, to follow as they attempt to manage the crime in the town of Farmington, CA. The show is able to maintain its hi-octane output because it rarely pauses between problems between the police and crooks, as soon ans one thing is seemingly tied off, it created another two, bigger, problems. The show is also hell-bent at times on bringing as much shock to the screen as possible. So, if you're not into darker story lines, then you may find the show off-putting.This show is, for me, is better than The Wire, which certainly deserves all the praise it has gotten.	5.0	The Most Riveting Cop Show Ever	2013-03-22	0	0	0

What The Sopranos did for changing the way we look at the mafia, The Shield did for cops. Vic Mackie is the very definition of moral ambiguity. Almost gives a wild west feel to modern day law enforcement. Vic, Shane, Lem, and Ronnie enforce their own brand of justice.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL	Little Miss Cutey	The Shield is an amazing tv drama.  It's raw, compelling, gritty and exciting.  It's a bit heavy going, but I think that's what makes it stand out from all else.  Michael Chiklis is great as Vic Mackey.  He's a good bad cop.  While he's on the wrong side part of the time, you always want to be on his side.  He doesn't take no s*&t.;  He is effective in bringing down the bad guys and clever at hiding his trail.  No wonder he's been given the Emmy nod several times.If you are looking for your average cop drama, this isn't it.  It's above and beyond the rest.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1D646OANVU8BN	Loladrum	Vic Mackey is the original Walter White; he is a conflicted hero, a storm of selfishness, greed and altruism. The viewer will condemn him in one moment, and cheer for him the next. The first season is particularly adept at setting Mackey up as the stereotypical &#34;bad cop,&#34; then winning you over to his character as he proves himself to be deeply committed to his community and family. Other characters, such as detective &#34;Dutch&#34; Wagenbach and Julien Lowe have compelling story arcs this season.

It's not for the faint of heart--quite a lot of realistic violence and not much sentimentality. The show held onto its strengths until the very end of its last season.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2XMSKUDJMHRIR	"Lynn ""Lynnsey"""	This is a very well written fast-paced cop drama that captured me from the first episode.  The characters are complex and the challenges that law enforcement faces in a high crime driven area are similar to the constant barrage of fighting that soldiers face in any war.  The toll that it takes on their personal lives is evident as well as their addiction to the action -- especially the 'Strike Team' that engages in activity that comes up to and sometimes crosses the line in brutal law enforcement.  I highly recommend this series, but caution you that you will not stop until you watch all the episodes and seasons!

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A4SY5RCGC5CH9	"Maciej ""Darth Maciek"""	"From the very first episode, ""The Shield"" became immediately my most favourite TV series and even if later I found that ""The Wire"" was even better, still I faithfully swallowed all the episodes until the terrifying and grandiose finale seven years later. I own all the seasons on DVD and I will keep them for EVER!I really don't want to provide spoilers, so I will say only the strict minimum about what those extraordinary series are about. Everything happens in the fictional Farmington district of Los Angeles, quite obviously nicknamed ""The Farm"" and the local police station (""The Barn"") is located in a reconverted church. Farmington is possibly the poorest and the toughest district in whole Los Angeles and the level of violent crime there is simply amazing, mostly due to the presence of numerous well armed and extremely violent drug trafficking street gangs. Somehow reflecting the image of the whole Farmington ""The Barn"" is not exactly in great shape and most of the toilets are frequently out of service, to such a point, that men and women have mostly to share the only facilities left...)))""The Barn"" just received a new captain, tough, efficient and extremely ambitious David Aceveda (brilliant Benito Martinez). Although he received a very tough assignment, in one aspect Aceveda was lucky - his most senior detective is Claudette Wyms (wonderful CCH Pounder), a non-nonsense and tough as nails middle aged woman who is possibly the most dangerous (for offenders) criminal investigator in the whole Los Angeles. Another great asset for ""The Barn"" is Sergeant Danielle ""Danny"" Sofer (Catherine Dent), another very tough gal who was simply BORN to be a cop and who now, after 15 years on the force, is especially appreciated as trainer of rookies.But the real ""heroes"" of the series are the four guys who form the ""Strike Team"", an elite anti-gang unit based on the LAPD's real-life Rampart Division CRASH unit. Detective Vic Mackey (amazing Michael Chiklis) is the leader and the rest of the team is composed of his trusted friends Shane Vendrell (Walton Goggins), Curtis ""Lem"" Lemansky (Kenneth Johnson) and Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell).Now, from the very first episode one thing is absolutely clear - all the four guys in the ""Strike Team"" are bad, REALLY BAD COPS! Bad like in corrupt - in fact they are much more dangerous than most of the criminals they put behind bars... However, they do their day jobs pretty well - it's just that they also have a second, very interesting, very lucrative and totally illegal activity (in fact more than one...). And I am not saying more.There are also some other regular characters, two of which provide most of the humour on the series (yes, albeit very dark, ""The Shield"" contains also tons of hoots): quite competent but somehow pathetic detective Holland ""Dutch"" Wagenbach (Jay Karnes) and a completely demotivated slacker, detective Steve Billings (David Marciano).Other than the originality of the plot (the ""heroes"" are bad, corrupt police officers), the main reasons why ""The Shield"" is such a great show are as follows:- extremely tense and dramatic plot in every single episode, with unexpected twists and clever surprises- absolutely brilliant dialogs (with certainly a lot of strong language)- an absolutely amazing gallery of secondary characters, some of which resurface occasionally in later seasons- a quite realistic portraying of life in poor ghettos of Los Angeles and of all the racial tensions in those areas, with many incredibly cruel and horrible and occasionally also some hilarious, outlandish events (not all of them criminal) described which were actually inspired by real dramas...- an excellent camera work in many action scenes, reminding of footage taken by war correspondents working in the first line of battle- an AMAZING soundtrack mixing gangsta rap, heavy metal and all other kinds of extreme, but mostly very good musicNow, of course the plot is sometimes stretched a little - I cannot imagine that those four guys from ""Strike Team"" would ever be allowed to continue their murderous criminal rampage for seven years in a real police force. But honestly, I don't complain. In fact I am a little bit sorry, that there couldn't be at least one more season...Bottom line, this is an AMAZING show, ground breaking and still absolutely UNIQUE when the selection of ""heroes"" is concerned. To buy, watch, cherish, keep and re-watch! ENJOY!"	5.0	Ground breaking, shocking, brutal, and in many aspects very realistic show about really, REALLY BAD corrupt cops	2014-01-30	0	0	0

I started watching them again and was just blown away at how great this show still is. Shawn Ryan created a real master piece, if such a thing is possible for a &#34;cop drama&#34;. The acting is outstanding by the entire cast and the writing is top notch.&#34;Oh, let me stop here to define &#34;writing&#34;.You see boys and girls, at one time there were these creatures called &#34;writers&#34; and they were these really smart and creative people who would create clever plots and well written scripts for TV shows. Believe it or not, there was a time that just sticking a camera in some morons face or some D-level celebrity and having  them do something stupid then calling it a TV show, didn't exist.

I found that the story line was quite intense, and it had me glued to my livingroom suite. The actors are superb, especially Michael Chiklis. I watched all the episodes of the first season in one night.  After that I could not wait to see season two which I throughly enjoyed.  This led me then to purchase Seasons Three and Four via Amazon.  I can't wait to get Season Five on DVD.  What also made this series so interesting was the fact that you had to wait until the following year for another series to come out.

There are a lot of characters that do a good job making the audience really hate them and at the same time understand them.	5.0	Digging a deeper and deeper hole	2013-03-12	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AYE37A0WLGNMF	MG	Found this show through reviews of Justified. I loved everything about Walton Goggins' character and acting in Justified so I started watching the Shield to see if his other work is as strong. It's grittier than most other shows I like but I'm hooked and now in the middle of Season 3. Michael Chiklis' character gets a lot more likable as his character develops and I also really enjoy the acting by other characters (notably CCH Pounder, Jay Karnes, & Catherine Dent). Not appropriate for kids (frankly I don't think it's great even for older teens) due to the subject matter, but obviously the show is marketed to adults so I give it 5 stars.	5.0	Love this show and can't stop watching!	2013-10-22	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3TUZOJZM9008Y	"Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia"""	&quot;The Shield&quot; is great television, period. There will be those who complain that it only pushes certain buttons of a visceral kind. And it does that. However, the performances in this show set it apart from anything else on television. The cast is top notch. The setting is like nothing else on TV today. It is as pivotal for television cop dramas as were &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot;Detective Vic Mackay and his Strike Team tend to cross the line in pursuit of &quot;justice.&quot; They leave their calling card where they strike to let the criminals know who runs the streets of Farmington. Their methods, while effective, tend to skirt what the Supreme Court has ruled as being legal for law enforcement. And, they aren't above padding their &quot;retirement fund&quot; along the way.Their Captain is a man whose ambition runs beyond his run down precinct. Mackay's methods have a tendency to cause him problems. They work together when it's needed, but are more likely to be butting heads.The first season of this show is great. The commentary tracks are worth a listen to get the cast and crew perspective on this cutting edge series.Watch closely and you'll be able to see for yourself the scene in which Michael Chiklis walks away with a richly deserved Emmy Award.	5.0	Television that takes you to the edge.	2003-09-28	1	1	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2ZLROGIL2V7GV	Michael Crane	Cable programming will never be the same again, and &quot;The Shield: Season 1&quot; is the reason for that.  A cop drama unlike any you have ever seen before, this highly controversial and brilliantly written show takes you for a ride into the darkest parts of law enforcement that you never thought existed.  This is a show that isn't strictly about good vs. evil; it's about getting your hands dirty in order to get the job done.The show revolves around a police department and the men and women behind it.  They're faced with ugly situations on a day-by-day basis.  A major player is Detective Vic Mackey; the leader of a Strike Team unit that goes places where nobody else would ever want to venture.  Only problem is that in order for the Strike Team to get the job done, they have to bend or break the rules.  Rules that could end up having them become the actual lowlifes that they have dedicated their lives to lock away for good.  With numerous storylines popping up at every corner, one of the key ones is Mackey's superior, Captain Aceveda, looking for any excuse to catch Mackey doing wrong so he can lock him up with the same criminals that he takes down.  The end result of all of these characters and their stories lead to a shockingly entertaining show that ignores every rule in the book and questions your own morality.I found this show to be extremely addicting.  The show is down and dirty, just like some of the shady characters that are in it.  Sometimes you're afraid to watch because you have no idea what buttons the show plans to push next.  This is for sure not &quot;family entertainment.&quot;  With the exception of not being able to use the &quot;F-word,&quot; this show pretty much gets away with everything else.  You'd think it was on HBO.So what's so appealing about this show?  I think it's because of the risks it takes.  Instead of conforming to your typical cop dramas where the lines between good and bad are more than crystal clear, we are presented with a show that tests our morals and values.  It forces you to think and ask yourself, &quot;Would I have done the same thing?&quot;  While a lot of the things that transpires on the show can be viewed as outrageous and over-the-top, there's a lot of ugly truths hidden within.  And, we must remember that this is a TV show with a goal to entertain.  The actors are fantastic in their roles (especially Michael Chiklis, who plays &quot;Vic Mackey&quot;).  The writing and directing also stand out in this well-structured series.The DVD set has some goodies to offer, which will please fans of the show.  This 4-Disc DVD collection includes extras such as commentary on every episode, the original script for the &quot;Pilot&quot; episode, two featurettes, deleted scenes, and cast audition videos.  If the 13 episodes alone weren't enough for you, the extras should make you happy.&quot;The Shield: Season 1&quot; is an excellent show that takes chances by portraying flawed characters that seem much more realistic than most seen in other shows.  It's not for everyone, of course.  The show is brutal and in-your-face.  If you're willing to see how down and dirty a show can get, then this is something to check out.  A very clever show with an extremely promising future.Just how far are you willing to go to get the job done?  You'll soon find out once you pop in the first DVD.  Once you go in--there's no coming back.	5.0	&quot;Mackey's not a cop.  He's Al Capone with a badge...&quot;	2004-01-10	3	3	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2UEHAFAOA3N7Y	Mimsy	I watched the full first season and a couple of episodes of S. 2, and had to quit. It's not the violence, altho there's plenty of that, or the language or sex. It's the development of the main character who is simply a horrible person who occasionally does the right thing. Unfortunately, his dark side completely dominates the gratuitous good deed that happens once every episode or so, and I guess that's supposed to render him complex. Unfortunately, he just comes across as a boor, and often a rather stupid one. He is a bully, immersed in ugly stuff, including murder and graft, and every episode, predictably, brings a new crisis that threatens, predictably, to expose him, but somehow never does. The character is not as interesting or complex as Dexter, whose portrayal of bad vs. good left me rooting for him in spite of his violent nature. Vic Mackey is just a jerk and I kept hoping he'd get caught. I guess it took 7 years to get there, but I'm not willing to go along for the ride.	2.0	Leaves a bad taste in your TV	2014-01-29	1	0	1

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	"The show's main focus is on Detective Vic Mackey ( Michael Chiklis) who leads a team of three other detectives with the best arrest records in the department. While the team does get fantastic results, they are the dirtiest cops in L.A.. Captain David Acevada ( Benito Martinez) is brought into the department to help clean it up and to make sure things run smoothly so that a strong media image is maintained. Acevada soon learns however, that he is going to have his hands full when it comes to Vic and the strike team because they go by their own personal agenda. This of course soon pushes Aciveda towards going after the Strike Team personally...""The Shield"" in my opinion is one of the best shown on TV right now. The FX Network raised the quality of their programming up a notch when they released The Shield onto the air. The thing that I like most about the show, is how realistic it is. It actually feels like you are witnessing what goes on in the real world. The show often showcases acts of violence, nudity, and tons of profanity. That is why the show works. The quality of the show is put above the actual opinion of the viewers. The Shield is also the first cop show that I have seen that actually ties the episodes together. A lot of cop shows are based on what happens from case to case. But with The Shield, you actually have to see every episode to understand what's going on. Michael Chiklis offers one of the best performances I have ever seen with his portrayal of Vic Mackey. The character often toys with your emotions because you will find yourself hating the guy and supporting the guy all at the same time. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, despite being filled with relatively unknown actors.If you are fan of police related TV shows, The Shield is the one show that you should definately watch. The disturbing cases, excellent acting, and overall realistic feel will have you hooked after the very first episode. The DVD extras are a sweet bonus because of all the behind the scenes footage that is shown. Overall, this is an excellent buy that should not be passed up."	5.0	TV doesn't get much better than this...	2003-09-21	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A25AXWGBGJ5KBS	"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo"""	"I am almost angry with myself that I waited this long to ""get into"" this amazing series called ""The Shield"".Yes, I was aware how Michael Chiklis won the Globe, the Emmy, the freaking Nobel Prize, etc. Critics drooled over themselves in a manner not seen since the debut of ""The Sopranos"".I just wasn't ready for another cop show. I loved ""NYPD Blue"". That was enough for me.Then I got horrifically addicted to FX's  ""Nip/Tuck"", and now can't wait for Tuesdays and ""Rescue Me."" And then ""NYPD"" ended.I suddenly had the urge to give ""The Shield"", FX's flagship show, a try.What an idiot I was. This series is nothing short of amazing.There is nothing wrong with this show. Nothing.Name one other show you can say that about.The concept: to show the inner workings of a beleaguered police station, inhabiting an old church, in the middle of the worst section of L.A. They take an unflinching, thinly veiled look at the corruption (and decency) that led to the Rampart scandal, how race riots, drug wars, and political racketeering are part of the urban landscape... you will sit goggle-eyed staring at the TV at the brazen approach to some of these topics.This show is refreshingly lacking in political correctness.The idea is to present various points of perspective, good, bad, black, white, gray...and allow the viewer to arrive at their own moral conclusion.And my morals have never been so challenged by any sort of media than they have by this show. You will grapple with feelings you didn't realize you had. Your own ideas about race, drugs, crimes, the police, city politics will be prodded, pricked and scrambled like an egg. This happens because you are so drawn to the characters, you will find yourself wondering what you yourself would do in these tense situations. And you will do this without realizing what you are doing. Every brain cell will be involved and attentive.The thirteen episodes unfold like a carefully constructed puzzle. There are dramatic peaks within a show, as well as across 3-4 shows like mini-arcs, and in the end, all the threads come together in the altogether satisfying finale.The screenwriting is whip-crack smart...the dialogue is about the best on TV. The plot twists and turns are impossible to predict, yet as logical as a mathematic theorem. In other words, after seeing the entire season, there is not one false step. Not one unfair misdirection. Yet I was so absorbed...it was like riding a terrific rollercoaster, and you KNOW there's a drop or a loop or a curve up ahead, but you STILL are thrilled to the core.The look of the show takes the handheld technique pioneered by ""NYPD Blue"", and elevates it to a whole new level. It's beyond the ""docudrama"" level, to the point where you feel like you are ""on scene"", peeking over people's shoulders...The acting is justly celebrated. Top to bottom, these actors have been perfectly cast, beginning with Mr. Chiklis. I was only peripherally aware of him before, but during the pilot episode, he vaulted into my personal pantheon of great television actors. He makes an impression within milliseconds. After seeing the season, it will be not be a surprise to you anymore that he won the Emmy. In fact, it will seem like it could not have been anyone else.Next up on the ""ridiculously good"" list is CCH Pounder, so often seen on network TV, yet so often unappreciated. THAT will never happen again, as her every line, look, head move and scene entrance in this show is performed to perfection.Walton Goggins, as Chiklis' loco 2nd-in-command, is a bug-eyed manic marvel. This guy's clearly defective, but you can't take your eyes off him for a minute.Catherine Dent, as the female cop with secret issues and desires; Michael Jake, as the rookie black cop with religious conflicts; Jay Karnes as the flawed Boy Scout detective; Benito Martinez, as the Latino Captain with skeletons and political aspirations...they are all masterful. If they were this good before, where have they been all this time?Every episode has merit...in fact, on this DVD, every episode gets a commentary, and the funny thing is they DESERVE them. But I must single out the pilot.After seeing it, I knew instantly that I was hooked, and hooked for the long term. I knew I was in the presence of greatness, and I literally could not wait for the next episode. For me, this had only happened twice before: the aforementioned ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""24"". After the final shot, I yelled at my TV screen, apoplectic, ""Holy s@#t!""It was awesome, let me tell you.This is up there with ""Firefly"", ""Buffy"", ""Hill Street Blues"", ""Sopranos""...it's just great television.This is the reason TV is available on DVD."	5.0	This series is nothing short of amazing.	2005-08-15	6	5	1

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	"I love this show! I first got into it after reading some of the reviews posted here on these Season One dvds, so I thought I would give it a try and I purchased this complete season. I am truly glad that I did. I was hooked from the first episode to the last and I am now watching Season 2 on FX. What makes this show far better than all the other cop shows is that the production value is more in line with HBO or a movie than a cable television show. The acting is extremely good as are the scripts and dialogue. Even though Vic and his team are labeled ""dirty"" cops you can't help but root for them in the end. Michael Chiklis deserved his Golden Globe award for best actor, he takes on this role as if Vic Mackey was himself in a former life. I was also glad this show won the award for best drama series on TV. If you haven't seen the show yet and are unsure if you would like it, give it a try. It's a bit brutal and graphic, but by the time you finish the final episode, ""Circles,"" you will be speechless, praying to catch repeats of Season 2."	5.0	One of the Only Shows on TV Worth Watching!	2003-02-07	74	69	5

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A397RCIKNPZJEK	"Mr. A. K. Morgan ""mog_ster"""	Fantastic TV show from top to bottom. I first became interested in this when I heard that Michael Chiklis had won the Golden Globe - anyone beating Pres Bartlett and Tony Soprano to an award had to be from a helluva show! Here in the UK we have never heard of the Shield, and after reading a few online reviews, I dived right in and bought the box set. And I'm sure glad I did. Corrupt Strike Team leader Mackey is the show's dark, fiery heart, and you can't help rooting for Vic as he takes on the bad guys and fights off the do-gooders in the LAPD, even though we know he's no angel himself. High end production values, super-realistic violence, outstanding acting performances all round in a very well fleshed out cast (no dead wood on the screen, ever.) and totally intriguing plot lines make this riveting viewing from Ep1 right through to the end of season finale.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	APNQ1JXR2N67V	"MR Peterpan ""MR Peter"""	One of the best of the cop shows. This is all about the seedier side of police work. First and foremost the realistic aspect should not be mention considering that the show is based on The Rampart division and the police corruption from that division. I thought it would be just another cop drama just like every other one you see on TV I am very happy to say its nothing like the rest. The acting in the show is brilliant. The best part is I lived in Echo Park back in the early 80s till mid 90s and the show is right on the money. From the drugs to the gangs to  corrupt cops.It's not always about good guys catching bad guys. In the real world, sometimes the bad guys win - and The Shield does a fabulous job of illustrating this fact. The show is award-winning, and deserves every accolade it receives. When it goes off the air, the void will be hard to fill. Simply put, this is one of the best cop shows I have seen.	5.0	One of the best cop show I've ever seen.	2013-07-31	0	0	0

If one is interested in sitting down and relaxing with a television show at the end of the day, I would not recommend &#34;The Shield&#34;.  The acting is good and the story line is decent.  However, the violence and the unnecessary sexual content (nude buttocks) detract from the program.  There is enough violence in &#34;real&#34; life everyday on the news and in the newspapers.

I've seen bits and pieces of this show in the past but when I started at the beginning and was able to follow the whole episodes back to back, I became clearly attached to the chariters! What superb acting by all of the players! Michael Chiklis, Catherine Dent, Walton Goggins, & BenIto Martinez and in season 4 the introduction of Glenn Close is stellar! There are many more Actors (too many to list) that all add to the vivid details of what life in the &#34;Hood&#34; may really be like! The good, the bad and the ugly of law enforcement! I've watched many such concepts but strongly feel that this show brings it &#34;IN YOUR FACE&#34; sometimes heart stopping and leaves you itching to see the next episode!

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Originally titled Rampart; The Shield burst onto cable TV with a blast and never stopped exploding.  A slimmed down Michael Chiklis (who many may remember as the title role from TV's The Commissh) is Vic Mackey; a detective who operates on both sides of the law in a fictional crime ridden district of Los Angeles.  Chiklis deserves all the praise he has garnered in his role since The Shield premiered; and the rest of the ensemble cast of character and virtually unknown actors are almost every bit as good.  From the shocking series premiere (the climax of which proved to be more shocking than all the hype surrounding it promoted it to be) to the season's brilliant final act; The Shield always revolves around the idea of a crooked cop drama, and it had an ace up it's sleeve at the same time.  All in all, if you've missed out on the best TV cop drama on cable television today, now has never been a better time to give The Shield a look.	5.0	Simply the best	2003-08-26	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1LJFKIZ15WP32	Nicholas Doles	"This is in my opinion the best show on television right now. I started watching this show when FX did a reshowing in preparatin for season two and have been hopelessly addicted since. Rawer and gittier than ""The Sopranos"" better acting and more realistic than ""Law & Order"" (since Orbach and Noth left at least). This show has everything.The show takes place in LA in an experimental satellite station in the crime infested Farmington district. The show revolves around Vic Mackie, played by Michael Chikliss, the leader of a strike team that continuously crosses the line into crime. I had people tell mr they couldn't imagine Chikliss as anything but the Commish. This show will blow that image clean out of your mind. Along with the main storyline around the strike team are several periphreal story lines about other cops in the station. Rather than detract from the story they enrich it and add an additional level of reality.The extra features on this are great. If you thought the show crossed the line you will not believe some of the stuff they left out. The commentaries are also interesting and informative. I really liked a set they did on sound. I never realized how much sound was added after a scene was shot.Hands down this is the best, most realistic cop drama ever done."	5.0	My Favorite Show on TV	2005-07-11	5	4	1

As a fan of Chiklis since back in his Commish days, watching this show was such a pleasant departure from his previous acting stints. The show is top notch with a quality storyline, and some good acting.If you're a fan of shows like NYPD Blue, Law and Order, and shows of that nature, I'd suggest trying out the shield. It's more gritty, with more violence, language and sex, but the story arc is pretty solid.	5.0	Great show	2013-05-14	0	0	0

(It's a wonderful world we live in when we can now just buy whole season of television shows).  You only have to watch the first three minutes of this show to know that this is no ordinary cop show.  And by the end of that first episode, I dare you not to have your mouth hanging open.  Michael Chiklis is a dynamite actor and does remind you of an adorable pitbull that should never ever ever play with your children.  As much as I enjoy this series-over the course of the first 13 episodes, I'd be remissed if I didn't bring up, that there are times when the dialogue comes across a bit cheesy/campy or scene sort of looks too staged.  There are plenty of risk-taking performances: Chiklis and Jace are the first ones to come to mind.  Highly highly recommended.	5.0	Definitely a new kind of cop show	2007-04-03	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3U4VUSBJMR5KP	Patrick A. Hayden	"I heard about ""The Shield"" from a friend at work, and the idea of Michael Chiklis, TV's ""The Commish"", as a bruising, corrupt but with a unique sense of justice cop seemed ludicrus.  Still, I turned in for the marathon that FX played right before the Season one finale, and I was hooked.  You see, it's not just Chiklis who makes this show work(he is incrdible, by the way, and by no means was his winning an Emmy a mistake), it's the entire cast and the way the show refuses to just focus on one part of life in the precient.  The show gives you four distinct storylines each week, and weaves them in and out over the course of the season.  Each storyline is engrossing, and each charachter played to perfection.Chiklis is the obvious standout, and one of only two ""name"" actors on the show, the other being CCH Pounder.  Pounder has been a great B-list actress for years, and she's been given excellent material to work with, as the straight shooting but street-weary detective who is partnered up with a smart young detective who feels the need to prove himself to the veterans on the force, and is usually put through hell by Chiklis.The other two story arcs involve a beat cop training a rookie with a secret he dare not reveal, and the new, politically abitious Captain, a young hispanic who was rose quickly through the ranks because he was young and hispanic.  He knows this, and wants to make a real name for himslef, and sets his sights on taking down Chiklis and his squad of corrupt yet oddly honorable cops.  That they end up working together as much as against each other is a testament to the ingenuity of the writers.The season starts off hot, as we're introduced to the whole cast, and keeps getting tougher and more uncompromising as we learn more about the players.  Chiklis is a family man at heart, though he sleeps around.  CCH Pounder has lots of family issues, the young Detective goes through hell to solve cases, and it starts to affect him personally, and the Captain faces one problem after another, usually sparked by something Chiklis has done.  Was his promotion to this precient a pat on the back or a slap in the face?All of this is portrayed brilliantly, and I heartily recommend the DVD if you've seen the show.  It is always rewatchable, and always tense, with a good sense of humor as well.  It will make you think and it will have you screaming in outrage.  TV hasn't been this good since ""The Sopranos"" started."	4.0	Intense Drama that Always Surprises	2003-01-02	4	3	1
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A26XCS3QLDJJWN	"Patrick G. Varine ""Make beats, not war, haha..."""	"I thought Law & Order had set the bar pretty high for a cop serial (even though it doesn't focus spc. on the cops, I know, I know), but as far as entertainment goes, you can't beat The Shield.You can guarantee what's going to happen on Law & Order: someone's gonna get murdered, and there will be a trial. The Shield guarantees none of that, except maybe the murder. If there is a trial, you ain't gonna see it, and if Det. Vic Mackey and his Strike Team deal with a problem the way they want, ain't gonna be no trial, either.Following a team of cops that are corrupted to varying degrees puts a whole new slant on the cop show. It's hard to know whether to cheer for Mackey or not as he makes decisions that frequently have little to do with police ethics.Cringe as he doesn't remove children from a crackhouse, but instead advises the owner ""to put 'em in the back room and rent the Lion King... just keep them away from this s***.""  Watch in disbelief as he beats a hooker (at her request) so that her story about killing a john will wash with the cops.And through all this, Mackey is a) trying to avoid the net of Capt. Aceveda, which gets tighter and tighter following the wickedest decision Mackey makes in the series' first episode and b) trying to save his family and his son, whose learning disability becomes painfully clear midway through the first season.Add a stellar cast of characters and just the right amount of T&A;, violence and ignorant jokes (hey, what can I say, I'm a 24-year-old male...), and you've got an appallingly great show that I'm just now getting into.I watched the first season in less than two days. Probably ditto for the second season, which just came in today's mail. Compelling is the only way to describe it. Can't wait for the new season on F/X.If you're a big Law & Order fan, and ESPECIALLY if you liked Homicide: Life on the Street, this is the show for you."	5.0	Possibly the best cop show ever -- and I LOVE Law & Order	2006-01-23	6	5	1
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A309B18FKBVCOA	Patrick King	The complexity of Vic Mackey as performed by Michael Chiklis deserves all the accolades it gets. Mackey is an evil entity but he is not entirely wrong and it is that love/hate relationship that makes this show compelling. When one considers that this IS what police work HAS to be in most jurisdictions we understand that unless we make a concerted effort to do things differently problems with ethics will always abound and law enforcement will always be between a rock and a hard place. This is the first show to tackle the questions James Ellroy poses in his fiction, but in real life it is thinking like this that enabled Whitey Bulger to murder twenty people while working for the FBI. For those who like their crime shows gray, complex, and thought provoking there is no better crime drama than The Shield.	5.0	Makes Law & Order seem naive	2014-05-28	0	0	0

There are many other rich characters such as Dutch, Julien, Claudette, Danny, Shane, and Captain David Aceveda who tries to bring down Mackey. Throughout the season, each of the characters have their share of problems as they try to stop murderers, rapists, drug dealers, and much more.

[A year later: nope, he didn't get engrossed, and finally gave it back to me.] Vic Mackey, played brilliantly by Michael Chicklis, is such a mixture of admirable and detestable qualities that he gives a fascinating and credible picture of the moral complexity of human beings.  And the rest of the cast does a beautiful job, too.  Glenn Close was a guest star for one whole season, and other big-name stars in other seasons.	5.0	Makes a good gift.	2010-01-21	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"My excuse for not having seen this series before now is twofold.  First, although I try to keep up with between thirty-five and fifty television series each year (I have to watch that many for my specific scholarly and academic interests and writing), it simply isn't possible to see everything, not even everything that you know is supposed to be good.  Second, I hate cop shows.  I mean, I despise them.  I especially hate procedurals and because I loathe them so utterly I tend to avoid some shows simply because, like procedurals, they have cops in them.  With regard to the first, each summer I try to catch up on shows from the past that I have wanted to see, and with regard to the second I sometimes just make myself watch shows even though the genre doesn't interest me in the least.  I'm delighted to say that I really loved this show despite the presence of cops.What sets this show apart is the writing.  Good writing is not tied to a particular genre.  Some of the best written shows that I've seen in the past decade or so would include MAD MEN, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, DEADWOOD, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  This is an exceptionally diverse group of shows.  What I love about THE SHIELD is the way that they throw so many strong, exceptionally complex characters into one another's faces.  There is a great line from the film THE LADY EVE, in which Barbara Stanwyck's character tells a guy that the good girls are never as bad as they seem to be and the bad ones are never as bad.  That is true here.  No cop would seem to be more ""bad"" than Vic Mackey, but he is capable of some shocking displays of humanity and compassion.  He is impossible to predict.  And that ends up being true of just about every character on the show.If, unlike me, you love cop shows, you've probably already seen this.  But if you are a fellow hater of cop and crimes shows, don't let that keep you from watching this.  If you love quality television, you are almost certainly going to love this."	5.0	A truly great television series	2010-07-24	1	1	0

So, I figured that I would give it a try. I'm hooked! I have watched all of Season 1 and am about halfway through Season 2. I really want to take a vacation and lock myself in a room until I complete all seven seasons! Since that won't happen, I will work my way through them and enjoy it as I go. I would recommend this show to anyone looking to wrestle with concepts related to honesty and integrity and what they mean and also to explore &#34;good&#34; from various perspectives.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AIRI2A2SEF0TS	S. B. Sivaganesh	After reading great reviews about this series, I decided to take the plunge and get the 1st season. I was totally Blown away!!!Here in Singapore, we're never gonna get the series on air with its questionable content, which is a shame considering the performances of such a great ensemble cast...Vic - bad cop/good cop/amoral cop...you decide. A bible thumping homosexual who wants to do whats right, A latino captain with political aspirations trying to nail Vic in anyway possible but who knows he needs him as well. Dutch, sometimes brainiac-comic relief element who just wants respect....I love the Sopranos but I'd bet my bottom dollar Vic would take him down in a second......Please bring on Season 2 on DVD now!!!!	5.0	Bring On Season 2	2003-04-15	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A19HCQSC5FVOXW	Scott McFarland	"This might not be for the faint-of-heart - this is the ""Hard R"" to NYPD Blue's ""PG-13"".  It aims for a greater degree of realism (or hyper-realism) in the detectives' interactions with pedophiles, murderers, drug traffickers than ABC's show can.For everyone who can take it - say, everyone who can appreciate the movie ""Reservoir Dogs"" (which might have helped to pioneer the level of machismo in entertainment that you'll see here) this is a hell of a show.The influences are obvious - this is about 50% NYPD Blue (the style of the show, and some of the substance), 20% The Sopranos (central figure is amoral by traditional standards, and brutal), 20% Training Day (which was also based in Los Angeles, and also concerned with the difference between being a wolf or a sheep), and maybe 10% Bad Lieutenant (the raw exploits of a corrupted soul).The show does a lot with those influences.  From the pilot episode on, it sets itself up with logic and precision.  We watch a group of characters interact in a series of games and conflicts, coming to understand all of their points of view, and not understanding how or if the conflicts between them will resolve.  Like ""The Sopranos"", this is a brilliant character-based show.  It's highly compelling viewing, and adds up to an interesting portrait of modern urban police work (and not a pretty one)."	5.0	Excellent Television	2003-02-03	1	1	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	ANEDXRFDZDL18	Serene Night	The Shield is one of the most dynamic and realistic cop shows I've seen. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis), is  a corrupt, mafia-style cop. His gang of thugs, brutalize L.A., and at the same time keep the peace. Mackey pulls no punches. He's bad. But its a good kind of bad. At least a kind of bad you want to watch. &#60;Grin&#62;.Office dynamics between the dirty cops and the 'straight-shooters' on the force occasionally blur to produce interesting dynamics. In particular, I felt sorry for Julian, who seems one of the most 'human' characters on the show. Dutchboy and his partner are interesting. The only character I don't like? The female cop Danny(Julian's parter) and Vic's occasional girlfriend. Its pretty sad that she is continually fooled by Vic...Sorry, and this lady wants to be a Sergeant? Vic treated Julian terribly and who does she side with? Sorry...Danny annoys me. She's pretty dim, and considering she's one of the two main female characters on the show, I hope she's replaced for someone with a brain AND a spine.Other than that, this is a great series. Sure to delight fans of Police Drama. Vic Mackey is a guy you love to hate.	5.0	Engrossing...Despite itself	2004-11-08	2	2	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3MT6AW1SN0P9K	"S. Henkel ""subdivisions"""	"I would give this program 10 stars if I could. I saw the previews before the first season started, but was not able to see the first few episodes so I did not watch any of them. I have this thing about watching episodes in order so I waited. Then they played each episode one day after another. Truely the most perfect casting. I loved The Commish and I cannot believe it is the same person. I was praying that it would be available on DVD soon and it will be. I was told by someone that it was too violent. Fighting drugs and crime cannot be dealt with any other way. this is not customer service where you have to wear a constant smile to prevent insulting someone killing people and selling dope. There is a big difference in a personal drug user and a dealer. If letting a personal user slide (within logical reason) to catch the ones dealing to kids and gangs, then it must be allowed. It is no different than every day life elsewhere. Just in a different form. If I was a cop and someone pulled out a carton of smokes, I would not hesitate to shoot. No time to say ""you got me. Nice joke"" Cops do not make that much money, but have to worry about how they defend themselves. If I pulled out a carton like a weapon, I would expect to get shot. Who wants to die for a criminal's rights over their own. This show will grow to be quite a great thing. I know someone that is a drug user and hates the show and it is because it does not promote drugs. So if it scares people that are trouble, then the show really works. People worry about cigarettes killing people. I worry more of someone on coke with a gun. Season two will be awesome I am sure!!!11"	5.0	Totally Hypnotizing!!!	2002-12-13	10	4	6

You watch the show and just get [drawn] in.I remember sitting back and watching it the first time... I don't recall which episode but it really doesn't matter...You see the NYPD Blue type show, you see the cops at the precinct (which they call the Barn), and then you see something amazing. Something the opposite of what a 'good' cop would do. Something bad.. but good.And you like it. In fact with every move made by Vic and his team, you realize that things aren't done as nicely even by Andy Sippowitz, or the other TV cops. They are brutal. But generally, they get the bad guys off the streets, and get money on the side.You just have to watch it. It's the best show on TV.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	AHY8DVJ6VB5OY	"STONE A JUDLIN ""cajun 2 step cut short?"""	The Shield graphically illustrates what most large, inner-city police forces probably must deal with on a daily basis.  We don't always like the way the principal characters deal with crime problems;  but we don't dislike it enough to trade places with them and become the enforces, either.  The writers subscribe to a belief that rules and regulations often inhibit the ability of those we hire to keep us (and themselves) safe safe from  personal harm, and their ability to enforce the law.  So we can appreciate their frustrations and their willingness at times to bend the law in order to to enforce it.  Characters are well written and well portrayed.  Constance violence (murder, torture) etc and drug-use and gangs are realistically depicted; so if you are squeamish, choose a Disney movie.	5.0	REALISTIC AND GRITTY...	2013-04-24	3	2	1

Every episode in this season is an exercise in violence, character development and nihilism. Michael Chiklis is the very definition of an anti-hero as Detective Vic Mackey and the anchor of the show. It's not a show for the faint of heart as every episode has something to repel you but if you let it, it'll grab you by the collar and hold you down for what is indeed a wild ride into a world of corruption, ulterior motives and the never ending battle for justice.

The show has such amazing character depth and development that you really get a clear understanding of just how complicated each character really is. The actors also do an incredible job making their characters believable.The show itself hits all the right notes for me: it's dark and gritty, but there's a softer side that deals with family issues as well. There's also the occasional zinger thrown in to give you a laugh. I just cannot say enough about this show.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	The first time I remember seeing Michael Chiklis in something, he played John Belushi in the grotesque film version of WIRED about 15 years ago.  I was a fan of Belushi and liked Bob Woodward's book but that movie was obscene.  I felt bad for Chiklis because he did a great job but the production was darn-near evil in its approach to Belushi.Actor's careers can be killed over messes like that.But how sweet it must be now!  I was thrilled for Chiklis when I heard he'd come out of nowhere to win the Emmy for THE SHIELD.  Then I saw THE SHIELD on DVD from beginning to end.  Wow.  This is a show that lives up to its hype.  From a single gunshot in the first episode, I felt like I was in a whole new world here.  This is a tough, brutal show but expertly crafted and wildly unpredictable.The characters are perfectly cast and each feels real with a life of his or her own--and every demon that comes with the job.  I was also happy to see CCH Pounder in a great role because I always seemed to see her in smaller, unsympathetic roles before.I can pay this series one of the highest compliments of a TV show: There's only one thing ahead of the characters--the writers!	5.0	A Show that Lives Up to its Hype	2004-02-10	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2L4XGVPR42KHL	"Therabbitssing ""on the rock that spews lava.."""	"After much hype by FX, the Shield debuted on cable television last year.  It quickly became a hit, with its gritty and controversial characters, top-notch writing, and superb acting.  There have been many attempts to do police dramas, but the Shield elevates the bar.  With Michael Chiklis plays the lead role of Vic Mackey, the leader of a special strike team that does things in legal and not so legal ways at times to get the job done.One of the most interesting aspects of the show is wondering what Vic will do next.  He does some questionable things at times, but you can't help root for him and his team.  With a Captain out to expose Mackey for the ""dirty"" cop that he is, every episode has you hooked and eagerly anticipating the next.  Rounding out the superb cast, is the mentioned Captain, two detectives that get to solve many interesting cases, and two patrol officers, one a female training officer teaching the job to a new rookie.  Intertwining them all is expertly done, and each actor knows their character so well, that you can feel it each time they speak.The Shield pushes the limits of what can be shown on TV, though not as blatant as the Sopranos (which has to be shown on HBO), it has it's share of swearing and some brief partial nudity, as well as dealing with subject matter that is not for the kids.  It's about time that a police drama is shown this way.  NYPD Blue touched on this, but The Shield in the first season manages to take it up a notch.The DVD set of the first season includes 4 discs containing the 13 episodes of season one, and includes a making of documentary and commentary on the episodes.  Video quality is fairly good, but at times some artifacts are present.  All in all, a good set and the quality of the show itself makes this set shine brightly. An award winning show with an Emmy and two Golden Globes (best Drama series and Michael Chiklis, Best actor Drama), you can't go wrong here."	5.0	A reason to stay home and watch TV	2003-01-29	10	8	2

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	ABPSNLWY0EELP	T. Jonek	The Shield season 1 is a great way to start off knowing the show better. On the very first epidsode, it shows the main character who is Vic Mackey killng one of his own strike team members to show what type of a guy he is. Vic Mackey does alot of crooked things in this show and manages to get away with them! The season contains deleted scences and other bonus features. If you are really into The Shield, I reccomend starting of with the first season and keep continuing season after season in a row to find out what all goes on in Vic Mackey's crooked cop life.	5.0	The Shield season 1	2008-11-02	0	0	0

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A96JD9312DHWC	"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S"""	"In LA, Farmington creates a special kind of criminal. In addition to smaller gangs trying to cash in on the money and prestige to be had, there are the bigger gangs with bigger agendas and individuals with their own problems. This creates dilemmas of all kinds and calls for cops of all calibers to stem this proverbial tide of violence. Enter Vic Mackey, head of Farmington's elite Strike Force and a true force to be reckoned with. Far from the police units that operate within the clearly-divided blue lights of ""justice,"" Mackey operates his force like a cold and calculating mob of his own. This means he has enemies on all sides of the law and that he creates a story that is really worth watching.When it came to The Shield, I was initially hesitant because I really detest the overflow of ""Cop drama"" on television. I thought I had seen all the different types of dirty cops that the network minds had to offer and I wasn't in the mood for another slice of the shield-toting pie. Then I watched the pilot, saw just how far the strike team - Ronnie, Shane, Lem, and Vic - were willing to go, and reevaluated my priorities. As I continued watching the show I found that it worked on a lot of other levels as well, making me think about the motivations of every person involved and how tempting power like the type Mackey finds himself faced with could really be. A cop with a family, a child with a disability, and a job that doesn't really appreciate the things that are done in its name; that brings up the question of where does prevention end and crime really begin?This isn't to say that the Strike Team is the whole of the tale; far from it in fact. The 13 episodes on the disc are really the story of a lot of people trying to maintain a fine line on a personal and professional level, following two main detectives and a drove of other police officers and showcasing progression as the series goes forward. I'm writing this at the conclusion of the 6th series, too, knowing how much these people start to mean and how many of them lose small things like dignity or larger things like life. Not wanting to spoil things I have to end it there, simply saying that the show will keep giving and that Mackey always has a method in some of most beautiful forms of madness I've watched play out.Just watch the pilot and you'll understand what I mean.About the Set: Full-Frame, Subtitles: English, SpanishEpisodes Included: 1- Pilot. 2- Our Gang. 3 - The Spread. 4 - Dawg Days. 5 - Blowback. 6 - Cherrypoppers. 7 - Pay in Pain. 8 - Cupid & Psycho. 9 - Throwaway. 10 - Dragonchasers. 11 - Carnivores. 12 - Two Days of Blood. 13 -Circles.Also included: commentary, ""behind the shield"" featurette, a few deleted scenes"	5.0	Remember, the Team comes First	2007-06-06	2	2	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A6YNTCM9QFW8W	"T.

Lessons are learned the hard way; and, power plays lead to more violence.  However, this television Chicago suburb is not the typical population or police force.

This series is a must for anyone who is starving for unpredictable, unprecedented action/drama/excitement.  It is never what it seems.  The Shield comes at the viewer from so many different directions that it keeps the viewer guessing to the end of each and every episode.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	APM7GS9OEPUXI	"Vic Rattlehead ""MegaSlayer"""	"The Shield and The Wire are my two favorite ""cop"" shows. They're really more than just cop shows though. If you take this entire series as a whole (5 seasons so far) it's like a snapshot of the world (specifically, America) we currently live in. Every human emotion I can think of gets screen time on The Shield. But this is by no means an emotional type ""soap opera"". It's as down and dirty as it gets and the characters are real. Every character in the show has problems, no matter what level of command they're at, or how tough (or weak) they are (or appear). That's probably the thing I like most about shows like The Shield and The Wire. The cops aren't 100% good, and the criminals aren't 100% bad (although, there's some bad mf's in here if you know what I mean). From an entertainment standpoint, these DVDs are as addictive as some of the drugs portrayed in it. I have a hard time not watching at least an entire disc every time I sit down to watch it. Owning TV shows like this is both a blessing and a curse because they definitely cut into potential sleep time (or whatever else you have going on).From a technical standpoint, these DVDs are impressive. As you may have noticed, there is quite a bit of grain and ""noise"" in the video quality. At first I was disappointed and thought it was poor recording quality but have since come to find out that it's because the show was filmed with 16mm film. I am no authority on TV cameras or film, but apparently the type of film directly affects how the final DVD presentation appears. I have also come to appreciate the look and think it adds to the overall raw nature of the show. If it were too polished looking, it would probably be a downside. The Shield is gritty and rough, just how it looks. The sound is standard Dolby 2.0 and sounds great. Nothing fancy, but it does the trick.In conclusion, if you want well written drama with a good dose of action, comedy, and suspense...look no further than The Shield. As mentioned earlier, I also recommend The Wire, which is equally as good. These types of shows are more than just good TV, they're art. The same type of talent goes into writing, acting, and producing this as it does for you're favorite musician or painter to create a masterpiece."	5.0	One of the best shows ever!!	2007-05-29	0	0	0

Maybe.This past Christmas season I made several purchases on Amazon that didn't work out. May as well keep the Items because the return charges are 1/2 to 3/4 the money paid for them.

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A1U00UH4ICCKT0	Wesley H Hay	I am not finished watching the entire first season and Ipossibly would give it more stars after seeing more episodes.I'm still not sure how to take the character played by Michael Chiklis.He clearly is not a &#34;good&#34; cop.the series probably has more realism in it, than even maybe thewriters had intended. If he truly turns out to be a complete scumbag cop,then I will probably stop watching the series. Let's just say it is still ina trial bases with me.	3.0	The Shield, Season 1	2014-05-17	0	0	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3947BYDZGE1FH	"West End Girl ""West End Girl"""	So many times characters are either all good or all bad. That's not how life is. Bad people are sometimes heart-rendingly good and good people screw it up so bad you wonder if they're really gonna make it into heaven. And that's the making of a good believeable character. Enter The Shield. A great assortment of characters who blur the line.Crap! Am I cheering for that guy?But he's the Commish..No he isn't!But I know why he's doing it! Wait it doesn't matter if he's stealing this money out of love for his family! Does it?When does the new season come out again?If you liked NYPD Blue before it devolved into nothingness, you'll love The Shield - it's  a million times better.	5.0	Hooray for the bad guy!	2005-01-23	1	1	0
B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"Since I've never been a cop, I can't really vouch for how realistic its portrayal of urban police work is, but there's no denying that the first season of The Shield makes for some mighty compelling drama.  The Shield was a target for controversy from the very beginning, drawing all kinds of free publicity from TV journalists fascinated by the fact that the show contained such words as ""s--t"" and ""balls,"" but those willing to look deeper were greeted with a fierce, intelligent drama that upped the ante on decades of TV cop fare.  Granted, The Shield was hardly the first police drama on TV, nor was it the first to reflect a more modern sensibility on the part of its creators--both Homicide: Life on the Street (which I watched) and NYPD Blue (which I didn't) were known for their gritty, realistic depictions of police work and occasional use of naughty words.  That said, if you thought five years ago that there was nothing left for a cop drama to say, you would've been wrong: whatever the first season of The Shield lacked in originality it more than made up for in complexity and sheer intensity.  This first season barrels through thirteen episodes at lightning speed, throwing so much at you that it's virtually impossible to get bored.  Below all the action and cliffhanger finales, though, The Shield manages to overcome cop-show cliches and make itself a worthy watch because its writers blend intricate plotting with multi-dimensional characterizations and a healthy dose of moral ambiguity.  Much as FX's other great dramas, Rescue Me and Over There, de-romanticize the lives of firefighters and soldiers, respectively, The Shield presents a portrait of cops as deeply compromised people trying to do a tough job under incredibly trying circumstances.Naturally, no characters on the show are more clearly compromised than the always-compelling Vic Mackey and his Strike Team, who are almost impossible not to watch as they steal, beat, make deals with drug pushers, and generally abuse their power.  At first I thought the creators of the show were daring viewers not to like Mackey, but then I came to a more counterintuitive conclusion: Shawn Ryan and co. are daring us to *like* Mackey, to approve of his methods and the results they produce in spite of his blatant corruption and disrespect for procedure.  All this intentional ambiguity surrounding Mackey and his men actually goes to what I think is the other main thrust of the show, namely that moral rectitude and effectiveness as a police officer may not go hand in hand.  The show may take place in the fictional Farmington district of LA, but its setting could be a stand-in for pretty much any inner city where racial division and fears of crime run rampant (or, to put it another way, pretty much any inner city).  When they're presented against this context, it's easy to view cops like Mackey as a necessary evil at worst.Anyway, while Mackey and his behavior seemed to get The Shield a disproportionate amount of its considerable press, it's still hard not to notice what how many great characters there are overall here.  For all of Michael Chiklis's sound and fury as Mackey, my favorite this first season was actually Det. Holland ""Dutch"" Waggenbach, played in career-making fashion by Jay Karnes.  Dutch is the quintessential misfit (especially in a police station), the socially awkward guy who can't take a joke and internalizes everything, and winds up getting perceived as a glory hog because he just wants to be respected for his own abilities.  I have no idea why, but some small part of me can relate to a shy, overanalytical type who wants to be liked but who doesn't fit in well with his peers.  Benito Martinez is probably the most memorable after that as Captain Acevada, who in his own way is just as morally gray as Mackey, at times almost to the point of being amoral.  Much as Dutch typifies the well-intentioned misfit, Acevada typifies the ambitious social climber, the guy you can't really trust because he almost always has a self-interested ulterior motive, namely pacifying the Hispanic lobby and advancing his own political career.Like with so many other of the best shows on TV these days, The Shield is able to pull off its nuanced characterizations so well because its writers prove to be experts at developing them over time, as well as balancing single-episode plots with longer, more complex arcs that extend over several episodes.  Without giving away too much, there are numerous key strands that hold the season together even as smaller plots come and go: Vic's struggles to keep a lid on his collaboration with a local drug dealer; Dutch's search for a serial killer; Assistant Chief Gilroy's various perfidies; Aceveda's political maneuverings; and of course Julien Lowe's struggles with being a gay black religious rookie cop, which are handled a lot more delicately than you might expect from such a show.  The last few episodes are especially addictive, moving at even-faster-than-usual speed and expertly ratcheting up dramatic tension as they bring a bunch of plots to a head until I JUST COULDN'T STOP WATCHING!!!!!!!!!!  DAMN YOU CREATORS OF THE SHIELD WHY DO YOU MAKE YOUR SHOW SO DIFFICULT TO STOP WATCHING!!!!Oh, sorry, don't know what got into me there.  Guess that's just what watching The Shield does to me.  Well, now that I've calmed down, I guess I'll just state dryly that I consider The Shield to be about as addictive as heroin, and easily one of the best new TV shows I've picked up in the past five years.  Yeah, that sounds about right."	4.0	Like an elephant to the head (4.5 stars)	2006-01-09	14	14	0

Which makes them more human.  And I can't figure out why I like Vic Mackey and root for him so much (despite the despicable things he does in order to serve justice) but I do.  Perhaps it's because Michael Chiklis is so charismatic - great acting on his part.  Darn good television.	5.0	Darn Good TV	2013-10-04	0	0	0

I must admit, at first I had doubts about another cop show but this show is so amazing! Everytime, I wish the show would never end! The Sopranos really have a competition except this is way better because they deal with people's everyday problems and gets to the root of things. The SUPER COPS are crooked as a politician but you gotta love the way they handle things. No matter what they do, you just can't hate them. It's too much drama but it's the dramas they have that makes the show so awesome! This is a MUSTTTTTT SEEEEEE especially if you like action!	5.0	ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS!!!!!!!!!!	2004-07-10	7	5	2

B00006RCNW	The Shield - The Complete First Season	A2W6Z81650LI83	"WordLover ""WordLover"""	Having just come off finishing up all the seasons of Rescue Me, I was sure there couldn't possibly be any more testosterone left in the universe. I was wrong! The Shield, season one, makes Rescue Me look like a bunch of outgrown college boys making jokes around a stolen frat-house keg. I'll be honest; I almost didn't make it through The Shield's first season. The characters seemed one-dimensional and I felt like I didn't really care about them at all--I was at that point in serial-viewing where I cut my losses and move on, or I bite the bullet (pun intended) and stay with it. Metal has a tangy taste! Near the end of season one, I felt the urge (not necessarily the addiction) to continue. The story lines become more complex, and the characters have ALL experienced issues or events that have made them evolve. I'm a middle-aged female college professor, so I need more than &#34;mere&#34; ethical dilemmas and a couple of fancy guns to keep me watching. The Shield brings with it smart writing, talented casting, and edgy filming techniques. I'm nearing the end of Season 3 and it just keeps getting better!	4.0	Testosterone with a Badge	2013-06-08	0	0	0

Everyone has heard about Chiklis but Walton Goggins also thrives as Shane, Vic Mackey's closest friend.  Any fans of The Wire should watch this.  I'm really into great drama series and this is a top 10 show easily, perhaps top 5 because the final season is awesome and the performances across the board are pretty great.	5.0	Worth the Watch	2013-07-27	0	0	0

However, he's also a corrupt drug dealer and cop-killer. They manage to reconcile the two into a morally ambiguous cop with a good sense of humor and tons of clout. You end up rooting for him despite the bad stuff, not an easy task for any show. Well done	5.0	a bad guy that grows on you	2013-03-30	0	0	0
