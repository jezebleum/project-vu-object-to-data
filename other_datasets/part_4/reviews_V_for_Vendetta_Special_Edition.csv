The bluray itself is excellent condition and I'm happy I bought it used. I have it on HD-DVD but instead of whipping on my HD-DVD external drive for my Xbox 360 I wanted to use my PS3 instead. It was easier to buy this used on amazon than to use Warner Bros. trade-in for blu program (and about the same price if not cheaper.)Movie review:V for Vendetta has been probably one of the most influential films in the past 10 years. It has a very ""anti-government"" theme that resonates with many people; conservatives and liberals alike. Released during the second George W. Bush administration, this movie depicts the fascist state that England becomes if the Nazis had won WWII. It stars Hugo Weaving as the shadowy avenger known only as ""V"" and Natalie Portman who plays news reporter Evey Hammond. Evey and V meet when Evey is attacked by some of the state's henchmen.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ALIBRR4PLLLX2	A Customer	Critics call this movie unpatriotic or Anti-Christian.This is the story of a Totalitarian Society.  One where the Government can Black List anything. Where every career is a pawn of the regime. Where the regime can enter homes without cause or warrant.  Where citizens can be imprisoned or executed at the whim of it's dictator.V was captured and experimented on by that regime.  Those experiments erased his memory and enhanced his physical speed and reflexes.  Those experiments also created Bio Weapons that let the regime enslave V's country.  After escaping V spent the next few decades planning and executing his revenge - his revolution against that regime.  V was fighting to free his country.  Nothing could be more Patriotic.That regime destroyed most religions.  What it did to Christianity was even worse.  It reduced the Church to a Political Puppet, a farce of the Church, a Mockery of all Christ was.  It even turned the Cross into a Symbol of it's political power, instead of a sign of Christ's sacrifice. Those who see Anti-Christianity in this are right. V was fighting it.V for Vendetta is a masterpiece for all to love.	5.0	A Master Piece	2012-11-19	0	0	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2EEUQ81DTY7G3	A Customer	V For Vendetta certainly tackles some provocative and timely themes: media and government manipulation, and terrorism and the old adage that power corrupts and governments will single-handedly manipulate the populace to stay in power.  The film is packed with ideas - sometimes a little too many - but it's a smartly designed and superbly acted thriller and it actually gives you something to think about while you're watching the Britain's Parliament House get blown up.V For Vendetta indeed presents a scary scenario. It is England in 2020. The effects of world instability, including the downfall of the United States, have finally reached the country and now fascist political party has come to power, in the form of a draconian Thatcherism predicated on order, conformity and intolerance.With the government mushrooming into totalitarian repression, the public is controlled through police repression, surveillance and propaganda - particularly through the media. High Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) is a despot who rants from giant video monitors. Homosexuality or owning a Koran - unauthorized love and unauthorized faith - are capital crimes and free speech is seen as a disloyalty to the party, to the government and to the country. Into this mix comes the freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) who wears a mask and models himself in Britain's most famous revolutionary, Guy Fawkes.V is a revolutionary and an ideologue, his conversation is dense with analysis and philosophy; his fortress of solitude isn't a museum of weaponry, but a vast library and art gallery. He is a fearsome hand-to-hand fighter, who thinks of nothing of murdering to make his point. The center of his campaign is the protection of Evey (a ravishing Natalie Portman) when he saves her from being menaced by the secret police for violating curfew.The police (led by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) suspect that Evey is his accomplice, and V takes her into his sanctum for her own protection. As she witnesses him blow up the Old Bailey, Every falls ever more into V's revolutionary web. The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers parallels areas of government surveillance, torture, fear-mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, the references to current events being opportune depending on your world view.Whilst the back-story involving both Evey and V's past is a little convoluted, the Director James McTeigue adroitly visualizes the multifaceted story and keeps the action moving at a fast pace. At times, the script is a little overly alliterative and a section involving Stephen Fry's television host is filmed in such a way that it's hard to tell what's going on.The actors, however, are all suburb: Portman is wrenching as the victimized Evey, well matched by the masked Weaving, who crafts a terrific performance from body language and vocal inflections. Although V for Vendetta is not without its faults, it's still a timely, surprisingly entertaining and totally thought-provoking film on a future-world that could so easily come about in any country given the right political environment.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2UALOIFBDOI60	Adam Chen	"This movie laughs at all other movies and special effects. It is brilliantly a simple ruse to get you to laugh until you buy this DVD. You cannot stop yourself from buying it, since it is like the Mask you wear to go see the movie.In this movie, a terrorist called V recruits an acquired ally he rescues by chance. Soon he begins spreading his propaganda by getting people to wear his masks. Like those masks, this DVD spreads ideas in the minds of others, who then begin to appreciate his control over his mind and try to exert control over their own minds, in order to block the media suppression and violence stopping information from being spread. This movie supposes that even in restrictive areas and physical places like dictatorships, you can survive somehow with the mind intact. It urges you not to policy hate and destruction and instead policy information and dialogue. It is the hypnotist's manual, and it is the disgrace of politics.It further introduces you to the world of terrorism, that being a terrorist to self is a kind of self-meditation, since it takes HARD WORK being a good person in a world dominated by war, intrigue, politics, and poison. Poison because this world's worst fear is sickness and genetic codes.Deluded by self-intelligence, V attempts to break into a news tower and tries to broadcast his message all over. His first mistake, however, becomes almost his last, and that is how he meets his heroine, who saves him with a can of Mace. This begins the whole plot of the movie, and it doesn't really feel like a movie for the first part. V spouts so many words with the first letter 'v' to our heroine that it feels like you're reading a book.The first movie I've seen that makes movies look as moral and interesting as books. Certainly, parents won't want to censor this one and tell their kids that ""movies and television screens are bad for you"" and encourage them to read Clifford instead. I hardly need to say that seeing this once will open your mind if you're a right-wing extremist or hate Islam, since both are discussed here. In fact, ring-wingism is determinedly the status of this movie, and you should consider ordering your mind to this behavior if you truly believe politics can change world destinies, or World War III."	5.0	An amazing joke at meditation!	2006-08-01	7	0	7

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A32RDQQ47DSMYD	Aeneas	"This is just a Must See movie, as it has a powerful message apt for the times in which we are living. Though V himself is taking personal revenge in the way of killing the leaders in control, his appeal to people is not one of violence. He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime. That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.The scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non-violence and civil disobedience.As this non-violent uprising culminates in the film on the 5th of November, it is a timely reminder to go out and buy this video and let the message sink in.As a follow up reading ""1984"" by George Orwell, is eerily close in describing the fascist society that is shown in the film and sadly also close to the way things are going. The book ""Political Ponerology"" is another recommendable book that details the process by which a society gets to become a totalitarian state."	5.0	A film with a powerful message for our times!	2007-11-02	4	3	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3M2EGEIH4X2RZ	"aficionado guy ""aficionado guy"""	"I will put up with a lot from certain films.  I don't mind low budgets, inexperienced actors, flawed screenplays, etc., if the film has something good to offer.  That's one reason why I liked ""Bound,"" an earlier low budget offering from the Wachowski brothers.But I won't put up with a run-your-agenda-down-your-throat film from anyone.What's the difference between a normal film and. a run-the-agenda-down-your-throat film?  Well, for starters, the latter will feature ""good"" characters as wonderful, happy people with no character flaws whatsoever, while the ""bad"" characters will be completely corrupt and evil with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  A lot of writers have written stories as simplistic as this - when they were nine years old.Of course, a lot of great art was created with an agenda in mind.  Steinbeck's stated purpose in writing the Grapes of Wrath was to create sympathy for the plight of the migrant farm worker.  But he created memorable, well-rounded characters and a mature storyline, and in the process created great art - none of which V for Vendetta even tries to do.But don't take my word for it - decide for yourself.  Might this film have an anti-Christian, pro-gay agenda or no?  Let's see:1. The evil government is a fascist Christian theocracy, with a modified cross as symbol in the color scheme (red/black) of Nazi Germany.2. Every representative of the government is completely evil and corrupt with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever3. This evil government locks up/kills homosexuals for walking down the street hand-in-hand4. We are told that this Christian theocracy arose because of ""America's War,"" while we see news footage from Iraq5. Despite this current events reference, apparently showing a desire to root the film in reality, no acknowledgement is ever made that this type of ""oppression"" and ""fascism"" isn't actually happening in democracies.  That is, neither North America nor Europe actually haul off and kill homosexuals, but current Muslim theocracies like Iran and Saudi Arabia do.6. Despite this, a gay TV producer owns a copy of the government-outlawed Koran, which he says he likes for its ""poetry.""  Somehow its denunciations of gays and exhortations to kill them doesn't faze him7. The same gay TV producer is taken away by jackbooted thugs for criticizing the government, and later executed for owning a copy of the Koran8. With the possible exception of ""V,"" every protagonist is a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving character with no character flaws whatsoever.  Even Natalie Portman is so good-hearted she forgives V for imprisoning, torturing and humiliating her, falls in love with him and commits terrorism for him in the name of their ""love.""9. We are treated to an overly long flashback of a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving lesbian character with no character flaws whatsoever who recounts how she ""just wanted to love in peace"" but was hauled off, tortured and executed by the Christian Theocracy just for being gay.10. The head of the Christian church is an accomplice to murder and torture, is overtly corrupt, and is a pedophile.  Oddly enough, however, he is fixated on underage girls, not boys.  But why not?  After other attempts to have the film vaguely reflect reality, why not portray what is unfortunately the norm of priest pedophilia scandals, that is, man-boy?  Could it be that to portray homosexuality in any less-than-favorable light would be unacceptable?11. Despite the worldwide concerns about terrorists and their attacks against civilians in dozens of countries worldwide, the apparent goal of the film is for the viewer to better understand why a terrorist would blow up buildings, murder innocent civilians and take down a government (?????)No, I'm sorry, this film was one long agenda-spouting travesty from start to finish.  I really expected more from the ""Matrix"" team.  I can't even get into production design, acting, cinematography and the rest because I couldn't get past the relentless - and I do mean RELENTLESS - agenda.  So, if you want to see aggressively anti-Christian, anti-American, ham-handed pro-gay propaganda that talks down to you as if you were a three-year old, this is for you.Otherwise - avoid."	1.0	A is for Agenda	2007-02-07	403	259	144

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ	"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool"""	"""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amuck in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers.  This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.  While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through.  Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.  The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel.  The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film.  ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered.  Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film?  To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly.  The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended.  Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.  The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character.  ""V"", with this film, became iconic.  Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded ""V"".  The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak.  ""V"" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control.  Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character - and then there was Portman.  While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.  Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding.  These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.""V for Vendetta"" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals.  It is a thinking film.  It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments.  It will keep your mind occupied for hours.  McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting.  As mentioned before, what makes ""V for Vendetta"" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film - it moved it in a different direction.  Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought - but it isn't a complete masterpiece.  I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today - the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time.  Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.Grade: *** out of *****"	3.0	Chapter 11: Valhalla	2009-05-31	1	0	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't.This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.I like this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema. That would truly be a tragedy, all around.	4.0	Took me by surprise	2007-08-10	3	1	2

The idea of rebelling against an oppressive government isn't new, but the way that ""V,"" the main character, does it, is stylish and entertaining. Hugo Weaving brings more emotion to a masked character since Darth Vader in the origional Star Wars movies. A tilt of the head or a silent stare are worth a thousand words the way Weaving does it. Natalie Portman does an okay job, but that is all that's required of her. She does have spots of brilliance in the film, though."	5.0	The Matrix Brothers Make a Movie of Great Substance	2006-07-15	14	7	7
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3FVIFL4HGI5CL	Alexiel	"""V For Vendetta"" was originally a graphic novel illustrated by David Lloyd and written by Alan Moore, who became famous from the great ""Watchmen"" series and may be known to movie goers for ""From Hell,"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" neither of which were the best-executed or successful of film adaptations.""V For Vendetta"" gets it right this time, for sure. I don't like it as much as ""Sin City,"" but I also don't think it's fair to make that comparison seriously - the two works/movies succeed on different levels and have different objectives.Also, I can say right off the bat, this movie is not going to please all fans of ""V."" The look is somewhat different and some of the character traits and subplots are gone. But in my opinion, it doesn't hurt it. But there will be acrimonious debate. Oh yes, there will be.Like most comic book/graphic novels and their accompanying movies, ""V"" brings a wonderfully epic feeling by interspersing larger-than-life goals, scenarios, and characters with the more intimate, personal, and emotional aspect of human life. Instead of ""wonderfully epic"" some critics might suggest ""overblown melodrama."" I do not agree, but to each their own.The United Kingdom of the ""future"" (no surprise or problem this was different) is under the control of a dystopian, Orwellian government. It is a world sorely in need of a hero. On Guy Fawkes Day, such a hero arrives. A masked freedom fighter (or ""terrorist,"" whichever you choose) blows up Parliament in an act of rebellion. But there is more to it than that, something that has deep ties to the corrupt totalitarian government, how they achieved power, and the dark history of those involved. Something that demands vengeance. Along the way V saves Evey, the requisite Mysterious Beautiful Girl with the Mysterious Past. However, ""V For Vendetta"" was written before these things became such tired conventions, so I'm forgiving in this instance, and furthermore it still works to this day when handled correctly, as it does here. But this is all the plot I want to give, the rest should come as a surprise to those of you who have not read the original work. Needless to say the stakes rise faster than maybe even the irrepressible and Byronic V can keep up with, and Evey will have a lot to find out about the both of them. That should be enough to entice the casual review reader.The acting is very good. Hugo Weaving plays a not-unfamiliar comic book/anime type hero that could be easily and unintentionally hammed up. He does not. I am actually not a big fan of his at all, but I have to give the man his due - he shows us what a fan of the graphic novel series expects to be shown, in most of the important facets.Some people have expressed discontent because Natalie Portman is ""too high profile"" or ""not British"" or because they just plain don't like her. As with Weaving, I wasn't really a fan coming into this movie. Roles like Evey's are pretty meaty and easy to look good in. However, Portman did more than I expected with the role, which is saying something because I was expecting a lot and ready to write a snarky little review trashing her performance. Instead, I have to eat my words of a few days ago - ""I think there were better choices for Evey."" Whoops. Looking at the job she did, I'm dubious now. Even as a Portman detractor, I have to say, she's forging an interesting body of work that may soon begin to silence her critics.I like Stephen Rea in virtually everything I see him in and this is no exception. The man is one of the most talented supporting actors of the day.The rest of the supporting cast was fine but of course these three jumped out at me.The cinematography was indeed flashy, as you'd expect. I refuse to draw comparisons to certain other movies, and while I'm not usually a fan of the all-out style of these other movies that have been relentlessly parodied, there are some very well-done and exciting scenes, with an eye toward a more leisurely (and interesting) pacing than you might expect from a movie such as this. As I said above, the look of Alan Moore's world is not well captured, and that's my biggest mark against the movie, but the filmmakers have their own style, and it is not a bad one.Lastly, I am surprised at some of the angst expressed that ""V For Vendetta"" promotes, justifies, and glorifies terrorism, particularly as viewed in a modern context. ""V For Vendetta"" was started back in 1981. Whatever broader themes or messages people may think the movie touches on in lieu of the media firestorm over Middle Eastern terrorism and scorn heaped on movies like ""Valley of the Wolves,"" I rather think the vast majority of them are brought to the table by the viewer's interpretation or bias, not by the filmmakers.In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone reading these reviews and fans of graphic novels and comics. It's a great ride."	5.0	One of the most successful graphic-novel-to-movie triumphs, in my opinion.	2006-03-14	53	41	12

Love one another, for we are all children of the earth and beloved by Gaya.United we can achieve anything.  We can live eternally in happiness and never look back.Love can make it happen.No longer will we fight over Hollywood fluff like V for Vendetta.  The movies we make will have complex, interesting stories and well-drawn characters, as opposed to the stereotypes we see in this tired plotline more stolen from than influenced by 1984.  Our movies will be fun and exciting crowd-pleasers, not preachy soap boxes meant to enrage their viewers.  And we'll understand that while peace in society is good, it makes for very boring cinema, therefore our characters will face several inner and outer conflicts as they pursue their noble goals.  That's not how it is in V for Vendetta.  Will our characters achieve their goals?  You have to see our movies to find out!V for Vendetta is not a good movie.  If you agree with everything it says, it's still not a good movie.  It's poorly directed and even more poorly written.  Natalie Portman is not a good actress.  The only thing she was good in was The Professional.  Not Star Wars, not Where the Heart Is, and not V for Vendetta.Our movies won't be like that.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	"I was fortunate in that I brought no expectations to this film.  I didn't know it was from the ""Matrix"" crowd, a film I very much enjoyed.  If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our ""everyman"" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.""  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did."	5.0	Brave, Challenging, Smart	2008-03-02	4	1	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AJKPCS5A163QN	Allen I. Branson	"The fact is that no matter what you might think of this adaptation of the graphic novel or the methods used by V to achieve his ends, what it tells us about ourselves and where we are currently heading makes it an absolutely worthwhile movie to watch.The film takes place in a dystopian future that is very nearly the present for much of what is still known as the ""free world."" Wars and disease had shocked people into submission (see Naomi Klien'sThe Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalismfor more on that) and a power hungry dictator filled the gap in their minds with mock security and peace. It doesn't deal with the fall into totalitarianism itself, but then we've had ample opportunity to watch that happen across Europe already with the spread of fascism in the 20th century as brilliantly detailed inPolitical Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes).As V puts it in the film:""Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.""That dystopian future is our immediate future. WATCH THIS MOVIE.

I'm guessing that you guys and gals are either ultra sensitive, ultra patriotic or have a hand in using ideals to gain power (of any sort.) The rest of you might be correct- this might be a bad adaptation of the original (I didn't even know this was a novels adaptation.) On the stance that I wasn't aware that this was an adaptation or have any idea how the original version was fashioned I must say that this is of the best films- could count them in one hand that I have ever seen. Those who have been exposed to the novel might want to heed or keep the warning given by those that have seen it in mind. The rest of you should watch it and then decide- thats just my opinion though. Also, keep in mind that this is not an attack on the Bush regime (though in certain aspects it can be applied) if there is something that we in this country can bank on (no matter what tactics are used to discredit the truth or opinions that are seen as menacing- and I'm just speaking in general not regarding any political affiliation) thats our right to free speech.	5.0	I couldn't understand why anyone would give this a one or two but then	2008-01-03	5	2	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AE8LL9S715YTE	"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2"""	"If V is for Vendetta and T is for Terrorism, what would the questions be?  This is not a critic of the film per say, but instead a critic of the worldview behind the movie.  So many times we accept the ""signals"" that we receive from radio, tv, internet, and other popular media, so much so that we fail at times to consider the worldview behind the signals.  Hence this review is not about the movie itself, which I will say is a good movie just like it was based upon a good comic book graphic novel.  Instead, I wish to examine, in this review, the worldview presented--a worldview (or set of worldviews) that we might not consider when we just sit back, eat our popcorn, and watch the silver screen.Where does heroism (with worldviews) end and terrorism (with worldviews) begin?  Who's to say that the terrorists of 9-11 are wrong, but the heroism of V from the movie is correct?  When is blowing up buildings ""good"" and when is it ""bad"", who's to say, you or I?  That is a strong and complicate question one that we must face today in this post-9-11 world that we live in, especially those of us who live in the United States, a place where so many times we forget just how volatile the world is outside our pristine middle class to upper middle class neighborhoods.  Even the most prayerful of us probably felt an unrealistic tug upon our hearts minds and souls when we watched 9-11 those, about six, years ago.  Now, after the towers fell, we see images of the aftermath, wars and rumors of wars going throughout the middle east, politicians going toe to toe either complimenting the war effort or condemning the war effort, either way using ""political talk"" (which to even the most intellectual of us, still can't be figured out).  Where does vendetta end and terrorism begin?  That is a problematic point this movie is trying to make in the worldview this movie is presenting.  Would it not be true to say that, several hundred years ago, our Founding Fathers and the men they commanded were seen as heroes to most of the colonists while seen as dastardly villains to most of England?  One man's hero is another man's cold blooded killer, no matter what flag or religion is being viewed...at least that is what this movie's worldview tries to speak.Yet there is something more problematic besides the ambiguous moral this movie presents to the many theater goers who are enjoying this movie.  It seems to blame, and I would guess that to a point this would be true, that religion and political ideals are the root cause of totalitarianism.  I know that I have heard people speaking against me in the media and internet because I am a Christian, but more to the point, people blaming Christians and all other religions as the reason for problems in this world (at least religions that are not politically correct and haven't gone by the PC checklist of groups like the ACLU).  I say this as someone who says of himself as being a fundamentalist Christian, that is someone who treats the Bible as THE Word of God and that the Bible presents truthfully that Jesus IS the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  Many people, and I think that in some sense being shown in the worldview of V for Vendetta, seem to think that all fundamentalist Christians, of whom I consider myself one of, all want to abolish and destroy everything from homosexuality to abortion clinics.  Which is strange because I've never gone out to abuse anyone who was going into a clinic despite the fact that yes I do consider myself prolife.  Why would I consider myself prolife and applaud those who wickedly bomb clinics?  That just doesn't make sense, but the ultraliberals of the country seem to place me in the same ""room"" as those who commit such crimes.  Same goes for homosexuality.  I have many gay friends who know that I have a very intricately woven belief system based upon what I have read and continue to read in the Bible.  Yet those same ultraliberals out there seem to say that I am in the same ""room"" as those who attack homosexuals.  Strange, but true, at least when you listen to the ultraliberal elites.Am I saying the movie is Anti-Bush like some other reviewers seem to gain from my review of the worldview behind V for Vendetta, well answer is, who knows besides the minds of the writers and directors themselves.  They may have a slant toward opposing Bush, but alike anyone else seeing the movie, we dont see a dart board with Bush's face on it being used in the local pub as a game of chance (that being darts).  Still, I think that the worldview toward a humanistic utopian is a cliche, that is the worldview that I am gathering from integrating both the comic book graphic novel and the movie itself, pulling together the woven pattern of thoughts and counter-thoughts.  The movie and book seems to suggest that faith and government (at least a conservative form of government) leads to totalitarianism.  Whether you agree or disagree that is yours to hold unto.  I merely, an observer, wish to bring up some thoughts that the movie has awakened unto me.Still.  Let us say that we do outlaw faith and we do end free enterprise and other such evils, at least what is being pointed out as being evil by this movie and many writers and speakers like Sam Harris who wrote the Christianphobic book, End of Faith, and many writers and speakers like Clint Willis who wrote the antiCapitalistic book, The I Hate Corporate America Reader.  Then what?  That is the world the movie V for Vendetta seems to look toward as a utopia.  V for Vendetta, I believe, just as the comic book that spawned the movie, longs for what I would have to say, a true and pure humanistic world ... but who would make the rules of this world and who would be the ones who followed such rules?  Just because you brought about a vacuum doesn't mean that the vacuum won't get stained by the fact that humans are, as the Bible shows, basically evil due to the Fall.  Does nature not abhor a vacuum?  What would take the place?  I would not be surprised to see, in this ""utopian"" world that so many people long for roving bands out to lynch anyone who said they believed that Jesus was their Savior, just like they would lynch anyone who would say that free enterprise brings about true economic growth.  Do we not see the lynching already taking place in our school systems and in our universities and in our politik speaks? Yes we do.  Thus, in the end I would have to say the worldview of V for Vendetta spawns more questions than answers, and with each examination of such questions to answers, a greater sense of foreboding and danger arises."	2.0	V for Vendetta, T for Terrorism	2006-03-21	38	9	29

The movie is pretty good (and so that probably means the comic book is better, becuase books into movies always have less value) and it has a perfect, if your different they will come for you, but V is there to help you feel.  At the end the moview also helps one believe that sooner or later the people will stand up for themselves when the governement is losing their mind.  It fit in with the current climate when the movie was made (as this was when Bush was doing all these wild and clearly illegal things and no said **** about it...).  Then agin, if you think Obama is losing his mind then you could just switch him in for the character running the governement and you'll be set.  Politics aside, this movie envisions what it is like to stand up for what you believe it when the governement wants you to shut the **** up.  I personally trhink the whole movie is worth V's confrontation at end with the government's men in the tunnel.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AMIGVTZZIWS6I	Amazon Customer	There are times when it is difficult to watch this film.  In a post-September 11 world it is not easy to watch a film that makes a terrorist into a hero.  However, if all you see in V is a terrorist then I think you've missed the point of the film, because there is also a strong undercurrent of patriotism throughout.  V for Vendetta is set in a not-so-distant future that looks dusturbingly like a future that could easily be formed out of real-life current events.  In this future the government  has taken away basic civil liberties in the name of national security; government policies are based on fanatical religious doctine; and those who are different (gays and lesbians) are vilified and blamed for the ills of the world.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  This was also a well-cast film.  Hugo Weaving is simply great as V; and even though you never get to see his face, Weaving is able to convey real emotional strength.  Weaving is a very under-valued actor.  Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.  It says something about this film that when the final, horrific scene happens you find yourself cheered and excited.  This film is disturbing, but one of the finest of 2006.	5.0	A Disturbing, Yet Wonderful Film	2006-08-06	2	1	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2UHIQNHUD3XFR	Amazon Customer	It was interesting to see that they went back to the original 1984 movie and found the guy who played Winston Smith.  They used the same guy who railed against 'Big Brother' in the original 1984.  It's good to see that he's still able to bring power, fire, vigor and passion to this part as he did in 1984.  Everyone should watch this movie and realized that this is exactly what is happening today.  The media is controlled, stories are staged (the occupy Wall Street movement) and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.  Everyone needs to take a hard look at this movie as a modern version of 1984 and then watch/read 1984 with Animal farm.	5.0	This and 1984	2011-12-16	4	3	1

(no matter what Alan Moore says) The character of V is ambiguous, intriguing, and even scary. The Wachowski brothers did a good job with this one.I give the movie a 5 out of 5 stars, but I give the DVD special edition only 2 stars. The DVD package is sorely lacking. No commentary on the regular DVD edition. There was so much they could have added to this, deleted scenes, gag reels, concept art...the book From Script to Screen book plus the official website is better stocked with goodies than this DVD. But, this is just another in a long line of movies Warner Brothers is skimping on the extras on. The HD-DVD has a commentary, supposedly, but most people aren't going to have access to HD just yet.	5.0	One of the best of 2006	2007-01-03	9	3	6

So last Thursday, I sat down to watch it, not knowing what to expect and whether or not I would even like it.I watched it 2 more times in the follwing 3 days.This is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The not-too-subtle political statements are well said without being preachy. All the political angles have been covered ad nauseum. Suffice it to say, you will either love or hate it, depending on whether you are left or right of the center line.All the actors were excellent, but Hugo Weaving's V stole the show. Despite being behind a mask for the entire movie, his body language was so expressive that the audience can't help but be drawn in to root for this ""guy"". His V is at once angry, bitter, vengeful, but also righteous, decent, gentlemanly and above all... tender.Both Evey and V grow throughout the movie, each learning from the other that right and wrong is not so clear cut as they originally thought, eventually coming to the realization that they alone cannot make choices for anyone other than themselves.Like all good love stories, this one is heart-breaking. The moment near the end, when Evey and V finally share a tender moment, Hugo Weaving's touching performance conveys the depth of the longing that V has for Evey. The audience can actually feel V's momentary indulgence, considering abandoning his plans for vengeance in favor of a life that he never thought he would have. It was just brilliant.This is a must have for my collection."	5.0	Entertaining AND Thought Provoking	2006-08-15	12	6	6
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1AC2EBE707BX3	"Amazon Customer ""Ursapater"""	"While there's plenty of action in this movie, there's also a lot of deeper meaning. Questions that I think are very relevant, especially now.For instance the idea that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. For me it gives some insight into the current situation in the middle east. The 'terrorists' don't think of themselves that way, they actually do think of themselves as fighting for the freedom of their people [at least most of the rank and file]. Trying to shuck the yoke of oppression that's kept them in poverty for so long.[though I suspect that the people really oppressing them are their leaders; using various other targets as a scapegoat to divert suspicion from themselves the true oppressors]But the scene that most resonates with me is after Evie [SPOILER ALERT!] has her revelation. After V tortures her, making her believe that Creedy's fingermen had her. When she finally has her epiphany; arms out stretched, looking up into the glory of the thunderstorm. ""God is in the Rain"" [SPOILER OVER]The archetype of redemption struck right through me. The world changes as revelation pours over you. That moment comes I hope to all of us at one time or another, and the scene evokes it with shocking clarity.I strongly recommend this film."	5.0	God is in the rain...	2008-06-08	2	1	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUZYKPP1H0XNW	"Amazon Customer ""yello"""	"Okay,So I am hungering for some kind of semi-intelligent action, suspense film with some story line.  I have been watching V for Vendetta am aware of the comic book, have read the comic book ""The Watchmen"" by Alan Moore, even Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns. I love films as diverse as Shoalin Master Killer, Cinema Paradisio, Lawrence of Arabia, Master and Commander, A Man of all Seasons, and Spiderman 2.  So I go tonight to be entertained and am quite aware of the material ahead of time.  What happens? I LEAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE DISGUSTED as I am watching liberal lunatic Hollywood Preach at me with their totally screwed up value system very carefully bundled in what was suppose to be an suspense/action movie but REALLY is some kind of Bizaare Frothing at the Mouth Screamathon on the Bush Administration and anyone with conservative/traditional or even moderate Liberal Values. I can put up with the usual Hollywood Leftist Claptrap, but I think it was the Middle Interlude in which the movie slowed down enough for about 15 minutes to introduce me to someone completely useless and unrelated to the plotline whatsoever.  Who is this person?  WHy a HALO WEARING HOMOSEXUAL JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLSGIRL who grew up to become homosexual actresses that become imprisoned by their government and killed. (She was apparently born that way yet Science has yet to prove this piece of ""PROPOGANDA""..of course its the EVVVULLL Government who is in charge of Propoganda in this film...NOT THE FILMAKERS..they are the PURVEYOR OF TRUTH LOL....Why because they make MOVIES what a noble and intelligent endeavor..they are wise beyond their years.)  THis IRRELEVANT BACKSTORY CAME of course AFTER the EVVVVULLLLLLL CHRISTIAN PRIESTS who were in on a conspiracy to murder people and were breaking their vows of celibacy with Prostitutes.  Or PERHAPS it irked me when YET another previous character GOOD character ALSO happened to be gay? (Apparently most of the world is homosexual..not the 1 to 2% the statistics tell us) Question Hollywood: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A BAD EVULLLLL HOMOSEXUAL IN A HOLLYWOOD FILM OR DO THEY ALL FIGHT FOR GOOD AND JUSTICE AND THE OPPRESED?  I had a very good snicker where this enterprising homosexual had an old version of the KORAN...that had been ""Banished"" by the current facist government in which he was hiding in his private ""ART"" collection. He quote, ""Loves its poetry""..what a patronizing view of religion.  I wonder if that homosexual knows that the ""KORAN"" expressly forbids his behavior and that his obsession with sexual identity (And the Filmmakers) is incompatiable with Islamic doctrine.So I ask myself this Question...Why is every movie I am going to nowadays filled with the following1. POLITICS2. HOMOSEXUAL PROPOGANDAI am a super movie buff but am now done with Hollywood for a good long while after this season.  Frothy-homosexual-terrorist sympathizing crazed MOONBATS  I liked the Matrix even their subpar sequels but the Brother's W and Joel Silver need an injection of Reality.I do hope though that ""V"" himself comes to take on Hollywood soon and make his OWN rebellious films...you know the ones that make smart entertainment and leave out the relentless politics. It would be shocking to see a film actually entertain use and even SHOCK OF SHOCKS ESPOUSE SOME KIND OF MORAL VALUE SYSTEM...THAT would be BEYOND refreshing.  Who knows maybe hollywood's version of ""V"" is Mel Gibson....GO MEL!ONWARD TO APOCOLYPTO!Ohhh by the way the stuff I was harping about?...NOT IN THE COMIC BOOK.  Hollywood thought they could tell the story better their way.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A6F61DLQJEURB	Andrea Bowhill	This film for me was Sheer Entertainment and needs to be watched at least once, if not more than once a political thriller with all the elements.This Film is based on the Graphic novel V for Vendetta, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd. The Novel has a comic adult sophistication with an amazing piece of full literature. But I will say if you've read the novel before watching this film get the book out of your head.V for Vendetta is set in London, Britain in the near-future has been through a nuclear war, an extreme fascist party has arisen called Norefire. This New Fascist Government in the year 2020 holds England in an Iron grip through fear and Propaganda. V who projects himself as Guy Fawkes in this film (Guy Fawkes goes down in English History as a revolutionary who plotted to blow up Parliament with gunpowder in 1605) In this film V is shown in different ways a terrorist to some, a freedom fighter to others, an Anarchist, a Monster, who has ideals. V had been imprisoned, tortured extreme, physical and mentally abused, after surviving he thinks he can bring about great ideas and change in society but on the other hand he has a vengeful vendetta to get back at what society has done to him, a very dark and complex character. V uses his thread of elaborate, theatrical, violence to bring down the government. Will he succeed?Well done to James Mcteigue who used lighting and angles to give the V mask layers of emotion.  Many serious issues weave through this film that makes you watch this wide eyed, and then out of the blue it lightens and pulls you into its comical/ironic side, it grabs attention, although this is based on a fictional world, fascism portrayed in this film is not far off the mark.

It's like a great piece of art; you never get tired of it. Natalie Portman's acting is like a fine wine; it's nuanced, it's perfection. I watch her scenes over so I can savor her performance.  V has a mask, yet he commands the screen better than any of the overpaid actors of today.  The cinematography was incredible, such mastery.  It wasn't the story so much as to how it was told.  I gave my last copy of this movie to my daughter and I miss it.  I ordered it from Amazon so I could watch it again (and thus, the review).  There are wonderful little threads that run through the movie: music, &#34;the Count of Monte Cristo&#34;, tV loves to twirl his knives before he throws them, Shakespeare, &#34;no coincidences&#34;, etc.  Did I say Natalie Portman was great.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"At long last, Alan Moore's tale of a post-nuclear England, a fascist government and the lone terrorist/freedom fighter who stood up to it comes to the screen.  It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it.V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.  Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real-life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.  While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly.Set in London, England in the near future, it turns out things have gone very wrong in the world.  Due to the military advances of the United States, the world has suffered through a terrible nuclear war.  England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.  For years, there was chaos and panic due to the lack of resources, and things didn't calm down until a new political party was able to come to power.  Led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the party promised peace and tranquility.  Unfortunately, in return for peace, the citiznes of England gave up their rights.  Quarantine zones were set up, curfews were enacted, and non-whites, gays, and non-Christians (anyone different) was deemed dangerous, rounded up, and taken away.  Furthermore, free speech, which includes political activism and speaking out against the government, was outlawed.  A secret police force was also set up.One evening, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) left her home after curfew and was assaulted by the secret police.  They planned on raping her, but a masked vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) came to her rescue.  Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and black leather garments, V effortlessly took out the trio of cops using only knives and his knowledge of the martial arts.  It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman-type character in the sense that he can effectively use simple weapons, karate, and manipulation of his surroundings to take out his enemies, but he has a definite political agenda.  V is tired of the fascism and means to bring about a better type of goverment.  Using extensive knowledge of the government's inner workings, explosives, and computer hacking skills, V is able to blow up the Old Bailey as well as hack into the media networks.As the story progresses, we slowly learn V's motivations for why he is doing what he is doing, while Chief Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), a respected party member, begins an investigation of his own as to who V is and what his motives are.It is interesting that, in today's world when the term terrorist is synonymous with evil, a movie whose ""protagonist"" is a terrorist would even be made.  However, one has to keep in mind that one man's terrorist is the freedom fighter of someone else (George Washington was most likely seen as a terrorist in the eyes of the British).  Still, V's tactics are brutal, and he is definitely not a hero.  The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice.While there are a few things from the book that didn't make it into the film and there were a few story changes, the film more or less captures Moore's vision (though in the book, V explicitly states that he sought anarchy, while that isn't quite clear in the film).  The politics of this film may seem offensive to people at the extreme sides of the spectrum, but overall, it should intrigue most people.  And for the less politically-minded, it is also a great action film.  Verdict: go see V!"	5.0	While It Isn't Revolutionary, It Certainly Is Great	2006-03-25	10	5	5

At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen.

War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.Backed by an excellent supporting cast, ""V For Vendetta"" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make ""V For Vendetta"" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from ""Saturday Night Live"".

Let me tell you people, this movie fits that genre perfectly.Thought-provoking, intense, and confusing for the undereducated, this movie has its twists and turns, and if you're one of those paranoid people that's afraid the government is watching you, this is the movie for you. Originally Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel before this movie even came out, but he doesn't like the notorious hollywood all too well to have his name listed as the writer.The two main characters share an interesting relationship, and government is in more of a national socialist form in this movie, yet it also constitutes stereotypes and ethnic hate, something...hmm... some governments do today! This movie will make you realize there are people out there that will rise up against the masses for what they believe is right and wrong, and let me tell you folks, the power that one vigilante can do to influence a whole nation, he opened their eyes to the corruption and immorality their government held with it.It also makes us realize that the word 'terrorist' is thrown around excessively, if someone earns this title by simply standing up for what they believe in, and let's just say anyone hearing that word labeled to someone is not only a stereotype, but it makes a default hate for anyone who hears it about this person.All in all, this movie makes me think of what could be, what is and what could have been of this world. And what creates the chaos and hate of this world. Watch it, it's an awesome movie.	5.0	My favorite movie.	2010-08-12	1	1	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A38N4MOCLSOKOH	Armando A. Gomez	"There has been much discussion about the movie ""V for Vendetta"". Many have praised the movie while others condemned it. The consensus for those who oppose this film state that the movie promotes terrorism. On the other hand those who approve of it considered it opposing terrorism. Are either wrong or are they both right? Here's where I come in as a tie breaker. Inconvenient to the conservatives' vision is the very inception of our nation's history. For the early American Colonists to break free from the tyranny of King George, they were forced to fight back. That meant striking back, confronting the Red Coats and burning English ships. In other words, shooting British soldiers and blowing up property, thus ushering the American Revolution War.Many were killed, both Americans and British. Yet, the staunch conservatives of this nation applaud our robust history, giving birth to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And yet these same conservatives are the first to oppose any form of dissent, quick to curtail our civil liberties. At the same time, beginning of our nation's history, America had had a public policy in opposing any or all despotic governments up to the present, case in point: Saddam's Iraq. To further my point, we need only to go generations' back to World War Two. The ""Axis of Evil"": Germany, Japan, and Italy posed a dire threat to the national security of the United States and Western Europe. In short, we ""bombed"" our enemies into submission--especially Japan. Millions were killed because of our actions. When opposing those who threaten our national security we Americans aren't too shy about the tactics we choose to defend ourselves. Iraq's ""Shock and Awe"" is one of many examples. Is the ""V"" character and his destruction of Parliament in the movie any different from the destruction we did in Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, or Hiroshima?These events have become shrines to American freedom. If so how can one fault a ""freedom fighter"" who strikes back at his oppressors who now occupies his country in a liked manner? In ""V for Vendetta"" the British government gone rogue, who slaughtered families and destroyed communities, casualties by the tens of thousands to serve its ends and then sets-up concentration camps to conduct secret and illegal experiments on the ""politically-incorrect."" Is that why we resorted to unimaginable violence in order to stop the Nazis and the ""Tojos"" and found it acceptable, even praiseworthy? Why we praise the curtailing of our civil rights, ""pre-emptive strikes"" and ""extraordinary rendition?""  For V, violence of destruction wasn't the convenient solution but the only one left for him to stop the fascist and murdering dictatorship that had high jacked his country. For those conservatives who claim to oppose the ""terrorism"" of V they're the first--especially after 9/11--to go V for Vendetta."	5.0	"They are the first to go for ""V"" for Vendetta"	2007-06-15	11	6	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A959GDE92F7DO	Arthur Wise	"This modern day classic speaks very clearly and powerfully to the advent of fascism in the western world and manages to be very entertaining to boot! 'V' is all about how a psychopathic regime has taken over in England's near future and how the main characters, those who aren't ""in control"", have all been personally affected and/or deeply wounded, or even killed outright by this regime.The Guy Fawkes-inspired hero/anti-hero, V; one part Zorro, one part Batman, and one part George Galloway(-; has himself been a victim of the pathocratic government. Since choosing to transmute the pain caused by his oppressors, he makes it his mission to bring awareness of an alternative to totalitarian governance to the public.Along the way, V meets Evey, a young woman with a history of her own. In one of the most potent and emotionally stirring scenes of any movie I think I have seen in a long while, V compels Evey to face her own fear and victimization by the regime. 'V for Vendetta' is therefore just as much a story about Evey's re-birth as it is about V's Vendetta and how he carries it through.The film makes reference to world events that appear to be happening! This makes 'V for Vendetta' a very relevant and timely film. It was interesting to notice that the mainstream reviewers who spoke negatively about the movie at the time of it's release sounded so much like the pundit who is the government's propaganda mouthpiece in the movie!Anyway, 'V for Vendetta' should be put up there on a list with other great films of a political nature: 1984, 'Z' by Costas Gravas, The Manchurian Candidate, and The Parallax View, to name a few. It is an excellent and informative movie that, like those just mentioned, will be remembered."	5.0	Remember, Remember 'V for Vendetta'	2007-11-04	6	4	2

I totally identified with V, in the sense that he fought for what he believed to the very death, like everyone else should. I almost shed a tear inspired!!! But enough of my ramblings, the entire atmosphere reminded me of Citizen Kane and THX1138. Dialogues and overall were top notch, I liked specially the introduction from V to Evey. Effects were at the top but not too crowded as to make it Matrixesque, specially in the ending. I definetaly recommend it!! My first reaction when I got of the movie theather was to go and blow up something!	5.0	It was a long time since Ive seen a movie like this one	2006-04-22	9	6	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A19VMQDCB4HZ9P	"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen"""	Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.	5.0	Powerful, subversive and thoughtful adaptation of Moore's classic tale	2007-11-07	2	0	2

After days of suffering and major sacrifices, she starts to see behind the illusion.The proposed path is interesting because it has nothing to do with the usual ""elightenment recipes"" like pyschedelic drugs, immediate mystical experience, blind faith or hermir-like excapes.Just one quote about Evey's experience : V to Evey : ""You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still.""Meanwhile V works on a broader plan : helping the whole population to get rid of a fascist control.Here again, the interesting thing is that the solution has nothing to do with the usual revolutionary ""modus operandi"" : no violence, no new regime as cynical as the previous regime, no brainwashing of the masses, no civil war.Well, I won't give you all the details so if you want to know them you'll have to watch the movie and I really think that in thoses growing fascist time it's really worth it !"	5.0	A political tale - Path to freedom	2007-11-26	8	5	3

I'm glad I finally saw it.I didn't catch exactly when this story takes place, but I recall the date 2035 being mentioned, so it was at least that far in the future. Much of the world is in chaos, but England is under the iron control of a theocracy. An unlikely hero emerges who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a black cape, and all black clothes.He calls himself V (Hugo Weaving), and we know of him primarily through the eyes of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes involved with him in an unusual way.Everything about this story is unusual, although there are clearly elements reminiscent of other stories, both movies and books. The flavor of 1984 is in it, as well as The Count of Monte Christo, Phantom of the Opera, The Wall, and Zorro at least; you may well discover others. It was a graphic novel (i.e., comic book) before it became a movie.I can tell you almost nothing about it without spoiling some of the best surprises. I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more. If it helps to understand what I'm talking about, let me just say that you may want to play it often enough to grab some of the best quotes.

It's well-acted, with a particularly good performance from Stephen Rea, who plays a cop investigating the ""terrorist"" V.  I'm not going to rehash the plot.  I merely want to urge people to watch it for its entertainment value, and even its emphasis on democracy and freedom (even if this element was changed drastically in the story's movie adaption), and ignore those who claim that it glorifies terrorism.  It does not.  The government that V fights is a fascist dictatorship, one which Americans would be compelled to fight themselves if we are to believe in the principles established in the Declaration of Independence.  He seems to take care in limiting his destruction to the regime that has taken power and, as you'll see in watching it, made him what he is (it is, afterall, a comic book movie).

Small	Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo!	5.0	Ouitstanding Movie	2006-11-18	13	3	10
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ASZH1B3Z39Z5Q	"Bennie ""Bennie"""	"This movie was bad on too many levels. I'll try to briefly highlight them below:1. Sound Quality. It was not an error of the movie itself, but rather, you can hardly hear the ""V"" character talking at many points in the movie. He talks so quickly and at such a low tone, you can barely hear what's going on. His personality is corny.2. Story line. The story line was confusing and even contradictory at times. For example, one man is gay, yet he cherishes a copy of the Koran in his secret chamber. Do people not realize the Koran condemns homosexuality? Why would a homosexual ever value the Koran? It makes no sense.Plus, this movie gets overly dramatic at points when it is not necessary, and the plot drags and gets off track too many times. It tries to be dramatic and make you relate with the character's problems, but totally falls short at doing this.3. Forces the gay agenda down your throat. I didn't see anything in the reviews that this movie would be basically pushing the gay agenda down my throat, but of course it did that too. Why? I have no idea, as it seemed like someone just threw that part in the movie at the last minute to get your sympathy and the support of the gay crowd. It failed at both counts.4. Not family friendly. I wouldn't dare watch a movie like this with children. It is definitely not a ""superhero"" type movie, like the trailer painted it. This is NOT like Batman or Spiderman. Families beware.5. Encourages government rebellion. I'm no fan of the government, and personally think our current government is wicked. However, this movie should not really be encouraging violence and anarchy against the government. It does just that unfortunately.Overall this was a huge waste of time and money. It was the worst few dollars I've ever spent in my life, and I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back."	1.0	Falls Short on So Many Levels	2013-10-15	14	4	10

I appreciate the triumph of the human spirit depicted by thousands of individuals and families turning out spontaneously to oppose their oppressors, and agree with the assertion that we are truly free when we are willing to die rather than surrender our liberty. However, the movie could have made these points without the gratuitous portrayal of the ""conservative and religious"" leader who hates homosexuals as much as he loves power. All the while, the supposedly religious bad guy blames other ""religious fanatics"" for the nation's troubles while banning the Koran and free speech. The point was made very well before the heavy-handed anti-religious viewpoint was revealed time after time in the last half.

Gregory	"*I'm sure you can read the basic story line from the product description so I won't rehash the specific events of the movie for you again.*I was quite disappointed to read one of the editorial reviews describing this movie as ""stylish but empty"".  I found this movie to be one of the most thought provoking and emotionally appealing movies made in the last decade. The connections between the characters (Evy, V, Valarie-the girl in the cell next door) are complex and at times heartbreaking.  The movie has an underlying political message that is very relevant today- not just another county's future where the movie is set.  We must be wary of blind faith in our political leaders; fear should not allow us to give away our personal freedom and rights as human beings.  We are not just a number(5 i.e. V) or a sexual preference, creed, etc., we are human beings and we all have our own story to tell.  This is a movie not only about the transformation of a government because of terrorism but how it can change people.  If you are reading this and trying to decide whether or not see this movie I would highly recommend it (although I have not read the graphic novel which I'm sure is better-all books are better than their movie counterparts).

I don't care about the overt politics of the Wachowski brothers, I just love their movie! Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the oddball, dream-pair of revolutionaries Evey and V, w/ a neo-fascist regime to clobber. Said regime is lead by a Big Brother-ish figure (John Hurt) who uses all media outlets as tools for mass distribution of propoganda (aka: news) in order to control, contain, and deceive the populous. If that's not enough, he also has his military, as well as his gestapo-like secret police force. Unfortunately for him, he has totally mis-judged and severely underestimated the human spirit and its hunger for freedom. V exploits / utilizes this catostrophic oversight to bring his master plan into being. Does V use violent means? Yes. Does he have a personal score to settle? Definitely. However, V's targets are each responsible for thousands of torturous deaths, and would certainly cause thousands more. V's vendetta will knock these deadly, dictatorial idiots out of the way, so that the people can take back their country and their government. Wonderful stuff!

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own ""good"" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!)Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to ""protect"" its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C).

I even ( in my estimation) see  the sequence of the Natalie Portman character's ordeal of arrest, stripping of identity, torture, until the jailor tells her she's free (after she reaches the point of not fearing death), as a sort of spiritual? shamanistic iniation to liberation from the world.	5.0	wow....what a movie	2006-08-04	5	1	4

This film, however, preaches the merits of healthy skepticism; and we can be excused if we apply the lesson. In this spirit, then, we face the fact that in an Orwellian state of crushing powers a subversive, V, apparently working  alone, accomplishes remarkable things and has enough spare time not only to maintain his considerable martial arts skills but also to dress up his successes with fireworks displays.

Part Pimpernel, part 1984 and playing more French than English, V for V is likable enough but I wonder who exactly it's made for. It's a little talky for kids and tad lame for adults. Some curiously pointed comparisons with 9/11 can keep up the interest.Set design was obviously a big factor but the FX were a bit cheesy. Performances were uniformly fine and the direction even better. If they had made something more serious, I might not have bothered to see it but they (everyone involved) are capable of making something of a serious or maybe even comic nature that could be very good. The best thing I can say for V is that it won't put you to sleep and it was the best thing to come out this week.	4.0	IV	2006-08-02	1	1	0

When government is no longer by the people and only represents a fraction of the people then that government has lost its right to exist. A dictatorship by any other name is still a dictatorship. The logical consequence is revolution. Like they say, freedom isn't free. One idea this film implies is that the actively violent revolutionary is but the face, hands and voice of the silent majority.

V for Vendetta is a very powerful film.  Without losing an inescapable sense of reality, the creators of the Matrix have managed to bring to the screen a futuristic world that leaves audiences thinking.As a summary, V for Vendetta tells the story of pretty Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman trying to stay inconspicuous in the frightening London of the future.  However, during a late-night, dark-alley attack, she is saved by V, a masked terrorist that, for some reason, intrigues her.  When V blows up ""The Bailey"", a building in the heart of London, later that night, the government's police forces suspect Evey to have been privy to the plot.  Later, V holds the most-watched and government-sanctioned television network (called BTC) hostage and addresses the nation.  He asks England's citizens to rally against their corrupt government on the next November the 5th.  During the months preceding November the 5th, Evey becomes enmeshed in V's plans and the conspiracies and corruption of the government.  As the film progresses, the audience becomes increasingly aware of V's dark past and the secret that has brought the government to power and which it will kill to keep.I am sure that other reviewers will say that this movie sanctions terrorism.  V for Vendetta, however, is a powerful film simply because it makes the audience think about terrorism and our world on a completely different level.  The scary part about this movie is that V and Evey's world does not seem so detached from our own.  It has a certain and eerie that-could-actually-happen quality.This is one of the first movies that I have seen in a long time that made me reflect so much on real-world issues.

However, in the movie the totalitarian regime is run by Christian Fundamentalists reminiscent of Hitler with a double cross as its symbol.  The secret police carry badges bearing the double cross symbol and rapes innocent women staying out past curfew.  A key good guy is a gay TV show host who keeps an Arabic version of the Koran becaus he likes to read it as poetry (in Arabic?!!).  This movie will insult your intelligence if you take it seriously.  It reminded me of ""Sum of All Fears,"" where wealthy old neo-nazis, not Islamic Fundamentalistics, exploded a nuclear bomb in the U.S.  The heavy-handed political correctness in the movie just ruins the credibility of the plot.  The theme of people willing to give up personal liberty for safety is worth thoughful consideration and is reflective of the choices we need to make today to counter terrorism.  However, in the movie the need for safety was created by fake acts of terrorism engendered by the Christian Funadmentalist government to secure more power, not by external terrorists.  I commend the producers for their courage in bashing Christian Fundamentalists, without any fear of repercussions as depicted in the movie.Apart from the laughably strained political correctness, the movie had excellent cinematography, good acting, but little action.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ABO241PRMZ2KZ	Bradley Kerby	"When I first saw this movie, I was blown away by its disregard for social mores. It completely goes outside the standard Hollywood fare by taking on a real issue in contemporary society, while not working to ""dumb-it-down"" for the average movie-goer who is not interested in thinking.The United States is no more. It is in ruins and subject to civil wars and rampant disease. Does this sound familiar? It should, the United States in the future is Iraq. The ""American"" wars have devastated the world and withered away the nation's resources, while garnering the world's disdain and hate. The movie takes place in the near future in Great Britain. Britain is no longer a democracy, but instead it is ruled by fear and rampant misuse of power and resources. A secretive despot (called ""Chancellor"") sits at the head of the nation. His location is just given as ""underground,"" and he always speaks to his sycophants and the nation from this secure location. The Chancellor hates anything/anyone that gives him a tough time or might challenge is unyielding authority. He uses unfounded fear and Christian morals to maintain his authority. There's even a color-coded curfew system, which everyone is required to follow or suffer dire consequences. Does the Chancellor sound familiar? Again, he should, he is George W. Bush. The mouth of the Party--as they are called--is a government controlled 24 hour television station monopoly, called British Television Network (BTN), which ""spins"" the news to benefit the government. It is embodied in a building called Jordan Tower, which to me represented, perhaps, the Pentagon or NSA, where Fox News had relocated. It is complete with Christian inferences. Ironically, one BTN host states during his program, ""I'm a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm goddamned proud of it!"" During one part of the movie, a BTN producer of a news program, states, it's their job to report the news, and it is the job of the government to create the lies. Although, this movie is based on a comic series from the 1980s, it has striking parallels to modern issues and events through various allusions we can infer.""V"" is the ultimate voice of reason. He was a victim of a covert government research project, which left him scarred--mentally and physically--for life, hence his vendetta against those who have wronged him. He is forced underground into a world where he is surrounded by the facts and reminders of the past. He completely understands the issues of life in England. His goal is to liberate all the people of England from the oppression they have so meekly given their Chancellor. He uses various methods to destroy the government from the inside by preying on a top Party official's paranoia, while then giving the people a tactile vision of what freedom and popular sentiment really means, by succeeding where Guy Fawkes failed on November 5, 1605. Yes, he blows up Parliament; thereby, symbolizing a striking defeat to tyranny and a new beginning for the masses of England toward democracy and self-determination.In the end, ""government by the people"" is restored. ""V"" is deemed the patriot within all of us. Perhaps, ""V"" is the patriot in us as Americans. He envisioned a world without hate, a world returned to common sense, to rule by the people, from the hands of a dysfunctional, paranoid oligarchy.You may infer your own meaning, of course. But, of course, perhaps, we mustn't forget the 4th of July...the plot, the vision."	5.0	Excellent movie for those who like a challenge	2006-08-18	11	5	6
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AOF6EVPQSWZK3	Brad M. Keeler	"The brilliant Hugo Weaving excels and Natalie Portman redeems herself (Princess Amidala, anyone?) in this all-too-relevant film.  This film deals with many of the issues relevant to politics today and brilliantly skewers many characters who will seem very familiar from current events - politicians who exploit fear, blowhard talk-show hosts etc.  Set in England after the demise of the US as a superpower, the film deftly refers to current political events as background to the rise of totalitarianism and ethnic cleansing.  The central theme of the film is the trading of civil liberties for security, and the difficulty of undoing such a pact once it has been made.The film also tackles many ethical issues such as vengeance and torture with what may be for some people uncomfortable conclusions.Much has been written about Alan Moore (the original author) removing his name from the credits of the film, a decision which was based on the Wachowski Brothers (of Matrix fame) departing from the original text in their efforts to update it.  However, the Wachowski's have created a masterpiece that adheres to the spirit of the original book whilst holding up a mirror to contemporary politics.  Most importantly, the character of V (dandy, intellectual, mysterious) is largely untampered with.Unsurprisingly for a film that is based on a comic book/graphic novel, the main characters almost border on archetypes, and this lends an appropriately comic-book feel to the film, and in this respect although it has no animation it has some similarity to films like Sin City.The plot centers around the interaction of Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.  Carefully-placed reveals allows us insight into the events that (literally) moulded V's worldview and show his conversion of Evey from timid obedientarian to revolutionary.  Of particular note is Hugo Weavings ability to emote from behind a glossy, permanently-grinning mask.  The mask (and I am not going to give any spoilers here) is of a character called Guy Fawkes, a would-be revolutionary who long ago was foiled in his attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in England.Natalie Portman gives a convincing portrayal of the personal journey that Evey is persuaded to undertake, and John Hurt excels as the megalomaniacal Chancellor Sutler.  All similarities between Hurt's Sutler and Adolf Hitler are of course completely intentional, as are the ruling party's insignia and oppressive behaviour both of which have definite Third Reich similarities.  Hurt's performance would seem over the top if it were not for the fact that we regularly see the same hate-spewing histrionics from political pundits and talking heads.  I would guess that Hurt modeled his performance on talk-show hosts every bit as much as the crack-pot dictators of the Second World War.  It is no accident that when Hurt addresses the public, or even his political allies in private, he does so over a giant TV monitor.To call the supporting cast excellent would be an understatement.  Of particular note is Rupert Graves' brilliant portrayal of Dominic, the 'Voice Of London', a twisted, hate-filled talking head whose concentration-camp crimes are rewarded by a cushy job spewing vitriol over the airwaves on the government-controlled TV channel, a man so in love with his own persona that he even rants along to recordings of his own shows whilst in the shower.  His diatribes are punctuated with catch-phrases such as ""I'm a God-fearing Englishman!"" and ""England Prevails!"".  Also notable is Stephen Rea's portrayal of the beaten-down Inspector Finch, a man who has risen in the ruling party despite his not-quite-ethnically-pure family background and whose disillusionment with the party enables him to play a defining role in the plans of V and Evey.Perhaps inevitably, despite providing the catalyst for societal change, V is ultimately consumed by his vengeance.This film is not afraid to take on issues that many vendors of popular culture would shy away from, and that inevitably will invite criticism.  However as the poet Hardy once said ""If way to the better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst"".  If you haven't already seen this film, get yourself a copy."	5.0	Classic graphic novel gets a contemporary politics makeover	2006-08-12	138	119	19

Martin ""the jokA"""	"I've been going through the reviews, whereas most of them are positive and sensible, some others make me wonder what the hell is wrong with mankind.  Don't get me wrong, I truly believe everyone is entitled to their opinions, but most negative remarks on this subject seem to preaching their own sputter as fact and not realizing the beauty of FICTION.Very few movies will I ever give 5 stars, but don't for a second think that means I'm not a movie fan.  I'm a movie FREAK.  I love everything about the industry and am even working towards being a part of it.  I (try to) write my own screenplays and, although biased in my opinion, I think I'm pretty decent at it.  This movie, to me, is the kind that I would gladly be a part of making any day.  From the original ideas that it was structured upon, to the visual effects - gritty and as dark as the environment they're placed in, to the actors and actresses chosen for the characters.  And, let me be VERY clear, I'm not a big fan of Portman in the least.  However, the more movies she does like this one the more and more I will come to appreciate her talent.Those of you looking for a review about this movie because you have yet to see it, here is my opinion and some background to the film (no terrible spoilers included):A harsh, dark reality is painted from the first few moments of this movie, that make you appreciate how our society is now and what you have.  And our society isn't all too wonderful in the here and now, but you will relate IMMEDIATELY to the characters within.  Although Evey Hammond doesn't match the attitude of the original comic character in this movie, she still portrays the type of person you'd expect to find in this society.  She's scared of the powerful regime running the country and she's trying to follow rules, but she still has just enough fight in her to make it obvious that she's one of the few who would understand V's plight.Now V, although sometimes cheesy and quite odd (not sure yet if his ""v""-words speech was well placed), is a perfect lovable and deeply interesting anti-hero.  He's a terrorist, make no mistake.  But his terror is aimed at a totalitarian government that would rather own its citizens than protect their freedoms.  How can you say the fight isn't a just one?  If you disagree with terrorism as a means to fight unjust powers, then you need to read Fahernheit 451 and Orwell's 1984; watch Logan's Run, and so many more.  Get over yourselves.  Terrorism is only wrong to the powers that it opposes.The story is woven perfectly, giving just enough background and plot at the right moments.  Right when you're asking questions in your mind about why something is the way it is, you're given the information from dialogue or imagery...but JUST enough without spilling too much too soon.  The middle section is definately slower than how the film starts, as some others have mentioned, but what did you expect?  If a movie stays in a constant climactic state, it would be useless.  QUALITY people, not QUANTITY.  I don't think people understand that anymore, especially Americans.  We (most of us, not all) want more, more, more and when we don't get it we complain.  If you got to eat your favorite food every day for months, do you honestly think it'd still be your favorite anymore?The power of this film is not in its action sequences, it's not in its dramatic struggle, it's not in its good acting - it's in its thought-provoking questions that it raises.  As bizarre as it is, the personal questions you will be asking yourself at the end are exactly why this movie will remain on the ""A List"" for a very long time.  Because those questions can never be answered until something horrible changes our lives forever.  ""What would I do in that situation?""  ""How could a government ever get that way?""  ""Why must terrorism be used to counter-act political giants?""  They can be debated, but untimately fall to nothing more than opinion.You'll read some negative reviews here with people saying, ""Don't see this movie because it exonerates terrorism.""  ""It's fascism rhetoric.""  ""The characters are two dimensional and unrelatable.""  The point of this movie is that people, as narrow-minded as they are, are still free enough to have those kind of opinions.  You'd think they'd appreciate the irony more.Personally, I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD so I can study it and learn how to craft my own beautiful and horrific stories..."	5.0	What is wrong with you people?	2006-05-15	17	11	6

I've watched it a few times, and every time I do I realize something else about it.First of all, I think it's a great idea of the future. Cuz who knows? Maybe that really is what we're heading for. And Evey(Natalie Portman)is totally awesome in this film. You've got to hand it to the girl for being able to be shaved and still look great.And V in himself is such an interesting and spell-binding character. Yet he's hilarious at the same time, so open and honest, well just funny.And the whole idea is just amazing, and beyond me. It's a horrible idea of a future, and V's going to make it better for anyone he can, the only way he knows. That's all I'm gonna say though.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2AT23ZPZTVO9W	Brian A. Hathaway	"The film V for Vendetta is a visually stunning film portrayal of a man bent on vengence against those who tormented him personally and who have oppressed his country.  It is not so much a film of ideas as it is of visual effect.  Like the film Sin City which also brought to life characters in a graphic novel, the visuals in this film are striking and are to a certain extent, a large part of the story.  To elaborate, the film lacks a set of clearly defined ideas beyond the vengence that V wishes to carry out.  For example, he blows up the Old Bailey at midnight, when there is very little chance of anyone being injured or killed.  He plans to blow up Parliment one year later, but his pre-announcement of the plan to the authorities ensures that the government will not be brought down, precisely the opposite of the character he emulates, Guy Fawkes.  This coupled with his personal vendetta against those who used him in medical experiments contributes to a dearth of ideas driving the story.  In real historical terms, the story is a closer parallel to the French Revolution than the American Revolution, where the French people extracted revenge against the nobility and had no plan for a government beyond the revenge.  The American Revolution was more a revolution in ideas regarding government and the right of the colonies to determine their own future.  The main insight to the ideas driving V's actions comes in the television broadcast he makes to the nation.So we must suspend our judgement here and concentrate on the visual impact, which is striking.  I picked up on two interesting cinematic parallels.  The first is the ""1984"" parallel, the movie in which John Hurt, who played the High Chancellor, played Winston Smith.  The logo for 1984 included a large V as the symbol for the Party of Big Brother.  In this movie V is the symbol of the rebellion.  In both films, government is sustained through lies and a focus on enemies, real and imagined.  The second cinematic parallel is ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  In both movies a masked antihero imprisons a young woman in order to capture her heart and mind, with a repressed love interest between the two protagonists.  The symbol of the antihero in both movies is a single red rose.  The visual impact of the movie recalls the ""film noir"" genre of the 1940's and 1950's, with shadowy lighting, rain, and heroes of questionable nobility.I thought the acting was well done.  Natalie Portman goes well beyond her wooden portrayals as Amidala in the Star Wars trilogy as a woman torn between her desire to avoid the violent end her parents met and the magnetic personality of V.  Hugo Weaving plays a masterful part as V, especially since wearing the mask prevents the use of his face in portraying the intensity of his emotion and the ideas driving his revenge.  Insightful dialogue provides the window to the man behind the mask.  The other actors flesh out the case with standouts being John Hurt as the High Chancellor and Stephen Rea as the detective trying to bring V to justice.In spite of the fact that this movie offers few profound ideas, it is great entertainment and kept me riveted to the screen from the beginning to the end.  My only wish is that the DVD offered more extras.  However, Hollywood has already come out with a Special Edition 2 disc set which I am sure will offer more features to the viewer.  For that reason, I only awarded four stars to this DVD."	4.0	V- a vicarious and visually stunning view of vengence	2006-08-07	5	4	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AWNKEM8DAG8PY	Brian Conway	Based on Alan Moore's classic graphic novel of the same name, V For Vendetta is a look into the dystopian, not-so-distant future of England. In the original comic, England is one of few countries that have survived a nuclear fall out only to be run by a power hungry, right-wing extremist group. The movie adaptation by the Wachowski brothers wisely changes the post-Cold War/nuclear fallout scenario into that of a post-9/11 world filled with paranoia a la 1984, conspiracy, biochemical warfare, terrorism, and propaganda on a scale not seen since Hitler; the result is eerie and unsettling, effective in that it portrays a reality that isn't all that far removed from our own. Through the eyes of the female protagonist Evey (Natalie Portman), we explore the morality (or amorality) of the terrorist acts of V (Hugo Weaving) and whether the ends of his goals really justify the means. The emotions of Evey and rationalizations of V are played masterfully in the hands of Portman and Weaving making Evey's physical and emotional torment very real and V's philosophical ravings balance delicately on the edge of insanity. While the acting all around is top notch, the real stand out performance of the movie (as it should be) is that of Hugo Weaving--we never once see V's face and yet rarely is a character so affecting as this masked hero. The production of the film seems to be one long line of great decisions, among them John McTeigue's decision not to turn V into a simple action movie. The action scenes are neatly trimmed for efficiency and emotional impact; they occur at just the right times and never become bloated or stale. Perhaps best of all is that the audience leaves the movie excitedly discussing the messages of the film more than anything else, something that ought to happen far more often.	4.0	V For Vendetta (4.5 stars)	2006-10-05	8	1	7

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AVT9Q9PTUCDMR	Brian Maitland	"I'm tired with this whole ""it's a graphic novel"" nonsense, when really a graphic novel is just a fancy way to say better done ""comic book."" V For Vendetta has lots of great Orwellian type themes, but it still comes across as far too simplistic and dumbed down for the masses.First of all, if you can get past the ridiculous mask and '60s mop top Peter Tork haircut of V (and why in the scene at the pub when this V guy first appears that not a single patron makes as wisecrack about the fop in the ridiculous mask is so beyond me it's mindboggling).The action is definitely good. The casting is brilliant. John Hurt (hey, 1984 and all) as the Orwellian leader of Britain was perfect as was the SCTV-like telescreen he talks through. The Stephens--Fry and Rea--were inspired. Again Britain seems bereft of actresses such that yet another American must play an English heroine (Natalie Portman, come on down).As far as the extras, all you get is a 15-minute ""Making Of"" which is good but spends a little too much time trying to tell us how there are parallels in this graphic novel to the post-911 world. Sorry, but I get tired of this Conspiracy 101 drivel being spewed by anyone, and the fact this movie had virtually no impact at all on people's consciousness proves that that was a stretch (unless you now count donutheads at Occupy Whatever City wearing V for Venti masks)It's good fun to watch as long as you leave your brain cells at the door."	3.0	flawed Orwellian comic book onscreen	2011-11-27	4	3	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AN8K6OR4NKI0V	Bruno	This film has been compared to the work of George Orwell..I really doubt that Mr Eric Blair would feel honoured by the comparison. In fact I believe he might be turning in his grave right now, that this juvenile, nasty trash might be promoted in his name.As a British viewer, this film really jarred with me. Ok, there are lots of explosions, lots of violence, lots of cool allusions to the war on terror, lots of smart references to fuddy duddy old white people and their prejudices and consequently lots of fuddy duddy old white people being brutally killed by our hero. Hey, we even have a dirty old catholic priest character asking if Natalie Portman in kneesocks and pigtails 'is too old', ignoring of course that 99% of the Catholic abuse victims have been boys.  But then we don't want to confuse our distinctions between the 100% evil subhuman paedophiles and the 100% good homosexuals do we? Life should be simple, like a comic book. Or, indeed, like an american Democratic outlook on the world.But the most obviously jarring element is the fact that the film is set in London, with a facist, right wing government, and yet the film is a crude portrayal I assume, of 'where Dubya is taking us'. It might be difficult for young American Democratic voters to comprehend, but the UK is being led into a nightmare Orwellian state not by a rightwing party, but by a leftwing party, until recently led by Tony Blair.  It was he who, together with Bush, led the invasion of Iraq. It is his government that has made it illegal to even criticise Islam or homosexuality, that is introducing ID cards, that has installed security cameras in nearly every street in the country and that has led to dumbed down, brutal, anamalistic society where half a million of the native populaton flee abroad nearly every year.But this wouldn't suprise George Orwell, who wrote Animal Farm AND 1984 based on his experience of and consequent disgust of the left's hypocricy, simple-mindedness and refusal to tolerate opposition or dissension.	1.0	Violent, vicious, vacuous, vapid, vain, vomit inducing	2008-01-06	133	84	49
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3T8G3FN3H3948	bryhil_04	What makes V for Vendetta so interesting is that it is a different film then you'd expect it to be! V(Hugo Weaving) rescues Evey at the start of the movie from a few punks & at that point, I was confused cause I wasn't sure if he was a bad guy or a good guy having knowing nothing about the movie before I watched it other then the fact that Natalie Portman was in it of course. then he rescues her after killing many cops in which was basically blood bath after she watches him blow up a building & the movie has taken a dramatic turn. She's now his prisoner & he plans to continue his attacks of revenge against the government. V is an extremely experienced killer while no one knows his real name & we never see his face. but all his points against the government are valid & though I don't agree with him killing everyone as the solution, its his motivation that make this movie so different & so much fun! Of Evey(Natalie) escapes from the killer & they don't exactly become enemies as he keeps trying to get her to be like him & since they are still friends, sorta anyway, something happens with the both of them & they fall in love! & the final question is, will this effect Evey's decision at the end of the movie? Guess you'll have to wait to see what I'm talking about. It's a truly entertaining piece of work! recommend this to anyone who's looking for something with alot of action & makes some sense!

That makes for thrilling action and wonderful set pieces.However, as political commentary, it's laughable. This movie can't decide whether it's anarchist, liberal, terrorist, or something in between (if that's possible.) It owes its anarchist tendencies to Alan Moore obviously, and its liberal sensibilities to the moment. But it cannot be both. It doesn't seem to be arguing for anything so much as rebellion against Orwellian tyrants, which isn't really that much of a bold political statement. ""We'd all love to see the plan...""Finally, the ending, with masses turned out in Guy Fawkes' masks to watch the destruction of the old order is unintentionally chilling, in that it seems to drive home the idea that we will be free in the future when we are all thinking and acting the same way, in the shape of radical terrorism. Frankly, that's the sort of thing we're fighting against, and isn't all that different from fascism. ""But then it will be a good fascism!"" isn't really what Orwell and Huxley and the rest of them were on about, is it?Sorry to point it out, but it's necessary to inject a little bit of reality into these male juvenile sadomasochist fantasies.

The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood these days. However, it does seem obvious that the movie is taking swipes at the Bush administration and its supporters, which is not exactly a brave or bold position in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.However, if you can suspend your beliefs as to what is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie."	4.0	Got to give it credit for taking chances	2006-08-10	7	3	4

This movie was a nice change from the Wachowski brothers, especially after the second and third matrix movies.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2X2DX4AQPF1G2	Casey Miles	When V for Vendetta is actually about vendetta, it's highly entertaining.  But too often it strays from that theme in favor of pushing its own political agenda and a lackluster love story between its protagonists.The problem with the first one is that this movie forces its politics on the audience the way the fictional government it villifies forces its own on its citizens.  If you're not a left-wing extremist, you're evil.  Don't try to tell me that's not what Hollywood is saying.What makes the love story lack luster is 1) Natalie Portman is a nightmare of an actress, and 2) V wears a mask and speaks in a detached, emotionless voice.  Director James McTeigue seems to want V to be both a dark, mysterious character and a warm, romantic one--two things that don't quite gel.Then there's the seemingly three hour running time.  I mean, come on.  Does any action movie (at least I think that's what this is supposed to be) really have to be more than ninety minutes?This one doesn't, but it is anyway.	1.0	Don't Be Fooled By the Title	2006-04-25	60	11	49

Well I was just disappointed with what they did here.  Why they had to change so many things from the original story is beyond me.  I mean, was it going to hurt that many feelings to show the oppresive left wing government that the original story was about?  Of course, so lets make it PC, show anything not far left as fanatical with untrue labels, and make it right wing bad!  That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood!  And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars!  So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.Natalie Portman is great but I just felt so sorry for so many of them in this film because the story was bastardized for political purposes.	1.0	Propoganda hack at its finest!	2007-03-07	69	38	31

It was playing at the dollar movies, but I don't like going there, people have crying babies and make so much noise they spoil it. When it came out on DVD I went to the DVD store a million times asking for it, but all the copies were checked out. Finally I saw it and it did live up to and exceeded my expectations. It was awesome.Natalie Portman was great (do you suppose that's where Britney got the idea to shave her head?), and Hugo Weaving really conveyed a lot of emotion, even though he wore a mask throughout the entire film. It was cool when he was listening to Getz/Gilberto The Girl From Ipanema while scrambling eggs for Natalie in his Bachelor Pad/Bunker.I heard that the author of the graphic novel upon which it was based disowned the project, but like Bladerunner, it might have been a different story than what the author had in mind, but was a compelling cinematic vision in its own right.This movie worked as an action thriller, with just the right dose of irony, and then on another level altogher, it was a thought provoking film about politics, freedom, and the lack thereof.	5.0	V for eVer.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5	C. F Higgins	"V for Vendetta is ostensibly an action movie with political overtones.  What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a ""hip"" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.The main character ""V"" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution.  Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings.  Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she ""believes"" in his political endeavors.  All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder.  It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes.  At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference.  In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal.  The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester.  Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film.  It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on ""Animal Farm.""  And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.So take a comic book and turn it in to a movie using the director that gave us the tower dung-heaps called ""Matrix II & III.""

They have this movie so multilayered, that half the movie, V is talking through the other characters and since the whole movie is one idea, it turns out to be possibly the most wholesome movie I've ever seen!

The story line was excellent, touching, moving, inspiring, etc etc etc.  So when I finally got around to getting a blu ray player I knew I would need to get this one (already had it as a regular DVD, but ya know how it is!)In blu ray this movie is amazing.  AMAZING.  The details you could see were fantastic, right down to the texture on V's coat.  I can't say enough about it.  Everything is crisp and sharp.  The domino scene!!!!!

First of all, it has a really good story to it, but also a moral story about standing up and believing in a cause to fight against oppression and tyranny and how their strength in numbers. Guy Fawkes was a real person and there really was a gunpowder plot. Unfortunately, he was caught and put the death, but if you look at history and what Benjamin Franklin done, he was printing papers in a fictitious name and sending them out to the colonies to spread the truth about what was really going on and what was going to take place even when they are writing the Constitution that was considered treason and if that would be as of today it would be considered terrorism.

First the goods: Great storyline and idea with intriguing mask and voice acting by Hugo Weaver. I have to say that I haven't seen an interesting movie and character like this for a good while. The movie really developed the V character as a violent terrorist fighting for a good cause with human flaws.The bad: A lot of graphic violence which I think was not necessary.  This is definitely an action movie made for people who enjoy watching violence. The movie also made me feel that it has a political agenda of promoting homosexuals. The movie does a good job making homosexuality look beautiful.Finally, it seems highly unlikely that a country that is advanced as England can become a facist country in the future. Once a civilization becomes socialist, it cannot go backwards. People are not stupid. So in this sense, the movie was too unrealistic.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2LZMR9AD7UYXR	Charlotte Hawkins	I had only seen this movie once before I decided to buy it on DVD. I love it, there is a somewhat brutality to the storyline, which I compare to Nazi Germany and 1984 although I expect that this was the intention, The fight scenes are highly clever, this definitely comes from its origins as a graphic novel, they are a bit like Kick-Ass in a way, only darker and of course this was first. The film questions what it is to be human - freedom to love, freedom to speak etc - and leaves you wondering what it is you value the most in this sense, what could you give up and what would you fight for. The fact that we never find out the identity of V is so important. The fact that at the end, all the characters that were supposedly gone, all showed up meant that we questioned what was real and what was all V's creation. A beautiful, well created film that everyone should watch at least once. I loved it.

The acting was excellent and there were no gratuitous sex scenes.  What a refreshing thing that is.The movie gave me hope that a hero type character (V) can awake people from their stupor to rebel against an oppressive, spying, greedy, power seeking government.

It's a very flashy movie with the explosions, action sequences, and incredible knife combat scenes, but it lacked the entire meaning of the graphic novels it was BASED UPON. I did quite like a few quotes (Trying not to spoil this): ""Artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up.""That one hit me hard, but otherwise, nothing groundbreaking.

Natalie Portman did a good job at being a scared girl turned revolutionary. This movie reminded me of George Orwell's masterpiece 1984. The citizens are not as afraid of the government in this movie, but there are definitely similarities. I was disappointed with the end, and not because it was a bad conclusion but because what I thought was going to happen didn't.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"""V For Vendetta"" did something I didn't think a contemporary Anti Establishment movie could do: it instilled compassion for a murderer and made me agree with acts of terrorism. In today's day and age, it's easy to see why that would be hard to accomplish, considering how inhumane most terrorism is. This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels. There are a couple of people to thank for this: first and foremost there are Alan Moore and David Lloyd for creating the original graphic novel; then there are the Wachowski Brothers for adapting the graphic novel into a screenplay; and then there's James McTeigue for his direction.Of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V. What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask). It's very much safe to assume that he's not quite normal, both mentally and physically; he seems invincible from the way he fights, but more so, he seems incredibly cultured, not only from his expanded vocabulary, but from his interest in theater and film, as well (he's quite fond of the movie ""The Count of Monte Cristo""). The only concrete insight we're given concerns one major event from his past, an event that completely shapes him into a vengeful yet important instigator of society. I dare not say what that event was, nor do I dare say whom he wishes to hunt down and destroy. But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie.A lot of ideas presented have been used before: this is a futuristic story (although it's the not-too-distant future) about a totalitarian government and the rebel who decides to take a stand against it. Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's ""1984"" or see Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" to see what I mean), the way ""V For Vendetta"" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear. That's probably why it wasn't surprising that the filmmakers included a cop (Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch) who starts out loyal but gradually rethinks everything he's been told to believe. Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.The not-too-distant future we're presented shows us England under the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). It's a heavily regimented society formed from the devastation of disease and the collapse of major governments (our country is referred to as the Former United States). Maybe that's why Sutler is practically never seen in person; he's a ruler whose face is almost exclusively seen on a greatly oversized television screen (which I'm sure was an intentional tribute to Orwell's Big Brother character). To say he has absolute control over the country would be an understatement; political opposition, homosexuality, and religious freedom are all illegal and punishable by death. (Does any of this seem overwhelmingly familiar?)The vast majority of the population is complacent and fearful. We frequently sees shots of regular families in their living rooms watching their TVs, witnessing the government's propaganda in the form of falsified news bulletins and religious banter (delivered with style by Roger Allam as the despicable Lewis Prothero). You can see the anger and sadness in their eyes as they're being lied to from their own people. At the same time, you can see the unwillingness to do something about it; anyone who's ever faced a dilemma knows the agony of not rocking the boat when they know they should.Things get interesting when we meet Evey (Natalie Portman, who can finally fake a decent British accent). Her past is about as dark and painful as you might expect, and as a result, she has some intense but reserved feelings about the government. She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her. Right away it becomes obvious that the two were meant to be allies. It's also obvious that she is intrigued yet suspicious of his beliefs and methods. What are not so obvious are his feelings for her, and they remain elusive throughout the film; he's accommodating and witty while at the same time overpowering and distant. These conflicting personalities were eventually foremost in my mind, especially after Evey is kidnapped, questioned, and tortured (but to find out why, you'll have to see the movie).Some may be offended by ""V For Vendetta""'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way. Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world. It's by no means just a stylized action thriller, as the television commercials may lead some to believe. Underneath it all, it's trying to convey a serious political message, one that doesn't have to be believed so much as it does have to be heard."	5.0	V For Very Important	2006-03-17	22	13	9

Yes this movie has a vendetta, it is to place all the blame of terroristic acts on a decent and civil society. I cannot imagine a movie that is more of a crime against humanity and a plea for insanity and lawlessness than this one. I'm not going to say avoid this movie, I would say go see it if you are inclined to for what it really is which is Hollywood's secular humanistic pull for placing the blame of the 9/11 attacks on a western capitalist society.

It is not against Bush, and it DOES NOT portray the gay life-style as the only worth-while lifestyle. For that we have Brokeback Mountain. But! On another note, this film has it's ups and downs. But this is a great movie, I highly recommend it, compared to the graphic novel, I prefer the book but this movie has its own sequences which are very tru to the comic.

They center on this society elite that are basically the thought police who are imprisoning, experimenting and killing political radicals and gays and lesbians.  Of course the movie does little to indicate the actual views of political radicals.I do not know how this movie is selling so well, but I imagine it wont last, once people actually start to watch it.If you really want to buy it...just wait there will be hundreds of used / returned copies for cheap in the stores and online in no time.Sin City, Darkman, Dark City, and Matrix are far superior to this movie."	1.0	If you really want to buy it...Just Wait...it will soon be in discount bin	2006-08-28	108	55	53

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A24F1UX8ZT5IXY	C.J. Hustwick	Amazingly enough, V for Vendetta winds up being quite a memorable film. It is no tour de force, the 1984 homages are ridiculously simplistic, a dull subplot mires the entire affair -- but the core message and dramatic high points of the film are undeniable. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving both give inspired performances, backed with a surprising amount of emotional depth.Much of the revolutionary talk is treated in a pithy fashion, and it is very apparent that we are watching material evolved from a comic book. This is anarchism light, shirking any real discussion of the political ramifications of anything beyond totalitarian rule and its obliteration. It would have been nice and much more meaningful to have not only heard but experienced scenes that developed out of a more complex conception of the political realm.Yet, despite it all I found myself myself enjoying the whole thing. Realistically, I would give the film 3 and a half stars -- but extra points need be given for the ending credits song.	3.0	Never quite transcends its soliloquies.	2006-04-23	8	6	2

Then the movie continues to show the world in which people will eventually live if we don't fight for our Civil Freedoms. If people keeps their mouth shut when a freedom has been stripped away, in fear of Police or Military retaliation then we will slowly be forced into an invisible jail sentence.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3MP216T86YF0H	C. J. Rae	"V for Vendetta is a well-crafted movie with an engaging storyline, excellent acting, and enough visual effects and stunts to keep the action moving. On that note, there are some who will not like it, thinking it too dark, too cliched, and in some cases (although I'm not naming names) too liberal.What is interesting is that, while one of the story's main themes is terrorism (and what is the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter?) the two acts of ""terrorism"" that V commits are heavily sanatized. He blows up two buildings (big deal, you'll see more destruction of public property in the Mission Impossible III trailer than you will in this movie), in the dead of night when no one is inside them. In real life, terrorists don't generally wait until no one is inside a building to blow it up; after all, you tend to generate more terror when lives are lost. More violent is his personal vendetta against high ranking members of the government to whom he metes out his own idea of justice.The acting is excellent. I don't care what anyone says about Natalie Portman's accent difficulties. I'm American and admittedly I'm not very good at telling different British accents apart, however, I refuse to waste my time nitpicking about her accent instead of paying attention to her words and her body language and the way she interacts with the characters around her and her effect on them (such as V and Finch).Hugo Weaving (working at a huge disadvantage because he never removes the mask) lets V's favorite weapons, words, roll over us and he uses his sonorous baritone as well as his body language to wonderful effect. It won't get him any Academy nods, which I think is a shame, but it's a performance well worth seeing.And the rest of the supporting cast is very good as well- Finch, Dedritch, Sutler, and Creevy come to life as well realized characters. John Hurt, especially, as Sutler is wonderful. You can see the zealotry as spits his words over the looming screen as he speaks to his subordinates. (And on a lighter note, his moment of Benny Hill slapstick is hilarious as well as insightful).The film's second motif, the idea of the mask, has many people drawing parallels to The Phantom of the Opera. To anyone insisting that this is a cliche, I can only say that using masks as a storytelling device is well known from Classical Greek and Roman plays to Shakespeare (Twelth Night is heavily quoted in in V, and wasn't the only one of Shakespeare's plays to use the idea), and onward. The reason it's used so much is because it's a facinating reflection of another theme of this movie-what is identity? If terrorism and violence provides the cerebral A plot of the story, V's self-realization of who he is and what he has become provides the heart of the story.If you do not like the thought of bittersweet or ambigous endings, or if you go to the movies simply because you want to be entertained, you may not enjoy V for Vendetta. It is certainly entertaining, but it is written on enough different levels that it requires you to think. It can be watched more than once and if you pay attention, you will find something new to think about each time, while still enjoying the action sequences and the stunts."	5.0	Thought provoking entertainment	2006-03-20	16	8	8

I couldn't figure it out: was it the negative press, or the controversy, or the fact that I read the original graphic novel and wasn't that big of a fan of it? I still can't figure it out after watching it actually. It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love.We're in an Orwellian ""1984""-esque England where the government controls everything, microphones and cameras are everywhere, religious texts are banned and dissenters often disappear. Leading the fight for freedom is V, a man in a mask inspired by Guy Fawkes who dons knives and takes down key members of government and plans to blow up Parliament. With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions.Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize ""hey, we ARE getting screwed here!""How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an action junkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a ""Mr. Anderson..."" at any moment.Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies."	4.0	"It's good in that kind of ""it didn't waste my time"" way"	2006-08-16	4	0	4

Mcclain ""movie cole"""	I thought V for Vendetta was a really good movie, and it now the best of Alan Moore's Work that has now been brought to the big screen.  Yet, I wonder why disowned his name from the credits of the movie. Perhaps it's because the original graphic novel from which the movie was based upon was not only about the message that the masked hero delivered but it was also a little bit more about exploring what V (the character himself) was really all about.  Because by reading the graphic novel and then seeing the movie there were obivous chages made to the original story, but you can tell that the movie didn't spend as much time on the V character like the graphic novel did but it was more about the message that V delivered.  It would be very interesting to hear Alan Moore talk about his reason for not being involved in the movie.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1LMQHB3ZANNVN	C. Oliver	"V, brillantly acted by Hugo Weaving, is not the story of a terrorist who believes that blowing things up is the only answer.  It is not the story of a person that claims to have all the answers.  It's not the story of a person whose plans are all noble, but the story of a person who wants vengeance, and who sees something horrible in the world and wants to change it.  Violence is not an answer some contractors and critics of the show say.  Violence is not an answer?  Is not AMerica's freedom one by violence?  Did we not liberate a country by blowing up bombs, and sending soldiers with guns.  Do we not have our own Vendettas?V is our second Amendent.  V is to represent the ability all humans, and citizens of a country should have, not to be afraid of their government but for their government to be afraid of them.  If a government has power, you can not beat them in the press.  You can only outrage a public so much that they will join you in a violent overthrow.  Because if you believe a dictator will say that because the masses are quietly and contently protesting that he will resign I pitty, and sad and lost world that will inhabit.  If you believe that Sedition and Censorship are good, and that people who challange the religious ideals, in search of there happiness are bad, then maybe you'd find yourself at home in 2020 Britian.  If you believe that a government shouldn't answer for it's crimes.  That a government doesn't have to answer to it's people.  And that your government can be trusted.  You haven't done your history very well.Hitler, Stalin, 1919 Seditions Act, Containment Centers for the Chinese, Kings, QUeens, Hussien.  This is what blind obedience of your government causes.  Hitler had to be overthrown with violence.  Kings were overthrown, Queens were overthrown, Hussien was overthrown, The Tabliban was overthrown.People might say that this praises anarchy.  Anarchy is chaos, because we believe that people cannot be trusted.  People given freedom will be corrupted by that freedom, and for the most part it is true.  But I can only hope that the world, given a choice between, Censorsip and Sedition, Controling Government, Dictatorship, the Dissmissal of privacy, and the dissmisal of freedom, or Anarcy, people Anarchy.  Let me remind you of a woman named Margaret Garner, who instead of allowing her babies to be taken back for slavery, she murdered them.  Let me remind you of Nat Turner, who was hung, was tried and found guilty, who led a revolt against the government of the South because it wasn't right.  Benjamin Franklin once said that ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""  And that is the case we deal with in V's world.  It is safer to live under the governments rule and not fight, and not argue, and not do anything.  It is safer... but freedom is not meant to be safe.  Freedom means death, freedom means murder and hate, freedom means love and expression, freedoms danger and uncertainty, and freedom means Power and Individuality.V isn't a coward because he hides behind a mask, he's deformed for one reason, and he's trying to last longer than the man who thought there would be no punishment.  Anarchist and a Terrorist, you know, I wonder what people think America is in Iraq, the Iraqi citizens whose children have been firebombed, whose mothers have been burnt to death, or whose fathers or husband or wives or grandparents, or grandchildren have been killed by American bombs.  Or these people who have been left defenseless against the Tyranny that still exist as we try to force our views down their throats, and the voice of opposition is continually silenced.  If all of a sudden, ten thousand people Marched down Iraqi streets, we would lose this war completely.  If they stood together, if they chose to no longer allow us we would be the enemy.  WE aren't yet, but that's luck.  V united a people in his time against a true evil.  An evil the people came to accept for fear of death.

Slipman	"The dulcet and eloquent articulation by Hugo Weaving playing futuristic revolutionary known as V belies the powerful message of the film.  Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story ""1984"".In the year 2020 worldwide conflicts have fueled the creation of a totalitarian society in England led by the unyielding, dictatorial Chancellor Adam Sutler played powerfully by the accomplished John Hurt.  Having quashed the ideals of intellectuals, citizens live under fear of reprisal for wrong thinking.  Under these repressive conditons arises V, a lone voice attempting by terroristic acts to alter the shape of society.During one of V's escapades, he comes into contact with working girl Evey Hammond played by Natalie Portman.  She comes to his aid as he attempts to take control of the government run television station where she works.  They form an uneasy bond at first and V takes Evey in his confidence.  We learn that both Weaving and Portman are products of their society.  V was a survivor of a government sponored experiment into biologic warfare.  Portman survived the destruction of her family at the hands of an unsympathetic government.V who stealthily gets around in swashbuckling fashion cloaked with a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film, has designs to make a stupendous terroristic statement on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5th.  He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.The special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.  Weaving, Portman and Hurt were all impressive in their portrayals.

This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector.""-PlatoIn the 1980s comic books took a revolutionary turn (one the likes of which had not been seen since the `60s and `70s) and became politically and socially relevant again. These were the days of conservative and consumerist values, when Ronald Reagan was president and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. A Cold War was being fought and the lines between freedom fighter and terrorist, democracy and imperialism were quickly dissipating. It was in this political climate that David Lloyd and Alan Moore createdV for Vendetta, a highly intelligent graphic novel series. V for Vendetta was brilliantly written and illustrated and helped to prove that comic books weren't just for children; they were literature. The film V for Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel and was written by the Wachowski Brothers (the Matrix Trilogy).""As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality.""-Karl MarxIn a bleak totalitarian future, Britain has become a cesspool for corruption, conformity and brutality. People's civic rights are being severely violated by the government, under the leadership of Chancellor Sutler. The people are misguided, apathetic, and fearful of the harsh regime that rules over them but that's about to change. One night a young woman named Evey is caught by corrupt police officers after curfew. They intend to rape her but astonishingly (or predictably, if you're a comic book expert) she is saved by a costumed vigilante, who wears an antiquated mask ofGuy Fawkes. His name is V and he has a deep hatred of the current government, a hatred that was born when he was tortured and experimented upon. He invites Evey to join him on the rooftops fro a ""concerto"" which he will conduct himself. Reluctantly she agrees to go and there she watches in shock and amazement as V detonates the Old Bailey. The next day a police squad is sent to obtain her for questioning but V shows up and saves her... sort of. He takes her back to his underground lair where he makes her breakfast and asks her to join him in his revolution. She agrees but only does so with the intention of escaping. V uses Evey to gain access to his targets but she manages to get away. Soon she is caught and arrested. She spends months in a small gloomy cell being tortured and interrogated before she is released and learns to master her fear. Meanwhile Chancellor Sutler increases his power over the population by overwhelming them with misinformation in the media. He utilizes scare tactics and military force to keep any dissidents in line but the people grow quietly more rebellious. V has promised them a revolution will commence on November the 5th and he has planned to liberate them and avenge those who have been wronged. But is he a lunatic or a hero, a guerrilla freedom fighter or a monstrous killer? Maybe he is all of those things as well as being the only hope for ending Chancellor Sutler's wicked regime... and yet at what cost?""One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.""-Martin Luther King, Jr.The film is skillfully directed by newcomer James McTeigue and features an amazing cast including Hugo Weaving as V, Natalie Portman as Evey, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler. Other cast members include Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Roger Allam and Sinead Cusack.V for Vendetta is a disquieting film, a film that is thought provoking and questions authority. It daringly asks questions about the world in which we live but it leaves us to find the answers. The film is understandably controversial, especially in the age of terrorism, distortion in the media, genocide, biochemical warfare and rampant political corruption. The story shows us the dangers of combining religious fanaticism, puritanical thinking, and social intolerance while handing the government complete control. The film certainly won't appeal to many conservatives or centralists. It's an extreme film that attacks extreme problems. Even Alan Moore disassociated himself from it, feeling that the screenplay was not faithful to his story*. Yet despite the film's many flaws it remains very relevant to the issues we face in modern society.""You can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.""-Malcolm X* For an interview with Alan Moore about his disapproval of the film adaptation, check out the following site:[...]"	4.0	"""Remember, Remember the Fifth of November"""	2008-08-11	2	2	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	Well, if you like your villain as some sort of Wizard of Oz - Big Brother Stalinist Nazi - Ranting Phoole with a ham handed George W. Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.Oh, well.	3.0	If you like implausible paranoid fantasies, this might be for you.

If your idea of a hero is someone filled with hatred, bitterness, fantasies of violence and revenge, plus able to torture a poor innocent girl for her own good; then this movie is for you.  The very philosophy behind this movie is sick and twisted.  Of course, Hugo Weaving is a great actor even when he is forced to act from behind a Guy Fawkes mask (I think that's what it was), and Natalie Portman is good, but it's not her best role.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well.The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down.The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!	3.0	'V' fails to deliver the statement it works so hard to make...	2006-10-25	7	4	3

This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. The action is awful, the script is the worst writing the Wachowski Brothers have ever done since Bound. This one of the dumbest movies ever made. It seems that the Wachowski's movies are going farther and farther downhill as they try to match their only good movie; The Matrix. There are moments and lines and all sorts of other things in this film that are completely ripping off Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil. I think that movies should be entertaining and if they aren't that then they should be important, even movies that are bad I can still laugh at and get enjoyment out of. V for Vendetta is one of those rare movies that I got absolutely no entertainment out of, this is one of the only movies I can say I truly hate. Don't let the one star fool you, this is a zero star movie.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3GFDBYYRU9VEJ	Daniel C. Greene	"I popped this movie in the player having heard some of the negative comments and was really surprised. First, it's obvious what the political view of the movie is. Being somewhat moderate to conservative myself, I don't share the belief of the left that this movie is a portrait of our future. It's interesting how the Big Brother philosophy is tied together with a semi-Christian fundamentalist idealogy. Usually these ""big brother"" movies show government as soulless. My first thought after seeing this movie was ""this is probably how it happened in Nazi Germany"". When people are desperate or afraid (as Germans were in the early 1930's) they will sometimes accept anyone who ""makes the trains run on time"". Putting the politics aside, the movie was beautifully photographed. The atmosphere captures a sense of film noir, especially when dealing with the city streets. The movie was really well cast as Stephen Rea was good, and Natalie Portman was even better. Hugo Weaving does an amazing job of showing elegance, menace, and angst at times, all while wearing a mask! Not an easy acting job at all. Definitely a thought provoking movie.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	"Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say ""it can't happen here,"" but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.  The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.  V for Vendetta really is just a few plot holes and inconsistencies away from being a certifiable five-star film."	4.0	A powerful, compelling film full of stand-out performances	2006-10-23	7	1	6

But here they are again with another bloated, self-important bore-fest that might as well be called ""Yawn!  The Movie.""Many have said that ""V For Vendetta"" doesn't answer all the questions it raises.  That's not accurate.  It doesn't answer any questions, and unless you're a sociopathic mad bomber it shouldn't raise any either.  Because that's exactly what V is: a sociopath.  That's not what bothers me.  I enjoy anti-heroes.  What bothers me (aside from that the second half is almost as action-packed as an episode of ""The View"") is that the Wachowski brothers make V less an anti-hero and more a freaking messiah!  They claim that V is not intended as a hero, yet never do they condemn his actions in even the smallest way.  Conversely, they portray V as a paragon of righteousness.  They even go so far as to say that Guy Fawkes was ""a great man.""  Guy Fawkes was no more a hero than Timothy McVeigh.  The idea that he should be represented as such is nauseating.That being said, there are a few positives.  It starts out interesting enough with V hunting down and killing government officials who ran a concentration camp from which he escaped.  The use of color is brilliant.  It's visually beautiful from start to finish.  But it takes a serious nose dive in the second half, devoid of any real action.  That is, until the climax, which begins with a fight scene in the same slow-motion style that so copiously littered the Matrix trilogy and made parts 2 and 3 unwatchable.  There's finally some action, and it's THE SLOWEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE!  I was furious.It was effective in one way, though.  After seeing it, I did want to start my own revolution.Agains Hollywood drivel like ""V For Vendetta.""Seriously, it's bad."	1.0	Why are the Wachowski brothers allowed to keep making movies?	2006-04-22	53	16	37

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2HII4U9WQ0XUV	"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep"""	"Man oh man, when they said ""Sleeper Cell"", they weren't kidding with this one.Call it Snoozer Cell. Or since we're discussing poor Jimmy McTeigue's awkward, mind-numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting ""V for Vendetta""---and since it's set in not-so-jolly-old-England in the hazy, crazy future---then, in the spirit of the Cockney dialect why don't we just call it ""F for Foooking Awful""?Try  ""B for Bowdlerized"": the cinematic ""V"" is one plopped into the digital blender and stripped of its drama, boiled down, recycled, pureed, bled dry of its horrible irony and all too balefully human black heart.McTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in ""V"" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been---balletic, nimble, unapologetically brutal, almost graceful.But then McTeigue---and his well-heeled handlers, the gender-bending Wachowskis---get down to business: sticking it to G.W. Bush and those fiendish Americans!The story, which needed no fiddling, is fiddled with, the better to make Hugo Weaving's black-hatted Hamlet a white-helmeted paragon of Freedom: the sinister, blighted landscape of post-Apocalyptic Britain at the guts of the graphic novel is replaced by a UK gone fascist after a bout of nasty pox. Evey is no longer a prostitute, with nowhere to turn: now she's a pert, preppy, abs-and-thighs of steel -production assistant.And so: gone is the dark, wicked, twisted, nimble brilliance of Alan Moore's sinister diptych set in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian England, replaced by something that plays like a ""V"" Cliff's Notes for the terminally ADHD-set.S for Subtext! The Wachowskis really hate George W. Bush! We get it!F is for Fashionable, baby, Yeah! Terrorism is, like, you know, the new Black! It has a real thinning effect! And nothing brings a people together more than blowing up an historic national landmark with a tube-train filled to the brim with fertilizer bombs---does that mean Tim McVeigh is a posthumous performance artist?H for Hot! With that in mind, when she's not emoting her pretty little skull off or crying or writhing around on the ground in her cute little prison smock, clasping her little shaved-like-a-peach head---well God, blokes, is Natalie Portman not one peachy bird, baby? Yeah! I know the next time I dial up Madama Helga's I'll have to remember ""V"" and ask for the ""Portman Schoolgirl Special"". Rowrrrr, baby, behave!T for Teeth: as in, Jesus F*cking Christ the English have bad Teeth! When V's Halloween-party army takes over and the morning-after shivers wear off, the first act of legislation the new Government of the People should pass is one of free orthodontics: if whatever they were doing over at Larkhill caused these plaguey-bad choppers, then V was onto something, after all!Oh yes, and T for Thespians, too! Whatever ""V""'s faults, the acting is nearly sublime: all hands man their battle stations, and go down with this reeking turd---but throw out some fine performances along the way. Portman turns in the performance of her career as Evey; Stephen Rea (Finch) sulks his way through another flick; Stephen Fry (the snaggle-toothed Gordon) rejoices that he's at least not in ""Gosford Park""; John Hurt (Sutler) twirls his mustachios; and Hugo Weaving phones it in from beneath a heart---or face, anyway---of Oak.D for Deep Pockets! As in, where the h*ll did the freewheeling, itinerant V get enough money to afford Guy Fawkes costumes for the entire population of the British Isles? And come to think of it, wouldn't that sort of order have attracted notice? ""Made to order: 20 million Guy Fawkes outfits. COD.""B for Burkha! Which is what all the popcorn chomping cuties who left the theater wondering why the action quotient wasn't higher had better start fitting themselves for, if the general consensus is that terrorism is cool, blowing buildings up is groovy, and that the Koran is our flipbook for freedom.In the end, it's all M for Mediocrity, and more's the pity. Our shadowy latter-day Guy Fawkes does what he has to do, and serves as an exemplar of stealthy, shadowy urban terror: setting off fertilizer bombs in the bowels of London, whacking the errant, gouty, ulcerated perverted Archbishop (aren't they all, nowadays?), strapping himself up with TNT and parading into a broadcast booth, slitting throats with gay abandon.But the Wachowskis have deprived their Shakespearean anarachist of a suitable foe. In Moore's original, the dictator Adam Susan (renamed Sutler in the cinematic outing, so as to further underscore the Hitler/Bush parallel to the brain-challenged in the audience) was a worthy adversary, if only because he was just as deranged as V, and as equally devoted to his outsized notions of Order as V was to his unrequited love for abstracts like Justice and Liberty: arguably, they were mirror images.It's amusing that ""V"" gets raves for thumbing its wooden nose at Bush's America, where even illegal aliens feel free to march for their 'rights'---when this very instant in the Sudan---surely V's anarchic state of nature, a realm where the people are assuredly *not* afraid of their government because it no longer exists---men are slaughtered for the mistake of belonging to the wrong tribe.""V"" might have landed a roundhouse if it had pitted its Angel of Righteous Destruction against a truly committed avatar of Order---not the ranting Hitler-lite Sutler. Sadly, ""V""'s latter-day Guy Fawkes---reduced each year to a straw-man, and burned in effigy---is pitted against an even more hopeless Straw Man, and the film dies for it.""V for Vendetta"" is ultimately crucified on a cross of mediocrity.JSG"	1.0	P for Poop	2006-04-18	71	19	52

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2I2DE1DJUVQOO	DarthRad	"Oh jeez, how to begin to describe this pile of rubbish?Natalie Portman, as usual, manages to shine through the ridiculous premise of this movie, the illogical plotlines, and the hideously pious preaching of the current politically correct thinking of Hollywood.Hugo Weaving?  Does anybody even have proof that he was in this movie?  How do we know that it wasn't just David Prowse, or some other Darth Vader wannabe stiff taken off the actors' unemployment lines that was behind that Guy Fawkes mask?Hugo Weaving ACTING?  Give me a break.  His most outstanding acting abilities in previous movies have all been in his facial features, stern, menacing, and yet capable of compassion.Weaving's face is NEVER seen in this movie.  If that was him, what a waste of money and talent.  Waving your arms around, pointing your fingers here and there, and flinging knives, all the while wearing a mask, do not count as acting in my book - just about any high school level actor could have done this job.And as for all of this business about Britain being taken over by an evil conservative government with some sort of a pseudo-right wing Christian religious bent (which uses a double-cross symbol that somewhat resembles an Eastern Orthodox cross), come on, this is all Hollywood again.  Britain and Europe are now suffering from a severe DECLINE in religious beliefs everywhere except in the immigrant Muslim communities.  If there is a religion that is threatening the future well-being of Europeans, it is certainly not Christianity.  The Wachowski brothers are just doing the usual bigoted Christian bashing that has become so de rigueuer for Hollywood movies.Alan Moore, one of the creators of the original comic series on which this movie was based, had this to say about the movie:""[The movie] has been ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.""I have to say, in reading about the original comic book version of V for Vendetta, that Moore's own vision was also terribly near-sighted.  The comic book was riding the 1980's era liberal British themes of anti-Thatcherism and anti-Reaganism, as well as fear of a nuclear war that would destroy Britain as the result of Reagan basing American nuclear missiles in Europe.None of those fears came to pass.  Britain was revitalized by Thatcher's socialism-busting policies and became an economically freer and far more vigorous nation.  The threat posed by the American nuclear missiles in Europe led to a landmark nuclear disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union.  Then the U.S.S.R. collapsed, as did the threat of Europe getting caught in an all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  And in Britain, Thatcher's Conservative Party did eventually get replaced by Blair's Labor Party, but the Labor Party had to transform itself from a shrill advocate of the restrictive protections of socialism in order to get back into power, and it has never been the same again.Entirely different forces now threaten Britain and Europe, and they are not the ones depicted in this very, very vapid movie.Avoid."	1.0	V is for VAPID	2007-04-29	79	48	31

This film came in slightly under my expectations but that not due to any fault of its own but of the consistent hype it was given to me over the years.  I plan to watch this film a few more times as the dialogue is lengthy, sometimes convoluted, but somehow still engaging and grips you.  There was a few times during the film that I had to pause and rewind to understand what was said in the dialogue.  It should be made aware to the general audience that this is by no means an action film.  It is heavier on dialogue which I respected and the action when it took place was well shot.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY	"David A. Dein ""passafist"""	"Bollocks!  Bollocks I say! V FOR VENDETTA is pure drivel. I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion.  But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film.  It's a film about how great anarchy is.About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt).  Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned.  The government has created a police state that keeps people in line.  Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions.  Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman).  Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are.  They talk and talk and then talk some more.  The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds.  V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government.  It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask.  He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see.  Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government.  He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions.  He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see.  He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias.  Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge.  But what then?  Do you start another government?  Does that one become corrupt?I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark?  That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most.  I've even made my wife cry and  I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.That's why we invent law.  Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition.  But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him.  Government and greed are the problems.  He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right.  Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place.  But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him?  Would he be labeled a traitor?  Would he be sent away?  The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong,  I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right.  I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want.  We are ""One Nation Under God"", be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War.  My faith in America is not in the government.  My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante.  It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself.  Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.Do you want change the world?  It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not.  It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes. V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad."	2.0	V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad.	2006-03-17	51	18	33
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUEHG0DB54B7K	David A. Wend	"V for Vendetta is based upon a graphic novel by Alan Moore, which I was unaware of prior to seeing the film.  I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.The story begins some years in the not too distant future when England has been transformed into a Fascist state under the rule of a chancellor (played by John Hurt).  The United States is embroiled in a civil war (origin unknown).  The dictatorship (with overtones of Hitler) has a foot in Orwell's 1984 in describing a regime that has literally banned all freedoms but it struck me more that these are the hallmarks of all dictatorships: the cult of the leader, suppressing free speech, spying on their citizens.  The film centers on the mysterious character called ""V,"" who is part Zorro and Phantom of the Opera (in that he is disfigured) wearing a mask of Guy Fawkes (famed for the Gunpowder Plot during the reign of James I); he is an avenger and a liberator.  The pivotal character Evey (Rachael Portman) has suffered under the dictatorship with her parents (who protested against the regime) dying in labor camps and her brother dying as a result of biological weapon released by the government to instill fear.  The key part of the story is Evey's transformation from a fearful person, who bows to the dictatorship, into a defiant freedom fighter.However, Evey is not the only person affected by ""V.""  After his initial act of defiance (blowing up the Old Bailey on Guy Fawkes' Day) all of the people are awakened into their own acts of defiance.  This is the focus of ""V for Vendetta,"" that power is with the people to produce change.  This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.  After seeing the film I read the reviews of some film critics who believe the film is a jab at the Bush Administration.  Lately, several films have been exploited for a political message that I think is simply not there.  Even the ""March of the Penguins"" became a political football when it was held up as an example of ""family values!""  One can read into ""V for Vendetta"" what one wishes but I do not see how it can be labeled as having an anti-Bush agenda.  The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up; we all have to be ready to make sacrifices.  For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.The casting is perfect on all levels.  Hugo Weaving rises to the challenge of acting behind a mask using his voice alone to bring depth to his character and Natalie Portman goes from a frightened young woman to being committed and fearless.  Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture ""V"" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott-Smith is a superb villain.  Being a long-time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of ""1984"" he was the victim of Big Brother.I was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it."	5.0	A Thought Provoking Film	2006-03-27	8	5	3

The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original; I felt myself being drawn in to the mystery and the danger and became very curious how things were going to progress. The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.Hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey. The scenery and overall ambience of the movie are effective in conveying the oppressive nature of life under the dictatorial control of Chancellor Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt.This is a dark, serious, action movie which I believe more sensitive children and adults should probably avoid. It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.	4.0	A Different Kind of Hero?	2012-05-30	1	1	0

I have no experience with Alan Moore's graphic novel which is the foundation for the movie, but I did find the movie to present a world very similar to George Orwell's 1984--one of my favorite books of all time.  I was wowed by the thoughtfulness of the dialogue in the movie.  V has a few excellent, thought-provoking monologues throughout the movie which really make the viewer think.  The acting is also some of the best I've seen.  I am glad to see that Portman's portrayal of Evey was much better than her performance as Amidala in the new Star Wars movies.  The film also makes great use of different characters' perspectives to make the movie complete.I do believe that one could criticize the movie for its seeming over-emphasis on discrimination based on sexual preferences, but it is a minor fault which can be easily overlooked given the broad scope of the film as a whole.  That said, V for Vendetta is an excellent movie well worth owning.	5.0	A Great Movie	2006-08-05	6	4	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ABTYRDOKNGKFS	"David R ""dtr19"""	The funny thing about this movie is this..... I liked it.  Now why is this a funny thing you might ask.  Well its  funny because this movie was clearly supposed to have political undertones based around something that wasn't there in the comic.  I did read the comic, and in fact, reread it before I saw the movie.  Sure they changed a few things, but thats no big surprise.  The acting was fantastic, the script was still quite good, the cinematography was great, and overall it was a good movie.  The letter from Valerie was still just as moving, and actually moved me closer to tears than the comic ever could.  Portman was incredible in that moment too.  She made me believe she found that inch.  They changed the relationship between V and Evey a little bit, but it wasn't anything that was too surprising.  Hollywood likes to create a love story if they can.  There was a SMALL love story in the comic between them, but it was a differant kind than in the movie.  The love story did not get in the way at all though in either case.  The song playing when Evey leaves V though, that song and part just about broke my heart (I Found a Reason by Cat Power).  But Weaving stole the show.  That may have hardly been him under the mask even for all anyone knows, but his voice and his speeches were almost every bit as moving as anything V says in the comic.  Just remember, if the Valerie part doesn't move you at all, especially the part about the roses, even a small amount than you have no heart.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie that has enough of a thoughtful part to it to make you interested between the action, which is much less than I think most people will expect going in.  Give it a try, and go in with a totally open mind about it.  Read the graphic novel too, its fantastic.

They hate this movie because it shows where this goverment is leading us. ""V"" is a true hero because the goverment he fights is unambiguously evil. We are not there, yet. This movie is merely a warning. It asks us to ""look ourselves in the mirror"" and not let our fears override our values. The dangers we face from terrorists are real, but also the fear mongering and deception of this goverment are real. That's the only way to explain how something as un-american and un-patriotic as the ""Patriot Act"" (""Articles of Allegiance"" in the movie) can get that name and be accepted by the citizens of our country. We as a nation are sure to face new attacks from terrorists, but we should never renounce our liberty for the sake of security.  As Benjamin Franklin said: ""He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither"". Maybe the intentions of the neocons are good, but ""I'm not here for what you hoped for, I'm here for what you did"".++Spoiler Warning++The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous. In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropiate and actually enjoyable. ""V"" is a flawed hero, driven more by the desire for vengance than by ideals, but idealistic never the less. He realizes his shortcomings; he has became a monster and tells Evey as much in the climactic scene: ""You are right about what I've become, there is no tree at the end for me"". In other words, there can be no happy ending for ""V"", no tree to climb with his love like Edmund Dantes. The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent.  In the end with the announced destruction of Parliment ""V"" just gives the people the opportunity to lose their fear of the goverment and reclaim their freedom. It still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take it back.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AZCCTSHXYJMER	D. Bushe	Sword fighting, bombs, beauty, fireworks, and conspiracy all laid upon the themes of our times and exported to London. V for Vendetta is a completely satisfying movie. Whole, compelling, entertaining, inspiring, and visually awe-inspiring it overcomes its flaws and delivers like few movies ever have. As the movie begins, you may wonder how this film ever saw the light of day. Its story line is lifted right from the Bush-Cheney administration's corruption, blunders and propaganda and thinly veiled with an export of the setting to Britain. Perhaps the most amazing element of this movie is the acting. Consistently well-acted by all the the actors, those you would expect like Hurt, and those you might not, like um, Natalie Portman. Natalie is beautiful, and I found myself falling in love with her character during the movie, but I never thought she was even a mediocre actress. I have found most of performances to be some of the worst ever committed to film. But she pulls off her character her. Just like the brother brought out a worthy performance from Keanu Reeves in the Matrix, they have pulled off their magic again with another less than stellar artist.

Portman does a great job for such a vague charactor and ""V"" is a wonderful part as a whole, he truly represents a true, opinionated and couragous hero. I thought that it got stuck in the mud and began to get a little slow their in the middle but it sped up again in the end and overall it succeeded in being what slowly becomes a very unique ""Marvel"" film. Some of the parts of the film I thought were very clever such a the speech that ""V"" makes @ the beginning of the movie in  which he speaks in words that all start with the letter ""V"". Some other people say that you should read the comic book (I believe it is), before watching the movie so that you have a full understanding about what is going on and that way you can enjoy the ""Deeper Meaning"" as well, ...

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1HCZ5W02CCJYX	Dean Eric	"As if the Wachowski brothers didn't wow us enough with the Matrix, they resurface again, this time with V for Vendetta, a very bleak look at, by all means, a very possible future if the human race keeps on as it is.  The story is set in totalitarian Britain, where the country is under a government run by a high chancellor whose name bears more than a passing similarity to Adolf Hitler (coincidence?  I think not!) and centers around a clever, charismatic, Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter known only as V.  Accompanying V on his quest for a new revolution is Evey Hammond, a seemingly average woman with a terrible past and ties to the very government she finds herself fighting against.It's a long movie, so it does pave the way for quite a story to be told, and we are not treated with just one but several riveting accounts of just how corrupt this government is, and how most people seem to move to and fro about their lives, completely oblivious to the inner-macinations of their country.  The story I found myself most sympathizing with was Every's, having lost her parents in a political rally some ten years back.  And who better to play this role than American veteran actress Natalie Portman, who first truly caputured our eye on the screen when she starred as Padme' in Star Wars: Episode I.  We have dozens of English actors who come to star in American films, doing their best imitations of American accents, so why not have an American woman do the exact opposite?  Portman does it well, having trained for several hours a day for weeks on end to perfect her accent, it's a wonder she hasn't lived in the UK at one time or another.  Not that her accent overshadows her performance, Portman showed excellent emotion and sorrow at the right points, while not letting her guard down and feeding us little bits of how strong she truly is on the inside.  It takes talent, folks.  Talent that, to be honest, I'd have never thought her capable of.Then we have V, a ""terrorist"" (I prefer to call him a hero) who makes a living out of wielding daggers and cavulting through back alleys dressed entirely in black leather and sporting an creepy, grinning visage representing the late Guy Fawkes, whose attempt to extinguish Parliament in 1605 is essentially the basis for V's mannerisms and outlooks.  Hugo Weaving plays this role excellently, deepening and shallowing his voice in all the right places, executing lines while taking out ""Fingermen"" with an acting prowess that'll have you cracking an ear-to-ear grin and leave you wanting more.Let's not forget the high chancellor himself, Adam Sutler, portrayed by none other than British actor John Hurt.  This bloke is flat-out scary, hands down.  Yellow teeth, ungroomed beard, spazzy, evil demeanor, the works.  Sutler is fit for a straight-jacket, and after seeing Hurt go absolutely nuts with this part, I honestly don't believe anyone other than Hitler himself could fill the role.  Take a look at this flick and you can bet your bottom dollar you'll jump the next time you hear any word close to ""Sutler.""  'Nuff said.Weaving, Portman, and Hurt are also followed by a slew of wonderful British actors including Stephen Rea, Roger Allam, Tim Pigott-Smith, and Stephen Fry, written by the Wachowskis and directed by James McTiegue, V for Vendetta is not only a movie, but a political statement.  It has the potential to really wake people up to the things that are going on in the world and what they can lead to if we don't start resolving things peacefully.  Packed with lots of dramatic dialogue, hypnotic Shakespeare quotations, uber-stylized violence and, of course, EXPLOSIONS, this movie will not only have you sweating bullets and sitting inches away from the screen from start to finish, but will make you think long afterwards."	4.0	"""Disdaining fortune with his brandish'd steel, which smoked with bloody execution..."""	2006-08-02	3	3	0

I have not been impressed with this endless stream of regurgitated remakes this past year.  It's like Hollywood has gone brain dead.  Worse, these remakes are sooooooooo weak.  So when a movie moves me, spellbinds me, leaves me breathless, I am so thrilled to find it.

With a film striking so many ""chords"" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?  Damn straight it is!This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.  It gives you humanity; it gives you romance.  The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A105YVLAZNYQUU	Dentallica	I have never read the Alan Moore graphic novel but I suspect it is worthy of the hype. This movie however is not. This movie is a rehash of various other cultural representations: most notably Big Brother and Hitler's Germany circa 1940. I can get behind stories about overthrowing oppression and injustice but this movie had nothing new to deliver. Yes V is the shady hero who was `created' by the government state and eventually brings their power to an end. This theme has been done by better novels and films so many times I can't even begin to list them all. Needless to say, this film offers nothing exciting or new to the genre.If I had known the screenplay was written by the Matrix brothers I never would have seen this film. These clowns are still running from the crime scene of the Matrix sequels and some producer figured they could get another yacht or two if they adapted another comic book to the big screen. Big mistake. I actually fell asleep watching this movie, and that hasn't happened since I saw some diseased Jennifer Lopez movie.A huge disappointment in the film is the Natalie Portman character. Portman has the accent down but that's the only good thing about this gig. Her character is lame. She is a nonentity in a film that focuses her as the main character (I think). Basically this girl has been oppressed and wronged by the government but when she `awakens' or whatever, she turns into a window shopper for a year. She literally just walks the streets.Anyway, I can imagine the Matrix brothers typing away at their computers with lofty goals of blending the `1984' genres into something new and cool. In the end, this movie does nothing of the sort. It is predictable, unoriginal and tiresome. And what is up with the crappy cartoonish violence? Not good like the over the top Kill Bill, but boring and leaves me asking why?	2.0	Predictable and Boring	2006-08-20	16	4	12
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A382AH0YTZJHQ5	"Der Hammer des Kuchens ""I guess so"""	The movie takes place in futuristic Britian run by a totalitarian government and it's about the masked character known as V. V wants to overthrow the wicked government by blowing up buildings such as Parlament which will cause the people to rise up and take back the power. He also decides to kill a bunch of people that took part in horrible experiments where he was used as a test subject. Most of the movie is centered around Evey who gets rescued by V in the beggining and she slowly but surely starts to help V in his quest to overthrow the government. There is also a cop who's trying to find V and is trying to find out if his government is corrupt.Through the movie there are some references to America's war on terror and the kind of horrible consiquences it brought onto the world which I thought was a nice touch because it could be like that in the future but we won't know for a while. My only problem with the anti Bush type themes is that they do it way to much and over and over again which got very repetitive and it seemed forced and they wanted to bring it up as much as possible. The few action scenes that they do have are good but there aren't too many of them. Also what's up with V's hair seriously.Anyways due to the lack of action scenes and all the way too much anti totalitarian goverment talk makes this just an okay movie which should at least be seen once or twice but beyond that it's not really a movie you'd watch over and over again.	3.0	V for abomanation	2006-12-28	15	2	13

It has all the action guys like, the love interest for the ladies, and - what a surprise these days, an actually well written script with good plot and a turn or two. Natalie Portman is as delicious as ever (another plus for the guys) though the direction on the camera work was poor in that, as so many do for some reason, they kept cutting off her feet.  And often the top of her head too. She was barefoot in many of the scenes, but that opportunity was missed by the narrow camera angle. But overall a very watchable film, we actually never used the F/F feature to skip any slow parts. Recommended for a movie night.	4.0	A chick flick for guys too!	2010-11-05	2	0	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2EHZ86SI8EYUN	Dick Sunrise	Glancing through the other reviews, I find it funny that most all the focus is centered around politics as the theme of this movie. I think it is about the power of ideas, things any of us can make, and that how one man with an idea can change the world. The way I see it, V represents pure artistic idea, the artist in all of us that wants to be freed (in some more than others). The scene with him emerging from the fire, in my opinion, has nothing to do with him coming from evil or being evil but instead signifies that V (pure artistic idea) was born from the plight of mankind (artists are more sensitive to their surroundings, so therefore if something is wrong around them they will be more pained by it and want to change it). What V focuses on changing (the political ideals of his country) is what most of you are saying the whole theme of the movie is; I say you haven't dug deep enough. I feel this movie shows us how plight in mankind affects true artists more than others who tend to ignore it, and how if you let your pure artistic idea loose, it can change the world for the better. What you focus on changing (politics or whatever) is beside the point. V is trying to remove a certain plight from humanity, is all, and this movie is about trying to inspire us to focus on a plight and do the same. If everyone did their part, then plight would be basically gone, and we'd be in a lot better place to live.Food for thought.D.S.	5.0	A great movie to see.

However, friends didn't have this as an immediate reaction, but agreed after I mentioned it.The underlying story: (1) Guy Fawkes is an unlikely hero.  The Gunpowder Plot was to replace a religiously tolerant government (for its time) - the laws on religious conformity were largely unenforced (a version of ""Don't ask; don't tell"") - with a Catholic state that included the Inquistion.  Guy Fawkes had more in common with the autocratic government of this story than with the resistance.  (2) The victory against the dictator had been won before the Parliament building was destroyed, and that victory came from the leader being parodied and mocked on TV.  V's destruction of the Parliament building was an act of anarchism - destruction of institutions simply because they are institutions.  Realistically, you don't destroy institutions with long solid records because they have been briefly subverted.

One would think it was developed from a famous novel on the peer level of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or Lord of the Flies. This movie makes one think past the wonderful story to the mirror being held to the face of the USA today. We are only one election away from creating a government similar to one depicted in this film. Witty lines and a great but horrifying story keeps one entertained from start to finish. It leaves you with hope that humans will make the correct choice in times of need and not be sheep to fear of a make believe superstition and made up holy books.

If you take a close look at the movie you will be able to see a lot of parallels between the society there and the current administration in the US. However since the graphic novel the movie was based upon was written in the 1980's it would more likely compare to the Reagan administration instead of Bush's.	5.0	One word.  Wow!	2007-01-20	8	2	6

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1E6JS6C205VZD	Dr. Laurence Raw	V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source-material and becomes a truly influential piece of work.  Set in a Fascist Great Britain following the victory of Germany in World War II, it shows the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving) taking revenge on all those government servants and employees who consciously used human beings for experiments, while deliberately creating an epidemic so as to encourage the people to support them.  Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure.  V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process.  With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire - in a deliberate reenactment of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 - V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so-called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power.  If nothing else, we should aim to retain the capacity to disagree with people, even at the cost of our own lives.	5.0	Hugely Influential Version of a Classic Graphic Novel	2013-05-05	1	1	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A11OLVAT5YF20D	Dr. Matthew J. Loop	"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal DVD library! This movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years.

The ""hero"" is a dark vigilante type character who has been victimized by ""the system.""  He is out for revenge, and the powers-that-be in the upper echelons of government had better take heed!Natalie Portman is gorgeous.  Heck, she even looks great bald.  She also has a lot of potential as an actress.  She is perfect as the dark hero's side-kick.  Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.  He shows off the distinctive voice that we were introduced to in THE MATRIX series.On some level, this movie seems to be a subtle attack at the Bush administration and all of the steps it has taken to absorb more power and subtract any sort of congressional oversight.  Cutting away civil liberties in hopes of gaining more security is almost never a good idea. The totalitarian paradigm of ""the ends justify the means of extreme government"" is as alive and well today it has always been.  Just a thought.....In any case, this is a thrilling (albeit dark)  movie that is sure to be a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3ORWAR4CAOPAC	DRob	"Wow! This is a terrific movie, a parable of future history from a liberal viewpoint. Warning- some people may find the movie offensive to their religious and/or political beliefs.However, the movie is the telling of how ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" With an incredibly strong performance by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea, the movie tells of a fascist society that is shaken when a character known only as V blows up the Old Bailey Courthouse while the 1812 Overture plays loudly on the loudspeakers placed throughout the streets of London. Evey (Natalie Portman) is a naf that V (Hugo Weaving) rescues from the guards when they are about to arrest her for violating curfew. Stephen Rea is the police inspector charged with tracking V, and as he trudges through his investigation, his faith in the government and his superiors is destroyed.V and Evey are drawn to each other while Evie is at the same time repelled by him. After he commits a murderous raid on the TV station where Evey works, she saves him from being arrested. He takes her to his hidden bunker and refuses to let her leave. He continues his murderous spree and Evey, in the course of helping him with one of the murders, escapes from him. However, she is soon taken prisoner by the police and tortured while undergoing interrogation about V's whereabouts.The end of the movie is truly stirring and brings to mind the revolutionary march scene from Les Miserables. The earlier scenes between Evey and V are very reminiscent of The Phantom of the Opera, although Evey never does see underneath V's mask. She doesn't need to because by the end of the movie she, and we, learn exactly who V is in a scene that is surely one of the great scenes of movie history.This is not a movie for young children due to scenes of graphic, realistic violence. However, people who are resistant to viewing the movie because it is produced by the same people who produced the Matrix or because they don't like Science Fiction movies or Super Hero movies can put those reservations aside. The movie is in no way a Science Fiction movie or even an action thriller, although there are action scenes in it. To go back to the beginning of this review, the movie is a parable, and one that can be enjoyed even by people who don't like ""genre"" movies."	5.0	Phantom of the Opera Meets Les Miserables	2006-08-09	6	4	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A21Q0BW434RSQM	Dr. Reality	"The are many good things about the movie, but for me, they were overshadowed by the politics.Is the government in ""V"" really a government sort of like our own?  ...a government which controls our minds and uses invasive laws to threaten our freedoms?Those who have a profoundly negative view of modern societies, sympathize largely with anarchists, and enjoyed seeing the White House blow up in ""Independence Day"" may enjoy this film.  But if you see the positive things that western society has accomplished, if you sense that history has been steadily moving in the direction of progress, education, and increasing freedom and prosperity for citizens of 1st World nations (and most others as well), then this movie's prescription for social change through terrorism may seem alarming to you.I was unable to enjoy Vendetta because I feel that it is trying to level undeserved criticism on Western Governments and Liberal Democracy.  The Government in ""V"" is meant, it seems, to be a caricature of the U.S. government...though I find the two hardly similar.Still, I have many friends who see the U.S. government as somewhat like the government depicted in this movie.  They're paranoid about government conspiracies, and if you feel the same way, you may get a kick out of this movie...but I implore you to consider the differences between western governments and the governments that usually oppose them and I hope you will ask yourself which governments the totalitarian state in ""Vendetta"" really resembles.  I feel that any fair interpretation will find the governments of the West to be far freer, but that's me.********************************other thoughtsI think about who might enjoy a movie like this, and this comes to mind:Anti-social peopleTimothy McVeighTim Treadwell (The subject of ""Grizzly Man"")Osama Bin LadenThere are many who, unhappy with modern society, can see only the destruction of it as a remedy.  I see this as frightening and incoherent.What would Martin Luther King Jr. think of this perspective?  What would Gandhi think?  ...and Jesus?Frightening because those who end up doing horrible violent things: Osama Bin Laden, the Columbine Killers, McVeigh...have rationalized their actions along similar logical lines: the oppressing powers are evil, so that justifies any response.But what if people die in the blown up buildings?  What if the act doesn't actually accomplish anything?  What if the murder of all these people is based on political opinions that not everyone agrees with?  Why should people die because some turkey has an opinion?Usually criticisms of the West are based on the opinion that life was better before modern society, or that we had more freedoms once...or that our prosperity is hurting the world...or that life is getting worse and worse...But there are many, many, many people who disagree with this point of view.It is my opinion that this movie advocates violence that no good can come of.  Many many people may disagree with me.  They have that right, but they do not have the right, to blow me up."	1.0	good movie, doesn't share my world view	2006-08-11	100	59	41
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A304NJUUPO8L40	"Dr. Richard Daystrom ""creator, M-5 multitroni..."	I enjoy the sub-genre of apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, or dystopian future fiction, so seeing V for Vendetta was a no-brainer for me.Unfortunately, the things I found distasteful about this movie outweighed any of the positive aspects that other viewers have mentioned (e.g. cautionary tale, visuals, etc.).The comparisons to Orwell's 1984 are appropriate, but Orwell's motives were far more interesting: a committed socialist who warns of a state in which even his own ideals are misused to abuse the population.Portman's Evey is tortured by someone who believes he is teaching her a lesson and seeks her submission and service. Imagine being abducted and tortured by someone who later revealed that it was for your own good and it was only a ruse to convince you of their rightness. Literature that deals with this behavior is usually concerned with sociopaths and killers. Psychologists tell us that some victims of abduction and abuse can indeed demonstrate a loyalty to their abuser. I doubt that extolling a torturer was the intention of the film-makers, so for me their otherwise good intentions were seriously marred by the inclusion of these scenes.The cardboard cutout stereotype of the perverted religious figure was hackneyed and sophomoric long ago. Although, in the spirit of V, I am thankful that we still live in a tolerant society where such stereotyping is permitted.On a lesser point, I felt that Portman's performance was bland and unconvincing, and I think it wasn't necessary in such an international near-future to have her try to approximate an English accent. I found the inconsistent accent distracting.This one is worth a rental, or loan from the public library.	2.0	Disappointing dystopia	2008-06-14	8	4	4

Rumbold	If Ultraviolet is an action flick where you park your brain, V for Vendetta is the movie that makes you engage your brain.Having never read the graphic novel, I am not aware of the differences, but I can say I will read it soon.Howeer this was a policital parable, with layer upon layer of allusion and meaning.However, it is hard to catch on to exactly what parelells to draw.  It is clear the paralells to the Nazis, yet, you can feel that somewhere the director and writers were trying to draw to today and the conditions in the USA.The plot is twisted and layered, but simply put, a virus has struck the world, leaving it chaos.  A dictator has pulled England together, and a la' Big Brother, his will is law.  There are informers on the streets, surveilence vans and censors on TV.  Unfortunately, that isn't too distant from the world both the British and we Americans live in.  And that was my major concern. It is clear the creators wanted to comment on our current state, included the color coded states of curfew - much like homeland security's level of alert.  But they don't go all the way, they continually draw back on the punchHugo Weaving plays the masked V, terrorist/freedom fighter.  The only one willing or able to take on the totalitarian state.  He does so wearing a Guy Fawlkes mask, and uses the Fifth of November to remind people of two very simple principles:1. those who forfeit freedom for security deserve neither and 2. people should not fear their government, government should fear their people.Natalie Portman (rediscovering her ability act post Star Wars) is Evey - a woman swept up into V's life.This movie is rich in historical and literary allusion the way the matrix was rich in philosophical allusion.  From the Phantom of the Opera to the Resistance of the White Rose, from Blake to Shakespeare - well that isn't far!  For that alone, it is a joy. the scarlet pimpernel, Count of Monte Cristo - the list goes onThe action scenes are beautiful and rich.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A84Z6XUMGRMJ1	Duane Thomas	"I have loved V for Vendetta for over 20 years. I first read the story - at least the first 2/3 of it - in 1985 when I bought all 26 issues of Warrior, a black-and-white British anthology magazine. V for Vendetta was originally serialized in Warrior from 1982-'85. V for Vendetta is divided internally into three ""Books"" or acts. Warrior was cancelled right at the end of the second Book. Three years later, DC Comics reunited the series creators, writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd, to finish the story which was published in 10 issues of a monthly comic in 1988-'89, then collected in 1990.V for Vendetta the comic is perhaps the best-written, most emotionally affecting, heart-breaking and involving piece of fiction I've ever read. As many of you already know, Alan Moore tried to block this movie from being made, and had his name removed from its credits. Part of this was because, I'm sure, after reading the script he realized what a turkey it was going to be. Also I suspect Moore was still immensely P.O.ed that the Wachowski brothers' final battle between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix movies was such a blatant rip of the fight between Marvelman and Johnny Bates from Moore's Marvelman. I mean, my God, they didn't even bother to file off the serial numbers. Moore actually ended his relationship with DC Comics when they refused to retract statements (i.e. lies) saying he supported the movie.Within the first few minutes of watching this film, I knew something had gone horribly wrong. Let me make this clear: I'm a comic book fan. Unlike some fans, I don't think you can automatically fault a comics based movie for making changes from the source material. I realize that transferring an idea between media will necessitate changes. Sometimes those changes will even be improvements. (A good example would be the first Spider-Man film. Yes, they made changes to the origin. But in every instance the changes smoothed away logical inconsistencies in the 1962 story.) I **do** think you can fault changes from the source material when what was already there is infinitely better than what it was changed to. Every time there's a change in V for Vendetta the movie, it's for the worse. For instance:Comic: The Voice of Fate is an eerie, disembodied radio personality.Movie: The Voice of Fate is a fat, raving televangelist.Comic: Evey Hammond starts out a weak victim. When accosted by the fingermen, all she can do is whimper and beg for mercy. Evey is a metaphor for the person so beaten down by life, and existence within a totalitarian state, she has no guts, almost no individuality to speak of. At heart V for Vendetta is the story of how V, none too gently, forces Evey to face up to the evil in the world, to care, to find herself, and the strength to fight back. Evey is an experiment for V. Because he believes that inside even a born victim exists a potential hero. You just have to brutalize them enough first. This only works if Evey is weak initially.Movie: Evey is feisty to start with. Which leads to the ludicrous image of Evey, when surrounded by fingermen, threatening them with a canister of pepper spray. What depth! What wit! What garbage. She's supposed to look terrified and helpless - not silly.Comic: While rescuing Evey from the fingermen, V quotes a long passage from Shakespeare's Macbeth which begins, ""The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."" It's witty and literate. (Moore reports his use of this dialogue as one of those bizarre synchronicities that sometimes occurs during writing. A copy of The Collected Works opened at random to a page containing this passage which matched, line for line, the actions he'd already decided on for V in his first clash with the forces of law and order.)Movie: V's speech is alliterative gobbledygook in which he shoehorns in as many words beginning with ""v"" as possible. ""Vichyssoise of villainy,"" indeed.Comic: V taunts and bedevils the fingermen, and sweeps Evey away, in the process killing one of the fingermen with a bomb, leaving appalled survivors staring at the gutted, charred remains of what, but a few seconds before, had been a human being. Admittedly the way he does this (the fingerman grabs V's hand to arrest him, and the fake hand detaches before exploding) is hokey but the nucleus idea of a great scene is there. I would have liked, in the movie, this conflict to be much more brutal - just a bit of tweaking and it could have been great - but that's not what we get, either.Movie: V's fight with the fingermen is a Keystone Kops routine, complete with him pulling one man's pants down around his ankles. It's so bad it's painful to watch.Comic: Evey's first reaction to V is awe. The expression artist David Lloyd puts on her face is rapt, almost mesmerized. One of the creepier things about V for Vendetta is just how easily and instantly V pulls Evey into his world. This goes back to the idea that, to start with, it's almost as though Evey really has no will of her own. It's like she's been waiting to exist, for something, ANYTHING interesting to happen in her life, to wake her up. V might be homicidal and possibly insane - but he's definitely interesting.Movie: Natalie Portman, showing all the emotional range and acting skill of a wooden mannikin, stares at V with an arch ""Who is this freak?"" look on her face. (Or maybe she's just appalled at the dialogue?) Where is the talented actress who showed such immense early promise in The Professional? I ask, because I haven't seen her since. More importantly, where is the awe on Evey's face showing how completely V fascinates her? Natalie's expression in this scene commits the cardinal sin in a comic-to-movie translation: it condescends to the material (like the dropping trousers of a few seconds before), gives the impression ""Yes, we know this is all really rather silly"" during a moment that should be played perfectly straight.You see what I mean? Every change trades emotional depth for shallowness, brutality for slapstick, the weird exchanged for the ludicrous. These are only examples from the movie's first few minutes. I truly got the sense, watching this film, its makers had no real insight beyond a surface level of what was actually happening in the comic, were absolutely clueless regarding the internal dynamics, the deeper issues, that made it great. Rarely has such a bad movie been made from such excellent source material."	1.0	Great Source Material = Horrible Movie	2006-05-01	90	54	36

The main theme of this film is to murder or inflict violence upon everything you disagree with or that is corrupt, evil, or has harmed you.Its a very base and bestial film that hides its true nature wrapped in eloquent British speech and supposedly high ideals. At least films like Hostel have no pretense, it spoonfeeds its audience violence and sadism for enjoyment. But offers no excuses, justifications, or distortions.This film does the same thing but offers self-righteousness to try and persuade the viewer that the course of action taken in the film is the correct one.Hatred and violence is shown in such a casual way in this film that it offers an easy seduction.The worst type of film IMO.	1.0	Ultra-Violence masquerading as a political statement	2007-06-10	144	91	53

Also, the government in this film uses fear to take away the citizens freedoms slowly which our government is trying to do. Now everything that happens in the film is overblown but the same elements from both governments are there. I went to this movie with my father and after we left we were in a pretty deep political conversation, that does not happen very often if ever. All politics aside the film was entertaining and very well acted. All the characters were very rich deep and complex often having a positive side and a negative like real people. There was action in this movie but it will be disapointing for anybody who is going expecting a regular action movie. This was an excellent movie, I can honestly say I have never seen a movie like it. If you can stand the idea of this film challenging the definition of a terrorist than you should see the film.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AWBS5D7SI70S	"E. Day ""ENIGMA"""	Let me first start by saying that i REALLY WANTED TO HATE THIS MOVIE, when i first heard the title, i thought it somewhat weak, then i saw the protagonist hero wore a clown-like mask while fighting evil, which sorry to say really didn't help win me over, and when i heard that the Wachowski Brother's helped put the movie together, my opinion was complete(I'm still boiling over their final installment of the Matrix Trilogy which i enjoyed about as much as inflamed genital boils).However, despite my prejudgment,i must confess this movie is a triumph. Its almost like taking Batman and putting him in a Shakespearean modern conceptualization of George Orwell's 1984.Simply put, the story is a romanticized view of a lone hero set out toward opening the minds of his fellow English brothers and sisters oppressed by a fascist government gone crazy. Although she gets top billing, Natlie Portman provides nothing more than a pretty face and limited acting skills as the sometimes unwilling disciple of V, the blade wielding, eclectic,(possibly sociopathic) protagonist (played by Hugo Weaving, AKA..Mr. Smith from the Matrix trilogy) who more than adequately makes up for Ms. Portmans terribly limited acting skills (sweety you had your five minutes of fame in Star Wars, take it, and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU).The most interesting aspect of the movie, was in how realistic the future painted is, to the life and society we live in today.If you play close attention you will see how the insane fascist dictator seems vaguely familiar to a certain American leader who like in the movie is against homosexuality, has ostracized his nation from the rest of the world, and uses continuous fear to keep his country in line (i.e. 9/11, Bird flu, Axis of evil, and the continuous war on terror)....... but i digress.. no point in beating around the er..um.. BUSH.Another point that should be mentioned is the groundbreaking aspect this movie sets in regards to many action flicks in that it doesn't hold its own on fancy special effect, but on simply an intelligent smart story(sadly a rarity in many action films these days). The weak points i figure can only be seen in that I would have liked to have seen V in more fighting scenes, and the fascist dictators demise at the end seemed a tad anti climatic (sorry for the spoiler). So if you're like me dispel any first rush assumptions you might have had. This movie leaves you with the same message the first MATRIX movie (another triumph by the way) left many with........FREE YOUR MIND.	4.0	Today's movie review was brought to you by the letter V for Vendetta	2006-08-06	3	1	2

Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature ""Matrix"" style and directed by their protege James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets - the government, the media, the terrorists - that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the ""Beauty and the Beast""-cum-""Phantom of the Opera"" connection between V and Evey.On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in ""1984"", John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative filmmaking."	4.0	A for Audacious...B for Execution	2006-03-26	6	3	3

It hints at George Orwell's 1984 and various other Totalitarian State movies but that is not what it is realy about. In the past a Government (read George W Bush), caused a disaster (the attack on the twin towers and the Pentagon), that was supposedly caused by international terrorists (Al-Quada), but as has already been stated it was the countries own Government (read George W Bush), that did it so that they could pass draconian laws (read anti-terror laws), and have a reason to invade other Countries (read Terrorist supporting Countries), by pretending that they were only defending themselves. This is just another looney Conspiracy theory with no evidence to support it but it attracts morons by the bus loads, the only difference with this one is that they managed to make a major movie out of such pig swill. Now look into your conscience and see how you would feel if you lost a loved one to a terrorist attack and some corporate movie conglomorate made a fortune from your loss by twisting the facts to suit an army of idiot conspiracy theorists.	1.0	V is just an Anglisised version of the current Twin Towers Conspiracy Theory that is popular with all the fruitcakes in America!	2007-04-13	45	22	23

Portman I feel is a little flat in her acting, but that's my opinion.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AD6OFAVBJKQ57	Elaine	Being of fan of the Matrix movies and the Wachowski brothers, I was anxious to see this movie. I was very impressed with the style that they created for it. It wasn't the super hero type movie that I thought it might end up, considering what Hollywood does to movies from novels. They actually did a pretty good job not detracting from the real message within the movie.I perhaps expected a bit of the dark undertones as in the cinematography of the movie 1984, but this was completely opposite. It was crisp, the music was enthralling and demanding. It moved fluidly, the cinematography was excellent, and I loved the soundtrack. The actors themselves are perfect for the role - you actually start believing they are who they portray. I thought it a nice touch to see John Hurt in the role of Chancellor - especially since he was Winston in 1984.	5.0	V for Vendetta	2007-11-03	16	13	3

People who liked ""1984"" will love this film; those that didn't, will probably hate it.  It is visually appealing in a very dark way; but then again, if your tastes lean towards lighter, fluffier scenery, you won't agree with my statement.  The actors did a good job, especially Hugo Weaving.  I did have a hard time getting into him at first because of the mask, but after a while, you learn to appreciate it.  This was also one of the better jobs by Natalie Portman in the past few years (although she was good in Garden State - a very good movie btw).Also, this is JUST A MOVIE - made for entertainment.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"I never read the graphic novel that the film ""V for Vendetta"" was based in. I heard about the comparisons to the current political climate but I went into this film as that it was merely entertainment. I did not go in with any pre-conceived notions or political agenda.After the artistically disasterous Matrix trilogy (sorry, all three films were three too many), the Wachowski brothers return to the big screen with a vengenece with the explosive ""V for Vendetta"". The setting takes place in the future where the United States is no longer the lone superpower on the planet and is in a complete disarray. Britain has now taken over the US's role. Along the way John Hurt's character Adam Sutler has risen to power and became a totalitarian dictator. Hugo Weaving plays a mysterious figure named V who hides behind a mask. His intentions are to bring down Adam Sutler and his cronies. Natalie Portman is Evey, a young woman who accidently gets caught up in V's escapades when V rescues her from some strangers who tries to attack her.I enjoyed this film a bit. The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently. It was quite a departure from his villainous role in the Matrix series. I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power). The film isn't completely perfect. I thought some scenes tended to drag on longer than they should have been but overall I enjoyed ""V for Vendetta"" as a whole."	4.0	Thoroughly entertaining	2006-04-22	8	5	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A146D2LYLICNLS	eric_f	"""V for Vendetta"" has become among my favorite films of all time. Finally, a major Hollywood production that's intelligent and whose main focus is the story and not the special effects (usually it's the other way around with this genre). V is the most interesting, mysterious and complex character I've seen in a movie in quite some time, even if we sometimes question his actions. Everything about this movie works IMO. It's stylish, well-acted, dark, intriguing and intelligent. Forget politics - this is a fine piece of filmmaking.And what a great DVD release, with a flawless transfer. I highly recommend investing the extra $ and getting the 2-disc edition. The section on the history of Guy Fawkes is worth the price of admission. And here's how to access the ""Saturday Night Live Digital Short"" Easter Egg:Play the second disc. Click on ""More"" at the bottom to go to the second screen that features the ""Cat Power Montage"" option. Place the ""V"" cursor on the ""Cat Power Montage"" option and press Up.

It's timeless and never needs to be ""updated"" because it's about ideas that are still there today and were there long before the book was written.This film claims to be an update on said story. But aparently update means they must skew a balanced look at polotics as a concept into an onslaught on the bush campaign.

The opening scene flashes back to November 5, 1604 to introduce Guy Fawkes and his plot to blow up Parliament. This event lays the foundation for the rest of the film. The Wachowski brothers take us to futuristic Great Britian under a totalitarian government. They masterfully weave a tale of rebellion focusing on two protagonists- V (Hugo Weaving), and Evey (Natalie Portman). This film does a really good job of developing the characters and moving the plot forward at the same time. The dialogue is incredible - V has some of the wittiest and thought provoking lines/speeches I have heard in any movie. This film is great for people who enjoy movies that make you think. The themes it focuses on include - freedom fighter v. terrorist, rebellion, and fear and freedom.With that being said this movie is not for everyone. It is violent and there are some scenes in a prison/torture that make some people uncomfortable. My wife doesn't really enjoy watching it. This movie is fairly intense so be sure you are up for that before you start it.I enjoy this movie so much and I try to watch it every year around November the 5th. I always come away impressed with the quality of the story, the acting, and the effects. While watching this movie you will realize that V stands for an idea and the idea will be very clear by the final scene. I love the ideas presented in this movie - that is why I watch it again and again.	5.0	Remember, Remember the 5th of November	2013-10-31	0	0	0

I am here to tell my opinion on the whole situation regarding V for Vendetta.Great message. Freedom is a must, and people do have to care to make a change. We have to shake ourselves out of complacency and indifference to make change. We must think for ourselves and regain our humanity.I also agree that the movie is taking a stab at our government, which is neither good nor bad. It is what it is.I am here to just review the art.The story of V for Vendetta is so over-played and over-done, it is just plain annoying. The drama inherent within the movie is cheesy and the whole FREEDOM thing is done out of proportion. Like another reviewer stated, this movie as about revenge, not freedom. There is no freedom in revenge, revenge is another emotion that holds you captive, just like indifference. Therefore, I felt that the message of the movie was largly inconsistant. And throwing in Shakespearian quotes does not make the movie any better.The dialogue is horrible, and the action sequences are yawn inducing. Bullet-time is used again(!) but this time knifes replace bullets.What's the message of the film? Freedom or violence to reach freedom? Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the fact that they used violence to gain freedom in the movie, I just think that many misguided people will take this movie as true and think violence will ""free"" them from their ""oppression"".The writer and directors seem to have executed certain parts to tug at the heart strings of the audience, which failed misrably in my opinion. The writer tries to make a sentimental moment out of every scene, and it just doesn't work.Largly un-original concepts and over-done plot make this a very weak movie that too many people think too highly of, Probably because everyone loves to bash Mr. Bush and America, even if they have no clue as to why they are doing it. But hey, everyone else is:)Don't get me wrong, I am just as anti-anti freedom as any other lover of freedom and humantiy, but just because a movie features action and some guy fighting for freedom, does not make it a great movie.Decent film, worth renting. Provides a nice release to rebel-wannabes who are too afraid to help make change and would rather dream about it, a large reason why things are the way they are:)"	3.0	CLICHE' story line...great message	2006-08-13	14	2	12

This movie is great.  I've never read the graphic novel on which it is based so I don't know how true it is to it(or them?), but I do know this politically charged movie visits some valid points that are or could be problems in today's world.  Some people think it is too political, however, that is not what I got out of the movie.  This movie is a story of a government gone too far and the bonding of a nation to overcome tyranny.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3JD8FDS3CO3GH	FairiesWearBoots8272	I'm very glad to see so many positive reviews for this movie. I was wondering if I was the only one who was in total awe of it. V For Vendetta is simply an amazing movie. I was a bit worried when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers and a first-time director were involved, however within the first ten minutes of the movie my fears were washed away.  V For Vendetta is spectacular in every possible way. From the first scene to the last, the movie is completely gripping and you will not want to look away until the end credits roll. The movie is well-written, well directed and well acted. Everything about it is top-notch. Everything. I can't think of any flaws. I'm sure that there must be one somewhere, but I can't think of any. It's unbelievable that director James McTeigue is a first-timer. The movie is so beautifully and effortlessly directed that you'd assume there must be some seasoned veteran behind the camera.Being that it was based on a graphic novel and produced by the Wachowskis, I wasn't very excited to see it figuring it would be another bloated action-fest with tons of CGI and no story and I'd be bored out of my mind. Boy, was I wrong. For one thing, V For Vendetta is not even an action movie. It has a few action scenes here and there (particularly one Matrix-style scene near the end), however for the most part it's a fantasy/sci-fi/drama. Not being a big action fan I was thrilled by the lack of action scenes. For once we have a comic book movie that is about characters, story and ideas rather than special effects and car chases and fight sequences. The actors are great too. The large, primarily British cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly worth mentioning is Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith in The Matrix). Weaving gives an excellent performance in the movie despite having his face always hidden by a mask. How do you emote without your face being visible? That is the challenge and Hugo succeeds marvelously. Natalie Portman is also very good as V's helper/love interest and John Hurt is venomous as the evil British Chancellor.If only all of the big-budget movies to come out of Hollywood could be HALF as good as this, we'd be in excellent shape. This movie will forever erase the memories of the Matrix sequels from your mind. In fact, V For Vendetta is better than all three Matrix movies put together. Bye bye Neo.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A36GS0XV6BCYFU	Fedor	The original Matrix was a good film. The sequel was worse. The third instalment was worse yet. What made the original Matrix a good film was that it took an interesting idea and dressed it up in a stylish package without trying to be too pretentious or revealing too much. What made the sequels radically inferior was their attempt to develop the ideas further, an attempt which sadly revealed how terribly confused the authors were.V for Vendetta picks up where the last Matrix left of in terms of this unfortunate quality. The film is a collection of a few ideas taken from the popular consciousness and a philosophy text-book that are thrown together in such a way that I doubt that I could have done a cruder job had I set myself that very goal. These are ideas like the subtle tyranny of president Bush, the cruel marginalization of lesbians and homosexuals, the need to deceive those you love, the occasional necessity of inhumane action, and other things of this sort. I am not against these ideas. In themselves, they are interesting. My gripe is that this film manages to ruin almost all of them, though it tries so hard not to.The result is a film that is unwatchable: on the one hand, one cannot watch it as an intelligent film, because it is not an intelligent film; on the other hand, one cannot watch it as a pop-corn flick because it is constantly trying to be intelligent and failing miserably in such a way as to make one cringe more often than not. There is no subtlety as one is hit over the head with one after another underdeveloped idea, even as the customary Hollywood melodramatic nonsense fills the spaces in between.I could go on, but I'd rather spare myself the unpleasant recollection...	1.0	V for vacuous mess	2006-04-02	59	11	48

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AYWAY5MKLAITN	Film Noir Fedora	"""I know what happened; you were afraid. Who wouldn't be?""- VI bring in this qoute from the movie becuase I have to say that this movie totally blows your mind on so many levels. The character known only as ""V"" looks like your simple, reptative man in a mask who is either a superhero or a serial killer. I'm sure that we've all seen that song and dance before. This, in turn, makes moviewatchers afriad to go see the movie thinking that it will be unoriginal and just more of the same nonsense formula that everyonE and their cousin has already seen. This is not true.This story, like a good book, evolves on the screen. It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.When me and my girlfriend first thought of going to see a movie, we both agreed on V for Vendetta in hopes that it would be unique and that it would stand out among all movies made from 1920's--to---2005. And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace. This movie has a life of its own! It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul. The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.After the first viewing, we had to see it again imedietally and . . .were blown away for a second time!This movie, you should know, is not your typical action-movie-superhero story. It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline. The story is mult-layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.The begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way. Period.I have no gripes or any thing bad to say about it becuase for me it is impossible to do so. It just is.Whether you like the movie or hate it; it did its job in making you think. Since that fateful day, and that 8.00 dollar ticket stubb, me and my girlfriend can not shuddap about how fluidly brillant this gem of a movie is!We've seen it three times in all and, in all probability will go see it a fourth and fifth.And we will both own the dvd and watch it until it breaks from lack of oxygen from never leaving our dvd players!To those who don't like the movie I will say that you are entitled to your opinion but I believe that when you invest your time watching a movie . . . your head should be clear, a clean slate, if you will. All political views, likes, dislikes, and moods should be tossed out the car window on your way to the theater.Take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct? There's Batman, Super-man, Spider-man, X-men, many more. Now, when you go to watch any of those seprate movies do you really expect for any of those movies to have character cross-overs or a relation to each other? No. Why? Becuase each of those movies exist in their own little world.V for Vendetta, aside from being the best movie you will ever see in your entire life, has been beaten with remarks and comments that it's attacking political views. No it's not. When you see this movie you must keep an open mind!This is such a good movie, it deserves its own GENRE category!What I liked the most about this film is that it was never corny, but always sly; never stupid, always smart; never overhyped, always reaching expectations; never predictable, always unexpected; never Normal, always original; Characters have scope, they never are two-dimensional.Each frame is like a comic-book panel!This isn't a movie, folks! THIS IS MOVING ART!!!!And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.This movie made me remember the fifth of November and my girlfriend as well. And we will always remember the persona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante ""V"".Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable.IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!!IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!"	5.0	THIS MOVIE OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!	2006-04-17	11	7	4

Maybe I was expecting more Zorro than a politically under toned hero. But once I reread it in the late 90s...I got it! This movie is spot on, in regards to the book. And the director truly pulled off the look and feel of the book in this film. At times the movie may seem to drag, but what you must remember is, this was written at a time when people had patience to read, and a willingness to think. I'm not attacking the current Hollywood mindless romps, but they don't make thought-provoking movies anymore. This movie was based on a thought-provoking comic book, and loosely based on historical occurrences.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1EQGFZPJ4V24X	Frank Scoblete author of Confessions of a Way...	"Starring Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea and Stephen FryIt's the near future and the United States is destroyed by its own greed and all the wars it started. Our focus England has become a fascist state headed by a religious maniac. Gays are hunted and killed - and the Koran is outlawed. One poor gay television producer/host had a secret stash of outlawed art and he also had a Koran. Bad news for him. He's beaten to death by the not-so-secret police. You mustn't have a Koran. The symbol of the new regime is the double-cross.The powerful men in the country all made their money from drug companies. Where else? The drug companies are the great villains of the left - as if they don't hunger for drugs to cure them of their various diseases as do right wingers.Now this is a very good movie about revolutionary zeal in the face of oppression and I recommend it but I have strong intellectual reservations. We don't need to create a Christian, double-crossed, wacko fanatic madman leader of England when the Muslim fascistic movement is in full steam right now across the globe and they are the ones who already have these types of oppressive religio-manic societies. Gays? Where do you think a gay is safer? In a Margaret Thatcher England or in (pick one): Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iran, Iraq or in the communist states of North Korea, Cuba or the dictatorship of China? Where would you rather be gay?The movie suffers in my view with being way too knee-jerk leftist - as if blowing up England's Parliament, the movie's spectacular climax, means that ""we the people"" will have more power when in fact without the parliaments of the world, ""we the people"" usually get our buttocks kicked. And the drug companies! Are they villains again? Are drug companies the enemy of the people? I take drugs created by drug companies that have saved my life. They aren't villains to me or millions like me who are alive thanks to their research and development.Do we really have to fear the right wings of London politics when the true thugs are plotting explosions on subways and airplanes. The fascists who are about to take over don't use the double-cross as their symbol.In spite of all my objections, this is a stirring movie."	4.0	"""V"" Coulda Been a Contenda"	2006-09-02	6	1	5

It pulled at my heart strings, it made my heart beat quicker with action, it had a certain romance about it, and in these strange times of government power grabs it made me stop and think about the world that is being created by our politicians today.

The result was a ""super virus"" which Sutler's ""spider"" planted at a school, a water supply facility, and a subway station that killed an estimated 100,000 citizens.Of the ""degenerates"" the character ""V"" survives to wreak vengeance of those guilty for both his metamorphosis, the death of a person he held dear, and the biological terror that brought the ""Norsefire Party"" to power.This is a tale of a government founded on conformity and terror as well as that which is required for vengeance and political change.It is well worth not only watching as a movie but as something of a warning, which as ""V"" states, ""should never be forgot""."	5.0	Doubled Up	2010-01-23	1	1	0

In the U.S government is no where near as being evil and controlling. Now a days the threat is different there are nukes and biological weapons therefore we must give up a certain amount of ""personal freedom"" for our safety but we do that with haste and with restraints, the way our government system works a dictatorship wouldnt be able to take place.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ANBQIWHO9JRFS	General Zombie	I was in the middle of writing a long, long review for this, but it sucked, sucked, sucked, so I'll try for something short.  So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good-looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action-thriller-sci-fi kinda thing.  It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.  This comes at the cost of some ideas, yes, which is too bad, but it's a necessary evil and doesn't come with out some benefits.  Personally, I thought the comic was a bit too meandering and lacked sufficient narrative thrust.  That's bound to be a problem much of the time, considering the format, but it's was worse then it needed be.  Still, some good stuff is lost.  I particularly miss V's affinity for anarchy:  Here they really make no mention of this, with the only vestige remaining being his V symbol, which is, of course, a circled anarchy 'A' turned upside down, minus the line across.  He opposes the current government, yes, but there's no discussion of what he'd replace it with.This was written and produced by the Wachowskis, so yes it's got some Matrix-isms, but fewer then plenty of other films, and the dialogue is rarely, though still occasionally, painful.  The action scenes are generally nicely done; I particularly like the one towards the end, which features many slow motion gouts of blood.  So many action movies are tragically bloodless...  The film looks great, creating a plausible near-future Britain  that manages to be very cold and distant without seeming to far removed from reality.  Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V.  He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.  It would've been very easy for him to come across as such.  Portman is acceptable as Evey, and while the performance is hardly stunning there's really nothing wrong with it. (Just further proof of what a godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)  The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.  Interestingly enough, Stephen Rea's Finch, the man who is heading the investigation of V and discovers dangerous governmental secrets in the process, is the major point of identification for the audience. (Or, he was for me.)  I liked him, so it worked, I guess.  Also, I think it's neat that this movie is filled with ugly people, all creased and lumpy and old and with bad teeth.  (Though the one major female character is still very attractive, prior to her hair being cut off, anyway.)  That just happens so rarely.The film perhaps dragged slightly in the final acts, but only briefly.  It's also hurt by a slightly underwhelming and perhaps overly happy conclusion, but how do you finish a story like this anyway?  The ending in the comic wasn't utterly satisfactory either, so while it's different it's a fairly lateral move.The controversy surrouding this film is fairly stupid.  Yes, it's Anti-Bush.  I've encountered anti-Bush sentiments before, however, so I'm not particularly shocked or impressed.  Yeah, the protagonist is a 'terrorist', but that just proves how vague and variable language is.  He blows up a couple of empty buildings and kills some people who wronged him personally all while attacking a government that is legitmately evil and managing to avoid injuring the innocent almost entirely.  In short, he's no more subersive thean a million other film heroes, and less so then plenty.Yeah, I'm done.  An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.  It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.Grade: B	4.0	Solid, Entertaining adaptation	2006-03-17	24	16	8
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2MC4R6XFMPJ0H	George Bailey	"Sections: FILM; ISSUES; REACTIONS.FILMThe film is an acute and welcome departure from the Matrix excesses. The only criticism I have is in the sound production. The multiple plot layers and other aspects emerge through dialogue with sometimes one or two words being of significance. I found it difficult to catch the words in a few spots, and to answer some questions, saw it a second time in IMAX, which was much better overall.The direction is fine. Editing is quite good, especially during the historical background montage scenes. The pacing of the movie is excellent. At over two hours running time, it never dragged. The unfolding of the story through the police investigation helps too. The photography and direction during some of the Evey/V dialogues are also very good.The CGI effects, so ubiquitous in the Matrix films, are kept to a minimum, to good effect. Also, the action scenes, i.e. the blood letting, are a smaller proportion of screen time than would be expected, also to good effect.The sound track is an excellent complement to the visuals. Very atmospheric as well as dramatic, it supports the momentum of the film. The liberties with Tchaikovsky work well and structurally these scenes bookend the film.What really makes the story line work is the acting. Beyond the three key characters of V, Evey and the detective Finch, the other parts are relatively leaner and several are short lived. Having an excellent ensemble of actors for these parts is a real treat, especially Robert Allam's Prothero, John Standing's Lilliman and Sinead Cusack's very touching Delia Surridge. John Hurt is very fine and Stephen Rea does an excellent job of keeping the development on track.Natalie Portman's Evey is solidly good, but not extraordinary in my view. The affected English accent wobbles a bit between parts of England and occasionally crosses borders. Much has been made of her having her head shaved in the film. It works and her performance during that scene works well, if you keep in mind she was born and raised in Israel. Her physical stature is a bit problematic in being so waif-like, she has no where to go in terms of showing the effects of her imprisonment, but this is a minor point. Just praise has to be given for her scenes with V, as she cannot act off the expressions of the other actor. Lastly, she does a good job of evolving from a more childlike innocent in the beginning of the film, to a much more seasoned character by the end.Kudos go to Hugo Weaving. It is hard to imagine another actor pulling off this role. It would certainly be a very different V if (say) Sylvester Stallone was in the part. Weaving's voice is one of his strongest tools as he demonstrated as Agent Smith in the Matrix series. The vocal one-dimensionality of that role is dispensed with in V. With material from Shakespeare and uniformly well written dialogue, he has ample opportunity to display his mellifluous range. As he re voiced the scenes after they were shot, he had the opportunity for nuance that might not have been achievable with set microphones. Volumes are spoken sometimes with the fewest words as in one incredibly atmospheric scene (D: ""Is it meaningless to apologize?"" V: ""Never"") or between Evey and V (E: ""You knew her?"" V: ""Mmmmm"").But the voice is not everything. The body language and mannerisms work tremendously well with the voice. Which brings up the mask. (Terrific costume conception, i.e. hat, wig and cape.) The voice, body language and the mask create a unique character. Eye movement or anything else would have diluted the effect. With only voice and body, you end up looking at the mask and looking for an expression, at times almost seeing one. The shrugged shoulders during the rooftop conducting scene have you imagining a conductor's expression of eyes closed in musical passion. Similarly, when V relates to Evey his moment of personal breakthrough, the mask seems to come alive. A very interesting aspect of the mask, the other side of it hiding meaning in the dialogue, is that allows for ambiguity. A facial expression often explains a statement, but this makes V the more enigmatic. The mask also makes V iconic and more than human, an idea or ideal. V, in his last scene has the same appearance as always, and we think of him as unchanged.ISSUESFreedom fighter or terrorist. Both are clearly in the film. In the TV skit scene, the film makers identify the terrorist. Is V a terrorist? I would say no, although the government continually refers to him as one. He is a revenge seeker, but that is a positive quality in American cinema. My old dog-eared Webster defines terror as a state of intense fear and terrorism as the systematic use of terror especially for coercion. The population in the film, who would appear never to be even scratched (V explicitly states it is the symbol of Parliament that is his target.) seem never to be the least bit frightened and are in fact portrayed as becoming progressively supportive of V. The only people who realize intense fear from V are the government characters. (This might be a more difficult question about the graphic novel, with which I am unfamiliar.)Pro Liberal/Anti Republican? Don't think so. I never heard mentioned anything about fiscal responsibility, size of government, government sponsored medical benefits, free trade/protectionism, social safety nets, trade deficits, strength of currency, labor, taxation, pro life/choice, but to name a few topics. Is it anti Bush? The name never appeared in the film and little reference is made to America aside from ""America's war"" having gone rather poorly. As has been pointed out many places, the source novel on which the film is based was attacking the England of the Thatcher era and the screenplay began before the Matrix series. The film is certainly critical of censorship, government control of media, intolerance, lack of political process, kidnapping, torture, popular complacency and authoritarianism. If you feel any of those things are part of the Bush/Republican administration's policies, then it is understandable how you might be offended. (I alwasy thought black bag was a fashion accessory.)REACTIONSThe trailer for this film as well as it being a Wachowski product probably made most people think it was a continuation on the Matrix trajectory. Frankly, I thought the trailer appeared rather silly. Expecting a couple of hours of action distraction that I felt reasonably confident would not be a complete disappointment since both viewer and critic reviews in Yahoo were B's, why not take a chance? I had not read any reviews so the real tone of the film would be a surprise. And once the V character embarked on his alliterative soliloquy early on, it was pretty clear that I was not going to get what I expected. Some reviewers, particularly those whose saliva is not clear, angrily accused the producers of a bait and switch promotional campaign. Perhaps. Certainly not a marketing sin.An interesting observation on Yahoo reviews. There is almost no middle ground. Either you loved it (A/A+) as thoughtful and provocative or you loathed it (F) and venomously, I am sure hypertensively and with Cap Locks on (and Spell Checker off), denounced its political disposition as anti Bush/Republican pro liberal propaganda of a bovine nature, being an al Qaeda training film (never made that connection), pro gay, anti Christian/ pro Muslim, and on and on. This apparently was enough to give the grade of F for Direction, Visuals and Acting. Interesting.According to the advertisements, the film is rated R for strong violence and some language. In one viewer's comments, he/she was so incensed about the presumed promotion of homosexuality that they implored you ""DO NOT SEE THIS GAY MOVIE"". To offer proof of the earnestness of their conviction, the reviewer went on to say that because of this, his/her six year old daughter cried for several nights after seeing the movie. Under 17 accompanied by adult caveat aside, now that's concern for family values."	5.0	Mesmerizing and provocative....and not much rabid propaganda at all.	2006-03-27	13	10	3

At first, I wondered what it all was about, but I quickly got involved in the story!  Similar to 1984 and other ""futuristic"" scenarios where the earth or various countries have a top-to-bottom make-over, and a super hero emerges to restore the people's power and goodness!  One problem I personally have is that movies of this genre usually make the group or govt. that wants to restore order to a decadent culture gone mad, into the bad guys because they do want to restore decency.  Other than that, i.e., if you are conservative and would LIKE some decency restored, and you don't like to be portrayed as some right-wing religious nutcase for wanting this done, you will probably like this story."	5.0	DVD review	2007-07-14	6	3	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A15Q9YEG1XPEJN	Get What We Give	V for Vendetta will not be a film that everyone will see. It is, however, a film that everyone SHOULD see.If this film didn't have source material that it is fairly faithful to, I'd say that the filmmakers wrote the script based on events of the last five years. That's how timely it is.Known to the public as a terrorist, V, is a man who dons a Guy Fawkes mask and costume and attempts to bring about a revolution in a near-future England. Along the way he befriends a young woman - Evey (Natalie Portman) - who inadvertantly becomes his friend.V for Vendetta is a very British film and that is a good thing. The cast is very British and very well schooled in their craft as character actors. As a result, the film is exciting, clean, crisp, and invigorating when it should be and dramatic and engaging when it should be.The script is tight and well written. The content....well, it's amazing how timely it truly is.V is the ultimate anti-hero. Sure, he is acting outside the law and performing acts that would constitute terrorism, but we must remember that the U.S. was founded on similar acts: the Boston Tea Party, the Revolutionary War, etc.This film is about change and how it is necessary for people to take their blinders off and see what is wrong in the world and actively participate in making the change come about.Amazing film!	4.0	Incredible film and amazingly timely as well	2006-04-24	15	11	4
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1KMRYYAHHN4JY	"G. Foard ""G.F."""	"Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V for Vendetta at its core is a story about Humanity.  It is about the greed, corruption, and inhuman approach to civilization and the self-aware awakening of those whom once thought themselves too small to make a difference.In short, the performances are almost entirely flawless, save for a few instances of dialogue that leaves something to be desired.  The production quality truly shows in fantastic environments and views of tomorrow's London.  James McTeigue paved the way for an outstanding feature with far too little recognition for what it represents.You do not have to be an activist or part of the underground intelligencia to enjoy this film, but most certainly you will enjoy it more if you understand the message.  Through its action, its clever use of cunning dialogue, and its pro-Humanist message, practically anyone can get behind this modern day Zorro.The film and book both serve inspirations to the ""anarchic terrorist"" organizations of the modern western world.  But make no mistake, the book, movie and dis-organizations inspired by the story are by no means pro-anarchy; they are pro-Human.  The message is change through crowd-sourced cooperation for the greater good, and to prevent the few from ruling the many.Final word: #antisec"	5.0	A Film for the Information Age	2011-07-15	2	2	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A17IW44FV0HUTY	Glen Engel Cox	"Missed this one in the theater and it finally came up in the Netflix queue. As seems to be the case with movies made from graphic novels these days, the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the visual style of the comic while not necessarily retaining the story or underlying meaning. This was even more egregious in this case, where V is portrayed as a heroic figure whose victimization justifies the means by which he extracts his revenge with the added bonus of freeing the enslaved citizens of a nation. Sorry, but I think I understand why Alan Moore chose to remove his credit from the movie: in the graphic novel, the ending is ambiguous and serves to underscore the question of whether the means ever justifies the ends. The most effective sequence is Evie's torture and subsequent ""freedom,"" but the film breaks down in the last fifteen minutes where the directors fall back on hoary blockbuster tropes with slow-motion mega-violence and big blow-'em-ups. For a movie that wants you to take it seriously as part criticism of where the U.S. and the U.K. might be headed in the name of fighting terrorism, the ending betrays any thoughtfulness for spectacle. Disappointing, to say the least. It's not the fault of any of the actors, who were uniformly wonderful, including the understated Stephen Rea as the inspector. This flub has to be laid solely on the screenwriters and directors."	3.0	Great 3/4 of a movie, with a flawed ending	2007-03-06	9	2	7
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3MOUNGSCHPJBM	"Glen G. Boyd ""http://theglenblog.blogspot.com"""	"One of the most unexpectedly pleasant movie surprises I've had this year was the Wachowski Brothers' brilliant screen adaptation of the DC Comics graphic novel, V For Vendetta.It's not often you find yourself somewhat moved by something advertised as a Hollywood popcorn action movie, but V For Vendetta had that exact effect on me. After seeing the movie (twice), I bought the graphic novel and devoured it in about a day.You see, even if it has been somewhat cleverly dressed up as a Hollywood popcorn movie, V For Vendetta is clearly a movie with a point to make. It's a story that has been told numerous times before (though not nearly enough lately given the times we live in) of the people rising up against an oppressive government. The closest comparison you would find in literature would be something like George Orwell's 1984.The paradox of V For Vendetta lies in it's hero and central character, the mysterious (and sympathetic) masked terrorist known only as ""V,"" expertly played beneath the mask by Hugo Weaving.V is something of a cross between the masked serial killers of slasher fare, like Friday the 13th and Halloween, and the avenging angels of Reagan-era action movies like RoboCop and The Terminator. But in between blowing up government buildings to symphonic soundtracks and slicing and dicing his enemies with his ever so trusty knives, V is also something of a renaissance man.He quotes Shakespeare, lives in a crypt like underground ""Shadow Gallery"" filled with priceless artifacts banned by the government, and dances alone to the torchy slow jazz songs on his own personal jukebox.But ""V"" is no angel.Make no mistake about it. ""V"" is a terrorist who has a vendetta with an agenda, which is what makes this such a fascinating film. You see, ""V"" is a sympathetic terrorist. Remember that scene in the movie ""Independence Day"" when the aliens blew up the White House? That scene actually had movie audiences cheering in the theatres. When V blows up the British Parliament, you likewise actually find yourself cheering him on, which is no small accomplishment given the post 9/11 era in which we live.In a not too distant future, America has been destroyed by civil war and England is ruled by the iron fist of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt, who ironically played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of Orwell's 1984), with the aid of jackbooted goons called ""The Fingermen,"" headed up by a very nasty guy named Creedy.As the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that the rise to power of Sutler, Creedy, and company comes through the exploitation of fear created by a national crisis that, as it turns out, they manufactured themselves. This may all sound quite familiar if you follow the various conspiracy theories floating about on the Internet about 9/11.Anyway, it turns out that ""V"" was rounded up with the rest of the minorities, homosexuals, and other undesirables and placed in an internment camp once the goons took over. In the internment camp, some very nasty medical experiments took place which V survived. And now, V is pissed.After he rescues damsel in distress Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), an employee of the state run propaganda television network, from an attempted rape by a couple of the Fingermen goons, ""V"" takes her to the rooftops to watch him blow up a government building.""Do you like music?"" V asks Evey in one of this film's several great lines of dialogue as the 1812 Overture blares the soundtrack to the fireworks over loud speakers in the streets.But V is just getting warmed up.Turns out ""V"" has taken a cue from his spiritual mentor, 16th Century Catholic Guy Fawkes (whose mask he wears), and has decided to send a message to his oppressors by blowing up the British Parliament building on November 5th (the anniversary of Fawkes' original attempt to do the same). Leading up to that event, he slices and dices his way through an array of villains ranging from the fascist government's television propaganda mouthpiece to everyone's favorite pedophile Catholic priest.Meanwhile, with the none too subtle assistance of ""V"" himself, Evey has her own spiritual and political epiphany and becomes his accomplice.As I noted above, there are so many great lines of dialogue in this movie. I couldn't begin to note them all, but here are a few of my favorites:""A revolution without dancing isn't one worth having.""""Beneath this mask lies an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.""And my personal favorite:""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.""Though cleverly disguised as a popcorn action picture, V For Vendetta is a movie that makes you think. Even as it entertains you by blowing things up and slicing and dicing it's way through all the bad guys (loved the knife trails in the fight scenes), there is a definite statement being made:Question authority.The double disc DVD comes with some great extras, too. In addition to a short documentary on the making of the film, there are features on the new wave of comics focusing on the eighties and nineties rise of the graphic novels which spawned V For Vendetta, as well as a history piece on the Guy Fawkes backstory which inspired it.V For Vendetta is a thinking man's action picture.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3KGBMSG9ASVL	Gozer	"""V for Vendetta"" is not revolutionary, politically insightful or particularly original, despite the praise it's gotten.The film shows us a society of violent arrests, a big brotheresque government leader who addresses his henchmen over a giant video screen, and shadowy agents conducting surveillance. We're told the people willfully consented to a government that curbs their civil rights. We see troops in vaguely Nazi-looking uniforms parading before an all-powerful ""Chancellor"" and a media that's entirely government-controlled. And the director goes to great lengths to show us the horrors of British dentistry, especially when it comes to the bad guys.The fascit-like state is certainly not new ground for movies, so the twist is V himself -- a terrorist who fights the oppressive system and inspires people to rise up.But aside from a vague flashback in montage form and a few bits of dialogue, we're never told why or how the U.K. became a police state and how people became so frightened they allowed it to happen. This gap in the backstory becomes more obvious when V and the government each broadcast their own alternating propaganda to the British people -- we see a rotating series of shots that involve two or three families in their living rooms, a room full of elderly people in a nursing home, and some football fans in a pub, all watching the propaganda. The film cuts to the same people in the same shots over and over again as various pieces of propaganda are broadcast from opposing sides. The movie wants us to believe it's the future and these people are oppressed, but it looks like present-day England and the people seem to be having a good time -- those scenes could pass for commercials for Ikea or Miller Lite.V's own backstory seems like a bad rip-off of a Wolverine-style scientific experiment gone wrong, right on down to the unintentional side effect of a genetic mutation leading, conveniently, to really awesome superhuman fighting skills. And while the story goes to great lengths to show V as a feared -- but good -- terrorist, it glosses over the thorny issue of how a guy can run around detonating buildings without killing people. It's like the director and writers thought that would be too much moral ambiguity for audiences to chew on. There's also a fleeting reference to ""America's war"" over a visual of what looks like Iraq, and through a series of events the director doesn't explain, the mainland of the U.S. is reduced to smoldering ruins.While the parallels to today's world problems are facile, the acting is strong and the action plays out in a satisfying way. This film is proof that Natalie Portman can be not only credible in a sci-fi flick, but genuinely convincing -- and that the blame for her wooden performances in Star Wars should squarely rest on the shoulders of George Lucas and his ridiculous dialogue. As for Hugo Weaving, it's hard to imagine many other actors would be capable of bringing so much personality to a character who wears a mask for the entire movie. His performance was reminiscent of Edward Norton's masked king in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" except Alan Moore's story gives Weaving more to work with, and Weaving handles it perfectly.Overall, this film is a lot of fun as a sci-fi effort, but it is not the intelligent or profound commentary on society that some people mistake it for."	3.0	Politically superficial, but still fun to watch	2006-03-25	12	3	9

I saw it around seven times in the theater and bought it the day it came out.Although I'd consider myself a left-wing liberal, I don't see how V for Vendetta is instilling anybody with left-wing propaganda.  It is an action movie at its core and the action and drama are amazing.  There is a moral and there is a story, but it is more anti-establishment and pro-anarchy than anything that has to do with American politics.  I should note that the entire movie was made in Germany, set in England, and mentions America's existence only twice.Don't listen to anybody who tells you that it is bashing Republicans in America; those people just missed the entire point of this amazing movie.	5.0	Not as Left-Wing as They'd Like You to Believe	2006-08-03	8	6	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1VJ7HYM1EC94M	"G P Padillo ""paolo"""	"""V for Vendetta"" is going to confuse a lot of people. Nevertheless, and make no mistake about it, this is movie making of the highest order, combining all the finest elements of great storytelling into a potent roller coaster of a movie filled with great action,intellect and above all, ideas.  Its message can - and will - easily be dismissed by naysayers as sophomoric or too ""out there,"" or ""anti-american"" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works.Filled with stereotypes and archetypes, ""V"" is unapologetic in its essaying of morality and in its strongly held sentiment that this tale is ""for the people, by the people.""  Brothers and writers Larry and Andy Wachowski (of Matrix fame) have infused their screenplay with the anger, confusion and hope captured in Alan Moore's original graphic novel - and it's better looking as a result.I truly believe that many who see ""V"" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed.As Evey, Natalie Portman is cast in something of the ""victim"" role, but she makes us route for her, and to her credit she goes beyond that making the transformation of her character not only believable, but in the end, noble.Hugo Weaving - the man behind the mask - gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing.  As ""V"" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that is equal parts savior and villain.The physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not-very-distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio-political corruption and, ultimately, the complacency of its citizens.  Weaving's ""V"" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas - and with the promise and permanancy of change through rebellion and political uprising.Most chillingly, the film invokes the dread once feared in ""1984"" but with a renewed vigor that drives home the horrors Orwell foresaw, and still loom large in our comfy modern world.  Chilling?  You betcha!  For those who know the novel, there is little skimping, and, given the current world situation, one must absolutely applaud the filmmakers for ""going there"" as far as the ending is concerned.  This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.Are there flaws?  Of course there are, but ultimately ""V for Vendetta"" rises far above them in its presentation of a world filled with ideas that have forever been debated, and does it in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind.  Not bad work for a movie.  Actually, it's magnificent."	5.0	V:  Amazing and Thought Provoking Action !	2006-03-16	880	772	108

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA  is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact.  James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving)  appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine.  The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.  One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government.  But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host.  Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film.  The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding!  Grady Harp, August 06	4.0	A Spot-On Movie for our Time	2006-08-03	4	3	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ACYPSCBCH4T3B	Grant	It is hard to start at any particular point in describing V for Vendetta and just what type of movie it is. I could not specify the exact details of what you are supposed to know or comprehend at Vendetta's end. Some may think it was too preachy and some may think it is too sympathetic to the idea of terrorism and some may have thought it just plain sucked. All that aside here is what I thought about the movie. V for Vendetta's premise is somewhat simple to understand at first. It is set in England several years in the future and dark days have befallen the nation as a totalitarian government has taken over and ruled with fear and an iron fist. V the disfigured and vengeful hero who is out to make things right through any means necessary. But as it all unfolds realization quickly strikes that it is not nearly as simple as good versus evil it becomes a question of morality, how far is too far, and what is the justifiable cost of a revolution. Yes the story is grand and very well orchestrated and incredibly thought provoking. The title character V who is played to perfection by Hugo Weaving does a fantastic and memorable job portraying the masked revolutionary with his articulate language and firm belief that change must happen through any means necessary. Natalie Portman, though the painful memories of her playing Padme linger, manages to give a solid performance as Evey who ends up intertwined with V and his actions and is constantly at odds with herself as to whether what V is doing can be justified. One other memorable character in the movie is the detective who at the beginning of the movie is charged with hunting down V and how through his investigation into who V actually is he learns the government he has always been suspicious of yet loyal to has terrible secrets. These 3 characters in particular drive the movie .I wish the movies villains would have been a little better represented. Now what would a Wachowski brother's film be like without terrific action and slick special effects. V for Vendetta delivers big time in this department with terrific explosions and sensational fighting sequences that are brilliantly executed and an absolute blast to watch. The last one in particular truly is something to behold. One other cool aspect of the movie is how V's message spreads throughout the citizen's of England and how they are constantly getting closer and closer to going over the top and how much they want and believe in V's promise of freedom from repression. Though the movie has strong acting and fantastic action the movie would be nothing without the fantastic dialogue that perseveres throughout the entire movie.  Overall V for Vendetta is an excellent movie with superb action sequences and a tantalizing story that could make you question your own beliefs. It should be viewed with an open mind. Vendetta is not by any means perfect but it thoroughly is a fantastic viewing experience that should not be missed.	5.0	Reels you in fast and you are hooked for the whole ride	2006-08-02	1	1	0

Video is crisp and sharp with no dnr too be found, which can sometimes be hard to obtain in a dark film, and this is a very dark film as a whole. Audio is presented in Dolby TRUE hd 5.1, which is very detailed in every area, this film is very dialogue heavy and every word is heard very clearly, when it needs too get loud it does and goes very low in the LFE department.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ	"Grimmy ""Grimmy"""	"I liked the graphic novel. For all its philosophical and historical cluelessness, you could see Moore was an artist who was really trying, although supremely confused. But I just re-watched this, thinking I had enjoyed it somewhat the first time, and it was much less impressive than I remembered.It is so sad to see people praising this movie as ""thoughtful"" or ""smart."" It is a commentary on how badly our educational system has failed them. For those who are cognizant of actual current events and actual history know how muddled and confused this film is. The structure of the film itself is some action punctuating tedious sermons about the dangers of fascism and intolerance. It ""bravely"" casts Christianity as a danger and all others (including Islam) as victims.So this movie is a kind of ""opposite day"" in spades.To expound, anyone paying attention would see that, today, the only religion under constant persecution in mass media and actual, physical threat of death is, in fact, Christianity, from Hollywood to Burma, Africa, and various Communist states. They are routinely slaughtered by the villagefull with nary a peep from the press or the UN. The gay lifestyle is celebrated in the West. Apart from the odd exception, it is in fact Islamists who are burning the Bible and killing infidels. The media is not controlled by Rush Limbaugh, but his opposite numbers, and in staggering array. It is the Bible that gave rise, through long, painful birth pangs, to modern freedom, despite the failings and crimes of its followers, whereas anti-Church Darwinism, which Moore espouses, gave us the horrors of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Che, et al. and their collective massacres, tortures, imprisonments and injustices in the name of progress. (Yep, surprise: the Hitler-Darwin connection is historically unassailable.)Opposite Day, indeed.In this alternate reality, all this is unknown. Indeed, to enjoy this movie, you have to purge your head of these realities. But that aside, and supposing an alternate history to justify this narrative, this film should be tedious even to the most ardent believer of these fictions. It hits you over the head in ham-handed heaviness, over and over again, with these eternal untruths. Long stretches of yakkety-yak to ensure that you are well inculcated with Opposite History are sprinkled liberally. Plot holes abound. Bad guys have protection details outsourced to the Keystone Cops.However, there is redemption. In their earnestness, the writers forgot to excise the pro-2nd Amendment message - governments should fear their peoples. The people should be armed to resist tyranny.Think on this, even if you loved this movie. What if, per this movie, armed, government-backed Limbaughites were knocking on your door in the middle of the night? You would want to be armed. Yes, the 2nd is meant to foil any sort of tyranny, whether from the Right or Left.The rest of this movie is self-righteous sermonizing and violent revenge fantasy. Bags of salt are advised. To those who still think this movie was ""smart"", I would suggest challenging your mind with something likeWhat's So Great about ChristianityorThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions. You may be surprised."	2.0	Preachy and pretentious	2013-01-19	6	2	4

I had the impression that the writers' message was more important than the story itself. Movies like ""American President"" entertain first and make political statements second. Not this one!Artistic entertainment aside, if your Conservative, pass it up. It'll just hurt your feelings and tick you off. You're the bad guy in this movie (and I mean BAD).If you're liberal, watch it. It'll make you feel good, since it's a movie about how evil Conservatives are. It's also about another Revolution to overthrow them.I do suggest that if you do watch it, you should try to borrow a copy.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2LYBWP6Y68YI8	gudfooht	"This isn't a review of the actual film (there are plenty of reviews for that).  I just wanted to give people an idea of what they're buying with this edition so as to avoid any potential disappointment.  The following is an opinionated description of the contents:The DVD package itself is identical to the two-disc widescreen special edition. Thumbs up.The lenticular slipcase has three modes (red circle-V, circle-V in flames, movie poster). The lenticular part is pretty cool.  However, the dimensions of the slipcase are not ideal.  Both the DVD case and the book must be contained inside the slip case to ensure a snug fit and to avoid colapsing the slip case.  Not so great.However, the real sore spot for me is the inclusion of the ""64-page 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel"".  It's not the complete graphic novel, but only the first half or so  (spoiler: it ends when V appears in the coroner's / Larkhill doctor's bedroom). This was no mistake since the last page of the books states ""to be continued in the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel"". Thus, while the marketing blurb is not an outright lie (had I done my homework, I would have known there was no way the graphic novel would fit in 64 pages, and would have thus avoided disappointment), the marketing is indeed misleading. Stating ""Includes the first half of the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel scaled to the size of a DVD case"" would be much more accurate.I would suggest not going out of your way or spending extra money for this edition over the two-disc special edition, unless you're out to collect an abridged version of the graphic novel. If you're interested in the graphic novel proper, I'm sure you'll know where to start your search.Cheers, and I hope this helps."	3.0	Contains Incomplete Graphic Novel	2006-09-15	78	68	10
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A23T23U37ZDZ25	"Guillermo Ruiz Buenrostro ""Quoth, the Raven"""	"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. ""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door, only this, and nothing more.""So I answered the door, and it was a messenger. He handed me a package, made me sign a paper, I hope I wasn't selling my soul or something (I don't have a soul to sell, it will be breach of contract and I may be sued) and he leave as fast as he arrived. So I entered my house, put the package on a coffee table, and forgot it 'till the very next day. And the very next day I remembered the package.Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,in there stepped a stately mask of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door, perched, and sat, and nothing more.It was V's mask. It is a small mask, just the appropriate size for the bust of Pallas I have in my library. So I made Pallas to wear V's mask, and then I enjoyed the movie. Apart from the mask and the movie, the package has a few mementos: four postcard sized posters of the movie, and V's symbol. The second disc includes the making of V, interviews and a lot of stuff, while the movie itself, widescreen, has three languages for audio and closed captioning (French, English and Spanish) allowing me to practice two languages and still enjoy it in my mother tongue. A nice touch. I've framed the lobby cards and they are hanging in my walls. I like them.And V's Mask, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted - nevermore!"	5.0	A true collector's edition	2008-09-06	7	7	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3JH3DP4ZDWJBR	G Wesley	This film is based upon an old DC Comics theme and the screenplay is by the Wachowski Brothers, known for their Matrix series and others. Special Effects are of little importance as the plot and theme of the movie is the main attraction. This movie is about political struggle, social engineering and control. It builds upon one of the least recognized and least understood political concepts, being the power of the people and in a theatric way promotes revolution of the masses.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A17CM8IJ45DVUK	h2o	"So many good things about the movie, but since my opinion is original only in its understanding of politics, let me be brief and to the point.1) The message here, both in timing and design, seems clearly to be a stab at U.S. middle east foreign policy...and as misguided as that policy may be, the U.S. regime is neither terrorist nor totalitarian, and ME terrorists the likes of Al Qaeda and Hezbollah cannot claim a legitimate grievance in the manner that V does in this movie.  V is blaming his own government.  Middle East terrorists blame someone else's government, despite the fact that their own governments are the ones mostly responsible for their problems.2) In a time when the world is consumed by hatred, the answer is peace, not violence.  Infrastructure, not war.3) To suggest that blowing up a building is an appropriate way to make a political statement is dangerously irressponsible in the aftermath of 9/11, unless, or course, we're talking about Osama Bin Laden's house, or better yet, the imperial palace in Saudi Arabia.  Dictators, who block the economic growth of their countries, expel foreign aid workers, confiscate UN food aid, create a state-run media of hate, and waste precious resources on palaces and weapons, these are the guys we need to be taking a scrutinizing look at. They're the ones who are keeping their countries and citizens 200 years behind the rest of the world languishing in the archaic ideologies and conditions that breed terrorism, violence, and war.Okay, so I'm not being brief...THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT EXPLAINEDWhy V for Vendetta misses the mark:For the reasonable and the informed, a piece that plays metaphor with the U.S. and Israel and likens them to terrorist nations (such as the kind we are familiar with in Orwellian fiction) does such a disservice to the truth as to make itself into a menace and impediment to intelligent thought.This is because the U.S. and Israel are more like victims than aggressors, and are therefor more similar to V than to the totalitarian state which is supposed to represent them.1000 years of genocidal racism gave way to the state of Israel in 1948.  Israel is V.  The cultural reaction throughout the Middle East has been the same as it might have been had a group of Mississippian Blacks suddenly formed their own nation in 1950s America.  White America would've invaded and eliminated the threat.  But let's say for a moment that the U.S. was unable to do this.  This is the situation we find in the Middle East in 1948; a system of entrenched racism and beliefs of cultural superiority are challenged when a small minority repulses the genocidally motivated aggression of a seemingly more powerful majority.  Check your history!  (In the Middle East caste system, Jews had no rights, and were called ""Dhimmi"" citizens) Then, the majority, as they might have done to blacks in America, responds with a backlash against Jews throughout the Middle East.  A million Jews are expelled from their homes, their property confiscated...they flee to Israel.  At the same time, roughly the same number of Arab Muslims (700,000) are expelled from the Israeli occupied territories.  Here we come upon the defining moment of the Middle East conflict: Israel absorbs a million Jewish refugees, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria keep the 700,000 Muslim refugees in camps for political reasons (to incite anger against Israel) where they languish until they are finally renamed and reborn: they become Palestinians.  Imagine that the blacks won in our fictional Mississippian Revolution, and expelled the whites.  What if those whites were never allowed to rejoin white society?  What if they were kept in refugee camps for generations?  What emotions would guide their actions?  What would they think of the blacks in Mississippi?  What would they think of the whites who had forsaken them?  How would they view the white regime(s) that were manufacturing/using their plight for political gain?Here we have seen the real nature of the conflict in the Middle East.  A conflict created by Middle East leaders for political gain, to open a gulf of hatred between the East and the West, which can never be filled by violence, but only by empathy, understanding, modernization, prosperity, and the building of infrastructure.  The impediment to this progress being the governments of the Middle East nations themselves."	3.0	Clever Moments, Extremely Misguided Politics	2006-08-09	30	10	20

A Huffman ""haumf"""	As a fan of the original graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, depth and emotional impact of this movie. Americans really need to watch this one (before it is too late), the story about a mysterious hero named V, fighting a facist regime in a future England.The most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state-controlled television station - this speech should be broadcast on American prime-time TV, it gets right to the point.Don't be fooled by the ads for V, it is a drama, not an action film. Stuff does blow up real good but that is not the point of the film. The film's hopeful message that tyrannical governments fall under their own weight, great acting performances and great cinematography make V For Vendetta a winner.	5.0	Amazing, Important Movie.	2006-06-20	13	9	4

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A20FK68BUB1IVA	Happy Reader	"This is a review for ""V For Vendetta - Two-Disc Special Edition"", to give some information on the extras included with the movie.This is one of my family's favorite movies. It's exciting and it's stirring. Comic book but complex. Superbly filmed and acted, but then it had an amazing graphic novel to follow. Here's comments from participants in the DVD extras on this 2-disc Special Edition that echo my feelings about ""V for Vendetta"":Kevin Phipps, supervising art director: ""You don't really know were you are, in terms of time. It's almost as if creativity has stopped."" (extra #1)Daniel McTeigue, director: ""I think it's a political thriller, first and foremost. It is in the superhero genre, but it's also a play on that convention."" (Special Feature)John Hurt, who plays Adam Sutler: ""The themes are serious. I'm not sure the treatment is as serious as that. But on the other hand, if it was as serious as that, I'm not sure that it would reach the amount of people that it's intended to reach."" (Special Feature)Stephen Fry, who plays Dietrich: ""This is a movie about a terrorist. The hero is a terrorist. It's a very good ethical point, because as we all know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" (Special Feature)Indeed, though I root for ""V"", he is not perfect. He wants the populace to stir themselves, stand up for themselves, and take their government back. But not until after he's had his vengeance.DISC NUMBER ONE:1.  The movie. Spoken languages available are the original English and dubbed French.  Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.2.  Special Feature, 31 minutes: ""Freedom Forever! Making V for Vendetta"". This feature and extras 1, 2, and 3 were made at the same time. That is, when someone, such as the director, appears in more than one, you can tell that they were filmed at the same time. The extras compliment each other, rather than repeat each other. Interspersed with the interviews are film clips and production clips, too.Participants include James McTeigue, director, who says, ""I was the assistant director on the Matrix films. To live in the Matrix world is to know the graphic novel world.""DISC NUMBER TWO EXTRAS:1.  ""Designing the Near Future"", 9 minutes. Interesting stuff. The V mask was cast in fiberglass from a clay mold. It took the sculptor several tries. Most of the film was made at the Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. But there were crucial outdoor scenes that had to be filmed in England, such as at the end, where the mass of V's converge on Trafalgar Square on the 5th of November. It took 5 months to set up the 3 nights of filming; about 30 agencies/organizations had to give approval and/or co-ordinate.2.  ""Remember Remember: Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot"", 14 minutes. The history of the original gunpowder plot and how it's grown into an annual celebration in England. One interesting comment is by Sinead Cusack, who plays Delia Surridge. She was born in Dalkey, Ireland, and they have a different view of Guy Fawkes there.3.  ""England Prevails: V for Vendetta and The New Wave in Comics"", 24 minutes. This is about the comic book, or graphic novel. The camera-shy Alan Moore does not appear, but David Lloyd, who created the graphics for Moore's narrative, appears in several of the extras.Karen Berger, executive editor of Vertigo, DC's edgier more adult-oriented company says: ""V for Vendetta is in a class of its own. It's a brilliant piece of work. It's a commentary on society. At the time it was written, there was absolutely nothing being done like that.""The original comic book was published in black & white in England. Twenty-six issues were created before the publisher folded. Unfortunately, this was before V's story was finished!  Both Alan Moore and David Lloyd were subsequently hired by DC comics, who saw the genius, and published a complete version of ""V"" in color.4.  Cat Power Montage. This is like a song video. Clips of the movie are shown while Cat Powers sings ""I Found a Reason"", from The Covers Album (2000)5.  Soundtrack album info6.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A18MBO1U4DPY20	Harkanwar Anand	The first half of this film has a great intelligent flow in terms of acting, dialogues, screenplay and background music. I loved V's introduction to the film and his dialogue delivery was very intriguing. Natalie Portman does a good job and she's proved her multidimensional side. This film has a few goofs but I'm not discussing them here, towards the second half it gets draggy and one feels the editing could have done more justice to the climax. The best scenes in the film are the ones where Natalie Portman gets a letter which she reads out and the writers' story of life is relived.Definitely worth a watch in the theater.Overall - 8/10ps - I liked this film more than the newspapers said I would and more than most people did.	4.0	EARNS RESPECT DESPITE CERTAIN GOOF-UPS	2006-04-13	5	3	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3T8T6G9VNL0RJ	Harrison Koehli	"I'll never forget seeing this movie for the first time on the big screen. Being a big fan of the Matrix films, I was eagerly anticipating the Wachowskis' next project. And for the next 130 minutes, I was blown away. Not only was the story intricate and engaging, the acting intense and convincing, the characters sympathetic and human, but the subtext of the film was unbelievable.At several points throughout the film my jaw dropped and I thought, ""Did they just say what I thought they said?"" I walked out of the theater elated and awed at what the filmmakers had created. I even had a moment of delusional optimism: ""Maybe people will GET it! This could be the movie that breaks the door down!"" But, like a sign from the great pessimist in the sky, my wishful thinking was promptly rebuked.Leaving the theater I overheard a man talking with his son. They, too, had just seen the movie. Surely, he had seen what I had seen; heard what I had heard. But no. ""It was a good movie,"" he said. ""But just remember, son, it's a movie, not real life."" I wanted to sock the guy in the face. How could a human see the movie and come away with such a pusillanimous and lily-livered response?What property of human stubbornness and ""thick-skulledness"" can misinterpret the line, ""artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up."" But I should know better. The human mind has a hyperactive and tenacious tendency to avoid uncomfortable conclusions.  Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme. If believing two contradictory pieces of information at the same time can prevent one from accepting an uncomfortable truth, our subconscious is more than willing to give us a hand.""No son, our government would never do such a thing."" Bollocks.V for Vendetta is a no-holds-barred condemnation of the creeping fascism that has infected both the American and British systems of government; of their repeated use of false-flag operations to cow their populations into blind and terror-based submission; the presence of psychopathic individuals in said governments and all the implications that follow from that point."	5.0	Truth in the form of a lie	2007-11-03	19	15	4

But it gives us hope that a few brave people can shake the sheep out of their bleating complacency and actually stop letting manufactured false fear be their true dictator.

Four centuries later, V made his appearance. This smart plot combined clever and timely the ancestral legend of the Phantom Opera, the famous Count of Monte Christ, and through a wise game of crossed words and an admirable use of the semiotic, produced an underworld hero, ""V"" . curiously V was the signal of victory used by Churchill, but besides it might be regarded vengeance, virus and violence, who emerges from the sashes and the forgetfulness, who makes a smart plan after a terrible disgrace on Queen Mary's Hospital, as consequence of a failed experiment.In this sense, one might affirm the urban legend follows the mythical traces where the bad guys belong to the highest sphere of the government, featured by a visible Nazi taste (once more the semiotic lexicon, the use of the flags, the huge manifestations of submission and febrile obedience before the shelter state, the figure of the First Chancellor, who never talks directly to his subordinates, with clear reminiscences of George Orwell's 1984's Big brother)The rest of the movie runs for you, marvellously edited, magisterially filmed and supported by a tense and unpredictable script will lead the spectator to a chilling and surprising climax, with the accords of 1812 Overture, another semiotic element of well known historical transcendence.Natalie Portman once more carves in relief her outstanding skills as character actress, Hugh Weaving as V gives a very convincing role and finally the emblematic John Hurt (who precisely was part of the cast of 1984) as the hated Chancellor conform a well-rounded film that will reward even the most exigent of the spectators.To my mind, this movie must be included among the most emblematic cult movies of this raising century."	5.0	The fear is the oxygen of the extortion!	2008-02-06	5	1	4

He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor. There are not a great many other actors who can emote that much feeling even sans masks! And his voice! It sends chills through me every time I hear it. I truly fell in love with V.Natalie Portman is magnificent as well. She is so beautiful and a natural actress. Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit. Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.""***Hugo Weaving is magnificent. And I must agree with the aforementioned poster. He wove you into his pain and the love he had for Evey. It is a love story in the same vein as Phantom of the Opera.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ALN0EWN0NKQAO	Hughjazz	This movie is a wakeup call.  Not to say that in this great nation of ours that we are headed towards the wrong way or the right way.  Just that we as a society have fallen asleep at the wheel.  It was said that every 20 years or so that a revolution needs to take place so that politicians understand that they work for the people and not the other way around.  Move has great meaning.  Some people might not like it or might need to watch it twice to grasp all that happens.  I love this movie!The premise of the movie is a bit like George Orwell's 1984 - the government needs to control its people and owns the news stations that report propaganda to the people.  It later comes out that certain people in the government have been terrorizing the people to take away their civil liberties.  This masked man (who was a government test subject - but survived) is out to help inform the public.  It's a matter of if he can get the public to support his revolution.  That as much as I should say to not spoil the story.	5.0	Love this Movie	2008-02-18	6	1	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1QP5VCWEL1LHD	"Humberto Mejia ""Still alive and kicking"""	"This is a pleasant, provocative movie that is either an insult or satyre,  that I  have not discovered, or a manifestation of the collective aspirations of british fascism... as I learned by reading other reviewers, this movie comes from a graphic novel, so it does come from fertile ground for uncovering or exposing dark truths.Ideally this review should be read by having Pink Floyd's ""Waiting for the worms""  (from The Wall) as background and melody that repeats at certain intervals.""Would you like to see BritanniaRule again, my friend?All you have to do is follow the worms.Would you like to send our colored cousinsHome again, my friend?All you have to do is follow the worms.""So we are in Britannia some 30 years from present day. Unlike 1984, the dystopia state ruled by a fascist dictator (ironically played by John Hurt, which we all remember as Winston Smith in 1984 a movie censored nowdays) except that we are in a prosperous setting. If you look closely, this is not the multi-cultural London we know, if fact, this is a state where traditional anglo saxon virtues have been restored, it is George Bush's and all the neo conservatives dream land. What happened to the US? To me it was unclear, though a reviewer says that a brief hint in the movies makes it seem like it was destroyed in a civil war.Britannia is at this state in peace, the terrorist attacks of the past and the ""dark years that followed"" where unexplained purges took place, foreigners, islamics, homosexuals, dissenters were ""relocated"", disappeared or subjected to a series  of nazi like  human experiments where our mask hero seems to have acquired his feline, supernatural talents.Just for this setting, the movie should inspire us to reflect about the manipulative campaign of fear that today the USA and other powers are resorting to flirting with totalitarian ""selective"" methods. It is the Hobbean ruler that takes over the mind of the collective, which infinitely prefers totalitarism over anarchy. Even though the movie fails to create a coherent message of the rise of the new British fascism (apparently the only good thing that came out of this was the suppression of that bloody monarchy and all the pomp and circumstance that comes with it)  it does a good job at hinting, and showing us how over with time, homosexuals were persecuted, and islamophobic culture was instated, etc. (the racial cleansing or departures was apparently taboo even in this kind of setting, well, it is still Hollywood produced).But wait, our hero while using an English complot inspiration (some fellow who tried to blow up the parliament in the 17th century) is really a republican, Jeffersonian inspired... by being able to take over the only tv station in Britannia, he manages to wake up the conscience of the dormant herds that now yawn at their complacency in totalitarism, by inviting them for a sort of ""peaceful and collective"" resistance to the regime.When the bull smells, it smells, and the brits recognize the bull that the regime says right away, our hero is able to carry out his Count-of-Montecristo revenge against those who wronged him revelaing the putrid state of religion high rankers, scientist, etc. He picks up a girl (Portman) and teaches her how to face her fears until true courage emerges from the depths of despair.. in here there is a message to the young that is very appealing and I guess why the movie is so popular for the young (Note- if you are young and do not understand this review, read some books and get the facts before you start spewing out offensive comments, valid if you are old too).The message of hope spreads like wildfire and the promise to start a new order is achieved in a way that is rather weak to me, for the blowing of the parliament seems more like a terrorist dream than a protest that the true power resides in the people... the problems that the revolting brits do not seem to have much republican enthusiasm.So if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want  some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea."	3.0	Political Satyre ?

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A36UL77JYI2JBB	IamJ	"When I first saw the title, I thought this movie was about someone avenging someone else. My guess was half right. This unknown man in mask who calls himself, ""V"" tried to blow up the Parliament building, as the original Guy Fawkes tried and failed the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Other than this movie taking place in England, the time period of this movie is the near future in 2035. Somehow this movie shows how this world may turn into: People live under censorship and surveillance, the mainstream media is blurred from truth, no one is allowed to criticize their own government, and the protective government became the so called, ""Big Brothers."" I pretty hope that things will not be like this and turn out in better ways. I believe that this movie, to go back to the topic, tried to enlighten the people. This ""V"" was trying to open the eyes of people to stop being ignorant and stand up against their corrupt government and watch as V blows up the Parliament building as a symbol of ending their current regime. The lessons of this movie are certainly not to stand up as masked vigilante to blow up the Parliament building. The real lesson would be for people to actually act as people of democracy and stand up for their rights and freedom from those who wants to take them away."	5.0	My guess and My take on this movie...	2012-05-31	1	1	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	"This could be the most dangerous movies of 2006.  How is that?  Well, for one thing it's main charachter is what you could call a terrorist.  Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.  If nothing else, V for Vendetta is the film that revolves around Benjamin Franklin's saying, ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""V for Vendetta (VFV) is a creepy movie.  How so?  It shows just what could happen if Hitler and the Nazis suddenly returned, regained power and established a new dictatorship governement.  It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.  The government is made up of cold and emotionless police and government agents who do thier job (kidnappings, beatings, etc.) with chilling efficency.  Propoganda is played on the television.  Curfews are in effect every night.  And let's not even start talking about the detainment centers...Seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.  It resembles our current state of affairs pretty well, except for all the nasty dictator stuff.  The arrest scenes (where police break into homes and carry away ordinary people) are downright chilling.  This is NOT a place you want to live.  Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.  The story takes place sometime in the early-mid twenty first century.  The united states has broken up into civil war over the war in the middle east which has lasted for decades.  Religious fanatics have poisioned thousands in Briton.  The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).  At one point early on, V (the title charachter) tells the public to simply look in a mirror to see who is responsible for what has happened.It is because of this that VFV is a warning to us, that if we give in to fear, this just might happen.  But it doesn't stop there.  Oh, no, it doesn't stop there by a long shot.VFV is very deep on many levels.  When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.  When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.  In many ways VFV is like the first matrix movie.  The deeper you go into the rabbit hole, the more you are going to find. There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much).Arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.  Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.  V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh-so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).  His actions make him a Han solo charachter, not totally good, not totally bad.  He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.  Which one is he?  The movie lets you decide that for yourself, though it does lean towards freedom fighter.  With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch.The movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.  Because religious fanatics (the film does not say what faith these fanatics were) have apparently done so much damage that religions are now completly banned.  The issue of how homosexuals are treated is truly disturbing.  In this horrible future, homosexuals are routinely arrested and have all sorts of...well, i'll let you see for yourself. It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty.While VFV may be a movie about revolution, dont go in expecting lots of action.  This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.  That's not to say that there is no action, for there are some really well done sequences (especially a big fight near the end where V really gets to show off his fighting ability with knives).  There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself.Even with all the gloominess and dictatorship going around, VFV does have some very effective humor sprinkled in.  There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.  It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself.In the end, VFV is a movie about ideas.  What can happen to those who are afraid, and how ideas are things that you cannot control or kill (""Underneath this mask is a face and underneath that is muscles and bone.  Yet I am more then that"").  It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.  Highly recommended."	5.0	A powerful film with a chilling warning	2006-03-22	14	10	4

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A192KEPM0HW6AC	"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e..."	"Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking--though unintentionally so--is V for Vendetta, the latest installment of the Wachowski brothers's downward slide into formulaic banality. Directed by James McTeigue, the veteran first assistant director of such fare as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Matrix trilogy, V is his first directing effort in which nobody but himself can be blamed for monumental ineptness.Upon its release, V for Vendetta sparked a lot of debate among libertarians and Objectivists about its anarchistic and nihilistic themes, and from that vantage point I was prepared to write this review. Easier said than done. After viewing nearly all four hours of this CGI special effects extravaganza (during which, inexplicably, the hands on my watch moved only two hours and twelve minutes), I scarcely found any dialogue coherent enough to be debated.Set in the England of the future, V for Vendetta centers around its ""hero,"" V, played by Hugo Weaving. V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing ""Cry Me a River""?), who surrounds himself with now-banned books. For you see, the great Fortress has been taken over by ""Norsefire,"" a fascist theocracy. Its leader, Chancellor Adam Sutler, is a neo-conservative turned Big Brother, played by John Hurt. Just so the subtle novelty of a fuming and spitting despot who governs by Jumbotron isn't lost on the viewer, the makeup people made certain to give Hurt a shortish-cropped mustache and a slicked-back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love.Against this repressive backdrop, V nurses a four-hundred-year-old chip on his shoulder about the hanging of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the British Parliament. V also has a laundry list of personal grudges: he survived a secret government biological warfare experiment gone awry, as well as burns over one hundred percent of his body.All of this is meant to guarantee the viewer's sympathy for V's sociopathic killing spree as a knife-wielding assassin and mad bomber. After curfew, he prowls London's streets, avenging Norsefire's innocent victims. He hides behind a plaster Guy Fawkes mask, which appears rather stiff, though not as stiff as Weaving's acting.V happens upon our damsel-in-distress, Evey Hammond, played by the waifish Natalie Portman, whom he rescues from a back-alley rape at the hands of the curfew police, in a deftly-choreographed, computer-generated bloodletting by stainless-steel daggers that produce the requisite ""swoosh"" and ""chunk"" sound effects. V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one-hundred-percent body burns. According to the actuarial tables, he shouldn't be moving at all; but that's a moot point.After dispensing with the goon squad, V introduces himself to Evey by way of an alliterative soliloquy containing forty-seven words beginning with the letter ""V."" It's meant to be charming and chivalrous, but comes off more like Snidely Whiplash doing a Jesse Jackson impression. V then asks Evey to accompany him for a night on the town, whereupon he blows up that citadel of British jurisprudence, the Old Bailey. Talk about fireworks on a first date!The next day, the government takes credit for his dynamiting job, claiming that Old Bailey was condemned as unsafe. Unfortunately, another side effect that V suffered in prison was an abiding and strident narcissism; so he takes over television broadcast studios to inform Londoners that he blew up Old Bailey, and that in one year--on the day Guy Fawkes burns in effigy--he will level Parliament. Through another subtle plot twist--Evey just happens to work as a gofer at the TV studio (surprise!)--V manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice. This sets up the tedium that follows, right up to the anticipated anticlimactic climax.V for Vendetta doesn't just rip off George Orwell's 1984; that would imply some sort of thematic unity. Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself. When not squiring Evey about his secret lair a l&aacute; The Phantom of the Opera, V hunts down the bastards responsible for his fate in pale homage to The Count of Monte Cristo, while inciting the people to take back their country in a side plot embarrassingly reminiscent of that other ""V""--the 1983 TV mini-series about invading aliens from outer space. The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too. There's even a flashback that seamlessly melds the innocence of awakening lesbian passion with lush Merchant-Ivory cinematography from the 1920s.Amidst all the slow-mo slicing and dicing, V is fond of chiding his deserving prey that ""ideas do matter."" In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet. The film's tagline--""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""--is a rather Jeffersonian conception that rings with the spirit of limited government.Yet for all its nods to individual liberty, V for Vendetta fetishizes freedom through its direct advocacy of anarchy. Justifying his annihilation of Parliament, V argues that ""the world doesn't need a building, it needs an idea""--patently ignoring the ideas of common law and representative democracy that very building embodies. Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom.This is an obscenity to anyone who remembers his World War II history. From Parliament's halls, Winston Churchill rallied Britons in their ""finest hour"" to face down Hitler's Third Reich on the eve of the Battle of Britain. In their sick revision, however, the Wachowskis defeat the Nazis by leveling Parliament--never mind the fact that the Nazis burned down the Germans' Reichstag to consolidate power.Despite V's pompously vague appeals to the power of ideas, all that viewers are left with is a lot of the moral relativity piffle that leftist professors are so fond of quoting, to the effect that ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Substitute the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for Old Bailey and Parliament, and you'll get the drift of this sickening allegory.Or, to drive the point closer to home, substitute, in Parliament's place, Columbine High School in suburban Denver. Before the murderous rage in which Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris massacred twelve schoolmates and a teacher, they produced an amateur video glorifying their school's wanton and nihilistic destruction.Thankfully, they took their own sorry lives immediately thereafter. Imagine what cinematic epics Klebold and Harris might have scripted from their prison cells. Their insane musings wouldn't have looked much different from this nauseating waste of celluloid."	2.0	V for Vacuous	2007-05-20	31	9	22
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3DGTF9JL8ZCV4	Iodides	If you want to be propagandized for two hours by a pathetically juvenile attempt at glamorizing the extreme left, then go right ahead and watch this dreary and slow moving advertisement for radical leftism. This pathetic storyline does its best to rehash every single stale bit of canard and rhetoric right out of the old socialist democrat playbook of the United States in an obvious attempt to smear; President Bush and his administration, Rush Limbaugh, the military, etcetera.. This movie was an insult to the intelligence of any person who has even a feeble grasp of history, human nature and politics. The blatantly political attack on conservatism falls flat as the writers (propagandists) try to portray the NAZI like government of England as being conservative, anyone who knows their history knows that the NAZI party was entirely socialist, and that all the repressive regimes throughout history have all been socialist/communist dictatorships. My advice is to try reading a history book rather than watching this drivel, you might just learn something.	1.0	Thinly veiled Leftwing Extremist Tripe	2009-09-03	32	9	23

Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always - today - in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer.

V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.The main character, ""V"", is a model for every citizen - unchanged, unhinged, unwavering - he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come. V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that. It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face. Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.It's a great movie that's as important as it is well-made. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film."	5.0	Magnificient	2010-09-14	1	1	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	Before I begin, let me tell you that I WORSHIP this comic series. Alan Moore is a God amongst men. This is the best comic series that has ever been. And may ever be. It doesn't just edge out its competitors (DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, ARKHAM ASYLUM, even Moore's other works like THE KILLING JOKE, WATCHMEN, SWAMP THING, and FROM HELL), it blows them away. The tale is the best example of fiction writing in any category. David Lloyd's art doesn't hurt either. It's brilliant and atmospheric. The writing is supremely intelligent, caustic, incendiary, touching, challenging, disturbing and witty.But here, we're talking about the film.And the film leaves you wanting.I'm not going to get too far into the plot of the film, because everyone else already has. I will, however, go into my criticisms of the film.Obviously, this is going to come under fire from some people who will read this because of the following criticism: Too much has changed from the comic to the screen. Evey's origins, the obliteration of what I believed to be ultimately necessary characters to the tale in the comic, the ridiculous characterization of Adam Sutler (read: [...]) by John Hurt, and the teachings/love/hate between V and Evey.Really, the only scene that works as it was played out in the comic is the incarceration/torture/self-discovery of Evey.The heart of the ideas of the comic are still present, but they are watered down for a more palatable consumption.If you are a lunatic for the comic like I am, you've probably already seen it and feel the same way.If you haven't read the comic, see the film, and at the same time, buy the graphic novel. Get them in the same shipment. Watch the film, then read the graphic novel. And you'll know what I'm talking about.Obviously, we've come a long way from LXG and FROM HELL, but it still needs more Moore.	3.0	The heart is there, but it could have been so much more...	2006-06-27	17	9	8

Interesting that he hooks up with the Wachowski brothers again. After the over hyped over baked and finally collapsed souffle that was Matrix 3 I wouldn't want to associate myself with them anytime soon.Here Mr Weaving spends the entire picture a Guy Faulks mask.  Any lesser actor would have been rendered into a basket case. Without his face to fill in the nuance of his character Weaving must use his voice and body to fill in the blanks.  Well to quote the W ""mission accomplished""Weaving gives voice, passion, soul and believability to V.Weaving is supported by Natalie Portman, forget the poorly drawn caricature that was princess forgettable in Star Wars 1,2 and 3. Given a good premise and real character development  she soars in V. This is because she has real actors to play against and well written script.  Yup sci fi really works when it's not written by a hack who is way too fond of his CGI toys.Let me not forget Steven Rea's contribution either, his world weary Inspector is spot on.  His hound dog face extends to his character hound dog persistence.  While he is there to drive the story along and give some of the background on V he never falls into the realm of cliche.  You feel his pain and understand his persistence.  He is (belatedly) searching for the truth behind his government and ultimately his life.Also contributing to cause it John Hurt and a truly wonderful score.  Set design and lighting are well thought out too.  The lighting has to do double duty as it has to help Weaving express the correct emotion. Remember that Weaving is acting behind a rather silly mask so lighting and cinematography have to be spot on, there is no room for error.The only real weakness in V is the premise itself. No not that the UK has slipped into fascist terror state.  Both the UK and US are just few ""Allah Akbar""s from that terrible future.  No it is that one person in a Guy Faulks mask pulls a somnolent public back to a freedom loving mass of citizenry in only one year.

That being said, this is probably the most offensive adaptation of any Alan Moore story yet. Yes, it's worse than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The Wachowskis and McTeigue nailed the look, but blew the script. While I cannot go into specifics (as they would be major spoilers), suffice it to say, they didn't ""get"" the story Moore wrote. Moore's story dealt with a grey world full of ambiguity and people with good intentions being felled by their own weakness. This is a superhero vs. Hitler. There is no ambiguity. One side is clearly good and the other is clearly evil. Not only that, but there are several scenes that are totally ludicrous in the context of the story (not to spoil anything, but what kind of totalitarian regime cannot even control the state-run media?). Read the book instead, you'll get more out of it and hopefully prevent garbage like the movie from being made."	1.0	Well made film with flaws, but a terrible adaptation...	2006-09-08	180	119	61

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A106016KSI0YQ	Jay Dickson	"The best things in this literate Wachowski brothers' adaptation of the classic Moore/Lloyd graphic novel are its stars, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions.The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous ""1984"" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in ""Triumph of the Will."" The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido ""Guy"" Fawkes."	3.0	Try to Remember the Kind of November	2007-03-19	9	4	5

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Reading ""V for Vendetta"" (the graphic novel) was such an overwhelming experience that one could be forgiven for wishing fervently that a movie adaptation *not* be made. But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes ""V,"" a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another ""November, November, the fifth of the November"" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. ""V"" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.""V for Vendetta"" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as ""V"" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short ""making of"" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, ""V for Vendetta"" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power."	5.0	A Phenomenal Adaptation	2007-11-23	2	0	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	"The movie is visually stunning with some good one-liners. However, there are some real groaners. The movie makes one think about the role of government and the abuse of power. These are good ideas to ponder. The theme of ideas gives to one of the worse groaners. It went something like ""Behind this mask is an idea and ideas are bulletproof."" The other bad line if you stop and think about it is ""It is the government that should be afraid of the people."" What does that really mean? Respect the people, maybe. A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.The movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers. The philosopy is inane. Chaos for chaos sake seems to be the message. There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.The movie is visually stunning, the mask is really cool.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AS28WVBBZ3G99	Jeffrey E Ellis	"V FOR VENDETTA is a cross between The Man in the Iron Mask and Phantom of the Opera. While it purposes to take a serious political tone, it's message of ""It's our differences that make us strong"" seems silly by the end.Democracy has its price. It is the least efficient form of government and is unfair and unjust at times. Free markets are not fair. A market economy is unjust to the disenfranchised. Still, totalitarianism is pure evil and who can suffer it?Not England, according to Vendetta. She finally rebels against the heavy-handed government and its minions. Led by a Quixote-type character in ""V"", the rebel makes good on its suicidal promise to start from scratch. Such is liberty.The larger theme of VENDETTA is hope. Hope gives faith aim. On this point, the message is truly eternal, like love."	4.0	Political. Sensational. Vindictive.	2007-12-11	3	1	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2MNL91I56DX98	Jef Murray	"This film is a sleeper. I don't know why, when it came out, it was not acclaimed by the critics. As I recall, folks claimed that it was too ""heady"", and tried to drive its themes down the viewer's throat a bit too enthusiastically.However, I found the film fascinating, as much for the changes from the graphic novel as for the care taken in its filming, casting, and cinematography. This film is one that will resonate with viewers for a long time after they've watched it. And, unlike the graphic novel, this one ends less ambiguously and with much less angst and more hope.I really can't go into detail on what I liked and why...I just recommend it wholeheartedly. It's violent, but the violence is very stylized, such that even those who are squeamish aren't likely to be as disturbed by the bloodshed as they might be the images of Lark Hill....

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask?This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is. The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout, a few slow moments, and an apocalyptic future setting that really heightens the tension with starkly dark set design and stunning cinematography. There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison in the film. And it made the film even more direct.Hidden behind the creepy mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystrophic future, and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance. Portman on the other hand also excels, with a convincing accent. She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well. The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled. The rest of the film is great in its execution. The climax, especially, was uplifting and will live on to be the most memorable conclusion. The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.I'm going to say that it's nothing short of its brilliance. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure. A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowski's and Silver.	4.0	"""V for Vendetta"" might be a dense name but it's one intelligent film."	2006-08-20	12	6	6

You get the cool fights and explosions with the high def graphics that really make a difference. It has a big cast if your familiar with the British acting scene. It touches on the old subject of take a stand against something that's not right, but a cool and new futuristic spin. It was taken from a graphic novel series so it has a real dark feel.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A18COG93YT10CT	Jeremy C. Johnson	"I am proud to say I have now read the comic and seen this great movie. Other than taking a little artistic license to make the more relevant to today's audience, the writing and direction stayed true to the comic book as far as I'm concerned. Many reviewers have commented that it is a rip off of 1984, but those people should be blaming Alan Moore for that since he wrote the comic, not the Wachowski brothers. While Mr. Moore may not have been happy with the movie, most artistic people are not happy with other people (with different ideas about what their work means) ""messing"" with it. I love the fact that thousands of people can see, read, or hear something and have completely different ideas about what it means. While it has been a couple of years since I read the comic, I thought that the movie illustrated the point of the comic book very well. To me I found the main point to be that people can make a difference if they just stand up. I plan on buying it from Amazon so I can watch it again and again as many times as I want.

I think it is an absolutely wonderful movie: ingenious, imaginative, always exciting, with a breathtaking performance from Natalie Portman, who takes her character through momentous emotional changes and is always riveting to watch. Hugo Weaving is magnificent as the silken-voiced V. John Hurt is marvellously menacing as the High Chancellor and I thought Stephen Fry's performance really moving and highly convincing. The plotting and dialogue are simply splendid. I also loved the early historical enactments to link the modern story with Guy Fawkes.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1O6LR3FPISQBN	J. Fields	I know I'm going to get mass bad votes on my review, but I wanted to put in my 2 cents.As far as the movie goes, the visuals and acting were pretty good.  Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.  I'll only say that if you want to see a good movie about authoritarian rule without all the blatant political propaganda, go rent Equilibrium.  That's a 4-5 star movie.	2.0	Only for the visuals...	2006-09-20	28	14	14

Fortunately, a friend recommended it to me, so I broke out of my usual selections and gave it a shot. This is both an entertaining and thought provoking film, one which shines a revealing light on our own recent and current political climate.If more people would, as I did, take a chance and view this film, they might find themselves having a better appreciation for freedom and see the dangers we succumb to when we willingly sacrifice our liberty for security. This film offers a vision of what occurs when a paternalist government seises ever more power ""for your protection."" We should look at our own politicians skeptically, whether they promise to protect us from the danger of ""terrorists"" or ""greedy capitalists.""

The great Hugo Weaving who played Agent Smith in those films stars here and is excellent considering he wears a mask the whole time. He brings charm and class to the role while also makes you feel bad for anyone who has to cross him. He plays a hero/terrorist trying to find justice in a world controlled by an evil dictator.He isn't your ordinary hero, he doesn't mind killing people what so ever. He goes around killing the people who's fault it is that he got burnt badly and then leaves a rose on their corpse. He gets help from a women played by Natalie Portman who deep down also hates how the world is. Since her parents were taken from her and executed when she was little. Together they try to stop the evil dictator played by John Hurt, as a cop played by Stephen Rea (The Crying Game) trys to track them down and stop V. The movie is dark and very very violent but it also has heart  and a compelling story with romance on the side. It has Natalie Portman giving a better performance than she did in all 3 StarWars prequels. Well although the role is sorta similar to her role in the Professional.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3HH99TE0AB92E	J. Lehman	"Set in a futuristic Britain, the story opens about about the story of Guy Fawkes and his legend. Being an American, I had no clue who Guy Fawkes was or is and if the legend was fabricated or if it really did happen.The movie proceeds with introducing you to Evey (Natalie Portman) and in the background you can hear tirade from the ""Voice of London"" is loud and booming. while Evey looks into a mirror and applies her makeup.I was hooked on this first scene because the ""Voice"" was damning and condemning in all it's viciousness. It makes you think of the facists that are currently beating their bibles over everyones' heads. I enjoyed the entire movie, including Hugo Weaving's (""V"") eloquent speeches and vernacular. I felt Hugo Weaving really was the star and made the ""V"" character come to life in such a vivid form.Here is my favorite quote:""Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.""As much as I love this movie, there was one scene that really didn't belong. Throughout the whole movie, it was philosophical and chilling.There was a ""knife and dagger"" scene (towards the end) that just didn't belong. It belonged more in a horror or action-only film where that sort of thing is expected. But when you have a vengeful hero that has an eloquent dialect, then all of a sudden he turns into a throat slicing, body sawing, (you get the point) You really just want to fast forward through that part. Really, we all see action movies where there is NO plot and the main objective is cool bloody graphics and scenes. This wasn't the movie for it. It was tacky and distasteful.That was the only scene, in my opinion, that felt out of place and out of step with the rest of the movie.I highly recommend it to people who liked 1984 and other similar stories."	4.0	a chilling mirror but a great movie	2006-11-26	0	0	0

Apparently, when Fascism finally comes to Britain its main policy goals will be to outlaw homosexuality and Korans. Naturally, considering this script was written by the perverted Wachowski brothers and based on a comic book by the snake-worshipping degenerate Alan Moore, the guiding philosophies behind their fictional dictatorship is Christianity and conservatism. How utterly asinine. Everyone knows that the road to serfdom is paved with liberal intentions. Tyrannies usually come to power promising Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood, not limited government and an ethos of ""Do Unto Others.""I'd like to see a movie about the thousands of Western European and Canadian men in prison for thought crimes against the Left, such as questioning the official version of the so-called Holocaust, for writing or speaking out against the homosexual agenda or opposing the immigration invasion of their countries. Who knows where such left-wing oppression will end? A Reign of Terror, a Gulag? I look forward to the day when government will start to fear the people, but by diverting attention from the real enemies of freedom, this movie only makes that day more unlikely."	2.0	Lame, boring and politically confused	2008-03-20	20	6	14
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	APNF8LL48VSXH	"J. Michael Shepherd ""isomeraser"""	I found this movie to be intelligent and engaging.  The characters were fascinating, and my only real problem with the movies is that many of them were never really developed or revealed.Several people have mentioned to me that they were outraged that V, the main character, was glorified erroneously, that that the movie glorifies terrorism.  While any person who fights a government with violence might be billed as a terrorist (especially by said governement), V seems to focus all of his retribution on members of, and symbols of the facist regime.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid harm to civilians, and it is that tie to his essential humanity that sets him apart as more than just a terrorist.The dialogue and cinimatography in this movie were beautiful, and I found the story's intelligence a breath of fresh air after the parade of tripe that Hollywood had inundated me with lately.While some of my conservative friends rail against this as anti-bush/republican, and my liberal friends hail this as a return to the sixties, I find myself disagreeing with both sets.  This movie targets totalitarianism and intolerant governments more than any one specific regime, and I found the anti-establishment message harkened far less to the marijuana hazed sixties sentiments than to the American revolutionary war.The message was delivered masterly, and while the movie had its share of violence, it was delivered with tasteful effectiveness instead of the sensory saturation 'gross-out' that marks the average modern action movie.This is a movie that will hopefully make you thoughtfull, and act as a warning to the dangers of doing nothing and allowing any government or group to manipulate you with fear.

He is Great Britain's last hope against a tyranny that has smoothily eased its way into the lives of England's citizens.Of course, revolution is forthcoming, thanks to the acts of our masked hero and his unlikely apprentice. But what about the political bone that is humerously picked throughout the film? Didn't see that one coming, eh?Our persecuted consist of anyone who is not standard, particularly homosexuals and Muslims. And wouldn't you know it, the persecuters are ""deeply religios"" individuals led by their Adolph Hitler lookalike leader.Smell an agenda? Oooooh, but it smells oh so sweet. I have to admit, I laughed at these contrived segments of martyr-mentality propaganda. Islam is under attack. Gays are under attack. I'm sorry, but I don't see this happening in the future. Call me naive, but the world seems quite cozy with both of these groups.  Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and Europe is currently leading the world into the new gay-friendly political scope.I think the overall premise of the film could be a distinct possibility, but the persecuted will be different when that day does arrives. The secondary underlying message of the film is that we should be weary of those who have an anti-gay, anti-Islam agenda.

Sound like a government we know?It's facist Britain in 2020. The United States has fallen into civil war & no longer matters.This seems to raise faintly disguised satisfaction in Britain. There is a terroist in London. He on the side of the people aiming to overthrow the oppressive government. For purpose of this movie, he is the good guy. He is pretty brutal & kills without hesitation, those that he deems, deserve it. He is inspired by Guy Fawkes. He plans to blow up Parliament on September 5. On that day  in 1605, Fawkes was to blow up Parliament. Fawkes was caught, tortured & hung. V wears a mask throughut. Natalie Portman is Evey & she's never been better. V saves her life & shortly she is involved in his activities. Both her parents had been murdered by this government & she has little use for it in any case. He does test her in a way that is cruel but ultimately helps her know her limits. They love each other but it is chaste & borne out of mutual admiration. I really like the whole feel of this movie. It did not feel like a futuristic fantasy. The old newsreels & faux news report made it seem very real.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2MJET8N7S16FM	John Mark	"The truth is that this is a very good movie and has a good message. The problem is that this message can be taken very differently depending on your status. Are you a homosexual or an heterosexual, a republican, or a liberal, a communist, a black person or a white person, an inmigrant an anti-bush or a pro-bush or maybe a huge bush fanatic?Basically, it tells us to fight for our ideals and not let the government opress the people they lead.To some, this movie just might be a huge anti-bush political statement. Some might be bothered by the fact that the movie tells the story as a subplot of two gay persons.Some might even say that this movie is saying that anarchy is the way. But these people forget that we are talking about how ""this non-existent particular"" government ran things. You know: the banning of certain songs, certain books, certain pieces of art, the curfew etc etc all in the name of protecting our dear citizens from ""evil"" points of view (whatever those might be).Like with most movies that carry a message of this class, it is painstakingly disected to find the many controversial points that they can use against it to say that it truly is a horrible movie from the ""cinematographic/entertainmen""t point of view (of course). Does anybody find this a little ""odd"" (I'm afraid to say wrong, cause some one in here might just find it insulting. For the love of God!)Like I said, it really depends on your point of view. A man's terrorist can be another man's freedom fighter. Where do we draw the line?The bottom line is, this movie is really a good one. It has a great script and very good actors. (Some might disagree with me in this particular point, but what do I care.) It has some good lines, good action and a very emotional and political plot. The movie is thought provoking. Is about a government that sought to control the masses by fear. A governemt that controlled the influx of ideas and points of view that they considered ""wrong"". It's about a charecter who takes an approach to stop all of this and tries to make the people remember that they are the ones who decide in what ideal to believe in.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A113EXY3MASTGG	John Schinter	V for Vendetta is an extremely entertaining movie, with a dark character seeking revenge on individuals that deformed him while the government was doing plague research.  His severe burns are the primary reason he wears a mask.  In addition - the main character V (Hugo Weaving) uses extreme acts of violence to encourage anarchy with the public, with the intent to encourage the reversal of laws that have virtually eliminated personal freedom and expression.Similiar to many revenge type movies, V is an intellegent, strong and extremely wealthy individual, and leaves you with the sense that he is mildy disturbed.While pursuing his revenge, V falls in love with Evey (Natalie Portman), and she experiences his passion directly and indirectly.  Evey is not sure whether to love him or fear him.The setting is future England (2020), and is not overly futuristic.  Some of the scenes can be described as extremely violent, but in an artistic way.	5.0	Easy Movie Selection - Good Acting, Dark Setting, and Cerebrel	2006-12-12	6	1	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AY2VITPEE55OM	John Smith	"This movie was so good in so many ways.  Please watch the movie, analyze the writing, acting, cinematography..., then analyze the ""messages""!Disclaimer: I have not read the graphic novel, but I intend to.The acting is first rate. Hugo Weaving was outstanding.  My first thought was, why hire a real actor for a role that never shows his face?.  Then I watched.  Weaving expresses all of V's emotions / thoughts without one actual facial expression.  Phenomenal really.  Must give credit to the directing as well.  It's remarkable.  Even Batman shows some of his face, making facial expressions a partial tool for the actor / directors.  They do it without this option.The writing is first rate.  I'm going to watch it a few more times just for the script.  It's like poetry to me.  The dialog ranks high for me, on scale with a Tarantino film (pick one).  My wife pointed out that, in addition to the spoken word, the lack of speech is also important.  Example is, when V picks up the domino near the end of the movie he says nothing, just gives a look.  Most action movies would have some kind of cheesy line here.  This film needs nothing of the sort.The story was spellbinding and hypnotic.  I had to pay attention to everything because there was a lot going on.  It was as interesting as a David Lynch film, but the story went somewhere and is clear in the end if you pay attention.  I did not move from the couch from start to finish.  Parts of the conspiracy reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK.  Masterful.  I would rank it close to masterpiece.The use of the 1812 overture would be a cliche in most movies, but in this one it's perfect.  One of the most spectacular pieces of music ever written.  How appropriate.The question of politics cannot be avoided.  Clearly it is a film with ""messages"".  This is not a standard action movie.  If you want an action movie, go rent Spiderman!I have watched twice, and must say that Sutler bears little if any likeness to Bush.  Bush is a bumbling idiot and couldn't hold this guys microphone!  Sutler is like Hitler, and if you missed this, you were not watching!!  There are similarities, but my first and overriding thought was of Hitler.I am very right wing on the subject of terrorism.  Yet I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It's not an indictment of Bush specifically.  If this is what you saw, you either were not paying attention, looking for something that was not there, or are very closed minded.  This is much deeper than anti Bush.It is vitally important to continually question our motives, check our ""progress"", review our ""beliefs"".  If you come with an open mind, this film will cause you to do this.  True, the 1984 theme has been used countless times.  That does not take away the validity of using the theme again and again.  In fact, it's important to use it often so we don't wind up like the society in this film."	5.0	Riveting, spectacular.	2006-09-04	14	6	8

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	"V for Vendetta was certainly not what I expected. Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say ""republicans are evil bla bla bla"" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it."	5.0	not what i expected.	2006-08-15	9	5	4
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A33CLVW2K7SL1P	Jonathan Appleseed	"Until reading other reviews on this site, I wasn't aware that ""V for Vendetta"" was adapted from a graphic novel, and certainly not aware that the author/illustrator was unhappy with the finished product. This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn. While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story. The only reason stories (I'm using that as a very broad term) are made into films is because the story invoked passion of some kind in its readers. Too often, Hollywood either doesn't understand what passions were invoked in the reader, how to translate those to film, or dismisses them entirely. However, oftentimes a story is far too complex, contains too many character, too many divergent plot lines, or too many ideas for a proper translation to occur. When that happens, we either find a script that cuts to the core of the story and eliminates anything that isn't absolutely essential to the story. That's where everybody has difficulty. Hollywood and the fans of the story rarely agree on what was left out, what was left in, what was enhanced - what was essential.It seems, according to reviews here, that the film remained essentially true to its core, and trimmed around the edges. That said, many here disagree vehemently.That served me fine. I didn't find gaping holes or questions, and never felt that any plot line was hurried. The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against.""V"" was pursuing two things in the film. 1) To bring down the establishment, which had become increasingly totalitarian, and 2) to make those responsible for his creation pay.Both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature. Some have said that ""V"" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is. This is no Batman, no Spider-Man, and certainly no Superman. He is not a crusader for good, and possesses his own set of ethics - undoubtedly burned into him in his birth. While I personally can't agree with his tactics, I never found myself rooting against him. The ""system"" that was in place was a horrid one, and it did need to be brought down - especially by someone who himself had been ""brought down"" by the system.The acting is first rate, as are the special effects.As I noted in the first paragraph, stories are made into film because the story invoked passion of some sort. This film certainly evoked passion in me. It's a terrifying reminder that totalitarian regimes have existed, that some have been created virtually overnight, and how perilously close we are now to slipping backward, instead of forward."	4.0	A Dance with Vigilantism	2007-01-09	68	54	14

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A75MSQQ3LN86Z	Josef Bush	Accidentally it happens that an innocent and unsuspecting young woman is abducted by a masked terrorist who holds the nation's capital in his grip.  That's it.And this screenplay was written almost ten years before its release.  The Warchawski brothers created THE MATRIX films first.  And in them all, Hugo Weaving; quite a step up, here, in my opinion, from those interminable, overwrought English pixie movies in elfin-babble starring Elija Wood and everybody else but him.No, I don't need to have read any of the Lloyd/Moore graphic novels, I think.  There are so many of these masterpieces of literary comics around nowadays, and everybody's doing them.  But, a movie is still just a shadowplay.  Nevertheless, it is always an event to see John Hurt in anything: The inquisitive First Officer from ALIEN, or THE ELEPHANT MAN, or the distinguished seducer from LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND, or HELLBOY's adoptive earth-father from the movie of the same name, or as the victim/narrator from 1984.  That man's got something hardly any actor has; he can absolutely grip you and convince you of what he's doing within five minutes of any story.  And you absolutely cannot forget him.  Not even remotely attractive, but fascinating.The movie V has (English) political and even historical overtones, based as it is on Guy Fawkes Day -- that's the annual holiday the English celebrate the attempted destruction of Parliament -- but the dotty Baroness Thatcher is gone, nonetheless, though not forgotten, and Britain is now Labor and the flow of cash out of England to Enron in Texas has ceased.  One hopes.  But nobody need be aware of any of that on first watching.  V is very skillfully written, in that regard, so that whatever might slow things down to political mud wrestling is avoided, and the action is allowed to move at a brisk pace.  All the elements of the story; the Dictator and his cronies; the police; the constabulary SWAT goons; the unintended female hostage/victim/accomplice (the sympathetic, winsome Natalie Portman) and her abductor/guru/hero (velvet-voiced Hugo, always in disguise) are in evidence and work as a team to reveal the story as it tightens and coils toward its inevitable end.V is very easy to watch and understand.  Exciting to look at, the story, it seems to me, is a meditation on this proposition:  Cromwell liberated England from its Monarch and its aristocracy, but the Parliament, once it was free to do so sold the people to the nobility which has kept them enslaved ever since.  The pertinent question is, what a nation would England be were the English people free to work for their benefit alone?  And that causes us to wonder what a nation the United States of America would be, were this nation allowed to prosper for the benefit of all its citizens, equally?	5.0	STOP! GO BACK!

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUBFBOXP3SEBT	Joshua Hoffman	My expectations for this movie was not really high at first. My first impression is that it was a cheap movie from all the movie trailers.My expectations were wrong.Although it may not be as deep as the graphic novel, they were able to jam enough details in a span of two hours without making your head spin. It managed to create a good balance of action, storytelling, and character development. Natalie Portman was an excellent actress in this movie and played the role perfectly.The only downside is that the Wachowski brothers still do not know how to create a romantic scene! From the Matrix trilogy to this, it's unusual how  they create it.In the end, I recommend it! It's thought provoking, actionpacked, and just plain fun.	4.0	An Excellent movie!	2007-01-07	5	0	5

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1YD1DM2KU9P9D	JSM	I know I'm not the first to make this observation, but the film deviates quite a lot from Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Being a fan of the original, I found the film lacking on first viewing. After recently watching it again I found the film to be better the second time. For me, I had to learn to accept the film as a stand-alone piece, and in and of itself it is not bad.

I thought this movie suggests  we should not blindly believe what we see or hear - we especially tend to do so when we are in fear.Besides the story, Hugo Weaving is a great actor.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A32O4R6AKCZDTV	Junius	This is meant to be a thriller with a revolutionary political message.It fails to satisfy on both counts.As a thriller, the anti-hero fights an evil political system, mostly for revenge for the cruelties inflicted on him, but also to bring it down. In doing so, he kills a number of figures in the system and carries out explosions to topple the state. Fair enough. But he seems invincible, almost, and the state pretty powerless, even though it is supposed to be totalitarian. V is able to distribute a very lareg number of Guy Fawkes masks undetected and to drive a train under Parliament to blow it up. No one is killed in either of these explosions, unlike in real life. Furthermore, how does the masked V supply himself with food?Politically, this is as subversive as cold porridge. The state is a fascistic one, with an Oswald Mosley figure on top. Its homophobic and racist. How it got to power is explained by a gigantic conspiracy undetected by almost all. It fails to convince. And what happens after the overthrow of the regime? Most revolutions lead to either greater tyranny or a sordid compromise at best.  The film fails to engage here, and simply cops out. We also might wonder how why the apathetic masses suddenly risk death to overthrow the state.This film is actually in favour of the current liberal status quo, with rights to all, though it does advocate vigiliantism and capital punishment for evildoers. But again, this is not really explored. The fascist bogeyman of the 1930s is the villain of the piece - yesterday's enemy (how daring!).This is a film which thinks it is clever, but only in an adolescent fashion, which fails to convince on any other level. Having said that, the viewer maintains enough interest to see exactly how it will turn out, because the overthrow of the evil state is inevitable, isn't it?	2.0	Not as clever as it thinks it is	2008-04-12	20	16	4

FOR ALL!!In the movie I was mainly reminded of the ideals of our own revolution. One could certainly look into it (certainly someone like that propagandist crook O'Reily) and see the Bush administration hiding behind that huge Hitlerist big brother of the film, but what I was mainly reminded of was 1776.One other thing that seemed to stand out to me was the mentioning of the U.S. that apparently, at least in the propaganda enriched closed borders of this England, while faced with some of the same hardships as Mother England the U.S. stayed true to her Ideals of equality and freedom, no matter what the cost.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2Y6XZN9AKEVMV	Kan Lamat	"I haven't read the graphic novel. I expect this lends a great deal to why, for me, this movie was bloody soul-striking.I am a revolutionary, not an anarchist. Given the choice between statism and anarchy, I would take anarchy in a heartbeat. ""V for Vendetta"" is the tale of one man's vengeance with the ultimate aim to liberate a nation, and the existential journey of the woman who is forced to take his side. They are V and Evey.Incorrectly marketed as an action movie, this is more a drama and an obvious political commentary on the state of the world. To me, the most important aspect of this story is the journey of Evey, who begins the movie living a life of fear. Her journey begins with a flight out of terror, until she is forced the face her fear, and, eventually, her death.When at last she is given death, the growing parallels throughout the movie combine, until the visions of V's breaking and Evey's breaking unite in fire, in water, in screams and in tears. In this moment, I knew that I loved this movie.Others will follow what is purported as the main story until its end, marked by its own inspirational terror and beauty. The price of blood is blood, and the character V is one of flesh and blood. Knowing this, the end is apparent.To revolutionaries, anarchists and all those who have ever broken entirely only to find something ""else"" just behind the facet of life--this movie is waiting. To those seeking an action movie with car chases and bullets firing in every other scene, this movie will disappoint."	5.0	Penny for the Guy?	2007-04-23	13	6	7
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3ETC9BJP71RJ7	Karen Gulliver	This movie is a futuristic political thriller set within a morality action play.  It is rich in dialog, ideas and genre.  Based on a graphic novel, its hero is a political terrorist who was a past victim of state terrorism.  V exacts revenge against his individual state torturers, but he aspires to more.  He wants to inspire society, from the bottom up.  This movie envisions the state of society in a post 9-11 world where citizens give up too much freedom to be safe and no longer recognize the difference between a leader and a tyrant.  It darkly affirms the difference an individual can make in extreme circumstances, resting responsibility on each of us to take up our duty.  The rhyme to November 5th references a real event - the Gunpowder plot (1606), a failed act of regicide against James I and his family. V mocks the modern day celebration of Bonfire or Fireworks Night in commemoration of monarchical survival.  Three particular tickles:  The parody of British political satire smack in the middle of the film, the predicted demise of American society and the love story.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A27CHILBK6HIL2	Kaya Savas	MOVIE: The story of V, the masked freedom fighter (or terrorist), is a dark vision of the future and how the government basically runs our lives. We have seen a recent lineup of films that take on this 1984 theme of Big Brother and we must overthrow it. If you remember the slightly enjoyable Equilibrium, and the recent Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet then you can see that this has been expressed in film already. However, with the Wachowskis helming the script we finally have a real intellectual look at the subject of a totalitarian government. The film takes place in Britain and is ruled by a dictator who is played by John Hurt (you know him as the guy from Alien who had his chest bursted open). V is the man who was betrayed and left for dead by the government and almost lost his life in a fire. Now he stands against his nation's leader by destroying government buildings and rounding up society to stand with him. He covers up his scarred body with a black caped outfit and a vaudevillian mask. Natalie Portman plays the supporting role who ends up seeing the world has V sees it. The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I cannot say if this interpretation is faithful the the comic character. But it's hard to find whose vision is being represented in the film, and that kind of makes the film a little unfocused at times. You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue. McTeigue was First Assistant Director on all three Matrix films, so it looks as if he is just being largely influenced by the Wachowski's. It basically feels like there are 5 directors, and not one straight vision. Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation. It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed. The only thing is that these ideas have been expressed many times already in a variety of similar films.ACTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face. He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character. Natalie Portman basically becomes V's back support, and becomes more attracted to him and his goals throughout the film. She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him. I have to mention though that her British accent was quite weak. John Hurt does a satisfactory job as the angry dictator. The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.BOTTOM LINE: How does one man secretly manufacture and ship vaudevillian masks, black capes, and black hats to the entire population of England while the country is under a dicatorship and everything is run by the government? I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot; the film itself is entertaining and enjoyable. It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction. There are more pros than cons about the film, and it's worth seeing.	4.0	A Decent Film With A Great Intellectucal Script, But It's Unfocused	2006-03-26	7	3	4

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1Z2RDCJAAZIRT	Kendall Smith	The movie definitely felt forced at times. It was good overall, but it tried to draw a parallel between Guy Fawkes and liberation of a people, when the Gunpowder Plot was really more of a religious thing. Also, a lot of the movie was stupidly cheesy, like the emphasized super-human ninja skills' sound effects. I guess it was good for what it was, but if I wanted to watch a movie about torture in order to 'free' a person, I'd watch Saw. Though I suppose I have a soft spot for vigilantes.One thing the movie did fantastically was create a dreamy/sexy character without actually ever showing him. V in everyday circumstance has a really cute and playful personality, but powerful and commanding presence when he goes public with his vendetta (seriously, no pun intended).	4.0	It was good overall, but it tried to draw a parallel ...	2014-07-04	0	0	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2JG84JVWIV6BU	Ken Helms	This really looked like my kind of movie: a bleak, repressive future with a strange anti-hero protagonist. Unfortunately, the future just didn't look all that bleak, and the protagonist was not very compelling.While there is some gratitous violence carried out by government thugs, the people in this dsytopian future seem more bored than repressed. The future is dark, but it lacks the grittiness and character of such movies as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, or even Brazil.The protagonist remains too much a mystery and there are too many unexplained and unlikely details about his life to make him a believable character. And it is really hard to identify with a character in a mask. Even the best actor can't express much emotion using only a muffled voice.The female costar also has issues of believability and motive. Her actions seem driven soley by the plot. Similarly, the character of the hard-working cop is such a plot driven role, he actually seems bored with the whole affair. And for a plot-driven movie, there are several holes big in it big enough to drive a truck through.	2.0	Lacks grit and character	2012-08-10	2	0	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2HTAZ98A4SITD	"Ken ""KLS"""	"At its most basic level I thoroughly enjoyed the move V for Vendetta simply for its swashbuckling style, its lyricism, visual effects, great action sequences, its music (especially the stones song ""street fighting man"" at the trailer)! and I enjoyed V's use of poetry to convey his eternal idea"" of justice (an idea which cannot be destroyed) behind the Guy Fawkes mask.Some people might see the movie as violent but they miss the point that these scenes in the movie can be overlooked when you see that they could stand for metaphors relating to the disintegration of those twisted and psychotic govermental/media institutions that had brought about London's Orwellian futuristic totalitarian regime.I think that there will always be some violence in movies such as this  but in the movie 'V for Vendetta' I think  that it was more about the power of ideas to change things much moreso then the 'power' of violence.  In my view the movie had far more meaningfulness then meaninglessness.Definitely worthy of a 5 star rating."	5.0	More then just a movie	2007-11-04	8	5	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ACPIGUWNBHHKA	kermit	I've just seen this on the big screen - its just opened here in the  UK (would have made more sense to open on November 5th , but distributors missed a trick on that one, perhaps thats the date for the DVD).I have never read the Graphic Novel but i am very impressed by the updating of the story to fit the War-on-Terror world. I found all the performances solid and good to see NP given something a bit more meaty to do. She is good but she has quite a distinctive accent, which would be unnoticable were we not so familar with it from Star Wars.This asks big questions about violence as protest - even though V is mostly driven by revenge made more justifiable by the repugent nature of the government. I take the view 2 wrongs dont make a right , but the strength of this film is as we, like Evoy, have to make a judgement on the moral ambivilence of V.Its a much more mature and rewarding work than the tiresomly violent and increasingly cartoonish Matrix films - here violence has a moral context (even though it is strangely enjoyable to have Stephen Fry being beaten up during the film......... ).Oh and in response to the previous correspondant , America is only mentioned once, and thats just to explain its non-involvement in the story (civil war no less!) so i dont see the Anti-American bit. Perhaps its the shock of a non Yanko-centric movie might be a bit hard to cope with as i guess they're not used to that.....All in all - a thought provoking piece of work about Freedom of Speech and how far we should go to preserve it, which never becomes po-faced.

There is a lot of double think out there but thanks to films like this one those who think like that will become fewer and fewer. I am a fan of this film or I should say I've been a fan of this film from the first time I saw it and that was for many reasons. For one the actors are british who I find to be born actors anyway, and the script was brilliant. It's like giving Bruce Lee a set of nuchucks and letting him go to town. Match that with great production values,cinematograpy,and humour just in the right places of this deadly serious subject which, if you are perspicacious enough, will see that every frame of this film is happening to us all right now keeping in mind they have to condense so much information into a film. It's like trying to compress all of president, or is he dictator now? Geroge W. Bush's lies down to a couple of hours. But they got it all in. The lying news media,the corrupt police, the child molesting bishop,the megalomaniac ""leader"" all played brilliantly as only the english can do. The only thing fantasy like about the film was the main charachter V. Unfortunately we don't have one of those as far as I know. But who knows? It might rub off and we can all become LIKE V and get our freedom back. That is the message. Do we live out our lives in quiet desperation content to sit in front of the [...] tube doing the same old thing day in and day out being told what to think and what to feel just because it's easier that way being a slave to an elite gang of crimminals posing as our saviours and gods.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2TB0NO3OR24XO	Kevin D. Rathert	Now I will not dispute that this is a wonderful adaption of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel, V For Vendetta.  I liked the way they updated it and I can't say that for many of the comic book films that I've seen.  However the DVD release has left me crying.  I mean on this over-priced double disc special edition we don't even get a commentary.  A lone fifteen minute featurette, that is absolutely worthless as they don't interview the Wachowski Bros or ALAN MOORE the author fills out the first disc weekly.  They talk to a bunch of real cool comic book insiders but they have no relevancy to either the story or the film.  The second disc made me weep.  There isn't a single interesting special feature on the DVD with the exception of when they talk about the real Guy Fawkes.  They have a little featurette on the Gun Powder Treason that is interesting and relevant to the film since most Americans have no idea who Guy was.  The rest of the features fall flat on their face and simply appear to take up space so that they could stick a second DVD into the package and charge a few extra bucks for poor saps like me that loved the film enought to simply jump at a double disc release with out looking long enough.  I would recommend grabbing the single disc edition unless you are a huge Natalie Portman fan because of the easter egg on the second disc.  A SNL Digital Short of Natalie Portman rapping and cursing up a storm on Satuday Night Live in an awesome appearance.  Other than that this DVD is worthless, well the I guess the film and and this music video, and that isn't worth thirty bucks.	3.0	A dVd review	2006-08-15	6	2	4
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2CD6EKATZO1FH	Kevin	The main character speaks through a mask that they do not bother to dub through, making him very hard to understand. The story does not flow, with sequences added seemingly just to do so. Whole sections could be removed and the same story could be told. The action is ridiculous, the cinematography was Matrix leftovers and what dialogue you can hear was as if a junior high school child was writing it.The only reason to watch this movie would be to make sure not to make the mistake of watching such a pile of dung ever again. Sort of like smoking a whole pack of cigarettes to break you of wanting them ever again.Avoid with prejudice.	1.0	horrid film	2013-07-09	11	3	8
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A30TK6U7DNS82R	Kevin Killian	"We saw this movie on the IMAX screen here in San Francisco and it was fairly overpowering.  At the end of the movie we just sat there in our chairs while the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"" blared out of the 108+ speakers hidden behind the screen, too drained to say anything but eager to agree.Natalie Portman is OK, her disturbing and irrelevant resemblance to Sinead O'Connor made us wonder why they just didn't go whole hog and put O'Connor in the movie.  She's not the world's most interesting actress but she seemed to be giving it her all, so we wound up liking her even at the same time as we were thinking how  tiny she is, like a little elf.  And the torture scenes seemed so unrealistic, like wouldn't a sneeze blow her against the prison cell wall and splat her like a flyswatter?  No way could she withstand the abuse she's dealt out in this movie.  I thought she had it bad in GARDEN STATE being forced into kookiness the whole time but here she has to represent the entire viewership of the movie as she (and by extension, ourselves) are argued and browbeaten into radical politics, possibly anarchy, by a well-written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.Hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry-go-round horse grinning in a death rictus.  I thought it strange that he would choose as his theme song ""Cry Me a River,"" but the other song he plays, by Antony and the Johnsons, really hit the note of the sexually ""other.""  When V falls in love with Evey, it really does change his plans as well as his perspective on the ultimate meaning of life and death.  As a love story, V FOR VENDETTA is a little bit similar to MY FAIR LADY.Is there some special pleading in the movie for gay and lesbian civil rights?  I don't see how you can read the subplots of Gordon Dietrich and of Valerie Page any other way.  My hat is off to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia.Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.  I just can't imagine V played by anyone else but Weaving.  But this isn't really an actor's movie, is it?  (Although Stephen Rea does some magnificently simple yet enthralling work as Chief Inspector Finch, the policeman who gradually goes over to the ""dark side."")  I was astounded by the way that, individual plots points and loose threads seem to disappear into outer space while leaving us with a modern fable of great power and communal beauty and fire."	5.0	A Film Heavy with Paradox	2006-03-26	10	5	5

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1NI21WO79FH47	"K. F Harkin ""musketeer_"""	"Some people just don't seem to get it.I know we are in the middle of ""The War on Terror"" but some people seem to interpret everything in our culture as either Pro-Government or Anti-Government.  The same polarizing statement can be made about homosexuality.  Something is either completely Pro or completely Anti.  If someone does a documentary about the Holocaust and mentions Homosexuals were also targeted does that make them 100% Pro Homosexual?  Some reviewing this movie would have you think so.I believe why this movie arouses such hate in some is because it is a little too close to the mark.  You can both support your government while at the same time not trusting it with unlimited power.  This movie is about a society that has signed over all its freedoms to a totalitarian regime for the promise of security.  Somebody posted that this could never happen to an advanced Socialist nation stating they never regress.  I say the opposite.  As any society begins to put more and more dependency on the government for their lives and well being they are only more willing to hand over more freedoms in exchange for additional perceived security.  I see a heavily Socialist society as more likely to cross over the brink into a totalitarian regime than many others.  America would be less likely to easily fall into this because of the basic structure of its Constitution but given enough of a push anything could happen.The push in V is war, terrorism and plague resulting in a population filled with blind fear.  Perhaps because we already have war and terrorism in abundance with plague a constant threat in the media some people are a little touchy on the issue.  The movie is from a now insular English perspective.  It is not surprising plenty of fault is thrown onto the US.  That does not make it justified; it is merely a way of pointing the finger outwardly.  I would not take it any further than that.  Basically what happens is terrorism becomes very extreme to the point that people begin voting out of fear.  This causes a small hate mongering party to gather some power and is entirely plausible.  That party point the finger of blame at foreigners, Muslims, homosexuals, and any ""deviants"" who express doubt with regards to the measures this party believes are needed for safety.  The whole time the party plays to base of terrified English citizens who are in the majority.  It is always easy to get frightened people to point the finger at anyone different.  The leaders of this party are also somewhat religiously fundamentalist in their outlook, leading them to condemn all they consider immoral.  This is easy enough to do once they have the power.This party does not have absolute power yet though.  While developing a biological weapon and antidote those party members involved in the program decide it would serve the greater good, and preserve England, to sacrifice a few.  The idea is the vast majority will see the real need for security and make the decisions that need to be made (i.e. put the new party in charge.).  The virus is unleashed on domestic targets with the goal of creating the most fear.  It works and the party of hate is swept into power promising strict measures to insure security.  Soon after the ""cure"" is discovered, thanks in part to the party now in power.The main character blames the people for what they put in power and urges them to throw it off, while at the same time carrying on his personal vendetta against those who imprisoned and tortured him.The movie makes a good point that you should never blindly trust your government.  Those who think that the point of the movie is somehow ""subversive"" and call it terrorist propaganda do not see the irony in their position...  That should worry people far more than a simple movie!The movie is well acted.  All the praise placed on the actors already written is well deserved and will not be duplicated here.  It is also well shot.  I do think a few more details could have been revealed.  Not having read the Graphic Novel I do not understand just how V was as superhuman as he was, or how he accomplished so much alone (clearing bricked up subways and laying tracks?).  Perhaps it was something to do with the tests on him but it is never made clear.  I also thought that the time from when Evey left V (after the imprisonment) to November 5th was completely glossed over.  What did she do?  Was she a subversive or simply living under the radar?  It seems strange she would have such an awakening and then do nothing.  I did like the twist that brought Evey's awakening.  She had stated earlier that she lived in constant fear for her life and wished she did not, would give anything to not live in such fear.  As her father said ""Artists use a lie to tell the truth"" and that is what freed her from her fear.  The ending I found a little too cinematic.  I doubt that those fireworks could have been set up around Parliament and not been detected.Overall I give it 4 stars for the acting, cinematography, and thought provoking story.  It would have been 5 if it were not as full of itself and needlessly vague for those not familiar with the source material."	5.0	You are not a supporter of the Taliban for seeing the truth in this movie.	2006-10-04	16	5	11
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.Recommended as a rental only."	2.0	You Say You Want A Revolution??	2006-08-12	33	8	25

Whether it's a penchant for anti-establishment-ism or the implicit siren's call of the stunningly beautiful Miss Portman, I can't pass this up when it airs on HBO (At least I don't have 14 copies of Catcher in the Rye...yet). Beyond her looks, though, I was thoroughly taken by her acting performance. It's easy to dismiss someone who looks this good, and trying to be as objective as possible, I was pleasantly surprised by her performance and range of emotions. There's more to this book than its lovely cover.To simplify things, V is a more aesthetically pleasing take on the message in Fight Club, but with some Matrix flair in the special effects department. I would normally give this a 4 star rating, but since the last good movie out (IMO) was The Sixth Sense, I gave it a bonus star because I'm starved for something substantive.The one annoying thing for me about the production is the volume delta, forcing me to boost same for certain portions of the dialog, only to have to haul it back down during the raucous volumes of the action sequences. I'm sure some of it is age-related (I'm 43 going on 16), but some of it is pure dB-centric. I don't think that people really need to be jolted by volume if there's a message. It's too bad, given that this movie has at least some message to deliver.In any event, it's refreshing to see something with a message which is so well-polished and compelling to watch.

But one would have to assume that it was even possible for England to sink to that level.  Given that the IRA fought the British over a much more benign type of political control, I rather doubt that the UK citizens could ever allow the country to become a dictatorship -- I believe it would be nipped in the bud early on.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3IYD0M015J72X	KnowThy1Self	"The hero/villain, known only as V, is a modern `rendition' (pun intended) of Guy Fawkes, the man who was captured, tortured, and confessed his part in attempting to blow up the British Parliament building in 1605.  V recites the following poem amongst many others throughout the movie:  ""Remember Remember, the 5th of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot.  We see no reason, why Gunpowder Treason, should ever be forgot!""  However, the movie is neither a justification for the Catholic rebels of 400 years ago nor a condemnation of the King James administration, which was also a target of the Gunpowder Plot.  Perhaps I can best summarize V for Vendetta as an examination of the proper place in this world of those who would say, ""We need hope, not buildings"" or ""Ideas are bulletproof.""  Are such idealists too dangerous to be tolerated?  Do natural rights or even constitutional rights prohibit pre-emptive prosecution of thought crimes?Political philosophy is always a mix of the real and the ideal.  So what better venue than a comic-book inspired movie to provoke more questions than I could even enumerate in a simple movie review--questions concerning the role of citizens, the power of government, the justification of violence, retribution, toleration, propaganda, etc?  Moral issues presented in V for Vendetta range from unquestionable acknowledgement of the existence of evil in dystopian government controllers to more relativistic and difficult-to-grasp concepts that many viewers might never have even doubted before watching this movie.  Then again, much of what you take from this movie will depend on ideals you hold going in.  If you are only looking for narrow applications to specific current events, you will find them.  But if you limit yourself to such analogies, you will be missing out on the abundance of vital topics presented this movie.A student of Zen training methods may appreciate the direct personal experiences that Evey (Natalie Portman) must endure, while other may resent them.  One familiar with Eastern concepts of `Self' may not be so concerned that V never removes his mask or rarely even his gloves throughout the entire movie.  The Self is no more a face or flesh and bones than a State is its capital building, is it?  An Existentialist may have a better appreciation for the ultimate freedom of overcoming fear and saying, ""No"" even to ones own existence when the alternative is decidedly intolerable.  If you appreciate philosophy in general, or political philosophy more specifically, or if you've enjoyed books like We, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, or Brave New World, you will enjoy V for Vendetta.  But of course no prior knowledge is required to enjoy this action-packed and thought-provoking movie.  I suspect it will stimulate many discussions and perhaps even an interest in further reading."	5.0	Ideas Are Bulletproof	2006-03-20	1	0	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1LJZWBVCB44RO	"K. Sullivan ""No accounting for taste..."""	"Having not read the graphic novel on which this movie is based, I cannot (and would not) debate the faithfulness of the adaptation or its relative worth.  I also cannot divine what the Wachowski brothers' intent or motivations might have been, especially regarding the current political climate.  I can only relate what I witnessed and experienced from the film alone as an isolated piece of art, and it was good... profoundly so.The film does not dabble with subtleties or nuances.  The regime in charge of Britain is clearly oppressive.  However they came to power and whatever their motivations (and the film ultimately reveals the back story), it is clear that they rejoice in their complete authority and enthusiastically abuse it.  The field agents or Fingermen violate the citizenry; the televised face of the nation self-righteously revels in the judgment heaped upon other nations spewing smug vitriol; the religious leaders fulfill their carnal desires; the communications ministry controls all programming twisting the news to its own ends while eavesdropping on the general population; the Chancellor clearly rules through fear and with an iron fist.  Dissidents are quickly and quietly disposed of through violent means.  Free thought does not exist.  This is an archetypal oppressive evil regime.V is the faceless archetypal hero.  Happily he remains faceless for the duration of the movie.  His mask is all we see.  The lifeless mask allows for his thoughts and ideas to be the focus rather than his individuality.  His appeal is not so much for how he handles a fight and a blade, though impressive; his true weapon is speech.  Eloquent and literate, he expresses ideas that cut straight to the heart (the people should not fear their government, but the government should fear its people).  Suspend belief for a period and watch as he shakes a sleeping nation.  He chastises the citizens as the true culprits that have allowed the current state of affairs.  Then he provides inspiration and a means  to do something about it.  We see the cowardly and zombie-like nation slowly awaken and climactically throw off its oppressor.This is not a ""how-to"" tool for overthrowing a dictatorship.  Nor is it in my opinion a scathing indictment of any administration or specific political landscape in the first decade of the 21st century (though it will make you think about some things).  Its power is in the universality of the tale.  It resonates because it does not have to be political at all.  It is about people and oppression and anyone finally standing up to throw off tyranny in any of its forms by whatever means.  Certainly violence works well for a movie and to dramatically represent the point.  But do not lock the greater meaning and power of the message into its form.  Speaking of its universality, I was very much reminded of the musical ""Les Miserables"" (precursor to the French Revolution).  It is a rousing tale where one sacrifices self-interest for the greater good.The cinematography is phenomenal with its stark colorization; it is a visually stunning film.  The action is entertaining.  A more rousing tune than the ""1812 Overture"" cannot be found.  The film slows slightly while providing some back story, but it is necessary to fully inform the narrative.  From start to finish, it is just a remarkable achievement."	5.0	Thus always to tyrants and oppression - fantastic movie	2008-10-04	3	2	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2ICI500LRO01K	Kyle Wells	"""V for Vendetta"" is by no means a great movie, and I am not totally convinced it is even a particularly good one, but it has more spirit and bravado than anything I have seen in some time. The film comes across as current, decidedly a product of its time, and perhaps even relevant, which is something rarely seen anymore in contemporary popular cinema. We live in a very political world right now, a world of wars, aggressive internationalism, and often bitter partisanship; in other words, a climate that should give rise to much fiery and impassioned art. This has unfortunately not been the case. It is a little discouraging to see that it has taken a UK-Germany co-production to finally make a film worth arguing about, a film that isn't afraid to use the word `terrorist,' a film often shocking in its blunt political assertions, but with this misgiving aside, it must still be appreciated that such a film has been made at all.I say that ""V for Vendetta"" is not a great film because on a level of pure entertainment is falls short of what it could have accomplished. It's just odd enough to be interesting and just energetic enough to be exciting, but as with any film fueled by ambition, some of what it attempts falls short. The first half of the film was quite riveting, but it begins to lose a little steam towards the final act, as the story gets stretched a little thin and the momentum of the piece begins to falter. The love scenes, albeit brief and for the most part unobtrusive, were nevertheless unnecessary and didn't quite work for me, nor did the scenes concerning Creedy delivering the Chancellor, which were confusing at best. The acting throughout the movie was good but nothing more. Natalie Portman was more than adequate and certainly looked the part, but her performance did not strike me as anything special. Neither did Hugo Weaving's as V, but then again it can be hard to judge an actor who is masked for the entire film (crafty Greeks!). The effects were generally vibrant and enjoyable, except for the CGI enveloped fight between V and a dozen or so policemen which was over-the-top in a way that seemed beneath the rest of the film. Most of these complaints can be credited to the film being overlong, which somewhat hurt its momentum, and to the filmmaker's attempts to do too much with one film...Which is also partly what saved the film. ""V for Vendetta"" is a rarity these days because it is a film that has something to say and seems rather urgent to say it. This causes problems, sure, but it also injects the film with enough energy to make it often invigorating and always interesting. This is an unabashedly political film and in a way that confronts the conventional views and positions that our current pop culture insists on feeding us. The film is undoubtedly anti-Bush and anti-Western colonialism, which is not uncommon, but with a degree of passion and fevered insistence seldom seen any more. Its cry of protest is reminiscent of the anti-totalitarian rallies of Orwell or Huxley, and words such as `revolution' and `fascism' are used without hesitation. I do not necessarily believe that the movie is anything more than just that, a movie, nor do I agree with everything it could be potentially saying, but I do believe that art as bold as this, and as politically charged and confrontational, is the sure sign of a healthy culture. If there were more films that tried to say half as much as ""V for Vendetta"" our weekly trips to the theatre or video store would be a far less dull affair.I am as impressed by the fact that this film got such wide distribution in the States as I am disheartened by my insistence that it would have never been made had the White House replaced the British Parliament as the primary symbol of the film. America is plainly mentioned as the cause of the war that brought the destruction of our present society, but due to its British setting, matched with its graphic novel appearance, the film is distant enough that those who should take the most away from it will probably take nothing. Despite this the film is still as incendiary as anything you will see for some time, I imagine, and should have been far more controversial and debated than it was. It is not great, but any film which in our present situation associates terrorism, the Koran, and domestic anarchy with its heroes, for better or for worse, is certainly a film worth seeing."	4.0	A Lively, Politically Aggressive Movie	2006-08-03	5	4	1

It shows how a government based on greed oppresses it's people by means of prejudice, invoking fear, censorship, and curfews. It gives you a look at how the media misinforms and misleads the people intentionally with false information. This movie is about a country needing one fearless leader, icon, or symbol willing to stand up and speak against these injustices. They get it in the form of a masked individual known simply as ""V"". ""V"" is all about starting a revolution to overthrow the government, so the people can take back their country and freedom without fear or reservations. Personally, I don't think this movie is pro-Bush or anti-Bush, but I do think it's left up to you to make the call, or interpret it as you will.

"""V for Vendetta"" has a very predictable plot, but is visually well done, with good acting (or voice over?) by Hugo Weaving as V. Stephen Rea also does an excellent job as Chief Inspector Finch.A number of the minor actors (esp. Stephen Fry as Dietrich and Tim Pigott-Smith) bring great acting to very stereotypical roles (Pigott-Smith as the feeling-less super bad guy, very Herman Goering-ish, Fry as the only person our heroine can turn to).Unfortunately the plot is a repeat of other plots and books that set a formerly democratic government up as oppressive ""for the public's own good"" and personal freedoms get taken away almost without people noticing. Eventually a victim of the government (in this case, V) performs daring acts to get the people to think about standing up to what should be ""their"" government.A little too much propaganda-ish at the end, though I did like who the V character was shown to be both hero and villan in the eyes of Evey, the heroine. More of that would have made the plot interesting.Worth watching once or twice."	3.0	Predictable, but well done	2007-03-24	8	2	6
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2T049UQONS0OY	Larry VanDeSande	"""V for Vendetta"" is a political allegory in league with ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"" although neither as compelling nor realistic as any of those films. It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.While hardly a masterpiece, ""V for Vendetta"" is certainly better and more entertaining than ""The Island"", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's ""Bananas"" played straight, without the laughs. If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy ""V for Vendetta""."	4.0	Zorro meets 1984	2007-03-05	15	10	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ASSCA9IS0GWF5	Laszlo Matyas	"V For Vendetta is the rarest of things: A work of art that manages to be both commercially viable and uncompromisingly subversive. It's an arrestingly stylish, devastatingly smart movie whose every scene demands attention and contemplation. Without being preachy or condescending, it demands that its viewers think. Without resorting to cliche or cheap sentiment, it packs a hell of an emotional wallop. Without resorting to cardboard-cutout characterization or vague moralizing (and this is the really cool part), it sends an impossible-to-ignore message about right, wrong, oppression, revolution, responsibility, and the role of the individual.  And at the same time, it's incredibly fun to watch.The plot is a bit complex (and besides, watching the story unfold is half the fun. Well, more like a third of the fun. But I digress...), but here's what you should know: Our story takes place in an unpleasant future. England has fallen under the power of a very oppressive, very totalitarian regime, which has come to power by riding a wave of fear triggered by a surge in terrorist attacks. Free expression and democracy are things of the past, all information is controlled by the government, anyone who complains winds up disappearing, and God help you if you're a Muslim. What sets this brave new world apart from (and ahead of) other, lesser cinematic dystopias is its incredible atmosphere. This England is a creeping sort of nightmare, a strange and hostile place that evokes dread and paranoia with a throbbing undercurrent of tension. As anyone who's ever been across the pond (for those of you joining us from Europe, Asia, Africa, or Australia, ""on your side of the pond"") can probably tell you, the setting of V For Vendetta is an uncannily dark mirror image of the Isle that we all know and love. It's atmospheric, hypnotic, and undeniably powerful. This setting is populated by an equally engaging cast of heroes and villains- from the charismatic and utterly ruthless High Chancellor Adam Sutler to the oddly sympathetic government inspector Eric Finch to the film's twin protagonists, Evey Hammond and V, just about everybody in this film is a wonderfully drawn, finely crafted example of characterization at its sharpest. It's a stage full of Hamlets  and Mia Wallaces, without a single Jar Jar Binks to ruin the flow.The story itself, which concerns V's yearlong crusade against the tyranny that has fallen on hi nation, is simply brilliant. V himself is a stunningly drawn character, an incredibly complex man whose cool charisma and literate style belie a troubled, vulnerable sort of humanity. It's not always easy to agree with his methods- he resorts to acts of violence that border on anarchic terrorism- but therein lies the brilliance of the movie: V For Vendetta doesn't aim to make us blindly sympathize with its central character. Rather, it demands that we think, forces us to consider our own views on revolution, freedom, revenge, and violence. Is it right to defy a government if we see its actions as unjust? Can one man's actions speak for the ideas of many? Is it ever right to kill another human being? The questions may be as old as time, but this movie casts them in a startlingly new light.And it's entertaining, too: The plot is genuinely suspenseful and engaging, full of twists, and revelations. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed, the dialog is razor-sharp, the visuals are unforgettable, and the climax is simply gorgeous.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"Overall, I was definitely disappointed by ""V for Vendetta,"" primarily because I was anticipating a really great adaptation of the work by writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd.  I was also looking forward to a movie that I would be able to use in my Introduction to Popular Culture class when it comes out on DVD because I thought it would be a nice example of how cinema functions rhetorically.  The idea that a masked figure who blows up public buildings could be a revolutionary hero rather than a murdering terrorist is a radical notion post 9/11.  But this film lacks the subtlety of the original graphic novel and makes a strategic error in foisting a conclusion to this dark tale.  The results are compelling, but not the provocative story I was hoping to see.After recapping the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot for ignorant colonials, we cut to the future a couple of decades down the road where Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), is out after curfew in London.  She is about to be raped and probably killed by ""fingermen"" of the security forces when she is rescued by V, dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask.  He takes her to the roof top where he conducts a symphony that end with the Old Bailey blowing up.  They meet again when V takes over the single television channel to broadcast a promise that one year hence he will blow up the Parliament building (on Guy Fawkes day, of course) and asks that everyone in England who supports his cause to take to the streets that night to support his actions.  When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness. Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) is put on the case but immediately hamstrung by the government from being able to investigate the clues that would lead to the identity of the terrorist.The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers turns Moore's attack on the conservative inclinations of the government of Margaret Thatcher into a more overt representation of a fascist government.  The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.  Casting John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" as Adam Sutler, the fearless leader in this film only heightens the Orwellian analogy.  Moore and Lloyd had the evil men of the government look like ordinary bureaucrats, but this film stacks the deck so that the allusions to Hitler and ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" are so obvious that of course our sympathies are with the terrorist blowing up the buildings (besides, they are not our buildings, they are English buildings; but more on that later).In the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.  However, in the graphic novel the point was to blow up symbols.  The shift from having Big Ben be the first thing that V blows up in the book, to the total destruction of Parliament being V's ultimate goal, is rather significant.  V's final target in the book was 10 Downing Street and the final explosion is seen from the distance because the explosion is not the point.  It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.My biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.  No political diatribe worth its salt is going to warn the masses of the evil inherent in the system and then provide an ending that reassures the audience that everything is going to be all right.  The graphic novel ends with a victory, but clearly the war will continue, for at least another generation.  The movie seeks to reassure us with a Rolling Stones song (and does not even bother to play the entire song).  Moore and Lloyd wanted to enlist us, following in the footsteps of Evey as she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.  Relatively few will have read the graphic novel, but far more people remember September 11th in the U.S. than the 5th of November in the U.K.  The idea of purging an English-speaking nation of Muslims, immigrants and homosexuals may or may not seem like something that can happen here.  Blowing up apparently empty buildings in the middle of the night and reserving the blood letting for situations where V gets up close and personal with the bad guys can certainly make this terrorist seem different and, dare we say, acceptable.  In the end we are so clearly distanced from this story that it does not ask us to make any hard choices.I would have preferred to see ""V for Vendetta"" as a television mini-series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.  Beyond that, the frozen face that is V's mask becomes a disadvantage both for Weaving and director James McTeigue.  There is only so much you can do with lighting and head tilts, and the first-time director relies too often on close-ups (no wonder James Purefoy bailed on the role).  ""Sin City"" set a standard for adapting a graphic novel to the screen that will probably never be approached by any one else, but I was hoping this one would be a lot closer to the mark."	4.0	The subtleties of the graphic novel are replaced by really loud explosions	2006-03-17	19	11	8
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1WD13J9ZQ855I	"Lawrence Charters ""-- Lawrence"""	"V for Vendetta is a visually striking, politically challenging, memorable film. Natalie Portman plays Evey, a very vulnerable ""everywoman"" who gets caught up in forces she doesn't understand or appreciate. Portman is in almost every scene, and for much of the film is the only character you can truly see (there either are no other characters, or other characters are masked). For those who only remember her as Padme in the Star Wars films, she has a chance to show a much broader range of abilities, and is impressive.The plot draws heavily on contemporary themes, including uneasiness over Britain's very highly developed video surveillance system as well as the US Patriot Act limitations on civil rights. Add in some not-so-veiled references to Guy Fawkes, and movie trailers that gave away much of the action, and you have a film in which you know how it turns out (you think), but are constantly wondering how it will get there. The visual images, the political issues, and the unease stay with you long after the film is finished."	5.0	Provocative and unconventional	2009-12-05	0	0	0

Since I hadn't heard of it (I don't own a television and seldom go to movies), I was intrigued.  I really liked it; it was thoughtful, thought provoking, uncomfortable at times, and has a lot to say about the nature of heroics, privilege, power, strength, ethics and conformity.The only real complaint I have (and it is a minor one) is that the ending is highly improbable in our modern society.  I do realize this was based on a comic book, so reality is not particularly relevant to the story.  As the inspiration for Anonymous, however, it's worth realizing there are more things to consider/prepare for than the ending we have in this movie.	5.0	Heard that this was an inspiration for some of the Anonymous	2013-05-27	0	0	0

This story was a just the retelling of the Matrix, the story about control. Here however the a fascist government took the place of the machines. The themes of choice, integrity, and causality were the driving force of the characters. No action is without a consequence. Hence it would be prudent to consider the consequence of our actions rather than our feeling towards them, because are feeling can be manipulated. The Wachowski brothers do an excellent job of showing how every character in movie including V struggles with doing what they wish rather that which they know to be right. We can see how easily characters such Creedy are tricked by V because they are driven by their anger. The most powerful part of the movie for me was V coming to realization with the consequences of his own actions, and giving up control for what he had worked so hard for to Evey, since she represented the people who have to live with consequence of his actions.My only problem with movie and why I gave it 4 stars was that V forced the Evey the transformation process by torturing her. Yes she may have suggested in an attempt to win her trust that she wanted to be free of her fear, but that should have been her choice no V's. It would have been nice if their was more of a genuine desire expressed by her to free of her fear. Perhaps it was by forcing the process on Evey that V discovered that he was forcing this revolution on the people, rather than giving them a choice in the matter.At the end this movie is not just about governments. It is about all those who which to control people, how ever noble their intentions are or pure their believes are. It is that warning that such action is not without consequence, and that universe will eventually break through and will not be stopped no matter how much energy you generate. I hope you will take the time to see this movie again.	4.0	Understanding the Consequences of Our Actions	2006-09-02	7	3	4

Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of V prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!V for Vendetta brings to the screen the not-so-impossible scenario that in the future England (or any western country for that matter) has become a dictatorship.  Subsequently, a man idolizing a 1605 failed attempt by Guy Fawkes to blow up the English parliament takes it upon himself to start a revolution in order to bring down the regime.  What the revolutionary does not anticipate is to find love in the midst of it all...  It's a bit like the X-Files meets ""1984"" with a bit of Matrix, and all that in a Marvel Comics universe.On the positive side:Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!Moreover, the special effects are pretty good.On the negative side:The film is way too political and too radical for the comics genre.In addition, as in the case of the Michael Moore films, there are good and valid points, but the approach used is so radical and extreme that to a certain extent it backfires and may have the opposite effects.Ridiculing law and order by portraying frequent curfews and constantly stating that they ""are for your protection,"" may encourage lawlessness and anarchy.  Furthermore, the film comes to the defence of certain groups and minorities that mainstream people and common folk do not feel close or akin to, thus scaring them away from pressing matters such as who controls the media (which is something that is presented well in the film).In a nutshell, V for Vendetta may not be a terrible movie, but it's also not what they've made it out to be."	3.0	"""The Gunpowder Plot"" all over again..."	2006-04-21	12	3	9

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1XFAF8RKGQDBN	"Lisa Pease ""Guerrilla Informationist"""	"""Remember, remember the fifth of November.Gunpowder, Treason and Plot.I see no reason why the Gunpowder TreasonShould ever be forgot.""I knew nothing about the film V for Vendetta going into it. Ideally, you shouldn't either, so don't read this review if you haven't seen the film! And you MUST see this film. It is the most interesting, subversive, and important film I've seen in decades.The movie presents a parable for our times, a post-9/11 world in which freedoms have been traded for security with disastrous results. The ""former United States"" is a mess. The UK has become a fascist regime enforced through the near-total surveillance of its citizens. One man, a literate, intelligent, but vengeful man, who goes by the name of ""V"" for reasons revealed as the film progresses, has a vendetta, indeed, but it's much more than a personal one. Knowing that he has the power to change things, possibly for the better, he decides to take matters into his own hands. V cloaks his identify behind a Guy Fawkes mask, and becomes a terrorist.Or is terrorist the right word? He isn't trying to terrorize the citizens of London. He's trying to rouse them from their fear-induced slumber. He tells them that if they are unhappy with the way things are going, if they are looking for people to blame, they need to start by looking in the mirror, as they were the ones who stood by complacently as their world disintegrated. He invites them to join him at Parliament a year from that date, the next November 5, so that they can witness the act Guy Fawkes never got to finish. Why? Because there's something wrong with the country, and everybody knows it.Natalie Portman portrays the character Evey (""E V"", V articulates with relish, noting that there are no coincidences). Throughout the film, after every new revelation about V, Evey asked my own questions. Was V a good guy or a horrible guy? Should one support his choices or not? Would I choose his path, given similar circumstances? At what point is the law the problem, when the law is used to justify heinous deeds? At what point is one justified in breaking it?As someone who believes in the power of nonviolent, legal, collective action, the film was both disturbing and intriguing in its implications. The act of blowing up Parliament in the film had nothing to do with violence, and everything to do with symbolism. As Evey noted, the people needed hope more than they needed the building. And the blowing up of Parliament was a show of strength. As V had said early in the film, ""People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people."" Blowing up Parliament was a way for the people to reclaim their power. And feeling that power, they might yet right the wrongs that had been done in their name.I loved the story and movie on so many levels. The writing was brilliant, even Shakespearean at times. (Indeed, the Bard was nearly a character in the film, so often was he quoted.) The images were sleek and dark and sterile, like the world in which the story takes place. V's underground home was strange yet inviting, and warmed considerably by the slow jazz emanating from his jukebox. And everything had a meaning, including the signature roses V left with each of his vendetta victims.The acting was compelling. You wouldn't believe a man in an immobile mask could make you feel so many emotions. Through his voice, his body, and somehow through that masked face, I felt every joy and anger and pain that V did. I will be forever in awe of Hugo Weaving's impeccable, faceless performance, as well as Natalie Portman's moving portrayal of a woman who came to discover ultimate freedom by choosing integrity over fear. And the love story between them was incredibly compelling. I was falling in love with V too, even as I deplored some of his actions.I was surprised at the fairly overt parallels to the 9/11 controversy, especially given that the graphic novel on which the film is based was written in the 1980s, well before the attacks.In the film, the big ""terrorist attacks"" that resulted in the newly fascist society came in the form of a virus unleashed in the UK which wiped out hundreds of thousands of people. At one point, one of the government investigators searching for V, portrayed by the always interesting Stephen Rea, starts to open his mind. He asks his fellow investigator a question to which he requires no answer. In his world, the act of asking the question was itself a very bold step: ""If our government was behind the attacks, would you really want to know?""Perhaps my favorite sequence was the one in which Rea suddenly starts seeing all the puzzle pieces fall into place, how ""Everything is connected."" In a brilliant series of intercuts, he glimpses the past, present, and future--the throughline of history. As V says, ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.""Interestingly, the future Rea envisions in that moment does not entirely come to pass, but might have, had he been successful in his effort to capture V. Ironically, his failure to stop the ""terrorist"" ends up saving an untold numbers of lives.The most thrilling part of the film, for me, came at the end, as masses of people come out to stand in support of V's actions. There's something about people taking massive, collective action that inspires me to no end. We have the power to do amazing things, together. No force on earth can resist the masses when we act righteously in unison. As V said, in a quote I'm badly mangling, you can kill people. But you can't kill ideas. And ideas carry tremendous force.As some reviewers have noted, with a sentiment I want to echo, we should all take heart in the fact that a major studio (Warner Brothers) backed and released this film. If we were truly living in V's world, such would not have been possible.The movie is a warning, not a reflection. But we would do well to examine the road we are on.And then do something about it.Remember, remember the fifth of November...."	5.0	Remember, remember the Fifth of November....	2006-04-08	12	8	4

I can not understand why so many people disliked the actors or why the Mr. Moore didn't like the movie. The woman who played Evy was great, though you would think from the time her hair got shaved to the end of the movie it would have grown some. Hugo Weaving, who played V, was excellent. And forgive me, but till someone mentioned it, I had no idea that he was Mr. Smith from the Matrix series. Oops on me. But he had that voice, the chocolate and velvet undertones, like Shawn Connery and Vin Diesal. Totally yummy!

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A24E4JWAKKK3FL	Long Tom	"I did not read the graphic novel by Alan Moore that this movie was based on, but did hear that it was the story of a wounded anarchist whose goal was to bring down a crumbling dictatorship that was ruling Britain.  It was written in the 1980's and the movie likely had extremely little to do with the graphic novel it was based upon.The Britain of the movie is under the control of a Christian theocracy...never mind that modern-day Britain is hardly a strongly religious nation.  Far from a crumbling society, things for the most part look nice and new and shiny.  Furthermore, the hero V, for having been badly burned in a fire, is able to speak clearly and very agile and quick for someone who had suffered such physical damage.  Besides that, even though everyone and everything is supposed to be closely watched, V is able to gather up and maintain a huge secret room full of antiques, and also is able to send dozens of Guy Fawkes masks through the postal system.Other ridiculous parts also creep into the movie.  The society is strongly anti-homosexual (the product of evil Christianity presumably), and one homosexual man admires the beauty of the verses of the Koran.  Duh, that's like a Jew enjoying ""Mein Kampf"".Worst is the ending.  The people get their Guy Fawkes masks and put them on and walk into the streets, walk up to armed guards...and suddenly walk right through them unmolested.  Then a train full of explosives blows up the buildings of Parliament and Big Ben...and that's it.  What happens next?  Anarchy?  Democracy?

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created ""V for Vendetta"" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie ""1984,"" and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.  Enjoy!"	5.0	The Promise of Movie-Making	2006-08-07	6	3	3

I thought the acting was great for what it was, the cinematography was excellent (probably my favorite aspect of the movie), The direction was intriguing, and the story was overall decently solid and thought-provoking.The only problem I had with the movie was its tendency to become a bit full of itself.  By this I mean resorting to being a bit melodramatic at times and jauntily wacky at other times.  The flow was a bit odd.  The tendency for politicos to latch on to this film as if it were the all-encompassing life giving teet of the one true god has tarnished this movie for a lot of people in the same manner that goth out the bum tweens ruined The Crow. As long as you ignore the crazy fans, this movie fills the empty hole left by terrible romance comedies and ""underground"" films that should have stayed underground... preferably under three tons of cement, 20ft of sewer, and hundreds of feet of skyscraper.It was fun, pretty, interesting, and worth my time."	4.0	Stylized, entertaining, but a bit heavy in parts..	2008-05-06	0	0	0

To get a better idea of what the world has become (although the politicians are trying their darnedest to keep it hidden) one only needs to watch ""V for Vendetta"" to pierce the veil that hides the truth from so many.This movie shows the psychopathic people who are in control of a country and how they are abusing their power, as all psychopaths do.  And although I am not endorsing the way that the revenge of ""V"" was handled, there is a sense of encouragement that one has while watching the movie.I think that ""V for Vendetta"" is a very important movie in its own right.  It brings to light the true face behind the mask of those who are in power right now in real life.  It is a movie that needs to be seen by those who think that their governments have their best interests at heart.

A lone crusader single handedly fights a corrupt, vicious, repressive totalitarian government. And he does it mainly with knives and swords rather than guns (although there is the occasional explosion). In the beginning, the sheep-like populace seems oblivious to the situation; so the question is, will they wake up? Hugo Weaving (Matrix, Cloud Atlas) is superb as the man behind the mask, and Natalie Portman is excellent in the female lead. John Hurt is convincing as the evil dictator. With strong characterizations, fine acting all around, a commanding story and plot, a sobering political message, and a taught script, this movie, which I don't recall getting much play when it was first released, more than exceeded my expectations.	5.0	Superb	2014-01-02	1	0	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3AN0NXHARI55Q	Magic Lemur	The Matrixis often given the status of a modern classic and is seen as being the Wachowski Brother's finest hour. And many people have a point - even 12 years after release, it is still an astoundingly good film on many levels.However, it is not the Wachowski's best. For that you'd have to turn to this film: an often under-rated masterpiece.I have watched this film 10 times and can honestly say that the dialogue is second only to Shakespeare (who is quoted in this more than any other modern film I've seen). Furthermore this film radiates soul and has enough raw political clout to have founded its own unintentional mass movement: Anonymous.Like the Matrix, the plot revolves around a messiah/ hero figure in the form of 'V' and is told from the perspective of the appropriately named 'Evey'.Having not (yet) read the graphic novel, I cannot tell how much of the basic plot comes from Alan Moore and how much from the Wachowski's. Indeed it is said that Alan Moore can't stand this film since 'V' is an anarchist in the novel and is more of a freedom fighter for democracy here (Alan Moore has said on record that 99% of problems are caused by 'leaders').Despite the feelings of the author, I'd say the adaptation was first rate and the film stands tall as a testament to democracy and truth. The message is so clear that, even after George W Bush has gone and terrorist scaremongering has faded, the film still stands out as a classic.It has certainly become my favourite film and I hope I've made a good case for it being the Wachowski's best. Still, if you haven't seen it, please do and make up your own mind. If you have, simply look up 'V's Speech' to be reminded of why such an in-depth film demands repeat viewing...	5.0	"""Words offer the means to meaning and, for those that will listen, the enunciation of truth"""	2011-05-27	4	3	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	if Natalie Portman was a better actress.  You'll probably immediately recall her fake, pained facial expressions from scenes of maudlin excess in the Star Wars prequels (which, of course, were god-awful films, but don't get me started).  And because she appears in so many scenes, and her acting is at best hit or miss, it does take V for Vendetta down a notch.  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, of course.  It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo-intellectual sequels to the Matrix.  Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.Aside from Portman (who does a stretch in a dungeon and comes out looking like a concentration camp survivor -- except that she was just as emaciated before she went in ... does she eat in real life?), the acting is really first rate.  Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power-mad 1984-style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott-Smith plays the stern face of evil with aplomb.All this aside, I can't help but believe that many people, blinded by modern propaganda, will mistake the world in V for Vengeance as a thinly veiled stab at the modern United States or the Bush administration.  It obviously isn't.  In fact, only an intellectual adolescent would mistake real totalitarianism for what's going on in the United States, but that discussion is for another place and time.  Moreover, the film also, by dwelling on homosexuality as much as it does (some attention to this is warranted given that sexual freedom is often controlled in totalitarian states, but it almost predominates), dilutes attention from the real victim of oppression:  expression in all of its forms, not just sexual.  Sadly, I think in today's world, however, freedom is more often associated with what a person does with their sexual organs than with the quality of their ideas.  Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special ... and what we must die to protect if need be.All this, plus a satisfying ending.  Since when have we gotten that?	4.0	I'd give it a 5 ...	2006-03-19	16	10	6

The Wachowski brothers should fear the fans.Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read.  I am however, thoroughly disappointed.  They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security.  It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen.  Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less.  But for a fan of the graphic novel, the film adaptation is a poor reflection of a work of genius.

Without ever having read the comic, I had no preconceptions about V for Vendetta when I walked into the the theater. All I knew was that it starred Hugo Weaving in a weird mask and Natalie Portman with a shaved head. I was expecting an action/adventure movie in the same category as Zorro, but what I got was much, much more.Oh yes, there is plenty of action and adventure as the mysterious V slashes his way through the elite of London society, but to look at the movie only as an action flick is to miss the entire point-- the movie is the story of what happens in a totalitarian society when the government becomes too suspicious of the people. There's enough political relevance in the film to make some people today very uncomfortable.There are so many levels on which this movie can be watched-- it is very violent so parents of young children should be advised, but it is also a tender love story and a story of strength and courage and what happens when one stands firm in one's beliefs. I do know that the 1812 Overture will never sound the same to me again, and that the 5th of November will now have a different meaning in my life-- this is a life changing movie and a life affirming movie.

As is common, the trailer showed highlights out of context and led me to believe that it was action packed and meant to entertain.  This is of course not quite the case so the first viewing was spent waiting for what never came.  The second time around (of several viewings since) was when I began to get it, and it has since made its way toward the top of my list of all time favorites.  Some criticisms regarding a certain lack of originality are perhaps deserved, but the true power of this film is in the dialogue and in the wonderful performances of both Hugo Weaving (quite remarkable given that you actually see his face in only one short scene) and Natalie Portman who vindicates herself brilliantly after her difficult tour in the Star Wars mess.  The story itself is disturbing and meant to provoke serious thought.  Even if it is rather simplistic, it still offers a legitimate warning to those who accept ""news"" without skepticism and believe that all who have power deserve it.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3R4ZEDVRUWJNO	Mark	After what seemed like an eternity, Hollywood has finally cleaned all of the garbage out of the attic and is starting to make good movies again.  With duds like Glory Road, and contemptable films like Failure to Launch, Aquamarine, and The Shaggy Dog, Hollywood has been spring cleaning for the last three months.  But, now, we finally have the years first great movie.  I can already see right-wing conservative, Bush-humpers calling this film completely anti-American, and pro-terrorist.  However, what these ignorant people don't realize is this: IT'S A MOVIE FROM A COMIC BOOK!  Please think of it this way: If you had a government that was willingly killing, opressing, and controlling people, I would hope someone would stand up to them.  This film is completely fantasy.  There is only one instance in the film in which it describes America and the war in Iraq, and it really does not take it that much further.Furthermore, the special effects are fantastic, and the Wachowski brothers are able to make everything look so realistic, without getting rediculous and corny like certain movies (Fantastic Four comes to mind).  The performances are wonderful, and Stephen Rea gives his best performance since Interview With the Vampire, and I think he deserves the year's first Oscar consideration (I know it's early).  Hugo Weaving's voice performance of V is good, but it kind of sounds like Mr. Smith with a Guy Fawkes mask.  John Hurt is also great, giving a Hitler-esque performance, from everything from his spitting when he talks to his strong bodily movements.  All he needs now is a moustache.Yes, there are morals to the story, but we have really seen them all before in books like 1984 and Brave New World.  The idea of the dystopia is not a new one, but V for Vendetta displays it in such a new light, and it is really the first to use the dystopia with a superhero figure.  Everything in this film is great, from the story to the acting to the suspense.	5.0	Finally, the year's first memorable film	2006-03-28	7	6	1

It takes every civil rights movement and rolls it all into one. This movie takes a very serious look at the way violence is portrayed in modern society and how it is reported to society as well. There are a few things that do stick out in my mind. One of them is ""We should not be afraid of government, they should be afraid of us"" and look at the last election what we did as a nation to change what is effecting us. Another thing that sticks out in my mind is history and the definition of ""terrorists"". Are the ""terrorists"" coming from an outside source? Or are they coming from within our own country? Are the ""terrorists' acts"" planned from our own country from people that we should trust? Or maybe we shouldn't have trusted them in the first place. If you look at history of the world from the witch hunts to Nazi Germany to modern day government, it is all ""controlled and guided"" by religious zealots trying to ""save society"" or ""save the children"". We should wake up as a ""world"" and save ourselves from them. I am with V in this one; everyone should have the ability to live in peace for whom and what they are. Not be controlled by government guided by religious zealots in how you should be or who you ought to be. Until then, there will be no peace.

'V' is thought provoking and impressive as it delivers on multiple levels.Set in near future London, 'V' creates a compelling story as it extrapolates current events within the dark, brooding themes borrowed from the original ""Phantom of the Opera"". However, 'V' is far from a reprise of the original 'Phantom': although remaining true to 'Phantom's' original tragic love story, 'V' re-purposes the personal to convey its broader, social/political statement.If you're not put off by fairly graphic violence, I believe you'll enjoy 'V' as every facet of this film was well thought out and crafted to strengthen its theme. No clinkers here in the acting department. Natalie Portman, faced with a demanding role, renders a compelling 'Evey' and Hugo Weaving's mysterious 'V' was truly mesmerizing. Excellent support provided by Stephan Rea, John Hurt, and Stephan Fry: they also deserve considerable credit for delivering intriguing, believable characters.'V' succeeds by entertaining and prompting us to examine the conflicts and dilemmas when trying to balance freedom and security."	5.0	Dark and Foreboding - Loved it!	2013-11-13	0	0	0

I thought it was a lot better than you might think from some of the critical reviews, but not something I will go back to again and again.The film, like the book, is set in a future Britain some 20 years after a new far-right party has won power and established a police state. To be, or even to have been, a muslim, gay, trade unionist or a political activist can be a death sentence.The heroine is Evey, played by Natalie Portman, the daughter of murdered political activists: at the start of the book she is rescued from police agents who were about to rape her by a mysterious masked man called ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving. ""V"" does not remove his mask at any time during the entire film, so Weaving has to act entirely with his voice and his body movements, which he does superlatively.""V"" blows up the Old Bailey and announces that the following 5th November he will blow up the Houses of Parliament. He also settles some old scores by killing several senior government figures who had taken part in nazi-style medical experiments on gays and dissidents.The special effects are magnifient and there is some excellent acting: both Weaving and Portman are very good, and John Hurt is superb as the deranged dictator, Adam Sutler.For all that he is playing himself rather than acting, Stephen Fry puts in a great performance as ""Gordon Dietrich"" a broadcaster and comedian who has worked within this system for years but eventually cannot resist taking the mickey out of the government. Stephen Rea is brilliant as Inspector Finch, a policeman who has been a loyal supporter of the governing party for many years but begins to have doubts when he is ordered to track down ""V"".The plot is, in places, very silly. ""V"" treats Evey in an utterly implausible way. The film starts with some misdirected hero-worship of Guy Fawkes, which if you stop to think about it is quite offensive.Fawkes was a very close 17th Century equivalent of the 9/11 suicide bombers, a man who tried to blow up hundreds of people in an attempt to force his own religion on a country which didn't want it, and his legacy was to whip up fear and hatred against people of his own faith which lasted for centuries.And before you ask, we Brits don't celebrate Guy Fawkes every 5th November - we celebrate the fact that he was caught before he and his fellow religious fanatics could bring off their version of the twin towers atrocity.Having said that, if you don't take it too seriously, this film is a good piece of light hearted, escapist fun. Perhaps that's why those who did take the original graphic novel seriously detested it."	4.0	A modern Guy Fawkes takes on a fascist dictatorship	2006-11-15	0	0	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AAY1YLTKK4JC7	"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator"""	"I thought after attending the stinkfest ""Date Movie"" and the painful ""Ultraviolet"" in consecutive weeks I would finally enjoy a movie in V for Vendetta.  How cruel the gods of entertainment truly are.  If I were to watch this film again, I would sneak a sleeping pill about a half an hour beforehand, enjoy the first explosion in the opening scene, sleep through the middle then have someone wake me up for the final explosion.  Explosion, nap, explosion; maybe then I wouldn't have objected so much to having put forth money to see this film.  That wasn't a spoiler either, as we know from the trailers what the ending of the film shall be.Natalie Portman plays Evey Hammond, a Londoner who works for the state sanctioned television network.  It's a London with obvious Orwellian rules regarding behavior, and Evey is caught after curfew by some non-uniformed enforcement officers who are preparing to rape her.  V, played by Hugo Weaving, intervenes and incapacitates the men before they can harm Evey.  He's wearing the mask of Guy Fawkes, an anti-Protestant  terrorist from seventeenth century who tried to kill off the protestant government of England by blowing up the Parliamentary building in London.Soon enough, Evey Hammond is knee deep with V and is forced into hiding after helping V take over a television network.  I guess there's some plot in the movie, since we need to understand how we get from the beginning explosion to the ending explosion.  Fascists are involved, evil pharmaceutical corporations are involved, hypocritical priests and I think they even kill off a Rush Limbaugh type character in the mix.  The message the film sends about the evils of conservatism (of which I personally am one) is heavy throughout the film.  It's an unfair caricature for sure.The obvious political message of the movie could be forgiven if it were simply a better film.  Natalie Portman's performance is unbearable.  It's hard to believe you're in London when the main protagonist can't maintain a British accent.  Portman feels almost lifeless in her role.  I guess that can be understood when you realize the other protagonist is a guy trying to act through a mask.  Hugo Weaving does his best, however it only takes a while to be completed frustrated by the mask.  Not only do we never see any facial expression, Weaving's voice is muffled and difficult to listen to behind the mask.  Eventually it's simply easier to give up trying to pay attention to the dialogue.Not that the dialogue is bad.  There are some wonderful soliloquies and exchanges in the film.  Some.  V is put forth as an extremely witty and verbose former actor who delivers theatric performances as he's starting the revolution.  Those exchanges disappear about 20 minutes into the film.There are some action sequences to the movie.  V carries around long daggers with which he fights.  The expectation of these sequences is very high considering the magnificent history the Wachowski brothers have had in special effects and cinematography with their Matrix trilogy.  However, all the action sequences (excepting the explosions at the beginning and ending of the film) come off flat and uninteresting.  The special effects are lackluster.  Huge disappointment.V for Vendetta is an over hyped movie with occasional brilliance in dialogue combined with lazy special effects, tired action sequences, fatigued performances, plot holes, slow pace and a weak script.  Take a pass and save yourself the time and money."	2.0	Skip it.	2006-03-20	32	8	24
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A158NU1Y2HGA6N	"Martin R. Goss ""People don't plan to fail, th..."	"This film wasn't what I expected, from what I could glean of it from the cover picture and the blurb on the back of the case. I assumed V had a silent role, and that the film would be set somewhere in the former Communist eastern Europe.Once I watched it, however, I ended up getting much more than I bargained for. In short, this movie can be interpreted as a very stern warning to those who abuse power---and reminds us who gave them that power. John Hurt plays perfectly the megalomaniacal chancellor who is consumed by a desire to control everything in sight, and Natalie Portman does an excellent job of portraying Evey, who first regrets being caught up in the deadly game V plays with his former tormentors, but finally becomes his willing tool.I agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie has scenes which appear to be based on events in real life, as well as scenes from other movies. The analogy of the chancellor to Hitler is obvious, with the oversized symbol, marching before the platform, effective use of red and black to reinforce the propaganda effect, and the suggestion of a mentality meant to pervade all; the chancellor's chief servants eventually start to turn on each other, with disastrous results to his cabinet, a clear indictment of the infighting which shook the Bush administration to its core; the subway scene near the end, in which Portman cradles the dying V a la Luke Skywalker toward the end of ""Return of the Jedi""; the ruling party's infuriation at being parodied, so reminiscent of Fidel Castro's ire toward the late cartoonist Antonio Prohias; the ending with thousands of extras which was based on an actual incident in the former Yugoslavia which resulted in the downfall of Milosevic's regime; and V's disguise, his chivalrous manner, and his expertise with blades, so reminiscent of Zorro. V reminds us in brutally graphic fashion why a gentleman should never hit a lady. The only thing absent from real life is the character who holds to account everyone who took part in the conspiracy which brought them to power; presumably, that is the greatest fear of some of our leaders who've failed us (and you know who you are).As for the plot, I found it easy to follow despite its complexity and the penchant which most British film makers seem to have for dwelling a little too much on drama. About the worst I can say of this movie, however, is that Hugo Weaving as V can be a bit of a motormouth, though an impressively prosy and witty one. We eventually realize that a number of elements are introduced into the plot as it progresses, but the makers of this film do a good job of tying up all the loose ends and bringing the bouquet together, as the villainous party members take to feuding with each other as V picks them off one by one... except for the last, who finds out the hard way what it will be like to live in a changed world in which he is stripped of his power. Can you say ""emotionally castrating""?The crowning virtue of this film is the question of V's true identity. We realize at the end that the question is a moot point, but we still want to see the man behind the mask. But then, V wouldn't want me to spoil the ending, now would he?I fully recommend this film. Control freaks will find it traumatizing, but I daresay the rest of us will find it well worth the price."	5.0	Not what I expected from the packaging	2008-06-27	3	1	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3M4BURS1OLYMI	Matt Hargett	The review on blu-ray.com pretty much says it all, but to be more concise:1. The lossless audio track is nice, but only 16-bit. Some of the quieter and louder details that were audible in the theater are muddled on the bluray.2. I understand the extras being produced in 480p, but the trailer not being 1080p is just laziness.Even with these nits, it's a great purchase if priced correctly.

I had heard a bit about it, but I rented it with no real knowledge of what the movie was about or even what genre it fit into. This film is thought-provoking, with excellent acting performances and great action scenes. Hugo Weaving is the absolute standout in this film. As V, he is engaging and interesting. He was perfect for the role and I don't believe that anyone in the business could have outdone him in this role. He delivered in terms of action and dialogue- wonderfully on both counts.Natalie Portman also gives quite a powerful performance. Not to give anything away, the interplay between her and Weaving is excellent.The storyline is unique and is done very well.	5.0	"""blowing up a building can change the world"""	2006-10-02	14	6	8

Intelligent writing and great acting--Hugo in the mask is mesmerizing; Natalie is wonderful to watch; all the other supporting actors are first-rate. A lucidly insightful glimpse at both a potential future AND too-close-to-home  elements of our present time. First-time Director James McTeigue does an excellent job balancing action with wisdom and a touch of irony.Highly enjoyable and thought-provoking, this is a film you will remember long after it's over. Dares to explore--via an action-packed story--what's really behind the BS propaganda that's passed off as ""truth"" in our overly distracted times. Question to consider: How can V be called a ""terrorist"" when his targets are specific people guilty of terrible crimes and ongoing terror themselves--along with symbolic yet empty buidlings--as opposed to ""innocent bystanders"" and/or noble leaders? For example, had he been around in Germany in the early 1940's and taken out Hitler, Himmler and Goebbles while also blowing up the Reichstag and the Nazi judicial court headquarters, wouldn't most everyone cheer him on?

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1KU3UU93ZAY46	Matthew S. Boros	I just saw this movie today and it was f***ing awesome. This is a vision of the near future where democracy dies and dictators rule with an iron fist. This is nothing new. we've seen it before around the world both in ages past and in our own time. The movie even speaks about the fall of America and how our wars have led us to ruin. Opposing the government and state-run media is a man dressed all in black and wears a white mask who carries out attacks on government buildings on November 5 and kills those in power who he deems corrupt. This movie is NOT for children as it is graphic at times and also the storyline of a dictatorship might scare the small kids and make them think that terrorism is an acceptable way to get our governments to listen. This is not politics...this is treason. So therefore I urge parents NOT to let your kids who are under the age of 17 see this movie. I feel that it should be pulled and re-rated NC-17 because it glorifies treason and terrorism even though the government in the film is a dictatorship. If you are willing to overlook the terrorism aspect then this is a really good movie.	5.0	Not for kids	2006-03-17	17	7	10
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1ET1NZ7QZKN6M	Matthew Tundermann	"V for Vendetta is a story representing a future that could very well come true based on how events could play out.  In fact, the world of ""Vendetta"" is very much like what led to the creation of Nazism and Stalinism.  The government uses fear to control and cow its population.  The citizenry cower in their homes and scurry about their business, hoping to remain out of sight and out of trouble.  Isolationism, racism, homophobia, religious radicalism, state manipulation; they all tools used by a Supreme Chancellor bent on consolidating his power and ruling a futuristic U.K. through supreme oppression.Opposing this oppression is a man, V, who represents another form of extremism.  Sometimes blurring the line between terrorist and freedom fighter, V fights against the state for the freedom of the people, yet is also consumed and driven by his own need for personal vengeance.  Having been a victim of a state-sponsored concentration camp and having been subjected to horrible experiments, V is now striking back against those who hurt him.  As a dark superhero, one wants to support V is his desire to brake the stranglehold of the oppressive Chancellor on the population, yet you are also conflicted by V's methods and motivations.  While V explains that what was done to him was 'monstrous', Evey goes further to state that V, himself, is now a monster.Evey, herself, is a woman who's life has been torn apart by the government and initially finds herself afraid to stand up against the government's atrocities.  Through V, she both finds personal strength and enhanced wisdom over the need for radical action.  Her transformation is a painful one and again leads one to question V's methods and righteousness.The last scenes, which I will not spoil, are very powerful.  The symbolism over the fall of government at the hands of the public and the need for citizens to question and act out against an oppressive government are very real ones.  The faceless masses are very artfully turned into individuals as V brings down the establishment.In general regards to the movie, the storyline moves along well.  There is action, but not as much as the previews would have you believe.  I found myself not even noticing as the ideas and controversial questions raised by the movie sucked me into the intriguing plot.  Natalie Portman as Evey, is exceptional, and though we do not see Hugo Weavings' face, his voice and body language bring a mysterious quality to V.  And as you'll hopefully appreciate at the end of the movie, V, himself becomes a symbol for all of us.If you see this movie, think about how close our own society could come to becoming the world in V for Vendetta.  If we allow fear to control us and cause us to give up our own freedom for a perceived feeling of safety, we could find ourselves in a similar world of oppression, fear, and horror."	5.0	Thought Provoking and Slightly Scary	2006-03-21	10	7	3

They fire at him with machine guns until every single bullet out of every single gun penetrates V, which is quite a many of bullets. V falls to the ground, gathers his breath, and stands up. he then proceeds, one by one, to take out the gunmen in the most stylized, elegant, and powerful fight scenes of the whole movie. V kills all but one, the parliment official. The man shoots at V and when his bullets run out, V slams him up against a wall. The man asks ""Why won't you die?"" in which V responds:""Underneath this mask, there is molten flesh, under that flesh, there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.""Perfectly stated, this movie is bulletproof. From its powercharged beginning until the last 10 minutes of cinema glory and sheer, heart pounding adrenaline that is packed into a magnificent, visually stunning close, ""v For Vendetta"" provokes, shocks, both visually and morally, and ultimately provides some of the greatest and most beautiful scenes of imagery ever created in action movies.V For Vendetta takes place in Britain in 2020. The citizens are under a totalitarian government and are forced to do, think, and speak whatever the government tells them. However, there is a restless, relentless man, whom is known to officials as a ""terrorist"" that is determined to bring freedom to Britain through any means possible. Codenamed ""V"", the masked hero uncovers to a female comrad the horrendous past he has suffered through and the uncompromising future he sees for Britain.Everyone who I had gone to the movies with to see this film was absolutly blown away. Though the plot begins to become very slow for about 30 minutes, it kicks back up in a rampage of action, a hailstorm of a story, and, underneath it all, a powerful message to tell people now what can be in a mere few years. Throughout the movie news reports report the devestation that has rocked America, from war to plague, and fear the same happening to Britain.V For Vendetta plays its one of a kind script so well, so amazingly, and so elegantly, while at the same time, so bad-assly, that it soars you through emotions, and invokes you to the bitter end. Give this movie all of your power and attention, because underneath its stylized action, there is a great, powerful message. A plot so well crafted, an absolute beauty in the way it has been produced, that you will leave the theater impowered with such a rush, that this movie will become something talked about for years to come."	4.0	"V"" Will Shock and Provoke Until The Very End"	2006-03-17	23	17	6

Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in ""1984"". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, ""V for Vendetta"" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace.

Some may feel it is trite or superficial, that it's story about an evil regime is single-faceted, but that, in my opinion, is not what this movie is about. Obviously it is on the surface a work of dystopian fiction wherein the citizenry rises up in the name of freedom at the call of an anonymous messiah, but for me, it is a character-driven romance at heart. And though the romance is subtle enough to not define the genre of this film, the slow growth of love, and its effect on the titular messiah's motivations and actions, are why I love this story.	5.0	A Great Movie	2012-07-26	0	0	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"A nation with a long history of democracy succumbs to a totalitarian regime, whose stranglehold upon the population is based upon the spread of fear of fictional disorder & terrorism.  Such is the plot of the sci-fi/fantasy/drama entitled ""V for Vendetta"" from 2005 that is very apropos for today's world.  The film's main character, known only as ""V"" (played by Hugo Weaving), remains hidden behind a mask for the duration of the film, which takes place in a future United Kingdom ruled by an iron-fisted chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  With symbols reminiscent of Nazism and similarities with George Orwell's novel ""1984"", Sutler has imposed a curfew upon the entire country and has banned anything (books, art, films, etc.) that he has deemed inappropriate; but in V's secret home, V has rescued many works in the hopes that one day, democracy and freedom can be restored.  On a dark November night, V shakes the totalitarian establishment by blowing up a building in the heart of London and goes after specific individuals whom he kills and leaves a trademark rose behind.  A young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), is caught outside after curfew by government agents, but is rescued by V, who happens to be out.  With her assistance, V gains entrance to a TV station in London and broadcasts an appeal to the nation to join with him one year from that night to witness the destruction of Parliament, but will a nation's population that has been beaten down by an overbearing government and living in fear break their bonds?  Only by watching this film will you find out, as well as the terrible means by which Sutler gained absolute power.Based upon a graphic novel of the same name by artist David Lloyd, ""V for Vendetta"" is a compelling film whose actors were very interesting and engaging.  Though the film received no Oscar nominations, Natalie Portman won a Saturn Award for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.  The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Costume, Best Science Fiction Film and Best Writing (Larry and Andy Wachowski).  This was also James McTeigue's first film that he was director, though he has much previous experience as a second unit or assistant director for films such as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003), ""Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" (2002), ""The Matrix"" (1999) and ""Dark City"" (1998).  His future directing endeavors will hopefully turn out to be as good, if not better, than ""V for Vendetta"".Overall, the 2005 film ""V for Vendetta"" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to every sci-fi/fantasy film aficionado."	5.0	"""His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words"""	2007-08-11	5	2	3

Swing to the future where people are being controlled by a ""Hitler"" type person played by John Hurt (Hellboy, Love and Death on Long Island) whos really an evil bugger in his role. People have a curfew. Evey played by Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer) gets mugged one night and thats when she is saved. Enter ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving (The Matrix Trilogy, Lord of the Rings Trilogy) a man who hides behind a mask...a Guy Fawkes mask. He sprouts poetry, rhymes and all sorts of good stuff. He's out to get parlaiment and well, do what Guy Fawkes didnt do all those years ago. Evey doesnt know if she can trust this guy because he manipulates with her. She finds out that ""V"" was part of a project that went horribly wrong and he was burned badly hence the wearing of the mask. The dynamic Stephen Rea (Interview with the Vampire, In Dreams) plays the dectective on the case looking to try to bring ""V"" down before he does any damage. Also starring Stephen Fry (Gosford Park, MirrorMask), Rupert Graves (Extreme Ops, Room To Rent), Sinead Cusack (Winter Solstice, Waterland) and Natasha Wightman (Revelation, Gosford Park). I'm sure a lot of people think this is aiming towards Bush and what not but I'm not big on politics so I just see it as an entertaining action packed joy ride from start to blazing finish filled with brilliant performances done by our main man Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman who releases herself from the druk that was Star Wars Revenge of the Sith last year.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.  It isn't a pleasant picture the movie paints, but it is certainly well done and worth seeing.	4.0	GRIM LOOK INTO THE FUTURE	2006-08-05	5	1	4

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"V for Vendetta is one of those must-read comics that I never got around to reading.  I know, I know, how can I respect myself as a well-rounded geek if I don't read everything Alan Moore puts out?  I'm trying to catch up, give me a break.Anyway, my suspicion is that, in spite of Moore's well-known hatred of all things Hollywood, this movie does it justice.  To wit, it's the future.  The United States is no longer the major superpower, replaced by a despotic Britain that has a tight-fisted grip on its populace.  Outside, the world rages with disease (the bird flu), terrorists (including Muslim extremists), and every other ill free society offers. Well, no more.The people have spoken, out of fear, and they have elected Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt with all the bug-eyed spit of a self-styled dictator.  Sutler employs Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) as the chief of his secret service, who goes about ""black bagging"" people who are different: homosexuals, protestors, and comedians.  They're all fodder for black bagging and they're never seen again.The minions of Creedy are known as Fingers, and these Fingers have the run of Britain, including its women.  So it's no surprise when Evey (Natalie Portman, beautiful even when bald) is accosted by Fingers out for some fun.  Fortunately, a man in a mask, hat, wig, and cape known as ""V"" (with fantastic aplomb by Hugo Weaving) comes to her rescue.  Wielding only knives, he easily dispatches her opponents.  Then he shows her his ""symphony,"" blowing up a building and a symbol with a shower of fireworks.Shortly thereafter, V takes rolls out the rest of his plan: he appears on national television to call the citizens to appear on Guy Fawkes Day (November 5).  Guy Fawkes is a historical figure that planned to blow up Parliament with gunpowder, but he was captured before he could pull it off.  Apparently, V plans the very same thing (sans capture, of course).In the process, Evey discovers her past as well as her future. Merely being associated with V is too dangerous to allow her to safely exist, and it's not long before she must make a choice: about being afraid, about being loyal, about being herself, and about her love for V.Skillfully interwoven into this plot is poor Officer Finch (Stephen Rhea) as he struggles to uncover V's background. We learn many things about V, not the least of which that he is an experiment gone awry.  In essence, he is a mistake and a success, the vengeful child of a government that created him.  V is for Vengeance indeed.On a visceral level, this film could just have been about the title: revenge.  But it's so much more than that.  The touch of the Wachowski brothers is everywhere, from the dialogue to the camera shots, beautifully panning, teasing, titillating and mocking with every shot, every sound, and every line.  V is an English-major's protagonist, spouting alliterations and quoting Shakespeare.  Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.  See, now they've got me doing it!""V"" inspires you like that. Yes, there are obvious jabs at current events.  If anything, they're too obvious.  The film doesn't need to have watchwords like ""avian flu"" and ""terrorist"" interspersed throughout.  The message comes across regardless of the setting: the price of freedom is fear.Give it up at your own risk."	5.0	The Price of Freedom is Fear	2006-04-02	12	10	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ	Michael K. Smith	"For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel -- a ""comic book"" -- and they immediately write it off as juvenile. Some of us know better, though. The fact that the story a movie came from appeared first in another graphic medium has very little to do with anything. You have to evaluate the film on its own merits. This one is a combination of adventure fantasy -- bigger-than-life hero vs. superbad villains -- and political cautionary tale. It's a couple of decades in the future, the U.S. has collapsed economically and politically and is mired in civil war, and England has fallen into an authoritarian, fascist nightmare, largely with the acquiescence of its own people. Into all this steps a man in a Guy Fawkes mask with a vendetta against those in power for what they did to him in his earlier life. In the book, V's cause is anarchy; in the film, it's English freedom. (Alan Moore loathed the change in theme as ""Americanization,"" but revolution plays better in Hollywood if it's in support of democracy.) Though we never see the real, damaged face of V, the voice behind the mask is that of Hugo Weaving -- and a great voice it is, too. Natalie Portman plays Evey, the only survivor of a family that was wiped out piecemeal by the fascists, and the story also is about her climb up from constant fear. John Hurt is excellent as Sutler, the frothingly menacing Head Chancellor who glares out from an oversize TV screen like Big Brother in ""1984."" There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high-security places to commit his executions. On the other hand, the Wachowski brothers also were responsible for the ""Matrix"" films, so you know the sfx are going to be above average -- especially the final shoot-out in the tube station and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament as witnessed by thousands of Londoners in Guy Fawkes masks. Not a bad flick, and it's obviously destined to be a cult film, but it would have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book."	3.0	Alan Moore was probably right	2009-11-10	3	1	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1YLN3C5UIKKOX	Michael Tozer	"Yes, ""V"" is for Victory.  And the victory here celebrated is the triumph of the individual over the state.  This is the essential and overwhelmingly powerful message of this most important film.The movie is set in a futuristic London when a fascist government has seized power.  ""V"" is the shadowy anti-hero who, tortured and disfigured by totalitarian government agents, launches his own program of retribution, brilliantly begun on Guy Fawkes Day, the anniversary of history's first ""false flag"" operation, and played out to the strains of the magnificent ""1812 overture"".In an early scene, a beautiful young woman, stranded after mandatory curfew, is about to be set upon by tyrannical government agents.  ""V"" comes on the scene, saves her, roughs up the government thugs, shelters her, and reveals to her his fascinating secret life, all the while hid behind his enigmatic ""Guy Fawkes mask"".  His story is compelling.  He is the perfect anti-hero.  And yet, the young woman can't accept the brutality of his vendetta, until she herself experiences the evil of the government's torture regime.  In time, the romance that develops between the young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, and ""V"" is as wonderful as is the movie's terribly important philosophical message.Also, early in the film, the Rush Limbaugh figure of the government controlled television station is seen watching his own ranting relative to the now devastated former United States of America and bragging as to what he would do if he ever got his hands on the ""terrorist V"".  Of course, the lights in his luxury abode go low, and then, who should appear, but ""V"".  It is positively delicious.  ""V"" always leaves a red rose at the conclusion of his grisly work.As the plot unfolds, the working class stiffs of the fascist state begin to see more clearly through the government propganda they have been ""spoon fed"" through the media.  ""V"" plans a final climax on, of course, Guy Fawkes Day, a year following the beginning of the action.There is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.  The beginning scene describes the false flag operation of the ""Gunpowder Plot"" used ever since to offer a rationale for ever increasing government control of the populace.  And the climax, the actual destruction of the Parliament drips with historical and politica significance.  In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.  It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.  No wonder neoconservative Trotskyite apologists like Michael Medved hate this film so much.  It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.  A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.  In your face, Michael Medved!The final scene is breathtaking.  See it.  And keep in mind ""V's"" admonition:""Remember, remember, the fifth of November,Gunpowder, treason, and plotI can think of no reason that gunpowder treasonShould ever be forgot"".This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time!"	5.0	V is for Victory!	2006-08-05	8	5	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L	Michael Valdivielso	First, I will not compare the movie to the book.  Both have their own pros and cons, good and bad points, and while are close have different themes and come at those themes from different directions.V the movie is about a terrorist who demands that the people of England make sure a totalitarian government is held accountable for its actions.  He is a terrorist trying to get back at those who harmed him in the past.  And in doing so he may end up freeing the people from a Fascist government. But the movie delivers its message of liberation in a wonderful way that could only be called a form of art.  Hugo Weaving as V is such a good actor he can project his feelings and emotional reactions from BEHIND A MASK.  Natalie Portman, while not as powerful or as skilled as Weaving still holds up her part of the story as Evey.John Hurt as the leader was, for me, a great pick.  He was W. Smith from 1984's Nineteen Eighty-Four so I find it ironic.  Stephen Rea as the police detective is a good balance of smarts and loyalty to the government to make his character just THIS side of reality.  Stephen Fry's character brings a little more reality to the movie yet also adds the one moment of disconnect for me.  The idea that he would get away with broadcasting something on the telly that was not approved by the state-run media does seem a tad unbelievable.Add explosions to the great characters, a solid story, important themes, great fight scenes, and what you get is a Four out of Five film.Overall I enjoyed the movie even while I am also a fan of the book - to me there is no conflict.  Fan of the book or not I suggest, strongly, that you give it a try.  Rent it or get it out of the library.  I bought my copy and will very likely watch it a couple of times before my DVD gives out.Just remember, it is Rated R, so not for kiddies.  And at 132 minutes you will want lots of yummy popcorn.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"I've never read the graphic novel on which James McTeigue's ""V for Vendetta"" is based, but together with the late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, McTeigue certainly makes it unforgettable on the visual level. A sort of ""1984"" crossed with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (the last of which is a major motif in the movie), ""V for Vendetta"" is the often gripping tale of a masked avenger wreaking havoc on the leaders of a brutal, neo-Fascist totalitarian regime in mid-21st Century England. Murderously intolerant of anyone who isn't a straight, fundamentalist Christian right-winger, the dystopia of ""V for Vendetta"" has parallels to those created in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Fahrenheit 451,"" as well as some uncomfortable parallels to political and social realities in present-day England and America. McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when--particularly toward the end--its story doesn't make a lot of sense. The Wachowski Brothers' script is less interested in creating a cogent rationale and timeline for the story than in creating opportunities for making things fall down go boom; the final scenes, though visually brilliant, pose more questions than they answer. (Sure, the brothers are portraying a society in chaos, but the screenplay itself can't be chaotic.) It's a big help that the supporting players are some of the greatest talents in British Rep. Actors such as John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Rupert Graves, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact. As the masked avenger, Hugo Weaving works wonders with his body and voice, but can only partially overcome the handicap of the smirking, immobile Guy Fawkes mask he is forced to wear throughout the movie. As the young woman who becomes the avenger's helpmate and confidante, Natalie Portman is not as good as she was in ""Closer"" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the ""Star Wars"" movies. In all, ""V for Vendetta"" is an entertaining if not totally satisfactory entry in the action-comic book movie genre."	4.0	Three-and-three-quarters stars.	2006-03-26	4	2	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"The Wachowski Brothers, of ""Matrix"" fame, adapted ""V for Vendetta"" from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, moving the action further into a dystopian future where Great Britain has exchanged obedient consent to totalitarian rule for order and peace in a world beset by violence and chaos. A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself ""V"" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found ""V for Vendetta"" mostly tedious and generally bland. ""V"" could as easily stand for ""verbose"" as ""vendetta"". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but ""V for Vendetta"" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.Much has been made of the idea that ""V for Vendetta"" casts a ""terrorist"" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So ""V for Vendetta"" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see ""The Battle of Algiers"", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. ""V for Vendetta"" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is ""Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta"" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving. They discuss the film's themes and some aspects of adapting the movie from the graphic novel. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French (Canadian)."	3.0	A Pyrotechnician with Little Spark.	2006-08-11	31	11	20

It reaches down into the very root of the modern political warmaking machine and totally debunks the War on Terror (TM) (copyright) with all its sloganeering and xenophobia. I'm not sure the latter was intended by the movie's producers... it looks more like an attempt to analyze the mindset of hyperambitious politician-types. Nevertheless, the larger message becomes hard to avoid as the movie unfolds because it mirrors our government's actions post-911.If you're into feelgood fairytales, this is clearly not the movie for you.	5.0	The farcical WOT	2010-07-31	4	2	2

We miss the opportunities that are placed before us to see and then do something about it.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	As a film fan, I have seen too many shabby comic adaptations, and truthfully too many films which only act intelligent, and are indeed not so.  This film dispels both of those commonplaces, and really is one of those films that a fan like me waits for, if only to remind myself why I go to the theatres.To set-up a basic introduction, first you need to know that this takes place sometime in the future, in the United Kingdom.  The world is very different, as the US is said to be in turmoil, while Great Britain indeed looks very powerful and strong.  Or so says their media, because in the movie's not too distant past Britain was controlled (through elections) by Sullivan (played by John Hurt) who is as much a 1984 Big Brother, as he is a president.  This is why we meet the 'terrorist' V, and Portman's character Evey, who together have both in their own way suffered under Sutler.Enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.  Because once again, this film is smart and action-packed (thanks Wachowski brothers!); this is indeed too often becoming a rarity.  One more positive note, is that even though the situation is foreign (and not just by nationality), there is some commonality for all to relate to and dig into.  So, what can I say, except see it, like it, love it.I hope you do.	5.0	A for Awesome	2006-03-17	47	36	11

The acting is great, with the faceless Hugo Weaving playing V with great physical presence and an intelligent voice. Natalie Portman turns in one of her best performances here which shocked me to say the least.  She even looks hot bald! The visuals, music, set design, and action scenes are perfect without being overdone. This is a thinking action film, heavy with smart dialogue and interesting ideas. Some people are looking for a buried political message about our government in this movie, but it is based on a graphic novel written long ago. The government in the film has more in common with the Nazi party and Hitler than anything going on today.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2XVA2OGDYKKD	Monsieur Valentine	"I would have to liken this experience to that of 'fight club', to some degree. Very pleasant surprise. The previews would have you believe this was going to be another mindless punch up, but riddled amongst the ""pow"" and ""bang"" we have a very intricate story about society. Being an avid fan of post-apocalyptic stories, I had read the graphic novel by Alan Moore many years ago. So I was worried what hopeless experience lay before me at the cinemas. But to the credit of the interpreters, this onscreen adaptation was for the most part, well crafted. The ideology, the philosophy, mostly intact.I am glad the movie doesnt turn this adult world into a childrens story. The action, like the comic book, takes a big back seat.I dont exactly remember the specifics of the graphic novel but I do recall some differences. The graphic novel was based on a post nuclear world. Not post-viral. And I do recall a monumental ending when Evie was suppose to take V's identity (the mask).Some key failuresIt failed to communicate the necessity of torturing Evie. It only brushed on the idea of 'losing fear'. I remember when I read the comic book, that part was absolutely monumental. It was the soul behind the story. You can not live until you accept death. If you want to detach yourself from the system, you must first break yourself... and learn to accept fate whatever it maybe. Only then can you go forward. Much like a comment I remember in 'Band of Brothers' when before a battle, the captain told his scared soldiers, ""only when you realise you are already dead, will you find courage"". And much like a person immobolised by fear, paralyzed by a system because they dont want to lose any more than they have... they must first accept 'losing everything' before they can actually learn to free themself.The second major idea I didnt see much of was the chaos theory. V's method was based on the idea that only choas will bring the right equilibrium.One area I wasn't to keen seeing was image of him walking out of the fire like some action hero. It wasnt necessary to present V as 'superhuman'... he wasnt greater than man. And that sort of iconic figure only served to reduce the realism of a 'not too distant future'.In fareness however, I walked away from this movie with some new experiences. The movie was a lot more relatable to current politics. It raises controversial questions (where does revolution end and terrorism start). And if you play close attention to the subtle parallels, it played like a MICHAEL moore story. Propoganda... Code red's... terrorism... bird flu virus. I guess it all depends on how accepting you are of your surroundings."	4.0	A really good movie actually	2006-03-31	9	8	1

I haven't read the original story/graphic novel, but I really enjoyed the visuals and idealistic beliefs portrayed in the film.We do live in a world where the majority of the people are silent, because they lack the conviction to say something.  We do live in a world where governments silently threaten the majority.  We are in a world where governments do not act on behalf of the people [who voted them in], but instead act on their own agendas.  We do live in a world, where sometimes a vendetta by those agrieved by political hurts is the only way of expression.

I had high hope for this movie as I hoped that the Matrix producers had recovered the fumble  of Matrix: Reloaded and the pass for an interception aka Matrix: Revolution. However, I was a bit disappointed of how the movies politics seemed crammed in there to fit todays headlines. Don't get me wrong, I'm what people would call liberal, but I feel that it was just too extreme. The action sequences were great though.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AVL2U08IZ3B6I	M. Rhodes	"""V for Vendetta"" is a highly intelligent, fascinating and ambitious movie. The filmmakers present a story that dares to be thought provoking, unsettleing, and inspiring all at once. A cautionary tale which shows a disturbing future where it may not only be possible but all too easy for a liberal democratic society to willingly give up its freedoms and embrace a fascist ideology.To make such a film was courageous. Presenting a movie about a terrorist/revolutionary in this day and age of extremist violence entailed risk. It's a compelling, character-driven story that functions on many levels. A suspense thriller, a mystery, a political film and an action movie. The plot causes the viewer throughout to question whether violence is justified, whether the end justifies the means, and the definitions of terrorism, revolution and heroism.Captivating moviemaking and splendid performances by all members of the cast, especially Hugo Weaving as ""V"" who was nothing short of brilliant (his inspiring speech at the TV station alone is worth the purchase of the DVD), Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea as well as the cinematic irony of having John Hurt in the role of a power-mad maniacal dictator considering the fact that he played the part of a character who questioned the actions of an opressive government in the film 1984.The plot changes and twists as the story unfolds are unique to this film.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AKYNIMNI8LOBP	"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems"""	Let me preface my review by first saying that I am not familiar with the original graphic novel, so my review will be based on my reaction to the movie alone.What I am most impressed by is the commentary that is quite naturally found in this movie.  The theme is quite old, but wonderfully universal--the abuse of power by the powerful to entrap the common and weak.  Because of that, the movie makes not very veiled references to George Orwell (by not only using John Hurt, who starred in the movie 1984, but to dress him up as Big Brother from that movie and have him appear, through most of the movie, on a large TV screen) and even George Bush (with a second-in-command that smacks of Dick Cheney).  Though the references seems a little cliche at times, they are quite effective.  This is the greatest strength of sci-fi--to investigate present times and comment upon them in a form that doesn't seem like political commentary.  This was the purest strength of The Matrix--a movie, essentially, about the removal of humanity from an electronic world, and how to become human once again THROUGH that technology instead of DESPITE it.In this movie, we have an England that is run by a hard-edged morality that outlaws and bans what it doesn't like.  V, after a chance rescue of Evie (Natalie Portman), begins to induct her into his plan to free England, in much the same way as his idol Guy Fawkes attempted back in the 17th century.  But of course this time around, the stakes are higher, in that a mysterious biogenic weapon has created a lot of hysteria about terrorists and has given the government power to keep tabs on EVERYONE (sound familiar?).  Evie begins to investigate the truth of things, and everything unfolds from there.Some criticisms of this movie have decried the close connections of V to actual terrorists, but V clearly has a purpose to bring society together rather than tear it apart.Hugo Weaving, a brilliant actor (Mr. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.  And the idea of plans within plans falls through a little bit, leaving some confusing movements towards the end, but the extent of the conspiracies presented here will keep necessary arguments going on for years.  The plotline of V as somewhat superhuman didn't quite seem to fit into this movie--it would seem that he would have been just as effective as someone who hadn't been 'enhanced,' but perhaps this was an element of the graphic novel that held more purpose there.In all, this was an excellent movie.  Exciting, action-packed and meaningful.  Great work.	4.0	Wachowski fan...not familiar with the graphic novel	2006-08-17	5	3	2

So why do I need to add mine?  Because, I love this movie that's why!!!  Great plot that is easy to follow.  Great photography.  This film looks great.  Great supporting cast from the lead detective, the news anchors, the chancelor and all the rest.  Wonderful.  Then there's Natalie Portman.  She could easily have become an over the top super heroine, but instead maintained her status as one of the common folk dealing with circumstances.  She was terrific. Finally, when it comes to acting, Hugo Weaving who wears a mask through the whole film delivers a complex character, making him human, caring and frightening at the same time.  He does it without the benefit of facial expressions, although through his body language you can imagine his expressions.  Now there is an excellent piece of work.  All of these fine performances are done in what is almost a comic book movie.  V is a hero for the masses, almost a Batman against the establishment.  I've seen this movie several times and have enjoyed it every time.  This one goes beyond the action film.  This one gives characters with depth.  It does have a lot of violence in it and some of the fight scenes are of the Aeon Flux or Ultraviolet or Matrix variety, but still above average.  This one is easy to recommend to others.	5.0	Already over 400 reviews here	2007-09-15	5	4	1

I won't even bother arguing with those stereotype right-wing reviewers coz I know that I can't change their mind. Stereo in greek means ""solid"" for their information. Solid like rock or stone you know. So there is no sense in trying to write for pages trying to convince those guys that this movie is just great. They r strero types, solid types, hard to change and it costs a lot for them to feel anything. Ironically the movie is really making fun of those types in the first place in a very brilliant way. To make those sterotypes as annoyed as myself I am thinking of getting some fake reviewer ids and get logged on and rate this movie with 5 stars for several times.I recommend all open-minded people this movie which helps us to understand the world of today better. Especially Valerie's letter in the movie written in prison is soo touching and emotional.The moviescript in the whole movie is so great and it is so brilliantly written.The music is great. Especially it corresponds to the feelings of the characters so well.

Anno	"V for Vendetta, a film version of Alan Moore's graphic novel, is set in a futuristic totalitarian Britain and peruses the chords of politics through the vengeful eyes of a mysterious, masked rebel-fighter known as ""V"". Produced by The Matrix's Wachowski brothers, and directed stylishly by then-newcomer James McTeigue, this roaring, action-packed flick manages a rare brand of intelligence and lucratively enthuses the idea that citizens run by governments are nave to the confines of such leadership and are too quick to conform. V for Vendetta perpetrated Hollywood's long-since-owed delivery of a film equally rich in smarts and entertainment value--somewhat of a rarity in the sci-fi and action genres, lately."	4.0	V for Vendetta (2005)	2010-02-17	1	1	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3B5G1NTQUINEJ	"Nathan J. Graham ""Cosmic Pope"""	"First some important items you should understand to put my comments into context: 1) Moore's ""V For Vendetta"" books are some of my most treasured books ever.  2) I am generally VERY critical of adaptations, and almost NEVER have been fully satisfied with any of the adaptations I've seen of materials I liked.  3) I went into this movie expecting it to be a steaming pile of ick, largely because I couldn't bear to hope for it to be good.That said, I think it should be mentioned that -- regardless of how much you actually wind up liking this movie -- you will probably like it more if you see it after having read the source material.  Some few readers of the book may hate the movie for its many changes, but I think most of those who appreciate the books will find that their appreciation for the movie is deeper and richer.  For me, almost every scene in the movie pulled up memories of the subtleties, the details of the original material.Now for my thoughts on the movie.  Others (GP Padillo, A.Sandoc) have aptly reviewed it in general, and said much what I would say in that sense; the moviemakers changed things around significantly, but it remains a rather daring statement for the times... it can easily be dismissed as stereotypical because it is archetypal, mythological... it's not by any means a perfect film or adaptation, but it did very well in bringing the story and feel of ""V"" to the theatre.  I even liked the occasionally heavy-handed current-events nods, like the avian flu on the news, or the orange-suited prisoners in hoods.  Honestly, I found myself shocked that I liked it so much, given how much was changed around, usually that really annoys me and ruins the movie for me.  But I found myself moved, enjoying it, happy with it.  Well done!Since others have said so well the general things I would say, I want to bring up some specifics -- mainly, I want to mention some of the elements that were changed, and what effects those changes had.  (SPOILERS galore, of course!!!)-----First off, in the very beginning, Evey was NOT going out on a date.  She was haunting the mostly-uninhabited Westminster ruins as a first-time prostitute, trying to make some money.  I suppose this might have been a little harsh, and made it hard for some viewers to identify with her as they were supposed to.I was a little disappointed that there was so little exposition about the Eye, the Finger, the Ear, etc, in the scene with the Finger thugs -- like there was in the book.  It set things up nicely.V's first explosive essay was NOT the Bailey -- it actually WAS Parliament!  The whole area of Westminster had been abandoned for years, and blowing it up was a finishing of old business, so that new business could begin.  I suppose I can see why the filmmakers would make Parliament the climax instead of the opening, but I think they could have left it as it was.Evey never worked in the television station, in the book.  I believe she was impoverished and out of work, desperate for money for food.  Which was why she was driven to prostitution.Gordon wasn't a gay television show host in the book... though I did find his character to be not only a good one overall, but an interesting element in the philosophy of the movie.  But in the book, he was a rather macho, mostly-okay booze-runner who eventually got killed by Ally and the rest of Creedy's gangster thugs.  And it was after he got killed that Evey got captured and put into solitary - during an attempt to kill the thug Ally, who murdered Gordon.  Her captor took Evey before she fired the fatal shot.Which brings me to Creedy and his gangster thugs.  First of all, Creedy took over for Almond in leading the Finger, about halfway through the book.  In fact, Finch clocked him one out of rage, for being a jerk, the first time they met, over Dascombe's body.  In the book, Creedy eventually began developing an intricate plot to take control from the Leader, and this involved getting in with Helen as well as violent criminals and powerful gangs, who did work for him under the table.  This became a rather crucial plot device.They completely cut out Derek Almond (head of enforcement, known as ""the Finger"") and his sad wife Rosemary.  Almond occasionally worked with Finch in a capacity similar to that of the ""Dascombe"" in the movie, but they weren't at all partners, just heads of their mutual organizations.  Almond was a rather despicable person overall, greedy and petty and ambitious.  And his mistress Helen, wife of one of the other Fingermen, had him nearly completely manipulated in a scheme to power, as she did various others.  In the book, Derek Almond died trying to stop V from leaving Dr. Delia Surridge's place, in a scene much like the one at the elevators in the movie (except V didn't need saving by anyone, he was just ridiculously fast).Dascombe wasn't Finch's sidekick in the original material, nor was he the head of any governmental organization - he was a minor techie working for the Voice of Fate, and it was strongly implied that he was gay or bi.  (So they gave the co-worker part of Almond and made it a character called Dascombe, and they took the gay element of Dascombe and made it a character called Gordon, and the actual book characters of both Dascombe and Gordon are gone.)  Instead of some elderly station manager getting gunned down in a V costume, the book had it as Dascombe, and instead of towards the beginning of the story, the invasion of the tower was near the end.  After Derek Almond died, his sad abused wife Rosemary became desperate, started sleeping with Dascombe to have a place, but when Dascombe died at the station, she went into the gutter and started dancing at a strip club cabaret thing.They didn't do the faceless Voice thing with Prothero, they made him a personality instead.  They also  cut out most of the elements of V's vengeance on the Voice of Fate (Prothero).  The terrifying abduction on the train, right under Almond's nose (one of my favorite parts).  The Vaudevillian elements of V's vengeance on the Voice.  The whole re-enactment of the prison camp at Larkhill.  As well as Prothero's doll collection.  Unfortunate.  And they have Prothero dead instead of gibbering, when he is returned.  They did hint at the Larkhill bits, in other parts of the movie, though.They cut out pretty much all of V's monologue on infidelity with Madam Justice, on the Old Bailey, before blowing her up.  In the book he delivers a biting, sarcastic monologue to Madam Justice, accusing her of cheating on him with the Leader.They left out V's ""Vicious Cabaret"" song.  The also left out everything to do with the Land of Do-As-You-Please.  =/When she was with the bishop, Evey didn't try to betray V, but played her part perfectly.  Also, in the book, V's encounter with the bishop was when he played Mozart's Fifth to block out the Ear - not in the encounter with Creedy, which didn't actually occur in the book.  I have to say, I rather missed the scene with V at the door facing the bishop, growling, ""Please allow me to introduce myself...""They cut out the destruction of the Ear tower which provided the citizens with privacy for the first time in decades.  They also cut out the character of Dominic, who was Finch's aide, and replaced him with a ""Dascombe""/Almond mixup - and Dominic became very important at the end of the movie.They didn't really give the Leader as much depth in the movie as they did in the book - this is actually one of my only really big complaints.  In the book, he was disturbing, he was mysterious at first, but you gradually came to understand him as a human, however tyrannical and unpleasant.  But in the movie he seemed little more than a raving dictator, a talking head representing evil government.  If you read the book, you can feed in the other elements a bit, but even that isn't very supported.  Also, they left out the Leader's love affair with the Fate machine towards the end of the story.They left out the fact that Finch was tripping on LSD during his visit to Larkhill.  They left out the Leader's realization that V had enjoyed total access to the Fate machine since the beginning - Fate had cheated on the Leader, with V.  They cut out Conrad and Ally killing each other, and Helen's fall from power.It wasn't Creedy who killed the Leader, it was Rosemary, the poor sad widow of Derek Almond, who had taken and lost Dascombe as a lover, then been degraded as a cabaret dancer.  And it wasn't Creedy and his men who gunned V down in the end -- it was Finch, freshly returned from said hallucinatory foray and still a little confused, instinctively doing what he felt was his job.As I mentioned earlier, the abandoned buildings of Parliament had been the first to go, so the explosion at the end of the book - the area above the subway - was actually the destruction of Downing Street.And finally, the scene with the hundreds of thousands of citizens dressed as V simply didn't happen.  In the original material, there were people crowded around to see if V would return or if he was really dead like they had been told; and V did indeed reappear for them, though it was not the brutal and monstrous V of the previous age.  It was a V reborn phoenixlike from the ashes and rain, a new symbol for a new era.  And of course, since they left out Dominic entirely, and made everyone V instead of just the one person, they left out the scene where the new V introduces Dominic to the Shadow Gallery.-----So anyway.Despite ALL of that... I really like the movie.  I loved it.  Which baffles and shocks me, really.I will be buying it on DVD, in the best SE format they can deliver.  I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to watch this movie, and even more so, to read the book(s) -- there are 8 issues, collected in one trade paperback or hardcover, printed by DC/Vertigo Comics.I can't quite give the movie five stars -- it would have to have been much more perfectly adapted for me to do that.  They would have had to cut less of it out.  And that would have required Moore being involved, respected, and influential in the making of the film.  But Moore has refused out of hand to get involved in adaptations of his work, and for the most part, I can't blame him.  So it's four stars, though I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.  But that's enough of my rambling -- go see it.  Go on!  Now!"	4.0	WAY better than I'd feared it would be.	2006-04-10	0	0	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	After watching the big screen adaptation of V For Vendetta, it's safe to say that I don't blame Alan Moore one bit for not wanting anything to do with it.  After seeing his From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and now this made into films, it's of little wonder why he wants nothing to do with the movie industry.  That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future; one of which is becoming more and more frighteningly real by the day.  Natalie Portman is a combination of worthy and wooden in the role of Evey Hammond, a would be everyman who gets involved with a Guy Fawkes-mask wearing terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving, surprisingly perfectly cast) who plans to strike back against the oppressive British rule.  The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re-created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director; but Moore's message gets lost in all the glossy action.  John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.  All in all, Alan Moore's comic may be much more worthy of your time, but the film adaptation of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, which in itself is quite a surprise when you think about who all was behind it.	3.0	Meh...read the comic instead	2006-08-03	5	2	3

I'll keep this short and sweet, and not delve into a whole mess of politics and plot discussions, as many other reviewers have done for the title, but instead, offer only my unflinching opinion into the Spec-Ed. DVD and the movie itself. I was first impressed with the production values of this movie. It is very well done, with a decent script (although title character V mutters so much political mumbo-jumbo at such a high pace, you may want to watch a second time with sub-titles on). Of corse, I have herd much hate twards the film from parties expecting it to offer either a more political view, or more action. In short, the political ideals presented here are nothing revolutionary, but mearly ment to make you ponder about how quickly human beings are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Admist this out-lying message, and montage of revolution, there are several well thought out fight scenes and sly assassinations carried out by V, leading up to the films ""revolutionary"" climax and Matrix-esque slow-motion ending that everyone has been talking about. In a nut-shell, it attempts to be both political and violent, but in the end masters neither aspect. However, if you go into the movie with an open mind, I doubt you will be disapointed... If you are expecting harrowing, controversial political ideals and messages, or the blockbuster action film of the year... well, look else where. As for the DVD itself, I was impressed by the special features offered in the Special Edition. While the second disk isn't quite as spectacular as I was hoping, it still includes a fine amount of featuretes, making the Special Edition far superior to the average cut of the DVD."	4.0	explosions, revolutions, and ideals abound	2006-08-01	3	3	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A16682UK6O6P4I	Neo Noircat	Alan Moore usually can't help but tell the truth. A progressive socialist by nature, in The Watchmen his villain turned out to be the left wing progressive, his heroic, self-sacrificing anti-heroes the right-wing zealots Moore claims to deplore. Sadly V for Vendetta was an earlier Moore comic book, written well before Edward Snowden revealed to the world that Obama's surveillance of the American people is worse than Bush on steriods (and W never used intel to demolish domestic political opponents and surppress the opposition vote as Obama and the IRS did), so all the bad guys resemble Rush Limbaugh,and the evil government is a bunch of Christian zealots. Yawn.The hollowness of this argument is proven by the fact that the mask from V became an icon of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but there was so little reailty to their vague political opinions and demands that, unlike the Tea Party, OWS completely died away.	3.0	Intelligent, but omits the fact that fascism comes from the left	2014-01-18	2	1	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3SU3TXON36T0X	"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos"""	"_V for Vendetta_ is a film adaptation of a graphic novel which pits an anarchist protagonist against a fascist government.  The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood.First, the movie raises the issue as to whether violence in any form is ever justified.  Obviously the absolute pacifist ethic runs into severe problems when put into practice and in extreme situations in which one must choose between one's own life and the life of a perpetrator.  Even the idea that one should never initiate force (although which may allow for force to be used in defense against force) runs into difficulties when faced with familiar scenarios such as a mother using force to prevent her child from running into traffic.  To this extent, I agree with the movie that force is permissible as a defense against unjust political regimes.  The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.  Thus, the destruction of parliament by the (ambiguous) ""hero"" V is justified in the movie through the idea that it represents a symbol of a corrupt regime that must be toppled.  Secondly the movie raises the issue as to the unethical nature of state sanctioned scientific experimentation on unwitting individuals.  Both totalitarian states and the United States government have engaged in such experimentation (consider for example, the CIA's experiments in mind control and LSD research).  To this extent, I agree with the basic message.However, despite my reserved agreement with this movie on these two points, I must note that its message is severely damaged by political correctness.  In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.  Despite the current regime's claim to be ""conservative"", Bush is in fact nothing of the sort.  The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties of American citizens.  (Your property can now be confiscated by the state to generate greater tax revenue according to a recent Supreme Court decision.)  Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.  Illegal immigrants continue to overrun the United States (as well as Europe).  And, valuable resources are being wasted on a senseless war in Iraq.  Whether the Democrats or the Republicans win the next election the results will be the same:  greater state interference in the lives of ordinary Americans and the continued threat of ever greater globalization.  In the movie, Christians and ""fascists"" play the role of unambiguous ""bad guys"".  The bishop who appears in the movie has an unsavory sexual appetite and is involved in the creation of the death camps.  Homosexuality is glorified and made to appear a victim of a fascist regime.  In today's world, political correctness is by far the stronger force and the various communist regimes which have been propped up through the help of finance capital are never mentioned in the movie.  While the fascists and Nazis murdered approximately 25 million individuals, the communists may have murdered as many as 100 to 200 million.  This difference is staggering.  Certainly government can be a great evil, but by painting all enemies of political correctness as proponents of the state, this movie has severely undermined its own premise.  This is especially ironic given the way in which politically correct forces collude with the state to censor and promote violence against those who disagree.  It is in this respect, that I firmly oppose what this movie stands for, despite its apparent philosophical interest."	2.0	Philosophically Interesting but Marred by Political Correctness.	2006-05-03	48	13	35

This is a descent movie, however, I think the concept and the story is better suited for graphic novel medium and doesn't translate as poignantly as a film.  Film, books and music are often warning us to mindful of our goverment and how easily we can slip into a totalitarian rule.  Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.  Yet as a film, this one is missing some things.  I never truely contected with V.  There are a few scene when he comes off looking rather silly (cooking-kissing).  Weaving, likely a strong actor with a very theatrical voice, the mask was too cold a shield for an audience to connect to.  At the very least I would have liked to see his eyes.  Something for him to become more real to me.  Portman's character could have just as easily been taken out.  I know what she was suppose to symbolize, but, eh, I wanted her to be more involved in the revolution and I guess I wanted a bigger revolution than what was delivered on screen.  Again, it's a good film, just not a great one.	4.0	Expected more	2007-05-12	4	1	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A38UBVJEV1LLS7	NorthofCB	Poor Alan Moore has been a tortured man for some time. Two of his graphic novels have been turned into what can only be called - crap. However, V for Vendetta does not suffer such a fate. There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining.V for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow. Portman is a joy as usual (not always). She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey. I was disappointed that they changed her profession (readers will catch my drift). However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer. V is well cast as well. I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face-to-face.The political aims (Bush etc.) in the film are fairly open, and can sometimes be distracting. However, as a whole the film is true to spirit of the novel. The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life. I also think that the ending scenes are beautifully handled as the country transforms from a society of drones to one of individuals. I think that most anybody can enjoy this movie, if only for its incredible action and surprising sensitivity. Remember, remember this film forever.	5.0	A Worthy Adaptation	2006-03-18	12	6	6

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1FVUVE3PHN9DB	notthatimportant	"I've seen the movie just recently without ever seeing the comics the movie was based on. Because I had no information about the story whatsoever because of that, I didn't knew what to expect. That said, I came open-mouthed and close-to-speechless out the theater. Maybe because movies of decent quality seem to be quite rare these days, but the quality of ""V for Vendetta"" itself was also part responsible. Why do I say this? Well, after I woke from that 'shock', I began to analyse the whole thing like I would everytime I see a movie. I came to the conclusion that it is still of such remarkable quality to give it 4 stars, yet it falls short on vital places, which a classic 5 star wouldn't.I don't know if I should credit/critize the following points on the movie or the comic. Since I never read the comic, my logical descision is that I just credit/critisize the movie, even though the script and/or dialogues are most probably directly copied from the comic.Lets start off with the things ""V for Vendetta"" does remarkably well: Dialogues and action. ""V for vendetta"" opens with a quote from a song dating back to 1826 (yes, I did some research) which sets the tone for the rest of the movie just right:""Please to remember the fifth of NovemberGunpowder, treason and plotI see no reason why gunpowder treasonShould ever be forgot""These subtle quotes add an IMMENSE amount of atmosphere to a movie, and here is one done right. You feel the tension when the quote is spoken, you can taste history behind it, and you can guess what one might value it. When the story continues to the point where V and Evey meet, another non-quote comes up:""This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is it vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin van-guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-? -vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V.""The paradoxical intention of such lines are brilliant; the whole theater was blown away by the extensive use of his intellectual vocabulairy, yet it closes with the simplistic, subtly funny paradoxical; ""you may call me V"". It may seem cheesy if you don't see it as part of the movie, because it works so well in there. The paradoxical setting continues throughout the rest of the movie, V having both a human side and at the same time beeing a monster with revenge as only intention. They even literally mention the paradoxical setting in the following line:""Of course you can. I'm not questioning your powers of observation, I'm merely remarking on the paradox of asking a masked man who he is.""A brilliant line, one of the best I've heard in a LONG time.The dialogical brilliance continues with lines that sometimes are not that deep or intruding, yet make a great contribution for the whole package, and let you understand more about the situation at that point, one step (line) at a time. For example:Evey Hammond: ""Artists use lies to tell the truth. Politicians use them to cover it up.""On the one hand when she says this, she mentions that it's a quote from her father, which reveals how involved their parents actually were in the tradegy of manipulation and rebbelling against it, and therefor gives a hint that Evey most probably will follow her parents footsteps with V.On the other hand, when you see V's reaction on the quote beeing like it could almost come from him, you understand the intangable relationship between him and Evey. Why he felt meeting her was no coincidence, why she understands the things like he does. He even marks his actions with that quote: it's part of who he is, and more importantly, it's also part of who Evey is.Thirdly, it ofcourse reveals the situation, beeing it covering the truth. I'm not sure whether you can call Sutler an artist and if the quote even refers to the almighty indoctrination of lies, but it does give the viewers a hint of what to come.I can go on and on about the dialogues, but let's move on: the action. Seeing this movie would probably be the best if you see it in the theater (ok, most movies would), because of the intense feeling of the music coming up with every big event (first and last event of the movie). It gives the symbol of explosion extra meaning like V says. Not because the music does it, but because you as viewer 'feel' with the music, and therefor feel more for the explosion than just the action, and consequently, give the explosion the meaning of a symbol.""The building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by their people. By itself, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people, blowing up a building can change the world.""When it comes to the action scenes itself, they are great, but not brilliant. But I'm not sure if the movie needs ""brilliant"" action scenes, because now they are only great, and therefor leave the story upfront, instead of seeing it as ""just an action movie"". For example: The blowing up of the monument in the first part of the movie, gives the V character more depth; it's not just the 'nice' guy that rescued Evey with it's wonderfull speech, no, from that moment you know that there is something more about V, something darker, something you do not know yet and therefor keeps you interested in the story.Like most movies though, ""V for Vendetta"" can't keep the brilliance. And the faults lie in ""what has been done"" and ""what could have been"". When you see the beforementioned kind of brilliance in a movie, mediocre parts are devastating. And that is what happens here: the mediocre parts should have been better, and great parts should have been brilliant. Who's to blaim? Maybe the director? I don't know, possibly. Maybe an example would clear things up: The relationship between Evey an her parents seem untouched in most of the movie, but when it does show up, it must do it with a bang. You should care for it, feel it, be intrigued by that relationship. Instead, you feel almost nothing. Yes it's horrible that the parents are taking away in front her, but it doesn't leave an impact as it may sound. Again, I don't know where it goes wrong. Is it because the ""black bag"" synonym is explained so losely? Is it because it serves only a tiny part of the whole story? Maybe, again, I don't really know, and that's whats bothering me. Another prime example might explain more: When Deitrich get's taken, you as viewer don't feel it as such a tradegy as it should it have been. That's most likely because Deitrich is for the viewer just a random person. The movie don't show how the met, it doesn't really show their relationship, it's more like a person she know and the viewer doesn't. This is exactly what I mean with loose relation to the story; if the movie doesn't show the background of things, scenes aren't what they could have been. If, for example, Deitrich was an old friend of V, you probably would see more background about Deitrich, making it reasonable for the viewer that he was taken away, and therefor care much more for the personage. Instead they just let him make a show making a fool of Sutler, and is taken away like a random character.The fact that it's such a short piece of the complete story seems a reasonable explenation, in fact, the 'small part syndrome' happens a lot more in ""V for Vendetta"". Things are shown, yet it shows it with so little depth that it almost seems irrelevant for the whole picture, and therefor leave you untouched. I know they need to keep the movie at an acceptable length, but doing that makes a lot of the scenes fade away.About the cast; Hmm, I'm not sure. A part of me sees the scenes where they did an unbelievable good job, yet the other part of me knows that the lack of 'feeling' in a lot of scenes might be the 'fault' of the actors. But because I can't say for sure, let's just say they did great (some better than others, Natalie Portman outshines Stephen Fry in almost every scene).To conclude, ""V for Vendetta"" is great. The dialogues are superb, and the action is to support the story. Yet some scenes are not as great, mostly probably because they get too little relevance to the rest of the story to be of value, and therefor leave you untouched where it actually should have touched you as a viewer.80/100 = 4 stars."	4.0	Great movie, but seems to fall a bit short to be a classic *some spoilers to illustrate certain things*	2006-04-02	13	11	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A366IQ55BNPIZ8	Not Usually Hard To Please	Is this movie exactly the same as the graphic novel?  No.  Is this a good movie?  Absolutely.  The adaptation makes a few changes, especially in the final third or so of the story.  Some of the changes are good, some are bad, but for the most part, this is an outstanding movie that manages to be faithful to the source material while still forging its own path.  The emotional lynchpin of the story remains intact, and that alone is enough to have me recommend it to anyone who likes good, well-told stories.  I confess, while I am a fan of several of Alan Moore's works, I don't hold the man in the same high regard that he holds himself.  With that said, I would have been proud to have my name on this movie, whether or not it was word for word my story.  Very highly recommended.	5.0	God Is In The Rain	2006-08-03	5	4	1

C'mon, folks: Guy Fawkes was an orthodox (NOT HETERODOX) CATHOLIC; the ""Remember, remember the 5th of November"" was an ANTI-Fawkes, anti-Catholic, pro-Parliament, pro-government nursery rhyme (read the rest of it); the government insignia is a blatant bash of the Papal Cross made into a fascist symbol (if you did this w/ any other symbol of any other faith or denomination, you'd get crucified: no pun intended).

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1CJ94WJDD7X7G	"OceanOrigami ""Sam DeRenzis"""	I chose this rating because rarely do you see a film this interesting, engaging, and thought provoking. Basically it's an unknown man named V out for revenge because of the abuse he suffered at the hands of scientists and the government. He gained enhanced reflexes through the experimentation that was done to him, loosing his memory but not his heart. Nothing here is boring, nothing here is insulting to our intelligence, We even find ourselves questioning V's motives at times yet accepting also he is semi-crazy from the whole ordeal. V won't ever be normal so why bother? Time for a little kicking butt and taking names! That's also exactly what he does, he teaches them all a lesson they'll never forget.I love this for its clear message that letting people control you for anything is WRONG and that law and justice don't always stand side by side. Justice&#62;Law here and we see it in every action he takes, even semi-brainwashing his captive so she will go along with his plans later. You could say everyone in the film is brainwashed except for V who through pain and misery snapped out of his dreamland. Indeed it's not really for his revenge but to avenge the treatment of 2 lesbians at the hands of the government. I suspect also V wouldn't have been so interested in getting that revenge had they not tortured and been experimenting on him. In that way I consider both the cause for his acts.I definitely felt sad to see V die, he stood basically alone in the entire story until the end. I think he knew it would end with his death or theirs, maybe even both. I'll need to read the comic and so will you!	5.0	Simply great	2014-02-15	0	0	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A13FBTZ8SO8T3D	o dubhthaigh	Lord knows what bug Alan Moore has up his bum, but having read the COMIC BOOK and seen the film, I don't get what the brouhaha is all about. He and David Llyod collaborated on a COMIC BOOK, not Moby Dick. If there were concerns on an artistic front, Lloyd would be the one, but this is essentially a COMIC BOOK story fleshed out with live actors and special effects and it's all extremely well done and true to the source, i.e. a COMIC BOOK.As a movie, it's a lot of fun to watch, and makes a lot more sense than the soft-headed geeky-theory of The Matrix trilogy. It's all derived from Orwell, of course, but the effects are good, the acting is over-the-top without resorting to Star Wars platitudes or Johnny Depp ham-fisting, and there is a point to the story, and given the political climate in the world today, it is hardly far-fetched. There is a fair amount of ironic US-bashing, well deserved and on target, and the England on offer here is Margaret Thatcher's wet dream. That may tell you a little bit about the times in which the story was conceived, but to everyone's credit, it is told crisply as though it were a straight narravtive. That helps enormously in a film. The director got the point of letting the graphics help tell the story and set the tone. Nothing is gratuitous, and that's notable all in its own right.My quibbles with the film are slight: sound balance is way off: Hugo Weaving's dialogue is in such hushed tones that I was constantly adjusting the volume to hear him recite Shakespeare, then backing it down for the explosions. For that matter, it may not even be Weaving behind the mask. His voice over might well have been phoned in. V nods toward Eavey or one of the other characters, and there are action sequences, but nothing to suggest that Weaving is actually there. Still, it's a good film.The extras are for the geeks.I go back to the Moore dust-up. My guess is he's a stereo-typical art student who wants to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. I suspect it's all contrived anyway. As David Lloyd opined: if he is that upset, give back the check.For everyone else, enjoy the film, it's a good story that ought to be told in these times.	4.0	Truth is, the story is timely and very well done	2006-08-21	11	4	7

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A5ZVJ9A6H1YL1	papaphilly	"""V for Vendetta"" is a return to the political science fiction movie.  Part ""1984"" part ""Soylent Green"" and part ""THX 1138"", ""V for Vendetta"" explores the political climate of a country that has gone too far down the road of facism in the name of safety.The movie explains through the back story that the United States is in a state of civil war and England has been through its own version of troubles , but has avoided the problems the States faced through a very conservative government based on safety.  The problem is that the government has taken control of the lives of its citizenry.  Big brother has developed and the state controls the media.  A figure only known as ""V"" emerges and terrorizes the government.  ""V"" originally saves the character Eva in the begining of the film from government agents and then slowly turns her into a revolutionary by the end of the film.The film is a study of what happens when a government creates a monster.  The monster turns on the creator.  The film is very dark and shot much of the time in shadows which heightens the intensity beautifully.  Stephen Rea is wonderfull as the chief inspector trying to prevent a revolution as well as looking into the government corruption.  Hugo Weaving is good as V and John Hurt makes a creepy high chancellor.  Only Natalie Portman is wasted here.  Not that she is bad, just underused and could have been played by any young and up-and-coming actress.""V for Vendetta"" was originally a graphic novel and was written as a critique for the Thatcher government.  The film has been updated to include a observation of Bush's war on terror.  That if the safety issue is taken too far then society will rise up.  This is a very good film and thought provoking.  Not of all of it is easy to understand and you can't help the feeling the good guy is really very bad also.  My only criticism is that the film borders on a couple of genres without deciding which one to become.  It is certainly suspensefull, but it can also be sci fi or a political movie.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A12ANFNOSMW5VD	"Penfist ""Dulce bellum inexpertis"""	V for Vendatta is a movie about terrorism, anarchism, vigilantes, corrupt governments, trading false security for liberty and many other politically charged ideas.The cinematography and acting are wonderful. The political messages are ultimately polarizing and confusing.The film tells the story of V, a man who has been tortured and experimented on by a near future totalitarian and corrupt British government. V is a superhero or supercriminal, depending on your perspective. He's really both. Was his soul stolen by the government or did he lose it wreaking his revenge throughout the course of the film?All of the main performers are over the top. V's prose throughout the film is wonderfully spellbinding. I found myself alternately loving and hating this man.Many of the political issues addressed by the film are very valid. Americans and Europeans are in the process of trading basic liberties for a false sense of security. Just ask anyone who has flown on a commerical flight recently how free they felt during the in-processing.However, the imagery and ideas presented in V for Vendetta are over the top and the problem solving methods used by V pure fantasy.The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable. The important message contained within is that complacency is the recipe for loss of liberty. Interwoven throughout the movie are several love stories. Mostly though, the movie is about power, corruption, resistance and vengeance.	4.0	Many valid questions with few meaningful answers	2006-08-11	5	4	1

It had everything, most notably it wasn't a movie that was made for everyone in general. The Wachowskis have done something that is far better than the Matrix trilogy, not for its' action, but for its' plot. And I thank them for making a movie that actually makes a person use their brains. The musical score was absolutely stunning for lack of a better word.My final sentences are BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT, I mean actually sit down and watch it, and think about how much this is on par with Orwell's vision in 1984.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A26JEW1XARYUNO	Peter J. Ward	V for Vendetta, the film, is certainly not a bad movie but it is a poor adaptation of the brilliant graphic novel.  If you, like me, found the comic book version of V to be deeply moving and influential, I can't recommend that you watch the movie version.  If you haven't read the comic, go ahead and see the movie, but then go and read the far superior book.Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (surprisingly) both provide very solid performances as V and Evey, and the design of the film was perfect.  My only problems are the changes to the script which diluted the original story and replaced it with a happy and unambiguous ending.  There are at least four important scenes in the original book's narrative; V's backstory, Evey's imprisonment, the history of the woman in room IV, and V's death.  The film only gets two of these scenes done well (the imprisonment and the woman in room IV) while the other scences were deleted or changed in ways which made them meaningless.Judged on its own merits, the movie is not bad, but anyone who is interested in the storytelling should read Alan Moore's graphic novel instead.  Had the movie stayed true to Moore's original exploration of totalitarianism and anarchy, this could have been a masterpiece.  As it stands, its an engaging piece of entertainment but not anything more.As a contemporary political movie, I was impressed that the movie was so willing to address issues of terrorism and treason against a totalitarian state.  Even if the movie was flawed, it opened up a much-needed dialogue about the extent of governmental control during an endless war on terrorism, and the low worth of a society which values its security over the freedom of its citizens.	3.0	Despite very strong actors and current political ramifications, a let-down to a long-time admirer	2006-09-08	9	4	5

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A33XHXRTRZOQ12	"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man"""	"Here is a classic plotline co-opted so many times, I've lost count! ""Brave New World"" has been the ghost behind ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""THX1138"", ""Gattika"", ""1984"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". Oppressive, sprawling government plows on unchallenged, until one individual decides to rebel/conform/escape. In the case of ""V For Vendetta"", we're talking a rebellion based on the inimitable botched plot of Guy Fawkes, on the fifth of November, 1605. A character, who we only know as ""V"", saves a media go-fer, played by Natalie Portman, just as she's about to be raped by two ""enforcers"" of the fascist government that has come to rule all of Britain and Lord knows where else, as the USA has declined into chaos and lost its position in the world. This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes ""mask"" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent ""expression"" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured ""V"", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's ""Nineteen-Eighty-Four"", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, ""V""'s essential ""sidekick"" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.""Blackadder"" and ""Wooster and Jeeves""'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with ""V"".There is a Mephistophelean quality to ""V"" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as ""V"" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well! Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?A VERY intriguing movie that gives the whole ""1984"" storyline a new spin. Purchase if you dare!"	4.0	Aldous Huxley strikes again!	2006-08-05	3	2	1

And every time I watch, it still has the same powerful effect on me.Although the action is good, what makes this movie truly great is the message it conveys. After you watch the movie, look out of the window, you will see that the movie is playing in real life in the ""good ole' America."" In V's words: ""There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting submission."" That's not what happens with the fictional Britain in the movie. It's happening in the U.S. with the Patriot Act and the like.More than just pointing out the objective reality, the movie will give you a sense of hope. It is really moving to see thousands of people in their V masks marching in unison. It's a powerful force that once released, no government can contain.So as the Fifth of November is coming, watch the movie and remember that: ""People should not be afraid of their governments.

Being disfigured beneath the mask; I still wanted to see the face of the man.  What type of life did he lead before this?  What was his job? What made him want to act? These are all unanswered questions that make the movie less.  I didn't read the graphic novel.  I intend to if it answers any questions the film didn't.I would have liked to have seen the Wachovski's first pass at the script.  It might have provided more answers than this final version.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3PVSNS17HCIXN	pizowell	"That's exactly what I was thinking while watching V for Vendetta.  The hero is, yes, a terrorist - a well read, articulate terrorist who loves music and old movies and has plans to change London by blowing a good deal of it to smithereens, unseating a fuhrer-esque dictator of a totalitarian regime full of shadowy underlings from power and, in turn, give the city back to its people, for, as V himself says, ""People should not fear their governments, governments should fear the people,"" or something to that effect.  V spends a good portion of the film donning his mask and debonair get-up as he dispatches one by one a group of people with dark ties to the masked avenger himself - think secret government-funded experiments, concentration camps, etc.  He reaches out to the people of London by highjacking the television airwaves to deliver his message of revolt.  He rescues and befriends a cute-as-a-button Natalie Portman.  He blows some stuff up.  And, one year later, he plans on destroying Parliament.  Talk about a revolution indeed.As action films go this one certainly has a bit of brains and is, by far, better than most.  Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore who has universally hated all of the big screen adaptions of his work and subsequently had his name removed from this film, but nevertheless accepted the check, I'm sure, and cashed it hastily.  The Maxtrix team wrote it - the  Wachowski Brothers - and it is directed with style and flare by James McTeigue.  Good show!  Did I mention how cute Natalie Portman is?This movie might not have been made a few years ago.  That was another thing that kept crossing my mind while watching V for Vendetta.  I'm not quite sure what the message of the film is, if any.  Can terrorism be justified?  Interesting.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1IEIXRE1VJOF	"P. Parikh ""Dantes' Ghost"""	"""V for Vendetta"" is one of a few films in recent memory that transcends its current socio-political environs and reaches across the vast expanse of historical precedent, social experience and collective conscience. Precious few works of art in our post-modern era of self-aggrandizement have accomplished such feats with such ease. We are presented with warnings of ghosts past, portends of an ominous future and lessons to be learned once again by our increasingly complacent populace.To look at this film and its cogent sense of perspective, one must verily understand its reference to historical periods, though often lauded, present us with a multitude of lessons to remember. The fall of the Roman republic, the Inquisitions, religious zealotry and its brethren political arms, McCarthyism, the reactionary fascism of the 20th century culminating with the death of millions, leading to a climax of our current climate of religious fundamentalism, the subversion of individual rights, freedoms and free will to the grander view of the state.Individually, the film has deftly used symbols, referenced symbols and discussed symbolism to achieve its aim. Symbols are both powerful subservise agents as well as liberating ones. Subtle and not so subtle references to the idolatry of the Third Reich, the mind numbing rallies and heils of the rallies at Nuremberg, the talking heads of our current media machine, the garb of Abu Ghraib inmates, and the inimicable face of hero/revolutionary/terrorist Guy Fawkes all serve as poignant reminders of what we are to be seeing in this film.The selection of Hugo Weaving, in and of itself is a triumph; his voice, his mannerisms, all lend themselves to the somber , sobering, pensive yet expressive timbre of the revolutionary that we long to hear in times of need. Witty use of alliteration, references to the morbid Macbeth and the flighty Twelfth Night only add to the illusory world that our hero both leads us into and out of. Fawkes' coutenance only lends itself further to the idea that our real world and our real personas lie beneath the surface.Perhaps the most relevant and wonderful reference is to that of Edmond Dantes. V's struggle parallels Edmond's to the T. Imprisoned in a tower, receiving notes from a stranger, escaping, living a life of luxury free want want, surrounded by great works of art, yet still hidden from his true self, tormented by demons long thought exorcised.  Vengeance, remembrance, forgiveness, redemption and love.. all motifs that run deep through the undercurrent of this film, and throughout its historical and literary reference. All of which add to the  power of its message.Are we to be supplicants to the state; at what point do we fear the direction that the collective has taken on behalf of the individual. Orwellian references aside, more powerful and sinister forces are at work around us.. and what we are presented here with is a well crafted, cogent message to be heeded. Not mired in the muck of the usual superficial  Hollywood 2 hour long drones, V for Vendetta is a feast for the senses and a veritable smorgasbord for the mind."	5.0	A thought provoking, inspiring, chilling yet subtle reminder of lessons learned, and lessons easily forgottten...	2006-08-20	10	5	5

Any movie that moves people so obviously to extremes must have something to say. I don't know anything about liberals or conservatives or any of that nonsense. I do know that I watch the world around me and I am often bewildered and frightened at the implications for the future. I don't care which side of the political opinion fence you fall on. This movie is thought-provoking in a way that is quite rare for Hollywood-produced films. I guarantee that whatever your beliefs this film will make you uncomfortable and make you think. I believe this is a film that will become more revered with age. Sure these are themes that have been seen before (it was based on a graphic novel written in the 1980's after all) but I think the themes are still very important today. You may not agree with the point of view, but any intelligent person can look around and see that we as a human race are at the boiling point once again. Unfortunately this isn't the first time we've been here, and it won't be the last, I'm sure. But maybe if we could stop throwing insults and bombs at one another long enough, some of the themes raised in this film could benefit from authentic discussion. Sadly, this probably will not happen anytime soon. But it should.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3HGLP26MPOK92	"R. A. Bean ""filmfanatical"""	"This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same goverment that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independant, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!I have to note that it's a neat coincidence that this is set in the year 2020, just like DePalma's ""Mission To Mars"". People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independant thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Micheal Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is concidered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We are quickly declining into a fascist state as long as our current president is in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definetly time to stop all of the hate crimes! Has anyone ever stopped to think that when the Twin Towers fell in NYC, they ""imploded"", like a building would do when it is being demolished and bombs are in the BOTTOM of the building, not near one of the top floors! Has anyone ever questioned why Bin Laden's family got free air flight out of the country the day of the 'terrorist' attacks??? And, why did the president feel the need to go after Sadam when it was allegedly Bin Laden that we should have went after? More questions than answers. It's because the terrorist act was committed by our very own government! And I have noticed that after they started taking God out of the USA, the USA has gone downhill like a bobsled on a THICK sheet of ice. I don't mean ""religion"", for God and religion are two seperate things all together. And, I don't mean to sound as if I'm defending any kind of religous zealots (fanatics), like our president, who is doing all of this in a very scary religous fervor, while countless people 'sleep' and declare him the best president ever.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A4DTOO95QUGQT	"Randall Brooks ""Author"""	"This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece! And, I really love how it just rips the whole fear fueled by the media/fascist government/terrorism by our own government wide open. It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a facist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created.This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a facist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country! I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes!This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast!

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AXK5GN8DXB80X	"Raymond M. Rose ""Rainman"""	...I actually liked this movie. There are changes. Changes in comic book story from the original material to movies happen way too much in Hollywood for my tastes but they happen. Why movie execs can't trust the decisions made by writers in other mediums is beyond me...Still, V shines through. I liked the beefed-up character of Evey. Natalie did a great job. Her acting was spot-on! Sometimes the visuals were amazing. Sometimes they were too Matrix for my taste. The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask. Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea. John Hurt was truly frightening as the Chancellor.There were some things I would like to have seen from Graphic Novel. I would like to have seen the train scene in the beginning and I think it would have been better if they had kept in that a computer was basically running the government. Also, I wish they had gone into Finch's transformation at Larkhill a little more. There was more character development in the graphic novel.Things I'd wish they'd not had in the movie: too much of a love story between V and Evey. The end seen with the Fingermen and V was too Matrix and too Crow! And too gory. Blood was on a minimum through the whole movie (and I'm complaining here because I'm squeamish - far from it) and then you get to the fight between the Fingermen and V and there's blood flying out in great splashes. It was uneven with the rest of the movie.Overall, I liked the movie. It was solid, entertaining, and well executed. It didn't make me think as much as Allan Moore's graphic novel did. But then the day that Hollywood realizes that comic books can be great source material for more than just action/adventure movies... well, that will be a revolution!	4.0	As a fan of the graphic novel...	2006-08-07	5	4	1

So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this ""fascist"" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is ""People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people.""  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit ""right-wingish"" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but ""right-wing""), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.And in the end of the film where we see a ""mob"" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2FBT2R7U2X2WR	R. Durham	"As an initial comment, I have not yet read the original graphic novel, although I would like to when I get the chance, but I have read another of Moore's dystopic creations (also soon to be a movie) ""The Watchmen.""  At any rate, my appraisal of the movie is not based on any evaluation of the accuracy (or apparent lack thereof) by the movie in creating a film replicate of the graphic novel.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure why a film MUST adhere to the source material.  Such criticism is only worth advancing if the film's deviation fails on its own merit, which many here believe, while I do not.This is the only review I've ever spent much time on, if I even have other reviews, and I only bothered because it seemed like most other reviews were one-sided (pick one side or the other).  Either people saw this movie as ""telling it like it is"" and sticking it to the neocon fascists in the Bush administration (whom I firmly believe possess either a profound disdain for the rule of law, or, a disturbingly cynical view of what ""the law"" is, but whom I do not believe are personally evil people with per se malicious intent), or, people saw this as the wet dream of rabid and radical liberals frustrated with their inability to really advance an alternative vision or to successfully promote their view of what American values are.  I do not think this movie fits either description.I like this film, not because I am some blind Bush-hating, liberal (or fill in whichever other stereotype you wish, as I've seen too many in the preceding reviews to cover them all).  I like it because I think the CORE message, at least the one that resonated with me, was depiction of the natural and easy tendency within free societies, to cede liberties and adherence to the rule of law, rather than the rule of men, in order to obtain greater security, when those societies have long enough enjoyed their liberties as to have either, forgotten what life is like in a society which has made such an exchange, or, the society has enjoyed the benefits of liberty and the rule of law so long that is less appreciative  of both its benefits and its demerits (i.e., diminished physical security).  I like how the film manages to show that when the people cede power entirely to the government, by giving up the principle that the law governs, not men, and giving up the liberties which maintain that power, the security achieved is short-lived, and the people soon find themselves facing a different fear and threat to their security from those to whom to they ceded power.Perhaps this is a movie only someone like me can love while still being aware of these flaws and contradictions; someone who believes that the only thing that keeps our society from descending into cruelty, tyranny, barbarism, and disorder, is a strict adherence to the principle  expressed in the maxim popularized by Lord Mansfield in the Somersett case: ""Fiat justitia ruat caelum"" (roughly, ""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."").  I love it, not in ignorance of its not-too subtle, and inartful jabs at contemporary society and politics, but in spite of its bludgeon to the head on those points, and in spite of its failure to address its own glaring inconsistencies.  I care more about that over-arching theme, I suppose, than the particular elemental details which bother me, as well as most of those who categorically dislike the movie.I am rather young (@25) and perhaps my political views are merely developing, but I neither consider myself liberal, moderate, nor conservative.  I find myself uncomfortable occupying any perspective for too long, or at least, occupying any entirely.  For me, the appeal of this movie is its points on the importance of why the law, and not men (or humans for those who insist on PC language over John Marshall's), must govern.  Yes, the movie definitely takes aim at the current U.S. social and government situation.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  Criticism, especially of the government and our own society is not only at the origin of this nation, but that upon which its vitality depends.  As a third-year law student, looking at entering the legal profession, these themes resonated strongly with me, though I can see why they might resonate less strongly with those for whom a passion for the rule of law ranks below what they might themselves call ""practicality"" or ""realism"".  But again, that's what I like about the movie, even if it is so blunt as to be insulting about it (I'm cynical enough to think that blunt may often be necessary for clarity): that fascism and tyranny always begin from a point of ""realism"" and ""pragmatism"".  The law exists in order to temper passions, and temper the reason of the day, with the longstanding wisdom of forethought and basic rules by which a society and government decide they will conduct themselves.  The movie definitely hit my passions there, and that's why I love it.  I think it quite dramatically displays why the law must rule, and why, whenever one begins to think there is good reason or some exigency which justifies abrogating this basic principle of ordered civilization, that such thought must be rejected.However, my reason for liking the movie also leads to the list of things I found troubling in this this movie, many already mentioned:-V's own inconsistent stance on the use of violence and terror as just means by virtue of the justiciable quality of the ends to which they are employed (from the view of the one employing those ends).  I think the directors failed to explore the fine line and the biased nature of the distinctions between ""criminals"" or ""terrorists"" or ""murderers"" or what-have-you, and ""revolutionaries"" or ""freedom fighters"".  We clearly think that some who violently rebel and engage in violent resistance against a government are praiseworthy, while we think others that are, at least facially similar, are quite the opposite.  Why this is so, and the legitimacy, if any, of our distinctions is not really explored or challenged.  V is accepted as a ""revolutionary"" and the government as ""tyrannical""...These labels are presupposed, and one either accepts or rejects them, but there is no exploration of why they are so.  I thus find myself disturbed by the ferocity of V's violence against individuals who are merely pawns of the tyranny he opposes, and his casual justification of why it is just that he decide what is right and wrong, while it is unjust that the current government do the same.  The validity of these distinctions would be far more interesting, and isn't explored.  Thus, for me, V for Vendetta is loveable because it gives due credit to the importance of the principle of the ""rule of law,"" but disturbs me, and appears to suffer for undercutting this principle at the same time, by failing to distinguish the ""hero"" and his ideals, methods, and justifications, from those of the ""villains.""-the stylized violence typical of movies these days is all the more out of place in a movie that purports to tell a story of ""heroes"" who value human life and liberty more than do the villains;-while I'm not sure what sort of ending I would have liked, I do not think the blowing up of Parliament suits a story that does not have the original source's more anarchic endgame in mind.  I thought the ending was appropriate and stirring up to that point: the marching by the unarmed civilians against the army, that passive non-violent resistance, I thought, better resonated with the themes I loved about the movie which I thought were also its best qualities.  The destruction of the building was a distraction from the real triumph: that the people, unarmed, and in the face of threats to their lives, nevertheless, boldly marched forth to reclaim their liberty and their rule, by law, rather than by the will or whim of men (be they many or few).  THAT was the climax of the movie for me, and I wish THAT had been built upon more, rather than the FX extravaganza and ""WOW"" or ""Cool, dude..."" effect of blowing up Parliament.So, in sum, I found much to love in this movie, but what I loved, also leads me to wish the directors had been as introspective as they demand their audience to be, and addressed these more significant conflicts in character and socio-political philosophy, rather than simplistically defining the good and evil characters for us.I very much appreciated the way in which the ""rule of law"" as a principle is celebrated, and the dangers of the rule by human will or whim of the day are demonstrated, but thought the directors ignored the obvious fact that the hero himself, as a vigilante, necessarily engages in this same moral failure.  They obviously are aware of the conflict, as demonstrated by the several instances in which Natalie Portman's character questions, or condemns V for his tactics, but they do not really satisfy me (or many others it seems) with their explanations.Again, perhaps this is only a film only a person passionate about the law, and who has an occasional tendency to become unreasonably idealistic at times about his passions and ideals, can enjoy at those times, while realizing that the movie only matches those ideals in its broad themes, but utterly fails them in the details when examining the characters."	4.0	A Defense of V	2007-11-10	3	3	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1FITMT5NWZWYY	Reality Check	Anyone who thinks that there is some sort of moral ambiguity in this movie is completely delusional and semi-brainwashed. Despite all the comparisons to Bush and Cheney that exist in the movie, lets face facts, the regime in this movie was a Nazi style government which is much worse than the Bush Administration, and that takes a lot of hard work and determination. This was no pseudo-democracy, it was outright fascist dictatorship with no civil or political rights. Englishmen have revolted and overthrown kings twice in their history for crimes that pale in comparison to the crimes of the regime in this movie. America was founded in a revolution that is considered glorious, against a regime that was nothing compared to the one in this movie in terms of evil. And yet the absurd debate goes on, should V have done what he did? Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? IS V A TERRORIST??? If that is the question you come away with after watching this movie you truly are brainwashed, the question you should come away is how a terrorist regime like the one in the movie could achieve power and sustain itself. They are the real terrorists, not V. Again I ask what else V could have done? Submit or fight are the only options! There comes a point in the most radical regimes where peaceful protest is punished by death, then what? Submission or fighting is the only choice! There was no alterative to what V did except submission. And to those who would say that peaceful measures should have been followed and glorified instead of violent resistance. you are living in a fantasyland. Tanks in China crushed the pro-democracy movement of peaceful protest in, remember? Do you think peaceful protests would have stopped Hitler? If you think V is a terrorist for seeking to overthrow a fascist, racist regime that had killed 100,000 of its own citizens to guarantee its power, and experimented on V himself in twisted fashion, then you must also think that every partisan group that fought the Nazi's in occupied Europe was a terrorist too, that is certainly what the Nazi's said at the time. So therefore if you buy into V being a terrorist, or even if you try to equate V with the government in this movie, instead of seeing that the true terrorists were the fascist regime that started everything to begin with, you are thinking like a Nazi and identifying with the regime instead of with the person resisting the regime. It is not ok to fight against Nazis anymore, to stand up to them? If you stand up to Nazis you are a terrorist? Then the French Resistance was a terrorist organization and the Nazi's were the victims? Or there was some sort of moral equivalency between the Nazi's and the French Resistance just because they both killed one another? Such a contention is patently absurd, the Nazi's started the war and the killing and the only way to stop them was to kill them. V was in the same position in this movie. Sometimes you have to fight, sometimes the evil men have to be killed. We all know this to be true, there can be individual terrorists but there can also be terrorist states, just because a government exists and has power does not automatically give it some sort of moral high ground. Men who felt as V did killed Nazis in World War 2 and the world is better off because of it. That is a fact. Even Bush supporters know that some governments are no good and need to go, and supporting revolutionaries in those countries can be a good thing. What about Sloban Milsoviec? They should not have had a revolution and overthrown him? Complete submission and a total abdication of any willingness to fight is simply a recipe for success for despots like Hitler. America's founding fathers knew this, and it is simple common sense. Sometimes Revolution is necessary, sometimes the government itself is the problem. Coming away from this movie disturbed by V's actions more than you are disturbed by the governments actions shows you have crazy priorities. If you should not rebel against a Nazi style regime that kills its own people, strips them of all rights, experiments on them, then when should you rebel? Apparently never, no matter what. I suppose that there should also be a debate about rather or not V should have blown up the camp where he was being experimented on in order to escape. Obviously V should have just submitted to the medical experiments, blowing up the facility and saving his own life as well as stopping the sick experimentation that was being perpetuated on him was obviously a terrorist act, since the camp was state property, and whatever the state does it is automatically right, all the time, forever, and we should NEVER,NEVER, NEVER, EVER resist, EVER!! Give me a break! V was no terrorist, the true terrorists were the people he got rid of. Not everything can be solved by talk and peaceful protest, that is a lie you are taught to make you submit. Even if you do not agree with me at least ask yourself this question, if V was not right to start a revolution in the circumstances he was in this movie, then when is it right? Is revolution always bad no matter what? How bad does it have to get before resistance is ok? When can you resist, what has to happen to make resistance ok? If we followed the philosophy of those who think is a V a terrorist any semblance of modern democracy as we know would never have existed, it did not just happen, people had to fight for it. People have forgotten this, cowardice and submission to authority does not equal patriotism and virtue. If you do not believe me, find out what the founding fathers or those who fought against Nazism had to say. If they did not fight, injustice and evil would have reigned more supreme than it eventually did anyway. Sometimes violence is necessary and justified, we all know this.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ANUBY6KOT60WH	R. Galeano Valencia	"The Wachowski brothers' virtual opera prima (The Matrix Trilogy) is one of the few movies that I have absolutely and completely watched in awe. I was totally taken by surprise by it, as I never expected such a genre to  be so thought-provoking and deep to the point of pure and plain philosophical despair. Back then I even dared to define the ""Trilogy"" as ""subversive"" due to the unparalleled analogies between the fictional virtual world of Zion and its unbelievable reminiscences of so many realities in so many levels...However shocked by The Matrix Trilogy, I still believed it to be just a lucky strike in the elusive and unknown world of a pair of siblings who call themselves the Wachowski Brothers.My perception about the Wachowski's, however, drastically changed (and how) after watching the anarchic ""V for Vendetta"" (screenplay written by the Wachowski). As for the word ""subversive""... well it falls short to describe the kind of message taken out by all of these movies as a whole. And don't get me wrong here. I do not condemn the subject and neither its treatment or implications. On the contrary, I am thankful for it as it had made so many out there realize how  any form of fundamentalism (whether you call it communism, fascism, nazism, populism and also, anarchism) are so close to one another. Just like extremes of a serpent that bites its own tail. Fundamentalisms of all kind and the painful similarities between them (in scope, in methods, in objectives) should leave us all with a lesson. And I just hope that kids out there that watch these movies just for the fun of the amazing aesthetics and the overwhelming digital effects somehow get to see beyond the surface and dare to explore the undergrounds.As I come back to a particular phrase in ""V"" (""Peoples should not be afraid of their Governments: Governments should be afraid of their Peoples"") I wonder how we got to the point in which (again) 5th. of Novembers are seemingly perceived as the ultimate solutions."	5.0	And the Wachowski Brothers' Magical Mistery Tour goes on...	2006-11-08	8	2	6

As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. ""V"" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with ""V"" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from. The action sequences (minus the beginning explosions and Big Ben being blown apart at the end) were downright dull and a let down from previous Wachowski films.

The thing that amazes me is that people are giving it low ratings because it ""offends their world views"". Im wont deny parallels to the government today, but films and books like this have been around for decades I mean this story is obviously based on 1984 as well as our current situation. But these stories get told as a warning not as some evil left wing attack. I mean honestly, if our government got as bad as the government in this movie, you would be pretty stupid not to raise up like the people in this film did. but for the time being our government isnt that bad, but thats not to say we arnt headed that way. So the point of the movie is to say, lets not let things go that far. It is defintaely not a direct critique of todays world, and if it was we would be in a lot of trouble.So if your gonna give this movie a low rating for anything but that you thought the movie was badly made, or that it was badly performed, or even that you didnt like the differances from the book to the movie, you are indeed an idiot, and apparently think the government in this film is portraying the world today, and you are sick in the head to defend it."	5.0	Americans should be aftraid if they are drawing such direct parallels to their government	2006-09-13	10	1	9

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2EW96AE53PZMK	Richard De Angelis	"WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!I should start by admitting outright that I did enjoy many parts of the V for Vendetta movie (primarily those that remained truest to the source material), and by stating my agreement with other reviewers familiar with thegraphic novelon which it was based that it is the best film adaptation of an Alan Moore work to date. In fact, had I never heard of the book, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more than I did (and I did appreciate it much more when I watched it for the second time on this DVD set). I am always impressed when any mainstream, major Hollywood studio produces something that encourages audiences to question authority, even when that message gets muddled by science fiction trappings, convoluted plots, and special effects. However, having read V for Vendetta several times, while I am willing to overlook some of the cinematic alterations made by the Wachowski brothers (creators ofThe Matrix) as fairly harmless and perhaps even justifiable, there are two points in particular where I believe the film version totally undermines both the literary and political brilliance of the original story.The first point pertains to the portrayal of two of the story's central characters. By demonizing High Chancellor Adam Sutler, who came across as an almost laughable caricature of a raving, frothing-at-the-mouth tyrant, the movie completely robs the story of the psychological complexity found in the book. There, the party leader, Adam Susan, is motivated by an absolute devotion to his country, and an unfaltering conviction that fascism is the only way to save it from destruction. He sacrifices his own freedoms to serve his people (at least the white, straight, Christians among them) and is willing to tolerate dissenters like Inspector Finch as long as they continue to serve the needs of the State (something I could not imagine the hysterical egomaniac played by William Hurt doing). The villains are further vilified by the insertion of a cumbersome and confusing conspiracy plot into the story.SPOILER ALERT!It is eventually revealed that the ruling party orchestrated the nationwide plague that precipitated its rise to power years earlier. It was as if the Wachowskis were afraid their fascist state wouldn't be frightening enough to audiences if it was only responsible for killing civil liberties, so they had to pin the mass murder of 100,000 people on it as well. This changes the party leader from someone--right wing nut job though he may be--who heeds the call of his country in its time of need to pull it from the brink of the abyss, into someone who is motivated solely by the desire for power and a narcissistic need to have the world shaped in his image. This further casts the movie's High Chancellor as the most clich&eacute;d type of cartoonish supervillain. (It also further distances the story from reality and the kind of actual evil usually encountered in the world. Hitler did not have to orchestrate the economic collapse of pre-WWII Germany; he only had to exploit it.)And while the Wachowskis chose to demonize their movie's version of Moore's High Chancellor, they also decided to subtly humanize V. It seems as though they were trying to skew the character to play as more of a hero with audiences by making such changes from the book as narrowing the focus of V's vengeance to the party elite and those who personally wronged him, inventing a conscientious objection to killing their cronies (except when necessary), and having him anguish over his treatment of Evey and breaking down in sobs when she leaves him. Although less offensive to my intelligence than the over the top evil of Adam Sutler, this softening of the book's much more menacing and Machiavellian V nonetheless detracts from the brilliance and uniqueness of Alan Moore's story. The struggle between an all too human villain and a monstrous hero is much more thought-provoking than the black and white morality presented by the movie, which alleviates the audience from any need to question the rightness of V's tactics or feel pity for any of his victims. It is a credit to Alan Moore's writing that readers can still identify with and even like V despite some of his heinous behavior in the book--MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!most notably his torture of Evey, which somehow came across as much more brutal when presented by artist David Lloyd in the graphic novel.Secondly, however disappointed I was with the film adaptation's simplistic depiction of good and evil, what was even more tragic was its total failure to accurately convey the political ideology of its title character. I was horrified when the Old Bailey was blown up in the first 10 minutes of the film, and not just because V had inexplicably forgotten--despite his urging for us all to remember--that the target of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot had been Parliament. Even worse, I realized in that terrible moment that one of my two favorite scenes in the book had just been mercilessly obliterated. V's feigned conversation on the roof of the Old Bailey, in which he explains his reasons behind abandoning Justice for Anarchy, is one of the greatest monologues in graphic literature (despite some of the misogynistic terminology V employs) and makes it clear that V's goals are just as lofty as Adam Susan's (regardless of how one might feel about how either character goes about achieving them). Likewise my other favorite scene, V's address to the British nation via the State's own pirated airwaves, was transformed from a stinging indictment of political apathy and rousing appeal for personal responsibility, into an invocation of some unspecified type of democracy every bit as vague and uninspiring as any real presidential address. The choice presented to the audience of the film seems to be one between democracy and totalitarianism, which for most moviegoers means nothing more than preserving the status quo. In the book, which I consider the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism ever written (in comics or anywhere else), V presents readers with ""another way"" that offers ""new life [and] hope reinstated."" In other words, V is offering society as a whole the same sort of transformation Evey underwent (in the book, not the movie), which is nothing less than a completeparadigm shift.The final scene of the movie reminded my wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley's""The Mask Of Anarchy"", except without the sense of exhilaration. It's a shame the movie, unlike the book on which it was based, ultimately failed to evoke the same spirit as the closing lines of this poem:'And these words shall then becomeLike Oppression's thundered doomRinging through each heart and brain,Heard again - again - again -'Rise like Lions after slumberIn unvanquishable number -Shake your chains to earth like dewWhich in sleep had fallen on you -Ye are many - they are few.'"	3.0	Masked Anarchy	2007-11-06	2	0	2

The acting is overall good and sometimes approached excellent as well, yet... yet... I was left dissatisfied. The strength of a movie of this sort is the believability of the plot and to reach it's conclusion, V forces a slight bit of unbelievability into what has transpired as an otherwise strong cautionary tale of what can happen to a people to ready to surrender freedom for security.Nonetheless, V had to be made, V has to be seen. And the message should be heard. I gave the film 5 stars - the plot is 4.5, sets and direction, 5, acting 4 and message 5.

You could talk to me all day long and spend every minute trying to convince me it's not amazing.  You would be wasting your time.I've been to church.  They seems to think otherwise.  They have this terrible fear that homosexuality is a mental disorder caused by venereal demons.  Not to knock a hardworking venerable demon, but I think that people who love to love people with the same organs, just love to love people with the same organs.  They couldn't ""gay"" me, and I couldn't straighten them with medieval rack and an empty bottle of wine.  (I use empty wine bottles as rolling pins; quit wasting money you perverts.)This movie focuses on homosexuality and a handful of characters.  If you wanted someone to translate the book you have already read into a movie, then you'll be five kinds of disappointed.  I don't fault the film for this though.  Alan Moore is an ascended master of the English language.  He took hundreds of pages of English gloom to slowly build a story out of texture in the negative space of his fully developed fascist nightmare.  That's because it took hundreds of pages.  I don't believe a film could do his book justice, any better than the justice served by his fictional, fascist, secret police.The movie takes a few characters and a few good notes from Alan Moore's book.  Those notes come out a little loud and over the top.  The story isn't quite up to par with the material that inspired it.I don't want to analyze the whole movie.  I want to speak just on the gay parts.  There are a lot of comments on here about how people think that it's too preachy.  It is preachy; that's fair.  There are also comments about some kind of evil gay agenda.  As if homosexuals were prancing across the park in pink furry boas and playing Queen on flutes to lead the Children of America away to some candy-coated, but ultimately poisoned by AIDS funworld of gay sex.No one ever tells a dentist how to put his tool in his patient's mouth.  The dentist is clearly the expert, and the patient clearly wants the tool in their mouth.  Why then do straight fuddy-duddies feel comfortable telling gay men and women what they can put in whose mouth?  Aren't the gay folks a little bit more knowledgeable on the topic of gay sex?I've known a few gay and bi folks that have really appreciated V for Vendetta.  Here, in Louisiana, there are people who think that one day God will bless America with a pharmaceutical cure for perversity.  There are people, under 16 and legally kids, in mental institutions, because their parents couldn't handle them being gay.  So, maybe the movie's tone is too preachy.  It's not too loud.  It might be stumble over it's words, but you cannot ask this movie to put down its megaphone because it's tongue is twisted.  What it has to say, should not be whispered.Jesus was beautiful.  God is beautiful.  You can be beautiful.  You do not have to hate who you are.  God is love and truth.  I have intellectuals frown on me for saying that I'm Christian.  Why?  I have to explain to them that Bruno was Christian, Joan of Arc was Christian, William Blake was Christian.  I look into a glass darkly, but I want to and will one day see God face to face, as he sees me.  Christianity has turned so far away from this.Fundamentalists cower together in darkness, huddled under blankets sown from complacency.  They burn broken dreams and forbidden books in a bonfire to keep warm.  They shut their eyes tight so truth, change, and decay can't intrude on their static world of crumbling fear.  They think in the darkness they found God.  They go to kiss him, but they've loved under the threat of hell.  They've loved at the end of the barrel of a gun.  And now they find their lips pressed to that barrel.  And before they pull the trigger themselves, someone has to wake them up.You are not the contagious mental illnesses you've mistaken for your true self.You are beautiful.And you will find someone out there that understands, even if even I don't."	4.0	"""Pro Gay Agenda"""	2012-02-09	6	0	6

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5	R. Kyle	"The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's ""1984"".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.He calls himself ""V.""V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but ""V"" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.

It portrayed thehomosexual relationship as the only trulybeautiful lifestyle, and was anti-Bush from theword go, even portraying Bush as a tyrannicallunatic even willing to eavesdrop at will on anyhuman being having any conversation in anysituation.  If anything they made the left looklike they would accept anything, and the rightlook like they detested and wanted to destroyanything even to the point that they would fireon un-armed civilians looking to overthrow thecorrupt villainous regeme.  What is intrestingis liberals are the ones that want to dis-armour society.  If you think my review is toopolitical & etc.  Then you will hate this movie,it is two hours of politics 101 from aperspective that I neither agree with, nor accept.	1.0	If Anti-War, Anti-Bush, Anti-Patriotism is what you are after	2006-03-20	93	16	77

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A38XHXKPDKHP8N	Robert Anderson	"Like The Matrix, ""V"" is ultimately about ideas, symbols and questions.  It deftly exposes fascism and the insidious nature of power, while causing the viewer to consider for themselves the issues of privacy, civil liberties, abuse of power, terrorism, resistance, and whether under similar conditions we would be willing to give up our freedoms to a tyranical regime in exchange for ""protection"".  Most of all it is a study in fear, and how it is used to manipulate us.The actors hit their marks admirably, and the casting of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) as ""V"" is the ultimate in irony.  Additionally the plot, action and quirky Brittish setting are all ""spot on"".If you enjoy movies that make you think, this will be one of the best movies you'll see this year."	5.0	The Matrix meets Zorro!	2006-08-04	4	3	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A39ESHPCRV4Z5Z	Robert Caplan	say what you will about the Wachowski siblings,but they can direct and especially write very intelligent, intense, emotional and damn gripping story's. V for Vendetta and The first Matrix are their best films,even though they did not direct V for Vendetta. The story is so smart and really make's you think it gave my brain a workout, the first time I saw the movie in theaters just like the first time I saw the first Matrix. Hugo Weaving plays V to perfection, he is a hell of an actor and the fact that you never see his face adds to the intense nature of his acting. the fact that he has to do all his acting behind a mask and use body movements to really bring the character to life is a treat. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she gives a very strong performance and I love that she got her head shaved for the role even if they paid her to shave her head that's dedication to your art, cause women love their hair lol. john hurt is amazing as well he plays a cold sadistic dictator bastard to scary realism. there is not much action in the film but the action it does have is stylized and done very well with some cool knife and gun fights. this was my first review	5.0	The Wachowski siblings deliver another masterpiece	2013-12-03	1	0	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1815DUDYAS1A0	Robert Fiske	Set in the not to distant future, where a totalitarian government controls the United Kingdom, the title character 'V' is conducting a campaign of terror against tyranny. Disfigured by his arrest and mistreatment of this government, he escaped to seek revenge on those responsible. He enlists the aid of Evey, played by Natalie Portman. Without to much explanation about the plot, the movie is about people having the courage to stand up to tyranny, and this is why I like it. I also like the 'V' character wearing the Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film. This mask has been adapted by protesters around the world who demonstrate against repressive governments, and also used by the 'Anonymous' group to hide their true identities. I would compare it to the '1984' novel and movies, except this time the good guys win.	5.0	Excellent movie about courage standing up to Tyranny	2013-08-24	0	0	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AHCH7T7UJOKRY	Robert J. Salm	"I was not impressed with the features that supposedly make this a 2-disc ""Special Edition.""  The first DVD in this set is the exact same DVD of the regular 1-disc DVD with no additional features such as a running commentary or a director's cut.  For a movie that's listed in the top 250 films of all time on IMDB, not having even a director's commentary is appalling.  As for the second DVD in this set, the ""Special Features"" DVD, there are three short featurettes and a rather forgetful music video.  There are shortcomings: despite the heavy detail of costuming, sound mixing and production direction, the featurettes only skim a few production points.  The featurettes are standard PR issue from the studio.  No deleted scenes, no comparative storyboarding, no blooper reel, no outtakes.  Where's the fun?  Unless you want to know more about the graphic novel, see a music video or learn about the events surrounding Guy Fawkes (events you can easily find similar information about on the Internet), the standard 1-disc DVD version would suffice."	3.0	5 Stars for the Film, 3 Stars for this DVD set	2006-12-23	10	5	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUO5EA01GZNFU	"Robert Knowles ""Info Junkie"""	"This film was based on a graphic novel (comic book) of the same name from the eighties. Apparently the brothers didn't feel the need to ""dress-it-up"" a little for the big screen. The whole movie ends up feeling like, well, a comic book. But not in a cool Matrix or Underworld kind of way, where you have characters that are so far removed from reality. Just in a kind of cheesy, one dimensional way.It was hard to take this film seriously with its clich&eacute;d version of the big, evil government run amok. The big brother menace that was scary 2 decades ago feels fairly dated here. Due in part to lack of realism in the set decoration as well as the portrayal of the periods technology. I just can't buy that in an age of movies-on-demand, Tivo, pay-per-view, and hundreds of satellite and cable channels at our disposal, society progresses into a group of sheep-like morons that believe everything that is fed to them from the ominous government via one single TV station. Where is the internet? Once again, the graphic novel is now dated in its ideas and the movie makes no attempt to adapt to the ideology of the present day. This only works when filming period pieces.This movie would have worked very well in the early eighties. It's just hard to swallow in today's world.The acting was decent but shouldn't we expect that? No award winning performances.All-in-all? Nothing special. The whole project felt like a big inside joke. To elaborate; I'm sure this was something dear to the Warchowski Brother's hearts and I'm sure all their nerdy friends who loved the graphic novel thought this was a great idea. However, it should have been updated, expanded upon and modernized to entertain the people who paid to see it but didn't already have fond teenage memories of the once groundbreaking comic.Let's hope that the brothers have another Matrix-sized hit with their next project."	2.0	"J for ""Just okay"""	2006-08-14	16	6	10
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase ""The coalition of the willing,"" a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary."	5.0	A brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel	2006-07-15	23	15	8

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A6FH57UU66R64	Robert W. Moeller	"If you're reading up on V for Vendetta, you likely already know that it is based on the comic book series/graphic novel of the same name, written and illustrated by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, respectively. Alan Moore has detached himself from the film completely, likely because it does not follow his work completely. This is understandable. Being a writer myself, I imagine if I saw my work brought to the big screen with so many changes, I would have a fit, too. But looking in from an unbiased perspective, having not written the novel and only being a fan, I disagree with this notion entirely. The movie, while it makes several sacrifices in terms of extraneous characters and such, also streamlines the story yet still makes it an incredibly unebelievable movie.The plot takes place in near-future London, England, where a totalitatian regime called Norsefire, led by High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has taken hold. 'Fingerman', or secret police, roam the streets, arresting at will. Audio surveillence and wire taps are the norm. Difference is bad; homosexuals, Muslims, and the like are persecuted. The setting is very convincing. If you were to walk into London today, I can't say it would look much different from how the movie depicts. This strengthens the films impact.Enter V, a freedom fighter (or terrorist?) who plans to bring down the oppressive regime. Spectacularly voices and acted by Hugo Weaving, V is an extremely intelligent man who, strangely, remains hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask. It just so happens that he runs into Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a timid young woman being assaulted by several Fingermen. To say any more about this first encounter, or these characters' backgrounds and histories, would be to spoil a well-thought out plot that will have you recoiling in disgust, cheering, and questioning actions of the many characters, particularly V.Due to the film's material content, it is unfortunately subject to much criticism. Many individuals proclaim it as a bash against the Bush administration, others say it glorifies terrorism and that the film is ""evil"". This is cheapening what V for Vendetta really is. If you really think V is a terrorist, that is excellent. Why? Because that is the point of the movie. It is to get people to talk. Is V a terrorist, or is he a freedom fighter? Saying the movie glorifies him is incorrect as well. The movie tells you to voice an opinion, not what opinion to voice. And that is a beautiful thing.I don't want to appear biased; I am not a supporter of the current administration, but I am also not outspoke at all against it. Perhaps you could say I stand in the middle ground. If you are interested in this film, SEE IT FOR YOURSELF. Do not let hot headed right-winged conservatives convince you that this movie is propaganda. If parallels are seen between this film and the current U.S. government, then perhaps there is indeed something wrong with our great nation's regime.Everybody should see this film. It is deep. It is moving. It is thoughtful, delivers many themes and messages, and is chock full of symbolism and dialogue that will have you deciphering during your many viewings. The film is about people. Sure, it is political commentary. But it isn't saying, ""Oh, Bush is evil,"" or ""Bush=American terrorist!"". Again, that is cheapening the many elements of V for Vendetta. If anything, this film is anti-Nazi. It speaks against the complacency of people under oppressive regimes, it urges the people of all nations of the world to be mindful of their government, and to not let themselves be lulled into a state of fear, such a state in which they would be happy to give up their freedoms for ""security"". That is what this film speaks out about, and against.The DVD itself includes very few special features. A few documentaries, one or two are interesting, the rest not too noteworthy. There is on that explains who Guy Fawkes was and what he intended to do, so I do suggest watching that at least.But the content of the DVD is the film itself. Words do not describe this film; it has to be seen, and understood. Honestly, you either love it or you don't. I will not sugarcoat it: many who don't like it, just plain don't understand it. But whatever the case, everybody should watch this and decide for themselves."	5.0	A thoughtful and ultimately moving film	2006-08-21	18	11	7

It could've so easily turned into ""Life's a bitch, then you die.

Rodriguez	Although Moore's brillant graphic novel of an anarchist against a faschist government is much darker, V for Vendetta tries its best and ends up with a slightly less impressive but totally worth it, spectacular film. The fast-talking, British humor makes the movie only better and more delicious to the eyes and ears. I literally almost cried near the end of the film because it was that powerful, although the only problem i didnt like about it is we never ever get a chance to see the face of a man who eventually saves the British people from a Nazi-esque government. Eventually he makes the one thing that Guy Fawkes failed at, destroying Parliament, while revealing the truth about the government that the people trusted. Although i would prefer the graphic novel over the film, mostly because this film was mostly made for Americans, because of the political problems that we are facing. V for Vendetta isn't about America problems. It's about freedom, its about anarchy against a corrupted government, its about England, but mostly its about the choices and the ideas you make that can change the world.	5.0	Spectacular!

To the end, you are still waiting for answers.  Thank goodness the director and writers leave some unanswered... this is a powerful technique.There's even more.  Media manipulation by government.  The People's revolt.  The importance of youth in shaping the future.  Experiments on people.  Why good cops are essential in society.  There is a segment dealing with homosexuality and a horrible, draconian government approach to it (Nazi Germany is the obvious reference here).

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3VNL4C2HKFUGO	"Rubin Carver ""The Duke"""	"It's not often I'm completely blown away by a new film. But at the insistance of a close friend, I watched this with him the night it came out on DVD and I was floored. I can't remember the last time I had such an emotional reaction to a film.Many insightful things have already been said about 'V' by other reviewers, so I will try to keep this brief for the sake of not retreading what they've already said. First, the characterization in this film is nothing short of brilliant. The script is fantastic and they chose the right actors/actresses for the right rolls. You will believe you know these characters yourself when the film is through.The production team pulled no punches on the visuals. Over 80 full-scale sets with minute attention to detail, beautifully realistic model-based special effects as opposed to thinly veiled CGI as is the common practice in hollywood nowadays... it's all there. Not only that, but the soundtrack is gorgeous. The orchestral themes are memorable, the use of secondary tunes appropriate and unobtrusive. The soundtrack goes so far towards moving the plot emotionally.Most importantly, the story is rich and multi-faceted in a way that I was not expecting. There is layer upon layer of storyline elements, points, general brainfood, call them what you will... when you add the superb (and highly emotional) character development as well as its historical allusions to November the fifth and Guy Fawkes, you get a film that is massive in scale.Quickly before I wrap this review up, I would like to address a few specific things. Mainly, I think anyone who complains about the slightly unfaithful adaptation of the graphic novel is missing the point and depriving themselves of some of what this film has to offer as a separate body of work. Given the medium, this adaptation is about as good as it could have been. The changes to the story do not affect the quality at all. The convoluted maze of plot details now native to the graphic novel are beyond the scope of a mere two hour roll of celluloid (not to mention some of them might have dulled the delivery of the film considerably, IE the ""Fate"" computer.) Personally I'm relieved they chose overall quality over 100% accuracy.Lastly, I am reviewing the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD because it is the edition I purchased, but it is not really necessary. The special features are interesting but are not very long and you may not find it worth the extra four bucks. I prefer the artwork though and it does come with a hilarious (although hidden) SNL skit featuring Natalie Portman.This movie is worth an immediate purchase. Number one of the year so far and a contender for my personal top five. It's subversive and some people may find it uncomfortable, but it is undoubtedly of the highest quality filmmaking.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1ZIIC262XVX19	Russ	This is a dark, brooding movie, yet Natalie Portman is beautiful and amazing, even against the dark world of this story. Produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski of the Matrix Trilogy, and based on a graphic novel (adult comic book), V for Vendetta is a big budget, well produced, beautifully dark film with wonderful texture and darker, heartfelt themes. I saw many parallels between the Fascist Britain of this film and some of the western powers of the here and now. There are multiple facets happening in this film. Some viewers will take away one, some will take away a few more, and still some others will take away many.As usual, my recommendation is to lower your expectations, have a few beers, and view this film with an open mind.

It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England."" (from an interview of Alan Moore on MTV, 8-30-06)The bottom line is that the Wachowskis and Silver took one of the most complex and intelligent books about dystopia, man's interaction with the state and the easy slide from democracy to fascism and turned it into a dumb action picture and low-watt paranoid liberal rant ala Air America, and I say that as a liberal.If you want an intelligent, complex story, buyV for Vendetta.If you want ""knife time,"" dorky alliteration, anti-conservative paranoia, anti-religious paranoia and a nice pat on the back for voting for Kerry last time round, buy this movie."	1.0	V is for Vapid	2007-06-18	77	48	29

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A32XW50ILWOXNO	Samuel McKewon	"The most creative moments of ""V for Vendetta"" are during its flashy end credits, bathed in red, played over The Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man.""No kidding.The movie is a tremendous artistic letdown. Drab. Pompous. Obvious. So liberal it cannot possibly be considered a sincere allegory, but rather a preach-to-the-choir rant that Michael Moore would appreciate. At least Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" had the juice to stick it to the Bush administration - ""V"" merely wishes it so - and did not cloak its intentions behind an advertising campaign that features star Natalie Portman - who until now was Hollywood's staunchest defender of Israel, the closet thing we've got to a police-state democracy - in roundtables discussing the nature of terrorism.The Wachowski Brothers chose to adapt Alan Moore's graphic novel as their encore to ""The Matrix"" trilogy, inserting the second unit director from those films, James McTigue, as director here. Set 20 years in the future, England has fallen into tyranny, with Hitleresque High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) helming a government that enforces curfews, shapes the news to fit its agenda and employs ""fingermen"" to execute its ultra-conservative rulebook. It's these men that harass Evey Hammond (Portman) in a London back alley one night with the intent of raping her when a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask disarms them, rescues the girl and sweeps her to the rooftop so she can watch him bomb Old Bailey.The man is V (Hugo Weaving), a survivor of government experiments hot for payback and revolution, using the mask of Fawkes - who tried to blow up British Parliament in 1605 - to cover his disfigured face. Theatrical, talky, tortured, brilliant, V is a political Phantom, and London is his Opera House. And shy, observant Evey is the girl he'll come to love. The morning after Old Bailey comes down, V hijacks the state-run TV network and announces he will, in one year, finish what Fawkes started. He invites all of England to come and see.Evey is linked to V, and has no choice but to hide out with him, at least until she can escape. She succeeds, but eventually lands in state prison, where she is tortured to divulge V's whereabouts. If, in fact, she really is in state prison.""V For Vendetta"" is not without its clever twists. Or sincere performances - Portman is especially invested and effective, and Stephen Rea, as a police inspector charged with finding V, pads his resume of taciturn, shambled cops.  The weaknesses are McTigue's boring direction  and the Wachowski Brothers' script in its lack of continuity and tone - the background touches that make movies like ""Blade Runner,"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Minority Report"" challenging meditations on the future.We never get a handle on the government, omnipresent in some scenes, absent in others. Considering his past, it's unlikely V would have the access to the unlimited quantities cash needed to execute his Parliament plan, which is straight out of ""Shawshank Redemption"" anyhow. And one can buy only so many moments when a key face looms just out of the spotlight or the second most-wanted terrorist in England can walk around easy breezy because she has a shaved head and a fake ID.The Wachowskis are also too occupied with their liberal markers and props to create an effective argument. V has leather-bound books, art and movie posters in his cave. That means he's wise. A friend of Evey's hides a Koran preserved in glass. That means he's tolerant. The government's symbol is a weird variation on the Christian cross. That means Christianity is twisted.Then there's the Wachowski's agenda of sexual freedom - buried in the subtext of ""The Matrix"" series, but front and center in ""V For Vendetta"" (and previously ""Bound""). A government can violate a thousand rights, and yet the movie chooses as its two testimonials a gay man and a lesbian robbed of their desires. Since the picture never exactly articulates the government's other targets, yet we're certain they exist, we're left with sense that ""V For Vendetta"" places gay rights at the top of its freedom hierarchy, and that tyranny strikes first at gays, and society through them, similar to the Nazis persecution of the Jews.A scarier, tougher movie goes right at the heart of V's thesis statement - ""government should fear its people"" - and examines it through a activist with whom it's not so convenient for the literati to side. Consider America's own twisted V - not the 9/11 terrorists, but Timothy McVeigh, the conservative wing nut who blew up a federal building in response to the FBI's raid on Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Raised on a rich diet of reciprocity, militarism and hatred, McVeigh nevertheless had an intriguing point to make about the violations of our Second Amendment gun rights. He was a modern Guy Fawkes, he spoke of collateral damage and revolution, and when it came time to line up behind him, we instead put his execution on close-circuit television so the victim's families could watch him die.Just in case you forgot ""V For Vendetta"" was a fantasy."	2.0	MBPLN for Murky, Boring, Pompus, Liberal Nonsense	2006-03-25	55	12	43

What I have to say, though is that few words can adequately express the sheer awesomeness of this movie. So I'm going to make a couple up. This movie is froboobulously snarffarl. Totally and yagodically snarffarl to the absolute skrogidog limit! And that's the fraz, man! This movie is not afraid to use its fictional future world to make parallels with corruption as it is today and skirt the issues that closed-minded people get all flared up about when you try to point out, and I don't think it's England it's talking about. Said closed-minded individuals simply won't make the connections and thus flare up. So you watch it. If you don't see any connections, then don't give it a second thought. It may not even apply to you. But if you do see the connections, just remember it, and store the fact away. You know, for when the revolution comes. This has also been an allusion to the movie, but nevertheless made in all seriousness.

The end result is both pretentious and maddening. Yes, the writers/directors would like you to believe that conservatives are the root of all evil. Yet, when trying to make this point the movie is so narrow in scope that it fails to tackle the foremost relevant issues.  Nor does it handle the select few that it does encounter with sophistication. It's all to the extreme and very stereotypical.The political agenda is too distracting and the film itself overbearing due to the extent of didacticism.	1.0	Is this really encouraging free thought?	2006-07-20	171	64	107

My list of favorite movies has only 2 items. So when I say V For Vendetta is the best movie I have ever watched, I mean it. I watch it for the first time a week ago, and since then I watched 2 more times, and I admit it, I'm going to see it again tomorrow. Every time I walk out of the cinema I'm smiling and my energy is at its full.Fascism, totalitarian government, dictatorship, terrorism and most important, anarchism. Those are the things that make this movie real. And that's why I sob whenever I see that ending. Evey's last words in the movie, that music, that image...that's the most beautiful movie scene I have ever seen.V is a truly charming character. I fell in love with this movie and with him. His idea, his purpose, although not clear in the movie, is extremely inspiring, and it made me spend almost all of my free time reading, learning and understanding anarchism and all its forms. The whole movie is thrilling to me, it's filled with amazing lines and points of view, but nothing compares to the final scene. No matter how many times I watch it, it always gets to me and makes me cry like a baby. It's the most bittersweet thing I have ever felt. It's the high point of a passion that started a long time ago and that is not shared by only one person, it is every person's dream.One last thing: the sound track couldn't be any more perfect and suitable.And some people might say it's boring because it deals with politics and we are tired of it. But the difference is that in this film there's change. There's hope. There's dream. And for me, that's what is really entertaining.	5.0	Kudos for V For Vendetta.	2006-04-22	12	10	2

'V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.'V' (Hugo Weaving), as he identifies himself, has been a victim of the oppressive political overthrowing of a free government, and decides that revolution and death are the only answers to the world's problems.  Despite the dark sound of his schemes, it makes sense in the wake of the current leader's greed and incompetence.  Just before his first message to the government, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from a savaging from being out after curfew.'V' and Evey meet up again as 'V' takes over a public broadcast, and this time Evey help him in return for his kindness to her.  'V' then takes her to his underground hideout to keep her safe for one year, until next November 5th when he plans to carry out his designs for a new government.  When Evey gets away from 'V', he doesn't stop her.But neither 'V' or the government are through with Evey.  Evey becomes a prisoner and is tortured, emerging a stronger person from it.  Lots of secrets are revealed at this time, Evey's torturer, 'V's reasoning, and other sideline plots that were boring and belonged in a movie like 'Sleepless In Seattle' rather than 'V For Vendetta'.  'V' plans on bringing Evey in on his little November 5th celebration, whether she likes it or not, but not until he has taken care of his own personal business.'V For Vendetta' could have been a great movie if they had stuck to a darker vein and left out all the distracting touchie-feelie moments.  About the middle of the movie, where the 'emotional' aspect really takes off, is where I got lost, and bored, and began to see this film as a passing bow to the movie-rating God.  I would rather have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.  Perhaps the producers were a little too frightened by 911, thinking ""terrorist"" rather than ""revolutionist"", but because of the wishy-washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.My recommendation is to rent first, and make up your own mind.

It's quoted in the beginning of Alan Moore's second seminal comic work, ""V For Vendetta.""  For some reason, the book never seemed to get the dues it deserved, probably because it was ahead of its time when first published serially in ""Warrior"" (U.K.) magazine.  We who lived through those times, even as young people, remember in the U.S. and U.K. there was a feeling of super-patriotism and populism that many of us felt would lead to a new fascism.  Nowadays, those fears ring true again.Purists should take note - especially if you're as (justifiably) persnickety as Alan Moore - that the film takes some liberties with the graphic novel's story.  It's been updated to reflect the new fascist fears of today, as well as the power of television and internet.  Moore was so incensed at the changes made by the Warchowsky Brothers that he fought a successful legal battle to have his credit removed from the movie.  I think I can understand why, as I've seen how Hollywood took his ""Swamp Thing"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and completely warped it from his original intent.  However, I think he would be secretly pleased at how much of the spirit of his story is maintained.The themes of ""V"" are timeless - the use of fear to control and dominate, the willingness of the masses to turn a blind eye to persecuting the ""different"" in order to keep their feeling of security - and McTeague keeps this overall sense of menace and fear by showing us the new Hitler/Stalin, David Sutler (Susan in the graphic novel) mostly on television, just like everyone in that world sees him.  The stark symbolism of the double-bar cross used by the fascist Norsefire Party that brings together the twin tyrannies of repressive State and Organized Religion.  The messages of the film are clear, and well presented.Is it perfect?  No.  Sometimes the pacing lags, and there are sharp changes of mood, such as the parody of Sutler on a chat show set to the tune of what I call the ""Benny Hill Rag"" (those who've watched the Benny Hill Show know what I'm talking about).  Yet the strengths draw you in; the previously mentioned moodiness and feeling of paranoic fear, the superb acting of Natalie Portmann (bonus for maintaining her accent), Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Hugo Weaving (even though it isn't him under the mask most of the time), et. al., and the lush attention to detail in cinematography, as well as stage design.  It all drags you in.There aren't too many action movies out there that also demand that you think and try to draw conclusions.  It's all too easy to end up drowning in metaphor and lectures (which is what happened to the latter two ""Matrix"" outings), yet ""V"" in film form maintains that balance.  We are entertained after all, and called upon to think where we are heading as a people."	4.0	"The Spirit of ""V"" Is Captured On Film"	2006-09-06	11	5	6

Instead, I felt like I was watching pieces of a 'not so distant' future. Radical, dictatorial, fundamentalist governments are things western societies think only exist in the Middle East.

Recently, I heard someone make the statement that 'homosexuals' should all be killed. I couldn't help but think of this movie and wonder.....is this really fiction, or is it just the beginning.Aside from covering issues such as dictatorships, basic human rights, religious fundamentalism, homophobia, and government corruption, this movie is just simply entertaining. The special effects are well done and believable (for a super hero). The characters are not phony or laughable like the old batman superheroes. ""V"" is a classic anti-hero.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, ""V for Vendetta,"" was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard ""Big Brother"" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.Much of what made ""V"" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the ""Matrix"" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push ""V"" into the class of great action movies.  ""V"" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.For visual appeal, ""V"" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like ""Van Helsing,"" ""Hulk,"" or the ""Matrix"" sequels, ""V"" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  ""V"" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.  This isn't a bad movie by any means - we're not talking ""Speed 2"" or ""Dune"" - but it is a disappointment when the high expectations aren't met."	3.0	Stylish remake of Alan Moore comic offers thrilling sights but little heft	2007-01-02	4	2	2

I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.I will say that when I first watched the film, I was confused as to why this terrorist, V, was being glorified.  But once the plot fully unfolds and all is made known, the reason for V being viewed as a hero is more than clear.This is a tale of V, it is a tale of Evey Hammond, it is a tale of a fascist government run by Chancellor Sutler, impeccably played by John Hurt, it is a tale of revenge, it is a tale of mass conspiracy, it is a tale of love, it is a tale of so much more.  The complexity of the plot delighted me.And the performances!  It doesn't get any better than Hugo Weaving as V, in my opinion.  He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor.  There are not a great many other actors who can emote that much feeling even sans masks!  And his voice!  It sends chills through me every time I hear it.  I truly fell in love with V.Natalie Portman is magnificent as well.  She is so beautiful and a natural actress.  Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit.  Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.Stephen Rea is also excellent as Chief Inspector Finch.  The entire cast does a wonderful job bringing this film to life.The look of the film doesn't disappoint whatsoever.  Being a Matrix fan, I loved the dark and gloomy, but slick look of V for Vendetta.  The knife fights where V takes on his opponents are absolutely stunning, not to mention the striking quality of V's black clothing in contrast to the stark whiteness of his Guy Fawke's mask.I would greatly urge you to ride along with V, Evey and Finch on this fantastic and eye-opening journey.  Most highly recommended.  A masterpiece.	5.0	V took my breath away...	2007-01-09	8	3	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3FEARY7121EDU	Sea B. Terry	V for Vendetta is giving everyone what they expect, but with a little extra. While you watch, you wonder has this happened before, or is society on the verge of this now. V for Vendetta starts out showing us what the surroundings are like and what kind of monsters the villian has created. Soon after showing this, we get to meet out hero who is only known as V. After the movie's over, you realize V stands for so much more than vendetta. When we meet V, he's so much more intelligent than other heroes. he speaks with alliteration, and a genuine gentleman-like gusto. Once again Hugo Weaving is associated with the Wachowski Brothers from playing Agent Smith in one of Hollywoods biggest trilogies. They only write and produce this gem, why they didn't direct, I haven't the slightest idea. The villain in this movie is only a face projected on a wall sized screen. This man ,played by John Hurt, is so openly a mimic of Hitler, a man the audience already loathes and hates. His name is even Sutler, and he is, like Hitler was, only known by a single name. Through the many rises and falls of the movie, we learn the harsh past of V, and Sutler, and Sutler's sad followers. Sometimes the audience may find V's actions a bit bizzare, and heartless, but this is what breaks this out of the comic book cookie cutter genre that it gets associated with and locked into.Natalie Portman is just rolling off the Revenge of the Sith Star Wars pedestal, but instead of taking a step down off her high beam, she gracefully takes a step over. People should recognize her in films of this sort instead of only looking where drama is so often found.V for Vendetta is the movie we all wished so many could be. This is another mark hit for the Wachowski Brothers' writing. Without the writing this movie would be dust blowing down Main Street. Step away from Superman, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Daredevil; and step into V for Vendetta and find out why we should all remember, remember the 5th of November.	5.0	Electric, Yet...Truthful	2006-03-23	9	5	4

I see no reason why gunpowder, treason should ever be forgot...""All I have to say is WOW! What a great great movie. This truly is an important movie. A shadowy freedom fighter known only as ""V"" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally. That's all I'm going to go into for plot details.I've never read any of the graphic novels this is based on, so this is a review after a virgin viewing. I love this movie, plain and simple. Hugo Weaving is V and he plays the part amazingly well. Even though V's face is never shown, it doesn't need to be. Weaving uses mannerisms and has such a great voice, that sometimes you forget that it's even a mask. Natalie Portman is wonderful as well as Evey. Both of them have such a great chemistry together and it's always great when they're on screen. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (John Hurt is amazing as well even though he's not in it all that much).This is not an action movie like the trailers portray it to be (nor is it directed by the Wachowski Brothers as some are lead to believe). It doesn't need to be though. The story, characters and events are so good, that the few action moments in the film (which are spectacular by the way) are so good, you don't need action. It's such an interesting plot too, which I won't get into because you should see it yourself. The action scenes in this are great though, especially at the very end, I got goose bumps. The end sure goes out with a bang too, it's a great great ending to a great great movie.I seriously recommend this movie. It's a very smart movie that puts story over action and characters over flashiness. This truly is an important movie that makes you think, it wants you to think and it does so wonderfully. I recommend this movie completely. It's a great first movie by James McTeigue, it's controlled very well and is a tight movie.""Beneath this mask there is more than flesh.

I've never read the original comic this film was apparently based on, but I saw such lavish praise directed at it that I felt compelled to view it anyway. The movie takes place in the near future in England, under the control of a fictitious government. Natalie Portman's character, Evee (is that how it's spelled?) is caught wandering about after curfew by some officers. Just as they were about to go police brutality on her ass, which would have been the best scene in the movie, an enigmatic masked man appears and slays them with his knives. He introduces himself as ""V,"" via pseudo-intellectual jargon, and implores her to join him in an event he promises would be unlike anything she has ever seen. I feel it would be inappropriate for me to ramble on about the plot from this point, so I'll get to the meat and potatoes. V For Vendetta is, of course, is a politically inciting film. It blurs the line between heroism and terrorism, raising some interesting questions that go beyond how we define our words. Unfortunately, some of the political commentary came off as a bit ham-fisted and obvious, if anything. (The highly conservative and religious leader, for instance. Gee whiz, could that be Bill Clinton?) But overall, the message is compelling and its routes stem from how we define our lives, moreso than politics. The film's acting is remarkable for the most part, though Natalie Portman doesn't really impress. The Wachowski brothers had their part in the action scenes I'm aware, and (thankfully) there's no bullet-time or other matrix cliches. The action flows very well.All that aside, V... stands as one of the best sci-fi stories I've seen as of late. Dark yet whimsical, the plot never degenerates into self-parody or a tepid display of CGI, unlike a certain other big sci-fi release. The character V is an achetypical charming aristocratic type, but the stereotype is evidently intended. This is the case for all of the characters, and it never hinders the experience. There are a few dubious coincidences, or perhaps even plot holes, though. Strange V would have a military detainment center in his home, for such a petty purpose as it was used. The entire detainment scene felt a bit convoluted, and the subplot involving the note Evee found in that rathole felt tacked on. But... The movie has sort of a lucid, dreamlike feel,  and insignificant stuff like that isn't supposed to be picked apart by over-analytical minds. In the end, it's the message that's most prevalent. This review felt a bit directionless since I'm running out of time, but I feel that an unfocused train of thought is somehow appropriate for a movie like this.

Yes, I see the references to 1984, Hitler, and all the rest.  Yes, I see the cracks at Bush,etc, etc, etc.  However, despite the occasional (somewhat self-satisfied) sigh, I did enjoy the Shakespeare quotes, the camera work, and the film itself.What did rankle a bit, though is that at the end, I was not cheering for V as much as I felt the film should have made me.  Despite their attempts to use what happened to him to forgive everything and anything, I agree with Evey that they created a monster.  Or, maybe, I just didn't want anything as gorgeous as the Parliament building in London to be blown up.  I hear that the original graphic novel kept the ambiguity of the characters.

She was criticized by some for ""showing skin"" in CLOSER, but that was a relatively rewarding performance compared to V FOR VENDETTA in which the only new skin we see of hers is on her bald head (yes, I know, it may not really be her bald head, and her hair may be back none the worse for wear in her next role). But as for things of substance, that is sorely lacking in this film, in which all she does is participate for baffling reasons in a violent revolution that looks amoral most of the time. And the regime being rebelled against just looks like a silly and unbelievable caricature rather than a villain of any reasonable insight. And there is a distinct undercurrent of America-bashing in it. While any nation should be able to take thoughtful constructive criticism, that isn't what we have here. The America-bashing is just as simplistic, unsubtle, and crass as it was in LOVE ACTUALLY.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1QWWT367BZC9D	Shellie	"I had been told about V for Vendetta by friends who had seen it and  said that it was an absolutely amazing movie. It took me awhile to get around to watching this film, but  when I finally saw it on DVD I was quite stunned. How on earth did it ever get made? How did it get past the censors? For V for Vendetta is like an anarchist manifesto! I know it was loosely based on a controversial English graphic novel; and that its creators didn't like this film version much at all, although I don't really know why. The Wachowski's should be congratulated for bringing this timely film to the silver screen as I think it is most relevant in todays climate of increasing religious fundamentalism, extremism and intolerance. The film is set in a bleakly dystopian UK of the near future whose populace lives in constant fear of the oppressive Christo-Fascist dictatorship called Norsefire (based on the National Front) run by a demented Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) who though reclusive, rules with an iron fist. The regime deports so called foreigners, black bags intellectuals, artists, sexual minorities and anyone who presumably steps out of line. The story of the film follows one Evey Hammond (Natalie  Portman) who is out late one night and is accosted by some secret policemen called ""fingermen"" who intend to rape her. She is saved at the last moment by a mysterious masked vigilante named V (Hugo Weaving) who takes her to his lair... but only after blowing up the Old Bailey first!V is the tortured and obsessive antihero of the film that over time opens up Evey's mind to the horrors that are going on around her unquestioned and unchallenged by anyone, and this is where the story really begins. V has a personal grudge against the Norsefire regime and he is the only one brave enough to stand up to them; and certainly does so with great panache, style and flair! V is a freedom fighter, and not a terrorist like some have claimed, for he is primarily fighting for the rights of the downtrodden people and not some twisted and reactionary political or religious dogma. Throughout the movie V and Evey are under investigation by the police, and it's a race against time for him to accomplish his goal of toppling the corrupt Norsefire regime. One of the chief reasons I appreciate this film is for its compassionately positive portrayal of its gay and lesbian characters; for I think that many fundamentalist leaders today (of most religious persuasions) would truly love to marginalize, persecute and vilify sexual and gender minorities in the same way that Norsefire does, though only if they got their way of course.V for Vendetta the film may not be as good as the graphic novel, but then, film versions of books rarely are. Doubtless Hollywood has filtered out some of the more explicit political and drug references, but the anarchist message still comes across loud and clear. So if I were the author I wouldn't be too upset for sales of the original graphic novel have gone up, and most importantly, people are slowly becoming more politically aware and socially conscious. This is an important movie that openly questions where Western culture is heading; the christian right is gaining power, the separation of church and state is constantly being challenged, many of our basic democratic freedoms and civil liberties are being eroded and big business is creating a bland intellectual, cultural and ecological wasteland. So if humanity doesn't start to grow up as soon as possible, then I fear the world we live in has no future. Viva la revolution!* On a more historical note the character of V takes his inspiration from Guy Fawkes (1570-1606) the British Catholic revolutionary who fought against religious oppression, and who attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament! =S"	5.0	A Vengeful Vendetta	2007-07-16	2	1	1

I kept watching telling myself, ""The dialogue will get better, the plot will become less predictable, it will get better, just give it another 20 minutes.....  ok, another 20 minutes...... ok, just 10 more minutes....""Sadly, I didn't listen to myself and instead continued watching - hoping and praying the movie would get better.  The acting was fine - they just didn't have anything to work with.  The story is the biggest ripoff ever of the much, much better Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.As far as style, I can't dog this movie at all - it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AGJLDMVGPMBV8	Simon Foster	"If you're stuck in by yourself one night, and just fancy taking your mind off things for a bit, order a pizza, crack open a bottle of beer, and check out V for Vendetta. I missed this at the cinema, but it's a perfect night in.Set in a nightmare future where an ultra-right wing government has come to power, V for Vendetta mixes a fantastic story with state-of-the-art special effects. Natalie Portman is Evie, an orphan whose life is turned around when she is saved one night by the mysterious ""V"", a vigilante who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and whose aim is the same as the original Guy Fawkes - the destruction of Parliament! And his agenda: revolution! At first horrified, Evie soon has to make a decision - to trust this mysterious masked man, or the government that oppresses the country every day! Who are the real terrorists - individuals who protest, or the government itself? Who is the mysterious V? What is the secret of his shadowy past?This film asks many questions of us - and so you feel you are an integral part in the story, touching as it does on issues such as war, bigotry and racial hatred, as V appeals to the British public to consider their own actions.V for Vendetta is a rare movie - an action-packed, but thoughtful film that makes you think about the state of the world today and the direction we're headed in. With brilliant performances from Portman, Hugo Weaving, and John Hurt, V for Vendetta not only  makes for a perfect night in, it also makes you want to get out and start making a difference - unlike some long and extremely dull books my girlfriend keeps insisting we read about generations of families in South America or people messing about in the Ukraine looking for lost pensioners.This is a film that will get you thinking - and keep you thinking."	5.0	The writing's on the wall	2006-07-22	17	11	6
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A21FHSY7N2OU58	Sincere	This movie makes you think, which is more than I can say about just about every movie that comes out of Hollywood these days.  It follows a stong set of characters who pack a punch into the political tyranny of a futuristic England which is controlled by a leader which presents many characteristics of a futuristic Adolf Hitler.  Now, I have read a review which says something about this movie being anti-bush.  I really dont see how that is.  There is a tie into todays politics, and media more importantly.  The ease to control the masses using fear is a situation we all face everyday.  Being a Canadian citizen, I am less subjected to this fear, but for Americans there is a constant battery of bullcrap news reports about terrorism that never happens.  This is because the government wants you to be afraid so that when they decide that they want to take over Iraq you will support them to do anything to rid yourself of the fear they inpose upon you.  This IS the major point of this film which anyone who found it un-moving or boring obviously failed to recognize.  The future England can be a reality of sorts if this is allowed to go on.  People should not be forced into fearing the world.  Sure terroism is very frightning, but media propoganda is beating people when they are already down.  This has always been a problem, but never as bad as it has been since 9-11.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AEDLJZMLDDGWA	"Sith Warlord ""Sith Warlord"""	"V for Vandetta is simply a Hollywood propoganda film, designed to make conservatives and Catholics look like monsters. It refers to ""America's War,"" as a prelude to a dark and dismal future ruled by conservatives despots who use the media to brainwash the populace into believing everything they want them to.It seems that Hollywood has been frustrated at their party of choice, the Democrats, inability to win elections, so they have declared all out war upon conservatism.As a conservative, I feel descrimination every time I see a film like this and had I known this was simply a propaganda film, I would never have even bothered renting it.So, if you are a conservative or a catholic, skip this one entirely. If you are a liberal who needs media to reafirm your belief that conservatives are bad people, this may be yet one more film from Hollywood which will do that for you.In one scene, the conservative equivilent of the SS breaks down the door of a house and arrests a man for having a copy of the qoran in his house. The Islamofacists must love this film for giving them positive public relations.

But alas, this is a pretty fine movie, whether it follows the outlines of the original V for Vendetta book or not. All in all it is rather engaging and enjoyable to watch... if you are so inclined, then you will probably think about it for a little bit (and perhaps read up on Old Bailey).The plot concerns a literally faceless, mysterious man who dons the mask of old school anarchist Guy Faulkes. He, his name is V, goes around and blows up building and kills coppers. He also meets a girl. She is rather smashing. Apparently the actress also played a princess in the Star Wars movies (of course, here she wears much less make-up). The government wants to stop him because they think that they are right. Maybe they are? Maybe they are not? Who is to tell anyway?Remember those guys that made The Matrix, well it was the same folks as made this nice little movie. As always, their movies are greatly concerned with seemingly pleasent societies that turn out to by dystopic in reality. Also, their movies are drenched in philosophical discourse. Just as the Matrix concerned itself with causality and whatever else, this movie concerns itself with the dichotomies present betwixt deontology and teleology. For those out there who are unfamiliar with the said terminology, look it up, eh... Regardless, this movie does not necessarilly feed you the answers to these questions, because it is quite possible that there are no answers to them. Apparently the comics are more morally ambiguous, but the moral ambiguity here was quite enough for me.All in all, this was certainly a movie worth seeing. It killed off 2 hours of my day and I am not sad at all. In fact I am happy. I was able to escape to a world more miserable than my own. And for people who are hopeless, remember that even in totalitarian societies hope exists and it might solve problems... or make more of them... who is to say.	4.0	Conservatives love this movie...	2006-10-29	5	0	5

V for Vendetta is an exciting look at the post apocalyptic world created by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.There's suspense, intense drama, a great story...everything that you want from of good movie in the genre. Critics that say V for Vendetta glorifies terrorism should get out of the movie reviewing business and get into politics.V for Vendetta is chock full of good acting by good actors that is a jolt of fresh air from the stale performances that overrun Hollywood.Natalie Portman is great, as are the main supporting cast. Unfortunately, it might be easy to forget that this is Hugo Weaving with another awesome performance (it sure is easy to remember the awesome performances by Hugo Weaving of the feared Agent Smith in the Matrix series or of the menacing Elrond in the Lord of the Rings series, no?). Weaving's Guy Fawkes mask never comes off to reveal his portrayal of V.V has a vendetta. He will attempt to bring down the Fascist government created by the apocalypse. He will deal with the leaders of the fascist regime and with those that made him what he has become. The story of his endeavors is very well put together and fun to watch.Highly recommended for adventurists that like their action with a cool, believable story.Add it to your collection.	4.0	Vindictive Vendetta	2006-08-08	2	1	1

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1O8TLZLO5EUV6	"SnoopDopeyDogg ""Mike R."""	"""V for Vendetta"" is a candidate for the overused imaginary award category of ""the greatest movie ever made"" simply because it is the greatest movie of its prescient time.  It was made at a time when most other media channels had been successfully censored and controlled by Corporate Big Brother (as they still are to a large degree), while a united cabal of Corporate and billionaire power dragged the United States to the precipice of fascism.  Movies were one of the few ways to get a democratic message across.  The success of the Wachowski brothers gave them a freedom of expression that few others in the media had, a freedom protected by their uncanny ability to make scads of money when left to their own creative devices.  The fear of killing the goose that laid the Golden Egg trumped the fear of freedom of expression.""V"" builds on the concept created in ""The Matrix"", by far the greatest movie of the Matrix Trilogy: the notion of a totalitarian regime that exerts its control over the masses in part by carefully crafted and controlled reality creation, and then goes much further.  Unlike the Matrix, V clearly establishes connections to real life events and persons, both actual and projected, such as when it portrays the United States as having descended into anarchy as blowback for its initiation of illegal wars of aggression (deemed illegal by the ""quaint"" Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg trials), complete with demonstrations with protest signs expressly identifying then-president Bush.  Right wing corporate propagandists are accurately symbolized by a composite character (Dominic) that is an irritating amalgam of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and similar right wing corporate mouthpieces from England.  Second-in-Command ""Creepy"" Creedy is an inspired interpretation/extrapolation of America's then Second (?)-in-Command vice president Dick Cheney.  John Hurt comes full-circle from victim of totalitarianism in the movie ""1984"" to totalitarian victimizer in ""V"" as the inspired choice as a prophetic tie-in to George Orwell's ""1984"", complete with numerous spot-on allusionary warnings left to be identified by the viewer.  Hurt's character unites, leads, coerces, and bullies the futuristic right wing regime into a cohesive controlling unit of Fascist England with England being symbolic of the West in general, while simultaneously dealing with the opposition as brutally as possible to thwart the will to resist.Although one could surmise from the movie's title that the hero, ""V"", utilizes his more-likely-than-comic-book-usual superpowers to become yet another avenger of the many wrongs perpetrated by Evil, a usually accurate conclusion that can nevertheless be quite entertaining, but quite wrong in this case.  For while V has some very impressive abilities attributed to nerve damage caused by his being the subject of biotoxic experimentation, he is merely the (barely) human vessel containing the means by which those held captive by fascism are freed.  V is the repository and transmitter of ideas, and it is ultimately those ideas which are the Hero of the movie, a very unusual cinematic proposition indeed.  And isn't that often a key component of great movies: unusual cinematic propositions?PS  For more enlightenment as to how this whole scenario will play out, read the Pulitzer Prize Winning ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer, from which a startling number of similarities to modern events can readily been seen, and watch the great movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to see what generally lay in store for the surviving perpetrators."	5.0	The Greatest Movie Ever Made?	2013-08-28	0	0	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ASDP39VYB1AVX	SocraticMethod	This film was based on a graphic novel, but do not expect a lot of action scenes in it, because compared to the typical super-hero, comic book action flick, there are very few.  However, the story and ideas of this film are very well put together and thought-provoking providing good entertainment without the expense of too much mindless action.  The story is relatable to many societies and governments throughout human history and almost nowhere near relative to our current government and should not be mistaken as some poilitcal propaganda tool.  Anyone who believes this film to be a message to our government or having a hidden agenda is an idiot.  The film is great, well directed, well acted, and has some small flaws in it, but nothing you keep your mind on throughout the film.  The story keeps you engaged throughout the film and you are not just waiting for the next action scene.

To such dimwitted lemmings, thank you for substantiating the need for this film.As for the film itself, it was, simply put, a work of sheer brilliance. Not as much a tool for ""the left"", as some automatons would have you believe, as it is a necessary statement on the manner in which political leaders, past and present, gain power and profit by imposing fear on society. Sound eerily familiar given today's abhorrent disgraces? If so, your mind is open. If not, your head is buried safely in the sand.Natalie Portman and ugo Weaving provide powerful performances in roles in which lesser actors would be inclined to overract. Subtlety in performance can go a long way toward allowing a film to get its message across and the aforementioned executed their roles flawlessly in this manner.I won't provide spoilers, but there are (many) scenes worth noting in this film, including the ""V""-laden preamble given by V upon meeting Evey, the sequences involving the imprisoned Evey, the scenes which detailed the events at Lark Hill, including the origin of his name, and on and on and on. This film was great on so many levels that its ""payoff"" exists throughout the film, and not just during its incredible climax.For those who were put off by some of the Matrix's (another fine film) relatively disjointed, often esoteric sequences, V for Vendetta may prove refreshing in the fact that it provides more explicit explanations of its underlying meanings and origins as it moves along through the story. As such, the ""Ahas"" come more rapidly to the viewer, thereby allowing the viewer to focus more on the events as they unfold rather than focusing on what transpired eariler in the film.In sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today. For those who can't seem to remove their political blinders before watching a film, I would suggest something more along the lines of a pro-war propaganda film from the 1940s. At least you won't have to actually *think* when viewing such a film."	5.0	Stunning work of art	2006-09-09	16	9	7

Sadly I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It is OK, but very stylised and the story seems a little aimless in places (hence the 4 stars). Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable.

I read several reviews that leaned either towards a masterpiece or the other extreme...this made me really want to see the film. Extremes are one of the things that Mr. Moore's source material dealt heavily with, and finding that opinions pertaining to the film were to the extremes gave me a sense of hope that this would not be a travesty like LXG and From Hell. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. This is the first movie I have seen since Kill Bill Vol. 1 that I would gladly pay full price to see again in theaters, as I do not have the patience to wait for the DVD release. It is everything that Alan Moore wrote, but drastically altered to fit the film media. I loved every performance in this movie, I loved seeing some of my favorite characters from the beginning of the post-modern movement brought to life so dramatically..no they weren't the same through and through, but then old friends are often different when met after a time of absence and I suppose the same holds true for fictional characters. Prothero was nothing like he was in the comic, but he did still collect dolls and his past was the same...Evey wasn't a waifish, naive street walker but her transformation is all the more believable because she actually has some knowledge of the things the state has blacklisted and an appreciation for those things...V, well-he's the same but then he could not be otherwise.  I give this film my highest praise and do believe that if you are a fan of the comic or of extremes you will thoroughly enjoy it. I'm guessing the tagline will be used to sell the DVD...I'll be in line...can't wait for, can't wait for the 5th of November.	5.0	Remember, remember the 5th of November.	2006-03-20	8	6	2

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1MD15TS5UUFBF	"Stephen A. Sperr ""Royal Messup"""	Every once in a while a film comes along that provokes your way of thinking. Fight Club did that in the 90's and this movie does that for this decade. The story follows Evy Hammond (Natalie Portman), who meets a radical who calls himself V, and dressed in the likeness of Guy Fawkes. V exposes the tyranny and treason behind the futuristic government of Norsefire, which rules England with an iron fist. V teaches Evy how to not live in fear of the government, and all the while his plan unfolds to bring a revolution and freedom to the country. There's not a bunch of violence, but when there is you are at full attention to the beautiful directing and cinematography. Oh, and did I mention Hugo Weaving is V? The man known as Agent Smith from The Matrix Trilogy and Elrond from LOTR, is at the top of his game. I love everything about this movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.	5.0	Exceptional Filmmaking	2008-04-02	7	1	6
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AGMW3I34INNYG	Stephen Cannon	V For Vendetta is a rare sort of film.  It does qualify as an action movie, but at its core are some real-world issues that are sort of timeless.  Natalie Portman stars as Evey Hammond, a girl with an interesting past whose life is saved by a masked stranger named V (Hugo Weaving).  V is a lterate, mysterious anti-hero who enjoys alliterating, but does not think twice about doing what he deems necessary.  Some would say he is a terrorist, which is sort of true.  But like all terrorists he believes in his cause, and will risk anything to see it through.  V takes Evey in, and begins his plan to collapse the dictatorial government if a future London, lorded over by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  The events that follow are very dramatic, and as we learn the stories of V, Evey, and others, there seems to be a connection in how certain events changed their lives.Directed by James McTeigue, his first effort as such, V is an impressive film.  The pacing works well, buidling to an effective conclusion.  The film is not perfect - what movie is? - but it's easily the best film I have seen this year.  Don't be deceived - this is a drama with action, much more so than the matrix films, to which V has drawn many comparisons.  If you are able, catch it in IMAX to punch up the action scenes(not that they need it!).A final note - this movie has been accused of attacking the bush administration and the war in Iraq.  Please understand that this is based on a comic book story written in 1982 railing against Margaret Thatcher's London of that time, and is only one perspective that can be applied to most government structures.  Don't take it too seriously!  Final grade: A+	5.0	V for Vivid, Voracious, Violent, and... Enjoyable!	2006-03-24	8	4	4
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A21XDUIO2A4B8J	Stephen Paul Ives-Butterfield	"PILOJ is the acronymn for ""Proscription In Lieu Of Justice"". Proscription means banishment. And, here, in ""V For Vendetta"", where govt killing is to be avenged, and where justice is impossible, V's penalty for banishment is death.Until justice is done... We are, of course, in the twisty-turny world of justifying vigilante killings. When a govt does not protect citizens from murder, when a govt is instead responsible for the murder of its citizens; when a govt does not protect citizen rights, when a govt instead violates its citizen rights; when a govt's representatives act as though they live above the law and do not obey the Constitution, then justice must be considered to be impossible.  And, the vigilante may properly contend, if those conditions hold, then that govt's claim to the consent of its citizens is forfeit, and that govt is illegitimate until justice is done.When authorities have made justice impossible, when they've wired down a society's pressure cooker's safety valve--stopping all possibility of change--and then have cranked up the heat by continually disobeying the Constitution, there's only one result to be sanely expected.Americans are there, doing that.  Stories such as ""V For Vendetta"" give us a basis for discussion, a point of departure for speculation.Vigilante killings, in some pure sense, are wrongful murders.  You cannot take the law into your own hands when you live under the rule of law.  If you do, then you must expect to pay the piper.However--no matter how genuine the rule of law seems to be at the time--every era has many persons who think they live above the law, as well as many persons who live outside the law.  Such persons can always arrange circumstances in which their killings--their wrongful taking of lives--makes justice impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain.  It's the way of the world and has been since the earliest codifications of law.  Well--with the sole exception of Switzerland, the only nation in which democracy is directly in the hands of the people at all jurisdictional levels.If we, as ordinary citizens, with no ability to make justice happen under our govt, banish a wrong-doer and his/her helpers from our society, we can choose any penalty for the banishment that we choose.  If the person is clearly guilty of robbery, not murder, we may penalize him/her by taking wealth--money and property.  If the person is clearly guilty of wrongfully taking lives, then killing that person and his/her helper(s) is arguably justifiable.And so, into the twisty-turny world of vigilante killings.The fictional man called ""V"" lives under a totalitarian govt that has proven itself to him to be guilty of many murders.  It's a fascist govt very similar to Hitler's Germany, the infamous 3rd Reich.  Under such govts, ordinary people cannot make justice happen.After his near-thing escape from a research center--in which a lethal virus and its cure were developed, killing dozens--V watches as the politician-killers take many tens of thousands of lives with their own cureable virus.  He then prepares himself for about twenty years, and then jumps up his campaign to topple the totalitarian govt.He blows things up and kills as needed to keep himself free.  Under the cloak of state-controlled news media, he kills men and women whom he knows are directly guilty of wrongful death.  He also kills their helpers, for example, policemen. Ultimately, he cuts down the criminal govt's topmost leaders.Killing helpers is a bit of a stretch legally, but those who aid others in wrongful killing are themselves part of the ""felony murder"" conspiracy.  So V's killing of the regime's policemen--as with Robin Hood's killing of ""the Sheriff's men"" in the late 12th Century--is arguably the killing of those guilty of conspiratorial felony murder and therefore arguably justifiable.You don't step very far away from Robin Hood in any dealings with vigilante justice.  The History Channel's priceless documentary, ""The Real Robin Hood"", should be on the viewing list for anyone chewing on vigilante justice.  Sure, it's probably a grautuitous hype for the Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe movie, ""Robin Hood"".  But it's the outlaw's backstory, no matter how far in the future the outlaw runs with his vigilante justice.  Surprisingly, Crowe's touchstone of Robin Hood's taking rights and liberties from the rich and giving those to the poor so that justice can be done is ""spot on"", as the Brits say, for today's needs.In any event, the key here is that V's killings are punishment for murders done by a govt that protects itself and its cronnies and under which justice is impossible.  V's unsurprising intention is to take that liberty-set from the rich and powerful and then to give it to the poor and ordinary citizens.  Hello, justice.  Hello, Crowe and Scott.  Hello, Robin Hood.That govt's self-protectiveness and illegal caring for its rich and powerful cronnies is, in fact, very similar to the US govt since the Reagan administrations in the 1980s.  (See especially, ""Inside Job"", the 2011 Oscar-winning Best Documentary of the Year, which covers the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown.)  The similarity of govts is what makes the movie, ""V For Vendetta"", an important topic of discussion and point of departure for ordinary Americans.The movie is done in a ""filmatic graphic novel"" syle, according to the filmmakers themselves.  I didn't notice any filmatic nod to the graphic novel until V's final fight, you know, when he brings his daggers to a gunfight.  Then the filmatic comic book effects fairly jump off the screen at you.  The spun and hurled daggers are given the same visual after-images that you expect to see on a comic book's pages.  Yes, it's CGI to die for.The film's story is based on a ten-issue comic book series and given the ""graphic novel"" upgrade tag.  It's writers, and certainly the adaptive filmmakers, want it to be seen as something more than comic book logic.I'm not sure that the story makes it to that next level.  The story has many twists and turns that smack of disjointed, disconnected comic book logic.  Still, the story seems more engaging than something out of the straight, superhero, comic book genre.Some of the film's core features are things that our today's revolutionaries need to digest.  Given the belief of enough people, V says, a symbol--say the blowing up of a building--can change the world.  When V's bomb blows up the buildings of Parliament at the end--punctuated by a great sprong from the airborne Big Ben clock--the implication is that he's successfully involved enough people to bring down the V-decaptivated govt.Revolutionaries, make a note.  Rule one is seeing democracy done.  It's doers must be seen by its other doers--directly and beyond the reach of the sniveling superrich or their parasitic politicians.  All the great democracy movements share this seeing.  In the end, V-the-filmatic-graphic-novel shows the needed seeing of democracy done.--spib, 23 Dec 2011"	5.0	V For Vendetta--pure vigilante PILOJ	2011-12-23	4	1	3

I'm a strong supporter of Capitalism but I despise the idea of a totalitarian government that harms the economy, deteriorates the business environment and sinks the stock market.The British Government (in the movie) is deceiving and abusing its people and I couldn't help but feeling sympathy for V and his ideology.Politics aside, the plot is interesting and extremely thought-provoking.I didn't realize it was an adaptation of a comic until recently, so I cannot comment on that subject. Actually, I am not a big fan of comics and if I had known about the comic there's a chance I would have skipped this movie. It would have been a terrible mistake if you ask me.If you are not a fan of comics either and you are lucky enough to be reading this, please forget about the comic thingy and enjoy the movie for what it is.As a final word, the fact that this movie is getting either 4/5 stars or 1 star in most of the reviews is proof enough that it will not leave you indifferent and that it's definitely worth watching.	5.0	Left-Wing, I dont think so.

While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.But what if that was not the case? What if, instead of living the way you wish, you had to live the way the government tells you to? What if you lived under totalitarian rule, and to speak out against your government was a crime punishable by death? What would you do then? Would you live in fear, or fight against the oppression?This is the question raised by ""V for Vendetta,"" a powerful look at life under total rule, a world similar to George Orwell's ""1984."" The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their ""Matrix"" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred.Hugo Weaving gives an exceptional performance as V, who uses terrorist tactics against the government, but never against innocent people. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance as Evey, a person whose parents were murdered by the government, and who finds courage with V's help. The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.The storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually-stunning. And while some may question V's actions, his actions rally the people against the corrupt government of Britain in 2020.""V for Vendetta"" is a thrilling film, full of exceptional storytelling, great performances, and thrilling action sequences.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1F2L30AG4GGET	"Steven James ""Author of the Patrick Bowers se..."	In the latest film from the Wachowski brothers viewers are given a visually stunning look at an alternate future in which a naziesque British government becomes the target of one man's brutal vengeance campaign. Hugo Weaving plays V, the masked avenger to whom an obtrusive failed coup 400 years ago on November 5th plays apocalyptic importance. Natalie Portman co-stars as Evey, an innocent bystander who becomes entangled in V's plan and ultimately finds  herself in love with him (even though he nearly tortures her to death in one of the odd subplots that just doesn't work).The movie is filmed with earnestness and vision, blending flawless special effects with a thought-provoking story about freedom, vengeance, the role of government, the importance of individuality, and the quest for truth despite the consequences. However, rather than rise to the occasion, the Wachowski brothers take a detour into using the movie to make social statements that seem to be added not because they are organic to the story, but because they are important to the filmmakers:* Those who believe in God are cruel, repressive, homophobic and hypocritical. This caricature becomes so overbearing you eventually think you're watching a propaganda film rather than an action-adventure.* The ends justify the means for individuals but not for governments.* Vengeance, including terrorism and mass murder, is acceptable as long as you were disfigured years ago at a top-secret government facility.* Mercy and forgiveness are weaker moral responses to injustice than murder, torture and revenge are.In the end, the movie is a letdown as it becomes encumbered with trying to make a point rather than tell a story and viewers are left feeling like they're supposed to be cheering for a victory that seems like a defeat. Let the Wachowski brothers have their Vendetta against society and watch `The Matrix' instead.	3.0	vengeance without mercy	2006-08-19	23	16	7

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AYKM1B74OLEVC	Story Charts	V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship. It tries to demonstrate this with four plots. The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.It's a great idea.But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is:Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby:V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courtsFrom there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules. This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V.Great idea, just didn't work for me.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.	1.0	Bravery will bring down a dictatorship	2013-08-08	7	1	6

Walther	"What originally can be thought of as ""Summer Popcorn Fare"" with large explosions, high action and a lead character whose anonymity is central to the film, surely could be an Oscar contender if positioned properly in its release.  Unfortunately, the marketing aspects of the film billed it to be an ""action flick"" competing with other comic book fare.With brilliant dialogue and amazing acting skills by Hugo Weaving (who can act 100 times better than 98% of those in the trade today, and you don't even get to see his face), the film moves along one thought provoking scene after another.  The concepts of freedom and control and what society sacrifices to acheive each are beautifully woven into a visual and auditory orgy of intense stimulation.  So much so that a viewer cannot help but be moved by the images, much less the thematic elements of the production.This isn't your simple bubble gum flick.  Combining some of the strongest themes of today, and possibly tomorrow, this movie strikes at the heart of what it means to be human and what it means to be free.  Don't be swayed by those who say there are comparisons to political persons in todays news... those people are reaching to draw similiarities.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A38I00SO3D9ZSM	S. Zayas	Every conceivable, ridiculous cliche about conservative politicians is exaggerated to the maximum and crammed into this movie.  Imagine Michael Moore writing/directing Batman meets Zorro.V for Vendetta is visually impressive.  It has that dark feel of Tim Burton's films.  Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed.  The fighting scenes -- what few there are -- are enjoyable.At the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern-day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th.  Interestingly -- and without knowing beforehand the connection between V and Guy Fawkes -- I rented and watched this movie on November 5th.  If anything good came out of viewing V for Vendetta is that it made me want to learn more about Guy Fawkes. The movie was otherwise a disappointment.	2.0	Remember, remember, the 5th of November	2006-11-06	19	7	12
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2SBJWOJR64LW6	Tabbygail7	The bottom line for this film is going to be how you interpret it.  People who don't care about the current state of political affairs should enjoy this movie despite its rather slow pace and drawn out dialoge.  Good performances are provided by all, the directing is solid, and the action scenes, few that they are, are quite effective. The references to America crumbling under its policies of recent years, however, will make many uncomfortable.  At times the film feels like a left-wing fantasy of where they believe we are headed (with references to Nazi-ism and fascism), other times it just seems like an attack on Conservative ideas (mainly regarding the war on terror).  Two things to keep in mind;  Alan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel, demanded his name be taken off this movie completely, and that it's fairly obvious a bold political statement is being made with this film.  You may applaude it or you may loathe it, depending on your views.  My opinion is that politics should be left out of comic hero/action flicks.  Save it for documentories.	3.0	Alan Moore or Michael Moore?	2006-08-14	13	7	6

I had high expectations when I started to watch it, and wasn't disappointed at all.Natalie Portman was outstanding and it was a great story with some unexpected twists.  Her performance alone was worth the price of the disc.I'm generally not a big fan of action movies, but this was one of the rare action movies that makes you think.  I found myself pulling for the terrorist and thinking about how things are rarely as black and white as they seem.  The action scenes were fun, the writing was exceptional and the acting was outstanding.Normally, when I watch a movie on dvd, I'll watch about 30 minutes at a time, but with this one, I couldn't turn it off.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AKEZ5LBU48M63	Tenna Merchent	"This story is set in London, where an evil chancellor is head of an oppressive government that rounds up anyone that is different, and uses them as guinea pigs for their biological warfare experiments. There is a fire, and the resettlement camp burns to the ground. One inmate survives, our hero V, who appears to have taken his name from his cell door, which bears the Roman numeral for five, which is ""V"". He now has a vendetta to kill all the high ranking officials that orchestrated the prison and the experiments on the inmates.The government does create a biological weapon from the program, but instead of using it on the enemy they unleash it on their own citizens to create panic, so that they can have more laws and enforcers.Due to the fire, V is horribly scared, and dons a Guy Fawkes costume including mask, wig and cape. It's creepy but powerful. Guy Fawkes was also a revolutionary who tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up parliament. Guy Fawkes day, November 5th, is a theme throughout the movie.V meets our heroine, Evey when he saves her from an evil curfew enforcer. Her life is never the same.He hijacks a TV station, and gives one of the most moving speeches I've ever heard. His theme is the government should be afraid of it's people, the people shouldn't be afraid of the government. He succeeds in blowing up a building and killing everyone on his list. The government then makes up stories to cover up his actions. He does some really bad things, even to Evey. But in the end, he has an impact on the whole country, as they finally stand up in mass against the government.It is an excellent and powerful movie that reminds us that we must fight to keep our freedoms because the government does not always have our best interest in mind, and what they tell us isn't always the truth."	5.0	Absolute power corrupts absolutely	2007-12-20	4	2	2
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A26FHFTLRBOT4N	tenth8sphere	"One of my friends saw ""V"" while it was in theaters and suggested I go. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with the reviews and decided against it. I didn't even think about the movie again until I was in my local library and saw it available for free rental. ""Oh yeah, THAT movie..."" I decided I might as well pick it up.Wow. I was FLOORED. Not only did I thoroughly love the movie, but I watched it two more times before promptly buying my own copy. This movie is fantastic. It will certainly deal with challenging issues beyond what you'd see in most films out today. This movie does not ask you to love its hero or support his side. It presents two extremes and provides the viewer with the difficult choice of laying out his own choices much as the characters in the movie must do.V is not your common hero, and the movie makes it just as easily to hope he fails as it is to hope he succeeds. Even the opponents V fights against are not without their redeeming qualities in the complex world around them.I highly recommend people see this movie, and possibly read the graphic novels that inspire it as well. Many people find the similiarities between themes in the movie and the real world to be uncomfortable - but it should be emphasized that this story was written first, and if one mirrors the other, it is today's world mirroring the original vision in ""V for Vendetta"".This movie now tops my list of favorites, I cannot recommend it enough for anyone who likes complex, emotional, and exciting films."	5.0	A film that surpasses its ratings (for once!)	2007-01-14	7	2	5
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A5BKHU13LZOKH	Terry D. Cox	"If it were merely a precautionary tale about a society lulled into totalitarian rule, I could recommend this movie as a well made, fun bit of eye candy.  There are certainly a lot of elements here to like. Specifically, the story telling is extremely effective, and the visual effects are stunning.  Despite all this, ""V For Vendetta"" is wrecked by it's absolutley relentless ranting against nationalism, conservatism, and to a lesser extent Christianity.  In particular it is a soup-to-nuts diatribe against the United States war on terror, and is intended to inform us that supposed Islamic acts of terror were actually manufactured by conservatives in order to enslave the nation and exterminate homosexuals and artists.I won't bother to enumerate the twisted parallels between the movie plot and the war on Islamic terrorism.  I'm sure they have been identified and argued to death already.  I would like to point out however, that as of the date I am writing this review, the world is now safe from George W. Bush, who has quietly ridden off into the sunset, just like all previous U.S. presidents.A side note: The 1934 movie adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is referenced multiple times through out ""V For Vendetta"".  The 2002 movie adaptation is excellent and highly recommended.Let me leave you with a question to ponder.  Do you think Hollywood will ever produce a movie about a left-of-center government that manufactures a global economic meltdown in order to usher in unprecedented socialist policies, and supress conservative political speach?"	1.0	Leftist Rant Disguised as Thought Provoking Entertainment	2009-02-15	27	7	20
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A268EEWUXYCA8Q	Terry Mesnard	"I knew I would love this movie the moment we first see V and he begins spouting lines in alliteration.  That cue right there let me know this wasn't going to be the average action film.  Of course, with all of the hoopla and news about this movie and its controversy, I never once truly thought it would be the average action film.In fact, to call it an action film is misleading.  It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.  There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.  Each of these mysteries are investigated through various means including Stephen Rea as a detective brave enough to follow the trails.  Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.  V is, of course, played by Hugo Weaving who not many know off hand but will remember him as either Agent Smith or Elrond the elf.  Natalie Portman plays Evey.  In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.V for Vendetta is about London in 2020, a time not very far removed from us, but utterly alien.  The United States has fallen from the power-country and Britain has reigned its head in a dictatorship way.  Sutler, the dictator in question, uses footage from around the world (some true some not) in order to subdue his citizens.  Citizens are told of the horrors in far off lands, the attrocities being committed.  And then is told that this ""uber-protection"" he utilizes is for his citizens best.  ""See?  We don't have these problems here in London.""  True.  But the problems there are, arguably, worse.V also owes a debt of gratitude to Guy Fawkes, the anti-hero who, in 1605, tried to blow up Parliament because of their laws that didn't given Catholics the same rights as the Angelicans.  In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.  In 2020, 400 years after this event, the day has been all but forgotten and the citizens live in blissful ignorance that they have given up all their rights.What the film makers have done, though, is give us an interesting protagonist in V.  Is he mad?  Is he genius?  Is he right?  Wrong?  None of these questions are directly and the film makers leave the audience with more questions than answers as to what to think of this film.  People are drawing connections to current day situations.  I don't think this is unfounded, but instead of using the film to make a critique of our current culture, I believe they are doing something more interesting.  The London in this movie got to the way they were due to apathy and fear and allowing their government to usurp any rights and freedoms they have.  As free citizens, this movie instead evokes us and pleads with us to not let us get to that situation.  A situation in which it takes a 'terrorist' to knock some sense into the government and its people.A must see."	5.0	Remember, remember the fifth of November	2006-03-21	10	7	3

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AMLV3B3JDF4HD	The Kite	"Original, thought-provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self-adoring film.So lets explore these ideas(and, in keeping with the movie, you can hate ME for this review but my IDEAS are bullet-proof!!!Muwahaha!).....1) OriginalPAlease. Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix-like fight scenes but, looooooooong siiiiiiiiiiigh, I was greatly deceived. I conitinued to watch in dismay as the plot frolicked into the land of  I'm Trying So Hard Not To But I'm Just Like Every Other Film and the script happily  meandered into Chock-Full of Cliches and Loving It region. There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical. He happens to be in the area to rescue a girl who happens to be beautiful and happens to work for the TV station he commandeers and happens to have a past full of rebellion. Yaaaaawn. Good thing no one believes in coincedence or else it would have been REALLY cheesy(winkwink). Of course we also have villians with 0 depth, corrupt clergy and politicians, oppressed minorities and a people rallying, sacrifical, bloody, huge explosion filled, staggering-to-the-one-you-love-just-to-be-able-to-utter-the-perfect-last-words ending. Are you asleep yet?Original? A+ for effort, F for execution.2) Thought ProvokingFirst, I will admit that V had several lines that made me smile or ponder a moment. But after his ridiculous usage of torture - the very thing that embittered him into his mission!!! - he rather lost all credibility to me. While V loathes the murderous society he lives in who kills people they don't approve of, he pracitces the same thing, killing those he doesn't approve of. He is different from them only in his opinion of what is right and wrong. He still enforces it in the same way they do - brute force. Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in... I just didn't buy it, but obviously, judging from its top of the box office 26.1million dollar opening, most everybody else did.Thought Provoking? Provoked me to just enough thought to write this review and then banish it from my mind forever.3) DaringSo it ""dared"" to ask the questions, ""What if another moraly fanatic control freak Hitler-type took over the world?""  and ""What if we were in a supremely controlled world where our every move was monitored by the government?"" I would say ""daring"" would mean if its a topic movie makers shy away from. Hardly. Just to name a few: The Manchurian Candidate, Gattaca, A.I., The Final Cut, Minority Report and of course, the Matrix Trilogy all explore this idea.Also, the whole thing was blown so out of proportion that it succeeded in paralleling no one. It was far too extreme to be daring. It took some things conservatives believe and blew it up so much that only a handful of people could actually relate. It pretended to be ""in your face"" with the truth but, honestly, no one seemed to take it personally but simply nodded thinking it was addressing ""someone else"". This is called the SECRET SAFE ROUTE - make yourself look like you're willing to say anything while offended a maximum of 1% of the population.Daring? Close but no cigar.Ok, so the total of the above is a big whopping F. However, there were a couple things that inched it up to a C- on my scale.1) Natalie Portman = lovely and believable performance, especially toward the beginning of the film. I think she will be one of those stars that just goes on forever, impressing if not a little shy of stunning us with her beautiful acting skills.2) The cinematoghrapy, costumes and setting = The usage of color in this movie is very nice. We have a dark feel overall, spotted with some reds and whites and just when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story). All the outfits and colors fit the characters, although the Hitler-type motif was a little over the top. The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely. The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye-candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.I don't mind so much if someone likes this movie(my boyfriend and my sister seem to enjoy it just fine) as long as you don't insult my intelligence by telling me its original, thought-provoking or daring.So, my View is that I am the Victim of this Valient effort, which Veered into Vanity and Verbosness, concluding with Virtually no Value.In short, V adored itself enough that none of us need to waste the effort."	2.0	V for Very stupid	2006-09-26	35	13	22

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	APRZ2IVM8JTLV	The Mysterious Traveler	V FOR VENDETTA(2006) Created by the Wachowski Brothers. Based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore. Starring Natalie Portman, John Hurt and Hugo Weaving.Set in the not too far future, England is controlled by a Christian Conservative vaguely Nazi/fascist goverment that achieved power by staging a fake terrorist attack by supposedly Moslem Extremists. The current govt persecutes Moslems, Gays and liberals while forcing the people to watch what is supposed to be Fox News. Luckily a masked super powered Terrorist/freedom fighter dressed like Guy Fawkes begins blowing up famous landmark buildings and training the populace to give up their individuality and rise up against the govt while assassinating various Fox News clones, wicked pedophile Catholic priests and breaking the necks of persons done up to look like Dick Chaney.Another of Hollywood's--and the most blatant of the batch---Pro-terrorist films that follows the Al Queda/Liberal Party line right down to the periods and the commas. While also,by implication, Anti-semetic, the film makes VERY clear that in the Current War on Terror, it is the EVIL Christians(especially Catholics and Jews) and Conservatives on one side vs the heroic and Noble Moslem Terrorists, the Gay Agendists and the Liberals on the other. There is no parsing this and fudging it. This is EXACTLY what the film says along with justifing terrorism, promoting hatred and promulgating the most venomous lies. It is, short, one of the most evil films ever produced taking its rightful place along side THE BIRTH OF A NATION, THE ETERNAL JEW, MISSION TO MOSCOW, THE KILLING FIELDS and EARTH. It is hardly surprising that even Alan Moore, liberal hysteric he may be, had his name taken off the picture. This is the cinematic equivalent of MEIN KAMPF, THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO or THE KORAN. People will have their minds slaughtered because of this film. People's souls will be poisoned because of this film. People will die because of this film. People HAVE died because of this film.On the other hand, Hugo Weaving gives a wonderful performance and one imagines this will be popular at Liberal/Communist movie parties.	2.0	THE ETERNAL CHRISTIAN	2014-03-10	3	0	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AYCNDDEXSSK87	"The Nellernator ""Nell"""	This movie is amazing. i absolutely loved it. this movie will instill ideas and questions in you about yourself and about your government. i think everyone should be made to watch this movie.this movie is about a corrupt government in the future. it is a government ruled by fear and oppression and the excessive need for conrtol and power on the government's power, under total control of the Chancellor Sutler. he's done everything possible to kill free thoughts and different people. everything from The Koran to same sex marriage has been banned and the mews networks are controlled by the government and they report false or biased opinions (not too unlike that of Fox News Network).Theres a man named V who is a freethinker and the starter of this idea that is to change this government. he challenges all the ideas the government stands for. he meets Evey (natalie portman) by chance on the street, and they form a bond over the fact that the government is looking for her. he kills the people making the government corrupt and leaves the new ideas to different peoplem, who obviously want a change.the ending is very good and i couldn't have asked for one better. there are ideas expressed in the movie... maybe subliminally, maybe not so hidden...about whats to come of the world as a result of this war America is in or have started. its a very very good movie that poses plenty of questions for you to ponder. it sux that i had to wait to come to DVD because my local movie theater wouldn't get it. and thats exactly the reasoning that gets us to the government in this movie.  go rent this.	5.0	Remember, Remember, the 5th of November	2006-08-15	8	2	6

This movie brings to the forefront how a government can quickly go from the minimal required to ensure that free trustworthy citizens can go about their life, to an overprotective, lying, ends justifies the means tyrant system.I do find it ironic that it takes place in England, a monarchy.  I thought for sure the only better setting would be the republic of the united states of america, or the republic of france.  That is my only critique, as the film does a great job at questioning what is worth losing freedom for...  Money, security?...  These will evaporate, and you will only be left with a tyrant society.  SO WHY do we allow it???I think I know, but I don't want to be just another person using Amazon reviews to make a political point today.  All in all, it is a great film.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1NSUJJCG73IRF	"The Tweeder ""tweeder16"""	"Director:  James McTeigueCast:  Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigott-Smith, Rupert Graves, Roger Allam, Ben Miles.Running Time: 132 minutesRated R for strong violence and some language.After a disappointing outcome in making ""The Matrix"" into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the ""Matrix films"", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless.  In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, ""Episode 3: Attack of the Clones"" and ""Garden State"") becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black (played by ""The Matrix"" trilogy's Hugo Weaving), who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name ""V"". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, in a fine supporting role) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator (John Hurt), whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. As the film progresses, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.""V for Vendetta"" is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and takes a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy. While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's""1984"". Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the forefront all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism. The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architect in ""Matrix Reloaded"", the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. ""Vendetta"" takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.  When the year 1984 approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year 2020 just around the corner, will ""V for Vendetta"" do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought."	4.0	V for Vendetta (2006)	2006-08-03	0	0	0

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2C4EG9LRTNQW1	Thomas A. Holmes	Whittling the complexities of Alan Moore's intricate graphic novel (illustrated by David Lloyd), shifting the politics from an attack of Thatcher's England to a mix of Orwellian futuristic dystopia and contemporary politics, the film version of V FOR VENDETTA offers polish and style but little else. One can see what this film aspires to be--it contains obvious references to Michael Radford's adaptation of Orwell's 1984, David Fincher's adaptation of Palahniuk's FIGHT CLUB, and the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX--but it falls flat. 1984 provides us Winston Smith to win our empathy and pity. FIGHT CLUB suggests that the populace would develop a movement driven by passion. THE MATRIX offers a simple story but an innovative, visually riveting form of storytelling. The film V FOR VENDETTA glosses over the confusing dynamics of the relationship between V and Evey (Stockholm syndrome? love? brainwashing?), replaces activism with costuming, and lacks the visual verve one would expect from a Wachowski production. I should note that the masked Hugo Weaving performs impressively, given his reliance on his voice and postures to convey feeling, but the fine cast cannot save this muddled production. It would be better to spend time with the above-mentioned pieces that have inspired this film.	3.0	V for Vapid	2006-08-11	19	11	8
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A8NB711TPAGFB	"Thomas Farrell ""irish02144"""	I simply adore this film. It's intelligent, sophisticated, emotional, vivid, beautiful, well written, well acted, and well filmed. I saw it in the theater 5 times, I just kept feeling pulled back to it. I cried like a baby every time I saw it. It's utterly brilliant. If it were for the movie alone, I'd unquestionably rate it 5 stars.Such a pity, then, that the DVD transfer has obvious video problems. Particularly, the video brightness pulsates ever so slightly on about a twice a second rate. In scenes with bright color and lots of motion it's hardly noticable, but this is a story told in shades of black, so it gets rather glaring at times. In many scenes where the foreground subject, such as a person, takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest is a murky background, the background seems to subtly pulse and throb behind the person. It can get distracting.I'm rating this DVD 4 stars because of this icky video problem, which I feel should have been caught and corrected before any discs were sold. I'm tempted to rate it 3 stars for that reason, but I just can't bring myself to give such a low rating to such an unbelievable film strictly for technical reasons.	4.0	A movie for the ages, with a substandard DVD transfer	2006-08-04	5	2	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A6AAHA3OXM4SK	"Thomas Huff ""(BlownPotential.com)"""	"Before I start my review, I feel I should disclose to you this; I am a huge Alan Moore fan. For those of you not familiar with Alan Moore, he revolutionized the comic book industry back in the early 80s by blurring the distinction between the good guys and the evil-doers they pursue. Two of his works in particular are legendry, Watchmen and V for Vendetta. However, the two previous attempts to adapt his work, From Hell (2001) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), were both cinematic disappointments, both mutilated after they left Moore's hands. But this time around the Wachowski Brothers, who we know as the guys responsible for the Matrix films, are at the helm, and if anybody should have a feel for how to treat this material, it's them. Plus with last year's Sin City and A History of Violence bringing the ""comic book movie"" to a new level, getting your hopes up for a movie in this genre is no longer just for the adolescent.V for Vendetta was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in Britain and didn't hit North American shores until 1988, when DC Comics (owned by Warner Bros.), reprinted it in the form of a 10 issue mini-series, as a follow up to Watchmen. For some years now, Warner Bros. has been tryng to turn both V and Watchmen into films, and now V for Vendetta is finally here.The Wachowski Brothers leave familiar territory to take us down a new rabbit hole in V for Vendetta; this time, attempting to free our minds in a much less virtual world. The lead character V (played by Hugo Weaving of The Matrix trilogy) is a vigilante striking out against an oppressive Orwellian government in Britain's near future, with the help of a young television production assistant named Evey (played by Natalie Portman). V dons a mask depicting the caricature image of Guy Fawkes and picks up where this English folkhero left off hundreds of years before. If you don't happen to be an aficionado of British culture, Guy Fawkes attempted to destroy London's House of Parliament in 1605 with some two-and-a-half tons of explosives. He was, however, caught, and then hanged, and then drawn, and then quartered - a very nasty death indeed. The Brits now celebrate this occasion every year on Guy Fawkes Night (the 5th of November) much like we celebrate the 4th of July.Hugo Weaving's portrayal of V captures your attention with a chilling verse reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe in his grand entrance, and doesn't let go until the final credits role. The conviction Weaving is able to convey through an inert mask is simply mesmerizing.The stunning futuristic world that rookie director James McTeigue has captured is almost a little too real in this riveting film. In fact, you could probably take nearly any random 30 second clip from this movie and it would serve as an intriguing preview. V for Vendetta should evoke an emotional response in everyone that sees it, whether that be the inspiration to think for one's self or utter disgust at the film's bleak political message. For myself, it evoked delight.Check out [...] for my latest movie reviews."	5.0	A Film to Remember, Remember	2006-03-18	16	10	6

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"A mysterious figure known as `V' (Hugo Weaving) begins an assault against England's government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt). He saves Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman, from the Fingermen, a covert branch of the government's police force. His first step is to attract the attention of the people and he does this by blowing up the Old Bailey, the symbol of law and justice within England, a system that no longer works. Sutler is outraged and immediately summons a meeting of his inner council, lording over them through a huge video screen. Sutler orders Finch (Stephen Rea), the leader of the police force, to find the perpetrator. As V wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout, it is difficult to identify him, so Finch zeroes in on Evey.M for Message""V for Vendetta"", written and produced by the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy) and directed by James McTiegue is the latest entry in what I hope will be a continuing trend. We all know Hollywood loves blockbusters. Generally, these films are exercises allowing the filmmakers to trot out all of their tricks. Sort of like the old Mickey Rooney - Judy Garland films. ""Let's put on a show"" followed by a huge, elaborate musical in their backyard, or the barn, with great musical numbers, full orchestras, but little rhyme or reason. In today's Hollywood, a new film is the excuse to showcase any new special effects or stunts, showcasing the `talents' of everyone involved. Story? Story is unimportant. ""Look at all of the cool crap we can blow up. Let's put on a show.""With ""Batman Begins"" and now ""V for Vendetta"" (yes, in Hollywood, two films count as a trend. I would consider ""Terminator 2"" part of the trend but that was released too long ago) we see a movement to create blockbusters which also attempt to say something. ""Vendetta"" tries to incorporate messages about government control, some of which may be viewed as parables for our current administration.T for ThematicBased on a graphic novel, the author has removed his name from the film because he was unhappy with the thematic changes in the story. His graphic novel was created with a critical eye towards Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. I have never read the graphic novel, so I can't comment on any changes, but the film seems to be more a critique of the current British and American governments.There are scenes depicting wire tapping, prolonged wars, chemical experiments which may have lead to chemical warfare, spin doctors, government control in the face of paranoia, political talk show hosts and more.V for VisualThe film creates an interesting visual universe blending elements of modern design, the Nazis, Big Brother, the 1940s, and ""Phantom of the Opera"". These ideas and images blend together far too easily and help create a world which seems a little old fashioned and a little modern. Visually, this works extremely well with the thematic elements, reinforcing the message for every two steps forwards, we take one step back.H for History""Vendetta"" is set in the future, but as historians will tell you those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. The film begins with a prologue depicting the story of Guy Fawkes, the man who attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605. Moving forward more than 400 years, ""Vendetta"" begins on November 4 and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, V blows up the Old Bailey.B for Back-storyBut we have questions and the questions need to be answered. Who is V? How did he come about? What prompted him to begin his current journey? What is Evey's background? How did the Chancellor come to rule Britain with an iron grip? These are important things for us to know, to help make these characters believable and interesting. And the filmmakers realize this importance. A considerable amount of screen time is spent portraying part of these histories; through a series of back stories and montages, we learn these things, adding depth and interest to the story. If you think about it, few dramas made in Hollywood today devote this much time to the back-story, let alone a big budget `action' film.O for ObserverAt one point, there may be too much back story. Because so much time is devoted to four or five various bits of history, these serve to take us out of the story, making us an observer, not a participant. We almost, not quite but almost disconnect from the story. Just as V expects British citizens to realize they need to stand up and fight for their rights, the filmmakers expect us to participate in the film. Passive observance isn't enough for this film, yet it almost gets that. One of the back stories in particular tests our resolve; it seems unnecessary to learn about a character we never actually meet the person in the film.G for GoodNatalie Portman is good as Evey Hammond, the young woman who becomes V's unwitting accomplice. Initially, she is just like every other British citizen; trying to deal with the past while surviving in the present with little overt concern about the future. How does she do this? She tries to forget the past and complacently deal with the present. As she becomes embroiled in Vs plot, she begins to gain strength, to become an ally to the masked man. It is an interesting performance. Throughout a significant portion of the film, her character is imprisoned, tortured or interrogated. After this, she is still not completely committed to V's cause, the transformation continues. It is testament to everyone involved that Evey never becomes a superhero, always remaining a human being. It is her resolve, her persona that must change.H for HeroHugo Weaving (Agent Smith, ""The Matrix"" trilogy) has the most difficult role; behind a mask throughout, he has to create a character without facial expressions. He does this in a manner of ways, through words, body language, and action. His hands and arms, the cock of his head, his voice, all lend to his character. On more than one occasion, he uses riddles to temporarily perplex his foes. At one point, a speech uses seemingly every word beginning with the letter `V'. This verbal exposition provides a unique, fun and interesting dimension to his character.More importantly, Weaving manages to convey the various complexities of his character. Technically, he is an outlaw, but we see the world he lives in, through his eyes, and realize he is more of a hero. Some of his actions may appear severe, but his character is living in desperate times. Desperate times call for desperate measures.S for SupportThe supporting cast is universally good, providing an interesting level to the film. Stephen Rea is the standout as Finch, the leader of the traditional police. He begins to realize the problems with the current regime, yet still must carryout his job. Throughout, we see the conflict on his face, testing him every minute, Stephen Fry is very good as a television personality hiding a secret from the world. John Hurt is suitably ominous as Chancellor Sutler, always appearing on large video screens. Tim Piggot-Smith is very good as the head of the Fingermen, the government's version of the Gestapo.C for Conclusion""V for Vendetta"" is a very well-made film with a lot of ideas and messages. It is not a traditional action film. There are a few choreographed fight sequences, but the majority of the film is a drama, exploring how V and Evey will change there country, for the better, for the worse, through their actions and the actions of the people."	4.0	E For Excellent	2006-03-21	18	14	4

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2UNMXBJSVIXFB	Tony Khamvongsouk	"Movie - 4.5V for Vendetta strikes me as a well-scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once. But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his ""quest"" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations. Aside from the obvious parallel between he and The Count of Monte Cristo, I particularly find the whole ""rebellion against authority"" theme to be a refreshing testament to the way certain governments can sometimes be a bit too controlling or ironically nave for their own good, which in turn can cause said revolution. This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long. And as history (or even science) has proven, for every action, there is indeed an equal and opposite reaction; authority &lt;--> rebellion. But in one of the more unique twists, this revenge and rebellion is all catalyzed under the guise of a Guy Fawkes-masked vindicator whose actions also indeed can fit that of a textbook terrorist. 9/11 undertones are easily apparent when they mention the symbol of a building being destroyed and its ability to change the world for better or worse. I don't know when this graphic novel was written, but apparently the symbolism is justifiably and eerily accurate for what it's worth. I suppose it just depends on which side you're coming from and the amount of subjectivity involved when trying to observe such events. But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The only problems I had were a few pacing issues with the screenplay, that might've been better resolved with either a longer run time or more immersing musical score.Video - 3.5Presented in VC-1 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, I took a look at the bitrates (mostly in the high teens and low 20s) and it appears Warner Bros. used the exact same transfer from the previously released HD-DVD (aka the more inferior release). After reading the BD review of Batman Begins, I am now convinced that during the format war, some movies may have unexpectedly gotten the shaft in terms of a faithful transfer/encode. Because of the mere max capacity of 30GBs on a dual-layered HD-DVD, there wasn't as much space for as good a transfer/encode. The result: a few movies not quite meeting up to BD expectations LIKE a Batman Begins, V for Vendetta, and whatever else I might have in my library that was caught up in the war. Needless to say, while the BD presentation here is good, it's probably nowhere near as good as it could be. Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly-encoded, titles. Sharpness is around what you'd expect for an HD presentation, but some scenes looked a tad grainy and fuzzy (and not the good kind, like a Bourne Identity on BD, which by the way was re-encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates). Blacks aren't particularly deep either, which is a shame as it's a pretty dark movie. I'm disappointed, but it's better than DVD anyway...Audio - 4.0In addition, this TrueHD 5.1 track also seems to be a direct copy of the HD-DVD's. I don't have any HD-DVDs to compare, but I've heard other Warner Bros. titles with the same option, and they are remarkably more in depth than what we're given on this BD. Most of the film is dialogue and comes through very crisp (not that it should be hard), but the more action-focused scenes were lacking in surround usage. Music (one of the problems I had with the film overall) also seems less immersing than I'd like (where at least Batman Begins had a terrific score). LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes. It's not quite up to snuff with other BDs having only an average bitrate between 1.6 and 2.1Mbps, but it's better than regular Dolby Digital.Extras - 3.5I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind-the-scenes footage concerning production and writing, but I felt there weren't enough. The one segment making comparisons between V and a terrorist is especially interesting, though they could've offered a little more subjectivity to the ideas and overall concepts of what this could represent in society. All features are in SD.Overall - 4.0I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre -- to essentially portray the hero as a terrorist. Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film. But regardless, the plot itself touches upon many subtleties about authority, self-will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc. I highly recommend this for the great story. But with only an average A/V transfer thanks to HD-DVD's inferiority and the laziness of Warner Bros. studios to do a proper re-encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles."	4.0	V for Vendetta (Blu-ray)	2009-02-04	7	7	0

How do you inspire a nation that's been bullied into silence?The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase ""good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails"". Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying ""That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much."" The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a ""yellow coded"" curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should.

It is what most call an ""idealistic"" film that centers around a futuristic England where all chaos has been forcefully put to an end. In a world where disease, crime, and hatred became so rampant in America, a man by the name of Adam Sutler invented the role of high chancellor, and performed ""cleansing"" in England by initiating strict rules to create a seemingly perfect, ""Godly"", nation. The writers of this script wanted to show what could happen if our nation continues in the downword spiral we are in. They showed that the justice system can never be without flaw when Evey, the main character in the film, is out past the twelve o'clock curfew. She is confronted by a group of fingermen, who are the police of the nation, and they surround her. They threaten to beat and abuse her when ""V"", the defender of the innocent and punisher of the unjust, steps in and rescues Evey. This is just one example of how this movie shows the flaws in human nature. This movie was amazingly well written and directed. The characters and lines were powerful and moving.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1E2POEKKLNLD9	"Triniman ""Triniman"""	"V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novels by British writer Alan Moore, is the first new film by the Wachowski Brothers since the final Matrix film. And we know how disappointing that series turned out to be.The setting is in the not too distant future in the fascist police state of England, where deviant art, culture and sexual behavior is outlawed and nighttime curfews are strictly enforced. The public broadcaster is essentially the Ministry of Propaganda, and they put the government's spin on events to constantly cover up the truth about crimes of dissention.Our protagonist wears a Guy Fawkes mask (the guy who tried to blow up the British parliament buildings in 1605) to conceal both his identity and his burned face. He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) - who was on her way to dinner at a co-workers house - from a sexual attack by the curfew authorities (the ""Fingermen"").By coincidence, they ran into each other again at the public broadcaster's office, where he managed to air a pre-recorded explanation of his ""terrorist"" demolition of a government building (the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court) the night before, which the government tried to cover up by calling it a scheduled demolition. I didn't buy how she bonded easily and agreed to live with this creepy stranger so quickly in his windowless lair/deviant culture museum.Natalie Portman is miscast as a Brit and but despite her poor attempt to fake the accent, her performance was all right. Hugo Weaving's ""V"" character is foiled by the useless cute aliteration in his opening scene as well as his quoting of the Bard to suggest his wit, intellectual depth and credibility of his largely symbolic mission. John Hurt plays the leader of the government, a Hitler-esque fascist, but he was largely one-dimensional. Stephen Rea as detective Finch does the best with his lines.In the film, there is a conspiracy story regarding human experimentation, deliberate unleashing of deadly viruses, huge profits for the cure, people falsely arrested under the pretense of being terrorists, people concealing deviant sexual lives, etc. The story could have had more impact for me if there wasn't such an ambitious attempt to stage a spectacle, both visually and story-wise.The Wachowski Brothers aren't known for carrying a story with subtlety and intrigue and instead hammer you over the head with action and scenes that could have been edited out. The story seemed squandered rather than focused and tight.I wouldn't see this film again and give it a rating of 2/5."	2.0	...for the masses, but not that good	2006-03-17	42	22	20

I've had to stop and think a moment before I could even remember what movie I'd seen. They're all alike, or remade, or just generic mannequins doing predictable things, so that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart.Not so with V for Vendetta: you won't forget what you've seen!Its chief resemblance to the book is that both are flawed, not perfect by any means -- but there is so much more to love than to lament! Both entertain, provoke, and haunt you with home truths, both move to laughter and to tears, and leave scenes replaying in your imagination.The movie was wonderfully faithful to the book, not in every detail, but more than faithful in spirit. The graphic novel had many subplots, which filled out the story but at times almost detracted, or at least distracted, from the key ideas. A movie, of necessity, must pare things down a bit, but in this case it was like chipping away excess to reveal the facets and true colors at the heart of a gem.What remains is a haunting melody about the human spirit: we do mess things up badly, but even greater is our propensity to overcome and be transformed. The movie added focus to the ways V adapted to unthinkable torment, and the way Evey (and the woman letter-writer) discovered in the worst of times that our ""last inch"" of integrity is really our only treasure.* The movie highlighted the way the human spirit responds to horror and brutality--to survive, surmount, and transcend, becoming more than we were before. V rescued and preserved the best of the human spirit -- not just in the art and music and books he treasured, but also in himself. He could have become a monster, but it was his love--for humanity, for beauty, for humor, for integrity--that kept him from the edge.* The movie also emphasized that ideas are powerful instruments of change, and ideas can't be killed. If change is to be accomplished, it cannot be by the will of one man (like the despotic Chancellor), but must truly reflect the will of the governed. (The deployment of the Fed-Ex packages, for instance.) ;)I heard that Moore had at first withdrawn, but had a change of heart about the film--I hope that's true because, as the creator who wrote the above points across so many minds and hearts, he should be thrilled and proud.My deep gratitude to both Moore and the briliant creators of this film.

I give it a low rating simply because when I compare it to other Blu-Ray transfers, it amazes me that a 2006 film would have glare as if the telecine was not light tight. For 75% of the film the sharpness and blacks look good, but for about 25% (especially dark scenes) there's what looks like a light leak in areas that should be pitch black. The studio should really think about stopping production on this disc and take it back in to remaster it. Then they can send coupons to the owners of the first release for exchanges to what should have been done right the first time.Why does this transfer have issues that Donnie Brasco, 3:10 to Yuma, and Casino Royale don't have? If they want us to pay more for the Blu-Ray format, the studios really need to make sure they are providing the best product; otherwise people like myself will be out there to tell everyone to hold off until they hear that there has been an improved version released.	2.0	Movie is Excellent.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Whether you may like him or not, `V for Vendetta' is produced by Joel Silver, one of the strongest players in Hollywood, the one behind the successful `Matrix' trilogy, and the script of `V' is written by none other than Wachowski Brothers. First-time director James McTeigue worked as assistant director in three `Matrix's and one `Star Wars' and yes, the titular `V' is played by Hugo Weaving. This time, however, you never see his face hidden behind a mask - like Agent Smith wearing glasses. And fewer action scenes.`V for Vendetta' is set in the totalitarian society of England in the near future, where one masked anti-hero shakes up the nation's political system which is controlled by one Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police.[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey.To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.	4.0	V for Visuals and Very Stylish Ones: Masked Musketeer in Totalitarian World	2006-06-05	8	4	4

When you read a book do you just skim over the first 30 pages, then skip to the last 50?V for Vendetta was by far one of the most powerful movies of 2006 (and up there with the most powerful movies ever for that matter)!  I actually fell asleep too during the beginning the first time I watched it because it was LATE and I was TIRED, but a few days later I started it from the beginning & was completely blown-away.

If you continue to go along with what you're told, just sit back and watch our freedoms slide further and further down the drain from all the power-trips...oops...I mean politics until our world is a spitting image of what it is depicted as in the year 2020 in VfV.  Look at all of the changes in our society in the last 15 years, and with the world changing faster and faster every year that passes...just imagine what we'll be facing in even the next 10 years if certain things don't change.  Instead of just writing off VfV with a closed mind & bad review, I highly suggest you watch it with an open mind & try thinking outside the box for once in your life.

He was a member of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, but was captured before the plot could be completed.  Under extreme torture he revealed the names of the other conspirators and they were all hung together.  Each year in England and other parts of the British Commonwealth Guy Fawkes day is celebrated on November 5 with bonfires that burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, fireworks, and massive parties.Information like this is not usually needed to enjoy and understand a movie. However, when the movie is as deep, complex, and dark as V FOR VENDETTA the information above is essential to understanding the film.  V FOR VENDETTA is based upon a graphic novel written by Alan Moore.  The movie takes place in a not all that too distant future.  The world is a complex hybrid of George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's A BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Due to a misguided war of domination, the United States is no longer a superpower and Britain is back in control with a new Empire.The country is led (actually ruled) by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt).  Sutler rules the country with an iron hand and makes his ways known to the public through a variety of messages that he broadcasts via huge video screens and across the nation's television network.  The populace seems to have become addicted to amusement and spends the majority of their time watching television. They know that most of the news they hear is actually made up, but they still watch and listen.On a clear night at midnight on November 5th, V (Hugo Weaving) blows up the Banking Building in London.  Later in the day, he hijacks the news station and broadcasts a message to the country asking the citizens to join him in one year from the day when they will begin a revolution, eradicate Parliament, and begin things anew.  ""Remember, remember the fifth of November.""  While at the television station, V is joined by Evey (Natalie Portman) a woman he saved from being raped and arrested the night before.  Evey is knocked unconscious during the chaos and V brings her back to his secret lair.  As the plot thickens, Evey becomes V's accomplice as he begins killing various government officials who were responsible for secret government killings of their own citizens.  The action rises and falls like the graceful melody of a symphony until the final act when all the game pieces are put into place and checkmate is called.V FOR VENDETTA is based off of a comic book, but it's not like a typical comic book movie.  In most comic book movies, though there might be a great deal of character development there is a ton of action, not a great deal of dialogue, and hardly any serious thinking necessary by the viewer.  V FOR VENDETTA does have a great deal of character development, but other than that and the mask and costume that V wears, that's about the only similarities between this and the average comic book film.  The film is full of serious dialogue, witty diatribes, and monologues full of alliteration.  This wonderful wordplay just isn't amusing; it also forces the audience to think about what the speakers are saying.  Words are meaningful and have power and V FOR VENDETTA does an excellent job of illustrating this.Also, V FOR VENDETTA doesn't really have a traditional hero.  Though it could be argued that Evey is the film's heroine, we don't see her in action or on screen long enough to know whether she is the heroine.  Instead, we are presented with the actions of V and it is he himself that the movie revolves.  It can be argued that V is the hero because he performs some truly heroic actions during the course of the film:  he prevents Evey from being raped, he leads a popular uprising against a tyrannical dictatorship, he fights battles for the average citizens, and he salvages works or Art from destruction.  At the same time, V performs his very heroic deeds through some very dishonorable and ignoble means, for example he murders people and performs acts of massive terrorism.  Many might decide that a character such as V is too much like those who destroyed the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon to be a hero.Overall, V FOR VENDETTA is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film.  The film doesn't rely upon action to move the story along, is full of character development, and contains some extraordinary witty wordplay.

The creators of this film took intelligence and delicacy into making a nearly flawless adaptation.  Reason Being?  Material that didn't make it to film is what would have destroyed it.  V for Vendetta is not a word for word translation.  V the film is a updated and different approach with everything that was the heart and soul of the book.  They snipped and cut what they needed to and added fresh material to give the film more substance.I really feel sorry for Alan Moore after the LXG movie.  It really did no justice to him, and it did not display any of his writing talent.  V for Vendetta however is bleeding with Moore dialogue.  More than half of the films dialogue comes straight from the graphic novel, and it's really inspiring to see a hollywood movie do justice like that.  And even the new and different scenes compliment the Alan Moore setting like you never would have guessed.  Graphic novels like Watchmen and V are very cinematic but not everything can translate to film.  Although it was nearly the same, the Watchmen picture did have a entirely different ending.  This is simply because you can do different things in books that you can't in film.Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman?  Who would have thought? This duo turned out to be the best idea the film had.  I'm not familiar with the other actors but they certainly deserve more and more screen time in their future.  Portman is significantly different from the girl in the novel, but it was a smart move for the film.  The independent and thought-provoking Evey in the film is way more interesting and inspiring than the girl in the book. Giving her a smarter role really gave the audience something more interesting.  And Hugo?  What can I say? Hugo has never basterdized a role in a film.  He was spot on with V.V for Vendetta is one of the benchmark comic book movies that really got it right.  After seeing this I regained hope for all adaptations, because this one director thought to preserve the art of the book, and not just sell it.  We really take for granted how much these people work to make a film an artwork, when one can simply just sell it with action, effects, and sexuality.

It is more serious and important than any other's that I've seen. And more intelligent. Its not just about action sequences and explosions (though there is that). It deals with real issues, sensitive issues. It really makes you think. V is a great character. Beneath his mask, you can tell that he is in pain, physically and mentally. He really is unique and a completely different type of 'hero' than I've ever seen. Hugo Weaving did a great job in portraying emotion without ever taking off the mask.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1XMX65M9K6DGL	Vapor.Trails	"When I added V to my net flix queue I had no idea who made it or what it was about. I vaguely remembered commercial trailers on TV for it back in 2005. When I popped it in the DVD player I was appalled at its blatant hatred of the United States and traditional values. And when writing this review I was quite dismayed at the vast majority of other reviewers that either don't understand what this movie is truly about or are so brainwashed by leftist radicals that they cheer right along with V's anti-American, pro-Islamic terrorist propaganda.You can read elsewhere for storyline, plot and setting. My comments here are centered on the movie's theme. That is America (the place where any gender, religion, creed or sect is free to pursue their own happiness in any way they see fit) is only one step away from Nazi Germany. Yet, Islamic terrorists (people who mutilate young girls as a matter of religious faith, blow up children, behead civilians, fly planes into skyscrapers, preach and attempt the genocide of entire cultures) are the enlightened one who are to be aligned with to save the world from evil Christians and Conservatives. The whole premise of this movie is sickening. Republican or Democrat, Liberal or Conservative; we as Americans should be outraged and united against people who whose sole purpose is to destroy our civilization. Not supporting them as this film does.The most pathetic aspect of terrorist sympathizers, those who made and agree with this film, is that they have no concept of what radical Islam would do to them if given the chance. Do they really believe that the likes of Bin Laden and Ahmadinejad would embrace their lifestyles? To terrorists, America haters are useful idiots who would rapidly be dispatched in a radical Islamist State. Just when was the last time you saw a gay pride parade in Iran, for example? V for Vendetta claims that Christians and Conservatives are the totalitarians of the planet. Yet, when was the last time you heard Catholic leaders calling for the destruction of a Masque, or a Jewish Temple? Was it Saddam Hussein or the Pope who paid $25,000 to the families of homicide bombers? Was it al-Zarqawi or Mother Teresa who beheaded Nick Berg? Would the transgendered Wachowski be welcomed as a Muslim? Or would he destroyed along with all the other ""infidels"" that radical Islamists have sworn to kill?If you believe that Osama Bin Laden, Ward Churchill, Cindy Sheehan and the like are the moralists in this world; if you believe that the U.S. government staged 9/11; if you ignore the U.S.S. Cole, the WTC bombing, the U.S. Embassy bombing, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbolla's public cry for the destruction of the West; if you are sympathetic to those who are sworn to kill you then this movie is for you.But, if you recognize that terrorists are the enemies of freedom; that (most people in) western societies do not support fascist religious leaders and their followers terrorizing the world, then stay far away from this film."	1.0	Hypocritical Hatred of the West	2007-02-03	100	60	40

Either you loved the movie or you hated it with every fiber of your being. All of you missed the main theme in the movie in my opinion. To do what needs to be done no matter the cost. It doesnt matter if the political roles were revered and V was a conservative trying to oust a liberal government the theme would have been the same. You who say that this is an attack on Bush are retarded. Go out. Buy the comic. Read it if you can. Understand that this story is powerful.

I'll avoid the political and social commentary and diatribes in my review.The acting was exemplary in my opinion.  Portman did a great job (as usual), but I have to tip my hat to the actor who had the task of playing the role of V.  It has to be difficult to use purely gesture and voice inflection to play a part, and he was excellent!  I could imagine the emotions hidden behind the mask.Yes, the film could be interpreted as being somewhat ""preachy"" and portraying a transparent political and/or social agenda, but it makes one think.  It can evoke strong emotion.  To me those are things that can make a movie great.I could've used less gore in the final battle scene between V and the bad guys though.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3OZHR830G7H2U	"Walrus Rex ""rexferal"""	"First, the good news. This is a pretty exciting story and a pretty will made movie.Now the bad news: It is a dangerous piece of political propaganda.One of the themes of this movie is that lies are told to reveal the truth. And so it is with this movie although the revealed truths are not those ""truths"" that the movie makers intended.The nutjob left loves this movie. DU and other moonbat websites have threads in which they are trying to incite mass demonstrations of protesters with Guy Fawkes masks. Indeed, Fawkes masks are beginning to show up at srewball protests. The reason this movie has struck such a chord is frightening.This movie is a celebration of blind, mindless hatred for the purpose of inciting blind, mindless hatred and ensuing destruction. The movie makers would disagree with my analysis and would mostly likely says that the main theme of the movie is that a government that rules by manipulating terror must be destroyed by terror.Although set in the UK, the government is clearly modeled after the Chimpy W. McHitler administration. For example, the bad guy soldiers are wearing American helmets and uniforms. Be that as it may, unless you already believe that W either caused or knowingly allowed terror against American citizens for the purpose of achieving and retaining power, there is nothing in this movie to convince you. You are to take it as a matter of a faith that W was behind 9/11 and that such tactics are the essence of the vision of his administration. And thus terror is justified when used against the government.None of this, however, is explained or attempted to be explained in any intellectual way. Rather, your hatred is to be your guide. Just as you are to condemn the government without benefit of any evidence, you are to accept terror as a tactic without benefit of any plan. The plan is to blow up Parliament* which will automatically cause the government to fall for no apparent reason. The purposes are mindless hatred and destruction.The movie ends with Fawkes' dream enacted, Parliament destroyed, and the government leaders murdered. No thought is given as to what comes next. To do so would raise all sorts of difficult problems. If a new government were to be created, there would have to be some thought given to what form of government that would be. It couldn't be a democratic government because, after all, that is the form of government that brought Chimpy to power in the first place. But if not democratic, then what? Better you don't ask. Our hero and heroine achieve orgasmic joy in accomplishing Fawkes' dream of mindless hatred and destruction and that is all you need to know. One cannot help but be reminded of the Democrat Party's campaign once again in 2006 that is again, as in 2002 and 2004, that we-are-not-Bush and otherwise devoid of any idea or solution. Mere hatred is enough.The setting of this movie includes a deeply censored culture in which the slightest criticism of the government is cause for execution. (Indeed, possession of a Koran is grounds for execution, indicating that it is Christianity that uses terror on Islam rather than vice versa). Yet the mere fact that this movie was made and distributed disproves its very point, that we live in a fascist state. But here again, the idea is subjugate thought to hatred. Just kill and destroy and you will feel better.This is a dangerous movie. Although any mentally healthy adult can watch it without being led into a life (or death) of terrorism, the emotionally unstable may well be incited to violence by the paranoid vision of this movie. And as not only the plethora of suicide bombers in the Middle East but also a glance at Democratic Underground reveal, there is no shortage of the emotional unstable. And, indeed, this movie is intended to incite the excitable. But we do live a free country so view away. Just keep your eyes open about what this movie is preaching.One final irony is that this is a pretty good, exciting action picture. If it just didn't try so hard to convince you that this is contemporary or near future America, this would be a fun movie to watch.* One of the ironies of this deeply anti-religious movie is that it misconstrues or ignores the essence of the Gunpowder Plot that is used as a model. Fawkes was a deeply religious, one might say militant, Catholic whose was attempting to instill Catholicism over the objection (and bodies) of King James I and the members of Parliament. In the movie, the motive is to remove the influence (malevolent of course) of religion, not to instill it. But no never mind. Guy Fawkes is the inspiring secular saint because he wanted to kill and to destroy and that it what is important, to kill and to destroy."	3.0	Truth revealed through lies	2006-08-20	23	9	14

For those who value free speech, freedom, and independance, this movie is for you. For those of you who would rather ""watch"" a movie and not actually think through it, this is NOT the movie for you.V for Vendetta is a clear message. A message and a glimpse.A glimpse of the future. It is inevitably true that all empires corrupt and must be overthrown. This movie is a reminder, a warning, and a set of instructions. Set in totalitarian Britain, where the media, the music, the news, the reading material and even the art put on display is controlled by the government. Those who believe this is not how it should be mysteriously vanish along with their families. This is not a movie for those who look at their politicians and their government and say ""My oh my, those are the most un-selfish, moral people in the world."" This is a movie for those who actually see things as they are. Corruption will eventually eat away every government on this Earth. It just happens. All you can do is stand up for what you believe in. And V for Vendetta is a clear message to the people saying ""Don't let your fear of ""outside threats"" let your government take your freedom away. Be ever mindful of YOUR place in this government. And as always, don't believe everything you see on television.""This movie does what so many other movies wish they had done. It outlines exactly how far a government would be willing to go to control you, and to make you afraid. Because when you are afraid, you can be controlled. So please, watch this movie. It isn't ""Left wing conspiracy theorys"" or ""Left wing propoganda"". Its the truth. And the truth can either kill you, or set you free."	5.0	The only verdict....is Vengeance...	2006-05-08	19	10	9
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"First the plot--Imagine ""Batman Begins"" with the Liam Neeson character as the hero crossed with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with a twist of 1984 thrown in for good measure and you've got an idea of the film ""V for Vendetta"". V (Hugo Weaving)is bound and determined for justice and that includes taking down the government of a man (John Hurt)who has turned England into a God fearing police state. V is on a time table to undo this government as the government is looking for him. In a TV broadcast he tells England he will take out the House of Paraliment by November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day in England)and asks the population to show their support by being there when he does it. The film though turns on the relationship between V and Evey (Natalie Portman)the daughter of two revolutionaries put to death by the government when she was a child. She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness. When she is saved by V from rape by members of the government she is thrown into a world she can no longer make heads nor tails of. Clearly this film isn't going to be for everyone and fans of Alan Moore's graphic novel will probably be disappointed. No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release. This isn't ""The Matrix"" nor is it ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". It's better than the Matrix sequels but not quite as great as I'd hoped. It's still an entertaining film. It's clear by the vote count here that somehow I've been unhelpful. I'm not quite sure what folks were looking for here but this film did appeal to me even if it wasn't perfect.V may be a bit naive (when he takes out the government he believes that the people will take back power and the government will fear them instead of the people fearing the government)he's also a fascinating mixture of vigilante, hero and villan. Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of ""The Matrix"" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle (""The World is Not Enough"", ""Aliens"" and ""Thelma & Louise"")""V for Vendetta"" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it. Written as a protest against Thatcher and her government policies, ""V for Vendetta"" works amazingly well in this adaptation by ""The Matrix"" writers Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. Featuring stunning performances and great support work particularly by Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigoett-Smith and Rupert Graves ""V for Vendetta"" takes a lot of risks for a mainstream Hollywood movie in the post 9/11 world we live in but it's points are intelligent and well worth noting."	4.0	Thought provoking film of Alan Moore's graphic novel of a man with no fear	2006-03-17	22	17	5

If you love your country are you going to cross the line and fight for it when civil disobedience doesnt work? The only thing I have to say i disagreed with was the idea that the religious zealots were part of the problem - i think thats a little far fetched. True religions of the world have always made it a better place and these zealots that are portrayed dont look at all like those who feed the poor and care for the helpless.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1RIQUDE4B8NGX	Wildness	"I read the graphic novel of ""V for Vendetta"" when it was originally  released in the mid 1980s. Right from the beginning, I could see that this was Alan Moore's homage to Orwell and ""1984"" - he was most likely inspired by the book as the title's date approached and Moore observed Thatcher's England and Reagan's America unfold. What an amazing story ""V for Vendetta"" told. Alan Moore saw that Fascism was still alive and well in the world of 1984 as it was in Orwell's Post WWII 1940s.Jump forward 20 years, and we have a retelling of this amazing story, but this time on film instead of the comic panel. In this day and age of Terrorism, the fear of Terrorism, and the Fascist use of that fear, the story is more important than ever in Bush's America/World. Fear is the most powerful tool of the fascist as has been demonstrated in both the real world - Nazi Germany and Post 9/11 America - and in fiction - ""1984"" and ""V for Vendetta"".  ""V for Vendetta"" capture's this by potraying a not-to-distant future where plague and terrorism have crippled the world and are  cooped by the fearful conservative right (where all fascism is born as they are similar psychoses) to control the masses and ""protect"" the people.Though Moore set ""V"" in his native England, 20 years after its writing it could have been set in Post 9/11 America where even treehugging is consider terrorism by the ruling administration. Yes, this film portrays a terrorist as the ""good guy"", but it actually delves deeper into the heart of all of us; and it challenges every one of us to stand up for ourselves BEFORE we would need to resort to acts of violence to safeguard our freedoms - or worse have to reclaim them. Watch this film to be inspired for what we have to loose, before it becomes what we have lost.A final note on Alan Moore not endorsing the film...Moore doesn't endorse any of his works being made into film. But, I would like to think that he will see it and see his vision properly realized; this is what I saw in the film...his vision on screen (though I was disappointed that the musical numbers found in the graphic novel were missing!).

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A2G93ZQW963I5C	William	"Since the ascendancy of Obama, I have used the title above to describe the vision of Obama and the totalitarian wing of the Democratic Party.  The ultimate expression of this vision is their rhetoric of Republicans as enemies of society, and the transformation of individuals from people into wasteful consumers of social resources in the form of healthcare, when such resources can be used to ""better"" society, a waste that the government must control.  (Betterment of society is a truth only the state can know).  The Obama vision of healthcare is well expressed publicly in Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's graph of an individual's worth to society and corresponding worth for medical services.  Both babies and the elderly in Obama's vision will receive the least amount of healthcare due to their least value status to society.  To maintain infant mortality statistics, an infant will not be considered born for 24 hours and not contribute to mortality statistics unless dead after living into the second day.The movie V for Vendetta is an amazing replication of the Obama, Pelosi and Reid vision for America.  Unbridled power by the state and the party that controls the state (explaining Obama, Pelosi and Reid's most violent opposition to justices and judges who do not believe in the Democratic Party totalitarian vision). The movie describes the sycophantic support of Obama, Pelosi and Reid by the mainstream media.  The movie makers anticipated  the future turn in American politics in the election of Obama and the control of the American federal government by the totalitarian Democratic Party.Yet all is not lost, the movie also anticipated the Tea Party the grassroots up rising of ordinary people against the totalitarian vision of the Democratic Party.

Many scenes were engrossing in a video game / graphic novel kind of way, especially the whole back story on how the ""V"" avenger character came to be.  Also, I generally appreciated the treatment of the ""rebellion vs. totalitarian government"" theme, although it's often been done before, several times in better ways.  A major plot twist about 2/3 thru caught me totally unprepared (most unusual), and really made me think about V's motivations.  The acting by Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant, especially considering it was all done behind a mask.  A few minor parts of the plot were unconvincing, but overall I recommend it.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1K7X23UDT0R7V	Winston D. Jen	V for Vendetta remains true to its source material while avoiding the pitfalls of a slavishly faithful adaptation. I'll be honest -  the movie would be dull and plodding if it included everything in the second book of the graphic novel. Slow and dreary sideplots do little to add to a film's experience and invariably end up causing viewers to glance at their timepieces.Fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic. Hugo Weaving is exemplary as the psychotic yet compassionate terrorist V, and Stephen Fry adds black humour to a depressing film about power-hungry corporatists. The hypocrisy of fascist dictatorships is put on display in all its ugliness. High Chancellor Sutler is not content to refrain from enjoying music he does not approve of. He must also outlaw anything that has offended him or is used as a threat to his rule.The plot is very similar to the movie, with Evey staying at Deitrich's house instead of that of a generous stranger. V's Shadow Gallery is recreated in extreme detail and faithfulness. Delia's atrocities are reproduced to a starkly realistic effect, and are alone worth the price of admission.The tale behind the regime's rise to power (not detailed in the comics) is given the royal treatment, providing further enjoyment and deeper enjoyment for fans of the comic. The film's strongest point lies in Evey's incarceration, and although the ending doesn't quite follow the books, it is still powerful and inspiring.	5.0	The Gold Standard for Comic Adaptation	2013-06-04	2	2	0
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AUTBHG6070SL4	"wiredweird ""wiredweird"""	"-- in two ways. It's a great adaptation of a comic, and an adaptation of a great comic. The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more ""mainstream"" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow.First, the story: It's set in the visible future, in an England under some Orwellian regime with a crypto-christian edge. Agents of the regime are above the law, but not above using their power to abuse the rest of the citizenry. Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive - mostly. Now, he's here for revenge against the sadistic crew that ran the test facility, and against the totalitarian regime that supported it. It's hardly a spoiler to say that V gets his revenge.V's mask is about the only real comic-y image in the whole movie. That general sense of reality only strengthens the rest of the movie, including Natalie Portman's (Evie's) imprisonment and the final computer-generated fireworks. There are plenty of surreal elements, though. Except for V's mask and maybe Evie, almost all of the faces are disturbingly asymmetric, as if the twisted faces represented the twisted minds behind them.Maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin. DC has had the Vertigo line of comics for a long time, intended to hold on to readers who outgrew the super-hero-in-tights genre (that's S-H-I-... never mind). I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet. Based on what I saw in this movie, that's about to change.//wiredweird"	5.0	Best comic adaptation to date	2006-04-10	9	6	3
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AH55HMF0YDTYE	wlngtofight	Very, very well done. I just saw the movie and will watch it many more times, to be sure.I think the thing that struck me most was the incredible use of frames (as in the political sort, not the movie sort). There is so much powerful and eloquent symbiology in this movie that I'm sure I could watch it twenty more times and still not catch it all. That's especially true, I think, when it comes to V's character - whether the filmmakers are eliciting Batman or the Phantom, Voltaire or Timothy McVeigh, it's all done with remarkable skill, and creates a complex and rich picture. I find it especially compelling that the development of V and his ideas is done primarily through frames/symbols, while other characters are more linear; it is why V is able to embody an idea, while others in the movie are merely human.Many kudos to to the filmmakers for pulling this off. In the hands of less gifted storytellers, this movie and V's character particularly would have come across only as a series of cliches attached to loud bangs and shiny daggers. In their hands, it achieves what it sets out to do: create a movie/character universal enough that we can project a myriad of past, current, and future events/people onto it/him, while at the same time providing just enough specificity to make it/him intellectually and emotionally compelling.I went in expecting a superhero movie guilty pleasure, and left realizing that I had actually watched something a lot closer in depth and tenor to some of the indie flicks I also enjoy - but with all the added bonuses (effects, many superb a-list character actors, etc) that only a big-budget flick can provide.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A3OVGORKGD7BQ6	"WolfMama ""Liz"""	"I'm not going to compare this to other films. This one like every other movie, stands on its own. I can't stand the need of reviewers to compare films and make each new one an amalgamation of past films. They go on and on about how great they thought those were. I take each movie individually as it comes along. I don't care about who directed it, and what they directed in the past. I believe it does actors and directors an injustice to pull up roles that have nothing to do with the current piece under discussion.I am purely and simply looking for entertainment. Take me away from the worries of modern life and show me something else, escapist entertainment. I should think most people are. I want impossible feats of heroism. I don't care if they're believable or not. I want fantastic heroes that can do things that I can never hope to do. The strong men or women that can ride to the rescue and right the wrongs of modern day life, from the bullies on the playground to the corrupt politicians. I want to see people who fly, and fight, and great car chases, wonderful illogical romances, magic and ESP. That's what entertainment is. It's fiction. Every bit of it is made up in the mind of someone, whether it's a book, play, or movie. The interpretation of that idea is what we see as a final product. Good acting is a must. A good script and good direction are also a requirements.This movie succeeds briliantly in that aim. I was drawn into the story , it took my breath, and my attention until the end credits rolled. V is the mysterious vengeful antihero. I call him that because he's definitely not too sweet. I thought the girl's name Eve, to be telling. The acting was good without being over dramatic. The people that played the roles seemed to fit the roles well. No, I am not going to spoil the movie with a blow by blow account. I believe it's important to view a movie without any prior seeds planted by someone else who liked it or disliked it.If entertainment is your aim then this is a great film. I was absolutely amazed. This was great after all the other garbage that Hollywood has produced, tried to dress up as entertainment, and shove down our throats in the last five years or so. They keep slinging it out despite the steadily declining theater audiences.The plot is not too twisted to grasp easily, even though there are some surprises. There is plenty of action for the action buffs. There is a moral message for the conscientous. There is a very scary political message not even thinly disguised. ""The people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of the people."" There isn't any sex, this movie doesn't need it. There are however a lot of emotions.I cannot for the life of me get over all these arm chair critics. Even though for the most part they've been positive. I don't care what they have to say. I want to see it for myself. That is always my advice. Rent it. Watch it. Like it. Buy it. Don't take my word for it, or that of anyone else. Don't let someone's idea of what a great movie, of what great entertainment should be, make you miss something you might enjoy, or influence you to buy something you will hate. I learned that a long time ago, it remains my practice today. I've never regretted it. I have loved movies that others wouldn't give one star. I have hated with a passion movies that others gave five stars. So rent it and make up your own mind. I've bought my copy of "",V for Vendetta,"" and I've watched it several times already.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	Having been a fan of the graphic novel for many years I was interested to see how exactly the Wachowski's intended to translate Moore's early 90's view of the future into a believable concept for the twentieth century. Despite what most of the purists may say, Moores original view of totalitarian britain has aged somewhat, and an exacttranslation of the graphic novel onto the silver screen would have been far too esoteric and inaccessable for those who had not been previously introduced to the material. What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state. Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat. What we have now is a government that controls through deception and spin, by creating fear in the populace and presenting Anglo-christian based national socialism as the cure for all ills. This is in contrast to moores vision where the government rules by intimidation and violence, the citizens of britain are brow beaten dogs utterly submissive and incapable of thought, in this movie the populace have simply been kept in the dark and are awaiting someone to turn the light on. Enter V.What makes this film such a triumph is it's assertion that no matter how entrencehd a governments control becomes, there are always going to be people who question them always people who look at the world and sense something is wrong. People know when they're being lied to, know when spin becomes outright lies and are perfectly capable of standing for their own rights. Of course V's attacks act as the catalyst for this process ut the ultimate act of herosim is performed by the public.Yes there are better action films, yes there are better films that question the world we live in, but very few do both with such style and grace. This time the wachowski's managed to of their message without recourse to big black coats and rage against the machine music.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A21ZYADETVYYQ0	Xera	V For Vendetta is one of the best movies of our time. I'll admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but I don't think that should take away from this film. It's simply brilliant. The idea of a totalitarian government controlling every aspect of people's lives really makes one think of what it really means to be free. The acting is wonderful, with Hugo Weaving perfectly portraying the suave yet menacing character of V. His silky voice and charismatic words make one forget that he is, in fact, a terrorist with the intention of carrying out Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to destroy Parliament in the 1600's. Natalie Portman is great in her role of Evey Hammond, evolving from a cautious everyday woman trying to live her life in peace to a strong-willed woman who learns to overcome her fear. She isn't like most of the female leads in movies like this where she's only a victim caught in the middle of everything. And let's not forget Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, the skeptical yet determined officer trying to follow V before his threatened attack on Parliament on the 5th of November. The side stories are very interesting and piece the whole plot together in a web of illusioned coincidence. Never before has a movie given me chills the way V For Vendetta did at the very end, and I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it. Overall, it's perfect for those with an open mind who are looking for something very deep, thought-provoking, and moving.	5.0	A thought-provoking thriller	2006-08-06	4	2	2

Some awfully subtle jabs at the political right, reminiscent in style of the the far right's own hysterical fears.There is some unoriginal idea of rising up against an oppressor, which falls flat as it is of a type which has no connection with the experience most viewers.

Visually, it is flawless.  McTeigue certainly knows his craft and manages to use the camera in a manner that is perfectly befitting the content.  The production design is idiosyncratic but also accessible and believable, which further mesmerizes and intrigues.  The script by the Wachowskis further exemplifies their talent: they now how to use words, they know how to use ideas, they know how to build a story.And what a story it is.  I was uncertain how to feel the first time I viewed the film.  Certainly, the movie must breed controversy, and I didn't know which side of that I fell on.  I've come to endorse the film but only after careful reflection.  The issues are contemporary and touchy, but the movie offers enough ambiguity to permit the viewer his own interpretation.  Certainly, one cannot mindlessly interact with this film; only catastrophe could ensue as a result.  Patience and contemplation are required here, and I fear that in the wrong hands, this form of content could be inflammatory.  But then all good art is.There's nothing to complain about with Natalie Portman, but it's a sheer miracle that Hugo Weaving can continuously steel the show from behind a mask--what a voice!  Another component on which I must comment is the use of editing and music.  Dario Marianelli's score is superb, and listen to the way he subtly incorporates Tchaikovsky into the quieter moments!  Scattered throughout the film are several intriguing and wonderful montage sequences that create a marvelous flow to the narrative and are wonderfully accented by the pulse of Marianelli's music.  At times the film makes awkward pauses, the dialogue waxes melodramatic, and the pacing seems forced, but these faults are inconsequential to an overall brilliant film.	5.0	Everything You've Ever Wanted!	2006-08-15	8	4	4

The story line is full of holes and where it is not full of holes it tries way too hard to make connections between the present and the events of the past, and the connections which all of our characters seem to have falls into that forced category.The dialogue is drawn out and tries to come across as artistic, many times I found myself zoning out long after the point was made in these pretentious conversations.The fight scenes are nothing revolutionary or exciting, its the same familiar fight scene you see in all ""over-hollywooded"" movies.This film also perpetuates the growing anti-Christian movement by using a red, modified cross as the Evil State's symbol.  On the surface this film tries to preach against hate with the over-played anti-gay thing, in reality it promotes more hatred, bigotry and fascism than Mien Kompf.

At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable.  This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the ""Matrix"" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality.  If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations.  While both ""Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" presented the theme of control, ""V for Vendetta"" is the best presented as a government's control of the people.  This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings.

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A1G2XXOPOL9MHP	Zeus Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D.	V for Vendetta is a futuristic tale that unveils the social rot beneath the increasing concentration of wealth and power of that society.  It is a thinly veiled critique of our present society, and it largely pulls off the feat, thanks to a good story and a a kind of hero-antihero theme that instructs us how to watch out for false gods.  Thought provoking and intriguing.	4.0	Prescient, compelling glimpse into social issues	2014-05-13	1	0	1
1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	A13SGYYVKBLHYT	"Zippo ""Zippo"""	I didn't expect this comic book-to-movie adaptation to be perfect. They never are. But this is so beyond my worst fears. A great frightening, satirical, political, and also fun and emotional adventure story has been completely ruined. Every single scene that is from the original story has been diluted in some way, not just in the sense of softening the political edge, but just plain making them less emotional, interesting, tense and original. And the new poison storyline makes no sense; it's boring, and poorly executed. And usually good actors like Natalie Portmans (accent is awful), and John Hurt (a clown, instead of the deranged but still dangerous leader of the comic) do worse than ever. This movie might impress someone who never read the original, but only because usually Hollywood action movies are even worse. Let's hope the director never gets another job ever again.	1.0	Terrible, just terrible...	2006-04-07	52	15	37

1419838830	V for Vendetta Special Edition	AE9GUE3HHOX3U	zooni	This movie bored the socks off me, I was watching it in the background as I was talking on the phone and noticed how over the top it was. All the theatrics, the masks, oy vey!  I could care less about the story and natalie Portman looked like Britney Spears when she shaved her head.  Not a good visual! This film was trying to be important and relevent but it came across as eurotrash.	1.0	The Mask	2011-07-16	25	2	23
