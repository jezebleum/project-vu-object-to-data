0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	APZAJ6LGXH02F	Ace Reader	"""Jurassic Park"" is in theaters NOW! Go see this thrilling dinosaur film now before it's too late. You won't be sorry! Seeing the 20th Anniversary version of 1993's ""Jurassic Park"" in IMAX 3D format is a grand, entertaining and emotional experience. I think it's totally worth the steep admission price ($17.00 per person), to see it. I'm a happy customer and you can be too!I love this film and always will. This film is a joy to watch and is magnificent entertainment value. It's just as spectacular now as when first released twenty years ago to it's stunned and thrilled audiences. This new copy of ""Jurassic Park"" is clean looking, crisp and sparkling. It's ground breaking special effects look really good now on the big IMAX screen with special 3D effects that rival many of today's new films in this category. The new 3D depth of field is really good and works well with this thrilling story.""Jurassic Park"" is so much better than most of today's new releases in theaters right now. It really has no competition because of it's overall entertainment quality. That being it's intriguing well written story line and it's always witty dialog, plus it's excellent performances from all members of it's well known and beloved cast. Everything about this film speaks of the love director Steven Spielberg has for (Dinosaurs), film making and his ability to make and tell a well told adventure tale. Suspense, thrills, humor and terror run rampant throughout this enjoyable film causing today's new fans to laugh and scream in the autotoriums again. Many young people are watching this film for the first time on the big screen because they weren't born yet or were not old enough to watch it during it's first release. All the actors (Laura Dern, Sam Neill, and Jeff Goldblum), are all so young and fresh faced in this film. It's kind of time warp feeling to see them back in the theater again after all these years looking so young. Time flies when you're having fun! Musical maestro John Williams soaring beautiful iconic soundtrack touched me the same way it always does when I hear this rousing soundtrack. As usual it brought tears to my eyes during the first glimpses of this films magnificent Dinosaur's.Go see (today!), director Steven Spielberg's ""Masterpiece"" now in IMAX 3D format or you will be cheating yourself out of a rare treat for your senses. A good movie! I highly, highly recommended this film to everyone except little children. They will have to wait for it to be re-released again in another 20 years for it's 40th Anniversary, and they (and hopefully us) will get to see whatever new and improved special effects Hollywood will have dreamed up in our future. I can't wait!

I really cannot watch this film ever again, it looks so cheap and silly now, Steven Spielberg's directing is overrated even to this day. The only character that is still funny to me is Jeff Goldblum.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1B6MUCEFIR76M	"AJ ""AJ"""	Strictly talking about 3D.I'm going to be honest here. The 3D I'm expecting from all these supposedly 3D HD movies is off screen action, scare me off my seat type like I recall back in the 80's. My SONY 3D T.V has sample 3D videos which are mind blowing. It supports 3D active shutter glasses and it looks amazing. The depths of perception is incredible.I've purchased 11 3D movies including Jurassic Park and it's been disappointment after disappointment when it comes to 3D movies.  My problem is not with the movie itself but rather the poor utilization of 3D technology. Personally, I don't want to watch a children's pop up book via my active shutter glasses. I want a Dino jumping at my face making me feel unsafe and ready to be eaten.This will be the last time I spend a dime on 3D movie until something incredible comes along. Usually, I don't get upset very easily but I feel ripped off. Kept telling myself one of these movies is going to be great in 3D but all of them fall short of my expectations. Jurassic Park is just one more on that list.If you just care for HD blueray great but I wouldn't splurge $30+ for 3D that doesn't have a truly powerful wow factor.	2.0	Ok movie, disappointing 3D!	2013-07-14	2	1	1

Sure, it isn't bad, Neill, Goldblum and Attenburough are quite believable in their respective roles and the supprting cast works  hard to back them up, but why did Spielberg have to sentimentalize about  the children? I know it is a hobby of his, but here it is really out of  place. Excellent work of Sam Neill here, who manages to keep the story from  becoming a tearjerker, but it shouldn't have been necessary.

"Here's a great movie directed by the fabulous Steven Spielberg.I remember very well the first time i saw this film, at a local cinema in 1993. It was a chilling experience. The very first time CGI-real-looking-characters (the dinosaurs) were used on screen. How exciting! As a kid, i was truly thrilled.Today, i still enjoy the movie very much and consider it to be the best of the franchise (the second film being too dark and the third too light).The present DVD is actually quite good, though the extras are a bit disappointing. But the adventures of Doctor Grant (Sam Neill is very good), Doctor Sattler and the kids are worth bying this.Besides, who can resist Richard Attenborough saying : ""Doctor Grant, my dear doctor Sattler, Welcome to Jurassic Park!"" ?"	4.0	Jurassic Parkillicious	2005-10-07	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster based on Michael Crichton's technothriler about cloned dinosaurs running amok on a Costa Rican island, is still an exciting journey of the imagination, even though it's been 10 years since its theatrical release. Although its computer-generated effects have been surpassed over the past decade, Jurassic Park's tale of a misguided science experiment fueled by one man's ambition to create the ultimate theme park still packs a Jaws-like mixture of chills and thrills.As in Crichton's novel, the story revolves around eccentric billionaire John Hammond's (Sir Richard Attenborough) plan to convert Isla Nublar into a tourist attraction that would put all the Disney theme parks to shame. With all the resources of his InGen Corporation, a major genetics research company, Hammond has built a huge entertainment complex/luxury resort/wildlife preserve. But unlike similar resorts in Africa where tourists go on ecologically-friendly safaris to see lions and elephants, Hammond's scientific team has done the seemingly impossible...and cloned dinosaurs.After an incident in which a worker falls prey to a velociraptor (in a sequence that pays homage to Jaws, Spielberg's first megahit), InGen's board of directors gets antsy and demands that the Isla Nublar complex, Jurassic Park, be inspected by a team of experts to ensure the park's viability and safety. Otherwise, says InGen attorney Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) ""if I'm not convinced, they're not convinced,"" and Jurassic Park will be shut down.Hammond, determined to open his ambitious dream park, recruits paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to assess Jurassic Park's safety and viability. Grant and Sattler are swayed to go by Hammond's offer to fund their Montana dig for another year, but Malcolm is openly skeptical. Hammond's dream, he thinks, is a natural time bomb ticking inexorably away, waiting to explode.Worse yet, Hammond has invited his grandchildren Tim and Lex (Joseph Mazziello and Ariana Richards) to visit, ostensibly to help them cope with their parents' divorce, but mainly to prove  his confidence in the park's security features.Little does Hammond know, however, that his dream park is doomed from various threats. Out to sea, a hurricane approaches Isla Nublar from the east. Inside the park itself, greedy computer technician Dennis Nedry (Seinfeld's Wayne ""Newman"" Knight) plans to shut down the security systems to be able to steal dinosaur embryos at the behest of a rival genetics company. Worse, one of the techniques to enable the cloning of the dinosaurs -- a scientific short cut -- is backfiring badly, even though InGen's top geneticist Dr. Wu (B.D. Wong) is unaware of it.When all these elements converge, things go dreadfully wrong on Isla Nublar, and when humans and dinosaurs interact, disaster follows, ending Hammond's ambitious and arrogant science experiment to the sounds of roaring T-rexes and hissing velociraptors.While not Spielberg's finest achievement ever (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and the Indiana Jones movies are better), this is still a fun movie to watch, especially on a lazy, hot summer evening. It is exciting and suspenseful, and like its close cousin Jaws, is better than the novel that inspired it, thanks to a crisp screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. Adding to the magic are, as expected, composer John Williams and the techno-wizards at Industrial Light and Magic, Stan Winston's live action dinosaur crew, and all the rest who labored on this film. Even more amazing, Spielberg also gave us Schindler's List later that same year, proving his talents in organization and creativity...and diversity as a director.The Universal DVD Collector's Edition includes the 1993 blockbuster which was the biggest box office hit until Titanic was released in 1997, various making-of featurettes, exclusive DVD-ROM features, and the usual extra features (theatrical trailers, cast and crew credits, and production notes)."	4.0	"Things that go ""roar"" in the dark...."	2003-08-04	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1ZBASWCOPAAC2	Almostunbiased	When I was driving home from the theater after this movie, I did look at birds differently.  I swore any minute a dinosaur could run out from behind a building.  This is and was the best dinosaur movie I've ever seen.  Who doesn't like a good dino movie?  And how old is it now and it still holds up well against other movies' special effects today.As for the story, some will say it's slow, but I think the pacing is perfect and although kids now a days might think there isn't enough action, I think the build up to the first time you see the Tyrannosaurus Rex attack is one of the greatest moments in movie cinema.  It's intense, scary, even funny, and best of all you don't think about the special effects because you're watching a real 8 ton monster wreak havoc.  The movie is worth this scene alone and then when the raptors come you'll be jumping and at the edge of your seat.Love this movie.	5.0	You'll believe dinosaurs walked the Earth.	2007-05-14	1	1	0

John Hammond, the owner of Jurassic Park, gets a group of scientific experts, including Dr. Alan Grant, a professional expert on dinosaurs, particularly deadly T-Rexes and cunning Velociraptors to explore and approve the island. A greedy businessman shuts down the park's security leading to attacks by meat eating dinosaurs. It's up to Alan Grant and his companions to try to survive in a world filled with dangerous beasts that were extinct for 65 million years.Jurassic Park is a pretty good movie. The visual effects such as the giant Brachiosaurus encounter to the Galliminus chase scene are spectacular. The attack scenes such as the breakout of the T-Rex and the Raptor attack in the visitor's center will keep your mind in suspense and maybe even fear. Jurassic Park is one of the best movies of the 1990s. Don't miss the opportunity to have the experience of the dinosaur encounter.	4.0	The Experience of the Jurassic	2001-06-19	0	0	0

The 3D effect, in my opinion, was worth the few extra dollars.  It can be a little jarring sometimes, especially during brighter outdoors scenes, but the dinosaurs are really the only thing I cared about, and it worked.  The first time you see the full view of the T-Rex and he roars, that was good times.  Would like to see the other two movies come out in 3D.	5.0	Awesome Movie!	2013-04-24	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3TNM3C9ENUCFW	"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster"""	"Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances. Richard Attenborough plays the stoic billionaire who has discovered how to extract dinosaur DNA from a mosquito fossilised in tree amber, and decides to bankroll a genetics created theme park to wow the World. As always, with these schemes, you should listen to the age old maxim ""Don't mess with Mother Nature"" and despite the remote Island Location, the huge Reptiles get loose, and go on the rampage. This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked. Wonderfully realistic CGI blends seamlessly with superb acting performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (to name but a few). The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however. Like ""Jaws"" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children). It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers. Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3CZNYEZSUJCQT	Andre (Belmont, MA)	This movie lacked the oomph that the book had but it was still great.  The action scenes are particularly terrifying; particularly when the T-Rex breaks through the fence; also, when the raptors hunt for the two obnoxious kids in the kitchen -- too bad I was rooting for the raptors.  But still, these scenes in particular were very, very real, very scary and pulse-pounding!It's equally interesting to judge what didn't work in this movie: the characters, not quite as weak as those in the book but close; many of the computer generated shots looked surprisingly fake; and of course the bulk of the book's great science got lost.But still, none of this really matters that much.  The scary scenes were awfully scary!  Those dinosaurs looked REAL!  I can watch those scenes over and over and over again; so owning a quality DVD like this makes it easy!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"My wife and I just recently sat down to a `Jurassic Park' marathon and watched all three films in succession (it was a rainy and day and we were board as all get out) so I felt compelled to write my feelings on the films.I was reading a blog the other day that asked the question, ""How can you not like this movie?"", and to me that is a very good question.  Sure the film isn't perfect, the dialog is cheesy at times, the plot is silly in moments and the acting in areas is less than desirable but overall this is one of those iconic pieces of filmmaking.  Coming out the same year as Spielberg's masterpiece `Schindler's List' it was set as Spielberg's Blockbuster of the year.  He tends to do that, do one film for himself and one film for the public (ala War of the Worlds & Munich ext.) but little did he know that his Blockbuster would end up being just as brilliant as his personal film.  In fact I'm tempted to say that `Jurassic Park' tops my list of films that should have been nominated for Best Picture that never really had the chance.  It breaks my top five for the year, that's for sure.If you've read the novel you'll understand that there was so much more that could have been included in this film, but then again the film would have been a few days long and no one has that much time.  In fact, I'm a firm believer in the fact that they should have split up the orgasmic novel and come out more like `Star Wars' giving us a more detailed and expansive version of this first installment instead of proceeding with the much less impressive `Lost World' and the abomination known as `Jurassic Park III'.  Regardless, this is still a landmark film to say the least.  The computer animation was mind blowing at the time of its release, and even though the effects have `supposedly' gotten better, are they really.  Nowadays everything looks like a video game.  Here everything looked real, or pretty close.  I'm not saying today's graphics aren't in some ways superior, but I not saying they would have enhanced this film either.The plot centers around a multimillionaire who has done the impossible.  Of the coast of Costa Rica lies an Island inhabited by dinosaurs, dinosaurs cloned from the DNA found in mosquitoes fossilized in tree sap.  These dinosaurs are of course behind steel bars and are the main attraction for a new theme park.  Before this park is opened to the public the founder John Hammond decides to fly out some specialists to take a gander, make sure that things are safe enough for the rest of the world.  These specialists include paleontologist's Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler and Mathematician (or Chaos Theorist) Ian Malcolm.  With a product this amazing there is sure to be plenty of opposition that such opposition causes a greedy computer expert Dennis Nedry to do something thoughtless that causes some major problems for everyone on the island.`Jurassic Park' is directed brilliantly by Steven Spielberg, so much so that not a frame goes by we don't remember.  The scenes of violence, while never graphic (this is PG-13) are always filled to the brim with tension and suspension.  The kitchen scene alone with Hammonds two grandchildren is one iconic scene of modern (or not so modern) cinema.  The acting is decent among all here with Sam Neil and Laura Dern as standouts.  Wayne Knight is effectively disgusting as Nedry and Richard Attenborough makes a fine Hammond (although if you've read the book you'll know that his character is changed DRASTICALLY for the film).  Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello are effective as the grandchildren, Lex and Tim.  They play children and I like that, they don't mature up the part at all.  They play normal everyday children who obsess and bicker and swoon and panic like all normal children do.  Samuel L. Jackson continues with his long line of thankless roles in any and everything he can get his hands on.  It's funny, he's such a cocky man yet he really has little to back up his swagger.  Tell me, aside from his `Pulp Fiction' and `A Time to Kill' stints (both brilliant I will admit) what has he given us but filler performances.  Okay, I'll deviate from that to gripe about another actor I don't quite get...Jeff Goldblum.  He's not terrible, but he's not that great either, kind of annoying.  In fact he's much better in the sequel despite this film itself being much better than `The Lost World'.Those two very MINOR faults (it's not that Jackson is BAD, it's just not a performance to be cocky about) still can etch a single star off my review.  I mean come on, this film is iconic, legendary...filmmaking at it's very finest.  Sure the times have changed but `Jurassic Park' will live on in infamy forever, or at least until the world ends and all is lost and or forgotten.  Ha, well, over-dramatized but you get my drift."	5.0	An iconic piece of filmmaking if I ever saw one...	2007-10-03	2	2	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	"Last night I rewatched Jurassic Park for the first time since the '90s.  I still am amazed by the dinosaurs and how real they still look and am charmed by Richard Attenborough's performance as John Hammond.  But I don't like this movie as much as I once did.  So, lest I get some hateful comments, before I list the problems with this movie let me say that I still feel this is a good movie (good, meaning that it's certainly worth a rent and possibly even buying it).  The intent of this review is not to bash this film so much as to challenge the claim that it is a masterpiece.  Here is a list of some of those reasons:1. Trying to hard to make people laugh (The zingy one-liners):""What do they got in there? King Kong?"", ""Dinosaurs eat men, woman inherits the earth."", ""We're back in the car again"", ""God bless you"".  These are examples of some of the many one-liners from the movie, obviously designed to generate a laugh in the audience.  Some of them work well.  Others not so well.I don't think that caustic remarks, in moderation, is a bad thing.  But the movie has so many of these lines that it makes me wonder if the characters are in some sort of unconcious competition with each other to see who can come up with the most biting comment.  The overall effect is that this doesn't feel like how people, who are seeing dinosaurs for the first time in real life, would actually talk.2. The pompous moral rectitude (manipulating the story to fit the ethics):""We shouldn't tamper with nature because we have no idea what we are getting into because life will find the way.""  That's, more or less, a paraphrase by some of the dinosaur experts right before a sequence of events would prove them right, as if they had psychic vision of what was to come.  I must say that, for people who spend their lives studying these fossils, they had a very lukewarm response to what I would expect to be their childhood dreams coming true.  I, as a viewer of the movie, seemed to be more excited to see these CGI images than the characters who were, in the movie, seeing actual dinosaurs.  In Spielberg's earlier work (E.T., Close Encounters, Jaws) there wasn't some underlying moral message and it got on just fine.3. The two kids (especially the girl):Come on, admit it.  These kids were annoying and were obviously included in the story just to please kids their age and get their parents to bring them to the theater.The girl is the worst of the two.  She is supposed to be smarter than her brother but while they were in a car she decides to shine a flashlight at the T-Rex which causes it to move towards them.  INCREDIBLY, the girl continues to shine the flashlight at the T-Rex.  Through Herculian efforts, I managed not to shout ""turn the f***ing light off"" at the TV.  The kids are just a burden to everything and everyone.Alright, I hope that wasn't too brutal.  Besides those small things, I liked the movie and don't regret buying it.  It's just not a masterpiece like many people claim."	4.0	Somewhere in this movie there is the potential for a masterpiece that never quite materializes	2007-05-28	2	1	1

However before it can open it's doors to the world it is to be inspected and approved by at least 3 specialists. After recruiting 2 archeologists and 1 chaos specialist, the overly confident owner and developer of the park gives the trio a grand tour in order to publicize his main attraction....live dinosaurs! However, awe turns to terror when a power shortage decapitates the central security system and allows the creatures to break free of their cages and threaten the lives of everyone in the park! Now the race is on to survive the outbreak and call for help before its too late!With amazing special effects and edge of your seat excitement, Jurassic Park is bound to amaze viewers for generations to come!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AK6UVFSU07NXH	Anthony Hinde	Written by Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park is one of the big budget special effect jobs that the critics love to bag. So what! It's awe inspiring. The cinematography is nothing short of perfect.  The effects are  seamless and the action is heart stopping. On the less than brilliant side,  the characters were mainly two dimensional. Specifically, the lawyer was a  joke, (intentional but unnecessary). I just wish that the game warden's  character had been explored a little more.The plot is  straightforward. We have a scientific breakthrough that brings the  dinosaurs back to life after a much touted 65 million year absence.  Strangely, instead of scientific motivation, it has been created for  financial reasons. (-: A game park to be precise. But before it opens, the  backers want a run through with some experts, (and a couple of cute kids),  in order to check for safety.  It may well have been safe, except that the  one man programming company that set up the systems, (who by the way should  get the programming god of the century award), is selling out to the  baddies who want some dino-embryos.The next thing you know, T-rex  has escaped and is snacking on lawyers and the rest of the good guys are  battling it out against a pack of vicious Velociraptors. Lots of tension  and suspense here. But don't worry it is a Hollywood movie and therefore  gets a happy ending. Look out for the sequel, which if Crichton's novel is  any guide, will be a &quot;me too&quot; version of the first movie. Never  mind, the first one was good enough for two.	5.0	A movie with bite.	2000-05-10	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	"Anyone who has seen JURASSIC PARK can tell you of the thundering AWE they felt the first time they saw it. There are few cinematic experiences that can rival the spectacle of a herd of Gallimimus stampeding on an open plain, or a giant Tyrannosaur roaring in the rain. Jurassic Park, is quite simply, one of the greatest blockbusters ever made. The plot looks simple: a group of experts and friends are invited to explore a theme park that has yet to open - but the premise is high-concept in that way only Michael Crichton is high-concept: the park is filled with living dinosaurs cloned from ancient DNA. And quickly, the ordinary tour becomes a terrifying thrill-ride for survival, complete with claws, teeth, fangs, venom, and more.In the human corner, we haveSam Neillas Dr. Alan Grant, a crusty but passionate paleontologist, and his partner Dr. Ellie Sattler, played with childlike wonder byLaura Dern. Richard Attenborough's excellently optimistic performance as the park's creator John Hammond is a highlight of the film, as of course is Jeff Goldblum in full Goldblumish glory as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm. The supporting cast, including Wayne Knight, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson give tremendous performances, and the immortal lines ""Clever girl"", and ""Hang on to your butts!""But of course, all of our humans are overshadowed by the real stars of the film: the dinosaurs. In the dino corner, we have the T-Rex, a tremendous achievement in special effects, and one of the most awe-inspiring, earth-shattering characters in film. With the roar of a baby elephant, tiger, and alligator in one, the T-Rex has been shaking cups and terrifying moviegoers for 20 years. When you add to that several devious velociraptors, brachiosaurs, and gallimimus (sorry, I'm a total dinosaur nerd - I can't help it)... you have both an incredible achievement in digital and practical effects, and the groundwork for the most awe-inspiring, gut-clenching set-pieces this side of anywhere.If you haven't seen the film a) what's wrong with you? b) I can't stress enough how powerful that first viewing is. Ask anyone about the first time they saw Jurassic Park, and they will be able to tell you where, and who with, and of course, about that feeling of sheer awe in the face of Spielberg's spectacle. And that's the greatest thing about Jurassic Park: Yes, the special effects might be a little dated, and maybe those kids are annoying. But no matter how long it ages, Jurassic Park still affects and terrifies, even 20 years on. And THAT, my friends, is why I give the film 5 stars. Jurassic Park is an unforgettable cinematic experience that has no equal anywhere. Step back into an age where dinosaurs walked the earth!P.S. If this review was helpful to you, please give it a like. Cheers!"	5.0	"""Welcome to Jurassic Park!"""	2014-02-27	20	18	2
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1534MBU6VJXYN	"Anthony Nasti ""Tony"""	"I've always pitied myself for never seeing ""Jurassic Park"", a film that many deem a must see. I've seen bits and pieces of the film but I'd never seen it in its entirety. Yesterday, my mom got me it (along with its two so called inferior sequels, which I've also never seen). Today, I watched it for the first time, and I loved it.The plot is simple enough. Paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Statler (Laura Dern) have devoted to their lives to their career...and each other. Both have proved to be successful, and their research attracts the attention of Doctor John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who offers them a trip to his dinosaur theme park, Jurassic Park. When they get there, they learn that Hammond has revived dinosaurs through DNA samples and is keeping on display for tourists. This does not sit well with obnoxious cohort Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum, who really steals the show), who questions the experiment. It soon turns out that Dr. Malcolm is right, as the dinosaurs wreak havoc on the park and turn the employees and other visitors (including Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson) into walking Happy Meals.Steven Spielberg really outdid himself with this film. The special effects are amazing, and the dinosaurs are amazingly realistic. The performances are great (though Goldblum is the only one that is really of note). The special features are a bit lacking, but you cna overlook that since this film is truly a masterpiece."	5.0	Breathtaking	2005-12-27	1	1	0

I might add I did not get scared in either. I've  seen the movie about 32 times (mostly in 2nd and 3rd grade when I was a  fanatic) and I learn something new every time. I believe they had the  perfect amount of good acting, emotion, characters, science, thought, and  action, not too much or too little (I think It would be interesting to read  the book if it was by Arthur C. Clarke). I agree with Ian Malcolm 100%,  he's my favorite character, although having dinosaurs in a park would be  nice (The Lost World ruined his character it's like he were 2 different  people.

I ordered a copy for my adult son's birthday. My son is an avid surround sound user, and noticed immediately he had one of the defective pressings (and fyi,you can't tell until you open the package and read the numbers pressed on the disc whether you have a good one or not).  So we returned it to Amazon, and they sent us another defective one.  Since this trading game could have gone on forever, I wrote an email to Universal Studios customer service who very quickly traded the defective copy for a good one.  Beware of Amazon's inventory.  Unless they have returned all the old ones to Universal to get good ones, you still might be at risk of an old pressing that will not give good surround sound.  This problem is the only reason I gave 1 star.  I would like to have rated it N/A or blank, but the website software wouldn't allow it.	1.0	DTS Pressings Defective	2003-10-23	18	9	9

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A4ANCEUA6PFCD	Arsenic	Throughout the decades there have been classic movies of its time.  70's: One Flew Over the Cukcoo's Nest, Dog Day Afternoon, The Exorcist.  80's: Ghandi, Amadeus, Platoon. 90's: Silence Of The Lambs, Forrest Gump, JURASSIC PARK.  It was a break through in computer graphics making this movie and when Steven Speilberg got the actors he got some very down-to-earth people who can act very well and are very believable.  This was based on Micheal Chrictons novel (an excellent book) and they are somewhat similar a few changes from book to movie but they were good and they worked.  The script was very good and the direction was great.  You just know it came from the mind of Steven Speilberg.	5.0	One of the 90's Classic movies	2001-01-27	0	0	0

I was a measley 11 years old when this box-office smash hit.  &quot;Congo&quot; was... trash- sawry, Steven S &amp; you die-hard &quot;Mighty Joe  Young&quot; fans.  The '93 &quot;Park&quot; (the prequel) is about a DNA  experiment-gone-awry. Personally, the trivial filler (where no action  occured) is tedious, but when it comes down to the wire and a T-Rex is  bending over you like you're a pathetic ant... that's where it's at.  It's  a little grim for the kiddies, I must admit (when a Seinfeld character gets  the ol' spitz in the eyes and bumrushed in his car, yeah... he died, heh  heh).  But I don't think they'll wake up in a cold sweat- &quot;Mommy, I  dreamt that I watched &quot;Barney&quot; and... he-he spit in Michael's  eyes cuz he screwed up a line of &quot;This Ol' Man&quot;!&quot;  Oh, no-  they'll just eat this up.  The icebreaker is when the cast members are  standing around while CG dinos are running amock like they're about to eat  their last meal.  The highlight, everyone will agree, is when it's  &quot;Tim &amp; Lex vs. The Relentless Raptors,&quot; which takes place in  a friggin' kitchen (scary, I know... but the idea wasn't too far-fetched  for me to engage in).  It's also funny when Lex has this stupid look on her  face while her fork reverberates from the thumping baby Raptor  Untouchables.  Did I mention a dramatic &quot;Tim about to plunge to his  death in the J.P.mobile&quot; scene&quot;?  Heh, heh, that was... kewl!  (Not how he escaped death, but the anticipation that he would fall, yes!)  Towards the end, it progresses into predictability and cheesiness, but  nonetheless, worthwhile (despite a jaded attempt at a decent storyline).  Rent/buy it for the momentary thrill.  All 'n all, Spielberg's got himself  a humourous/thrilling, yet very timeless classic amongst the &quot;King  Kongs/Godzillas&quot; of the film industry.  Heh, heh, kewl.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1DQEYIQ9FK3JL	"Asa Bunnett ""Verboseman"""	"It's more than a little uncommon for a film to visually impress two times in a row.  What made for spectacular viewing the first time becomes old news by the second.  And with the rate at which the technologies used at the movies advances, these former special-effects heavyweights begin to look dated very quickly.That makes it all the more impressive that Jurassic Park 3D - a classic celebrating its 20th birthday this year - is still eye-poppingly amazing to look at.  The special effects alone have aged like a fine wine, due in no small part to the film's reliance on animatronics over computer animation.  Whereas CGI tends to leave everything looking just slightly ""off"", the dinosaurs of this park feel as real as they come.  There's none of that oddly shiny, too-perfect look of modern movies.Someone at Universal deserves a pat on the back for the job of converting this movie to 3D.  The original was obviously never filmed with 3D in mind, but the new sense of depth is completely convincing.  It is, in a word, awesome.  And in a movie that has the awesomeness of the natural world as a major theme, that really helps to sell it to you.Behind Jurassic Park's new bells and whistles is the same excellent Spielburgian film it has always been.  John Hammond, a visionary scientist, has had a jolly old time playing around with genetics.  The fruit of his labor is a private island filled with creatures long since extinct, which he wants to make into an amusement park.  He invites three scientists - the couple Alan and Ellie, and the eccentric ladies' man Ian Malcolm - for some academic cred, as his investors are having some trouble believing that resurrecting long-extinct T. Rex's is actually safe.  The opening act allows us time to soak in just how incredible this prehistoric wonderland really is.  From the huge beasts, to the hatching of a tiny infant raptor, the world of Jurassic Park is wild, but seemingly controlled.Controlled that is, except for the park's malicious computer programmer, Newman - err, Dennis Nedry.  In an attempt to steal dinosaur embryos for a rival genetics company, Nedry inadvertently shuts down the park's security, releasing the hordes, including one hungry T. Rex.  The delightfully carefree and safe dino zoo quickly turns into a prehistoric nightmare, with the scientists, Hammond, and his grandchildren all fighting to survive.Jurassic Park knows what it wants to be - it's a science-fiction thriller, and it does that well.  There are more iconic scenes here than a raptor has teeth.  Beyond that, though, it's effective as something of a pseudo-nature documentary.  When they aren't trying to gobble up the heroes, the dinosaurs simply go about their business - running with their herds, finding a meal, and nesting for the night.  It's a grim reminder of humanity's dualistic relationship with nature.  Sometimes we live in harmony and mutual wonder.  Sometimes  they eat us instead.The acting is mostly excellent, particularly with Jeff Goldblum as Ian.  His sarcastic skepticism plays off of the other scientists' straight-man performances hilariously well.  Richard Attenborough also does a wonderful job as Hammond and his rapidly-decaying ego.  Despite the fact that the entire park was his idea, you do feel sorry for the man as his dream crumbles to pieces around him.  While the characters are not the centerpieces (Jurassic Park is much more War of the Worlds than ET), it helps the film immensely to have such engaging performances.Jurassic Park is definitely worth a second viewing, especially in 3D.  The added dimension fits the film perfectly, as if it were shot that way all the way back in 1993.  And if you're somehow lucky enough for this to be your first viewing, than enjoy.  You're in for a wild ride."	5.0	One of the best 3D conversions ever made.	2013-04-22	39	34	5

It was hailed as a turning point in the CGI Revolution, showing what was possible by making the dinosaurs alive. At the same time, the dismal story undid the wondrous spectacle and rendered the film as a joke. To this day, I still can't get over the multitude of awful acting, dumb moments, and retarded physics in Jurassic Park. As soon as the two kids appear, there goes Jurassic Park. I knew that they were going to survive no matter what the odds were. A series of impossible moments that resulted in the survival of the main characters killed off any good memories from the first half hour which contained intelligent discussions, magical moments in the bridge between man and dinosaur, and significant, thoughtful conflicts. The constant question that kept popping up in my mind throughout Jurassic Park was: ""Why in the hell did they breed carnivores?"" I mean, this is arguably the most illogical aspect of the film and goes so far to serve the ulterior point of making Jurassic Park, just to give the audience a motive to see the sanguinary scenes. Of course, a smaller point in logic fail is that in order to clone an organism, a living egg of that specie must also exist. Obviously, there is no such thing as a living dinosaur egg. That itself would be a shock. Finally, almost none of the dinosaurs depicted in the film actually lived in the Jurassic but the Cretaceous period. So, that leads to another question: why not just label the film as Cretaceous Park? Meanwhile, the pro-children support is too much for me and detracts from the point of the film. All in all, Jurassic Park could have turned out better if Steven Spielberg would stick with the flow of the first thirty minutes."	2.0	How Disappointing That the Dinosaurs Never Ate the Child Stars.	2013-12-31	0	0	0

The 3D effects on my 60 inch Samsung SmarTV were quite impressive. Then I popped in the Blu-ray disc and began to notice a good deal of grainy artifacts in the beginning of the film. I thought once the setting changed from the desert excavation of the velociraptor to the location footage in Kaua'i that the grain would be gone...uh no. Some of the interior shots in the Jurassic Park computer center, especially at the edges of the frame were filled with a great deal of dancing grain. These aren't the artifacts noticeable during motion shots that some LCD sets have trouble with, this was obviously just a very bad transfer to Blu-ray. And since I have an extensive collection of Blu-ray DVDs that don't have this issue, I think it's reasonable to assume that the issue isn't with my Samsung.

Though they could've added more features to this DVD (there are way more features to the 'Jurassic Park III' DVD), just for the movie is well-worth the price! This movie is about two scientists who specialize in peleontology, are taken to this island amusement park designed by a wealthy business man to test it and see if it will work out for the public. This amusement park is unlike any other, for it is an amusement park of real-life dinosaurs which were re-created by top scientists who discovered a way to bring dinosaurs back to life. The theme park is called Jurassic Park, and once on the island, they meet a top mathemetician and the wealthy business man's two young grandchildren who come along for the trip, too. When someone suddenly shuts down the security on the island, things start heating up and the T-Rex gets loose! Now the humans are on a wild chase to get off the island alive before they are all eaten by the dinosaurs. This movie rocks and the special effects are just stunning and simply spectacular. The plot is really good and there's even some humor. The whole cast from Sam Neill to Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely superb. This is one of my favorite Speilberg films ever. The directing and filmmaking are top-notch. Some of the best special effects of the early '90s are featured in this movie. If you have not yet seen 'Jurassic Park', then I strongly recommend it - the movie never loses your interest! And if you liked 'Jurassic Park', then I also strongly recommend 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', which are just as amazing and awesome as the first!	5.0	A true action/adventure classic.	2001-10-12	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2883XE05ZV5A3	Bill Finnell	To finally own the DVD version of this wondrous movie is cinema nirvana. As might be expected, the DVD format has added something the VHS version could never match, the wonderful DVD picture resolution, and the digital soundtrack.Attempting to add just another movie review would be facetious. What does stand out, other than the fact that the movie is even greater in the DVD format, is the wonderful bonus material that comes on the disk, especially the featurette on how it was made.When I first saw this movie I didn't have to suspend belief to watch it. It seemed like real life. That's what Spielberg wanted and that is what I gave him. Little did I know how it was accomplished, and until I watched &quot;The Making Of Jurassic Park&quot; on this disk, I didn't fully appreciate just how much of a breathrough this movie was. It just literally boggles the mind how much had to be done, much of it new and totally untried, to finally get this movie &quot;in the can&quot;.I sat through &quot;The Making...&quot; for over an hour, totally engrossed in the logistics involved. To see the blending of stop action and computer generated images, and how it was done so seamlessly was a real mind-blower. To realize just how many people it took to put all this together, and how easy it all looked, almost upstaged the movie itself.If you are new to the DVD version of this movie, I would strongly urge you to watch &quot;The Making Of Jurassic Park&quot; first. Now that I have seen both it and the actual movie, I wish I had done it that way. Now I have to go back and watch the movie again, which I had (of course) planned to do many times anyway.Finally the DVD! It is very well worth the wait!	5.0	Finally!	2000-11-04	2	1	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AIMR915K4YCN	"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby"""	Jurassic Park was more than just a movie. More than an event. It was a full blown phenomenon! Steven Spielberg is the unrivalled king of such films. Every few years he puts out another spectacular that sweeps the world and sets a new standard (like Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, E.T., Raiders Of The Lost Ark, etc.). This time out, we've got resurrected dinosaurs running amok! The basic plot has stranded people on dino-island trying to keep from becoming dino-chow. You've got your scientists (Sam Neil, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum), your crazy zillionaire (Richard Attenborough), a greedy, lecherous computer geek (Wayne Knight), a sleazy lawyer, and two cute kids to round out the cast. You even get Samuel L. Jackson as a chain-smoking computer tech guy! Throw in an approaching hurricane, and you've got the perfect monster movie! It's usually not the &quot;deep&quot; storyline (except in the cases of Spielberg epics like Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, etc.) that causes the phenomenon. It's his way of thrilling us and breaking new cinematic ground that we love. I knew when I first saw JP that I was in for a blast. At the same time, I also knew that I wasn't going to see Hamlet or Macbeth! Jurassic Park blew my mind with it's realistic T-rex, Raptors, Triceratops, and the rest. We saw dinosaurs that were not rubber, clay, or robots (well, at least not robots that looked like robots)! We got CGI that put flesh on 65 million year old bones! The team that made this movie are legendary, and have pushed special effects to stratospheric heights. JP is a true milestone that stands the test of time.

Get this movie on VHS or DVD and experience the original motion picture that started it all, and set the standard for all dinosaur animation to follow it. There are so many good scenes that will capture your imagination through action, suspense and awe.The film is based on the book by Michael Crichton and it follows his story-line pretty well. Using of course much less technical detail, but enough to give the viewer a bit of an understanding. Illustrating the same idea of how dangerous and drastic biotechnology can be when developed with a greedy motivation. Okay, okay I know. What happens in Jurassic Park is taking it to the extreme, but it still makes an exciting movie, nothing else is like it.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A6WZVL0SRQAPY	Brian Driver	"I am writing this review after having seen the 3D-IMAX version of this movie yesterday at the theater.  I can only hope this is the version being released later this month (April 2013).All I can say is WOW! I and my family were immensely pleased. This is every bit as amazing as I remembered it, and then some.The 3D was definitely a benefit here, and it heightened my appreciation of the movie. While of course Spielberg had no inclination that this would eventually go 3D, the movie has several sequences that really seem to have been made specifically for it.  As anyone who has seen the movie can guess, there are all sorts of scenes that almost literally jumped out at the audience in the original, and they're even more super-charged here.While this has to be one of the most-watched movies ever, I'm sure there are many who have never seen it -- in fact, I could tell there were a few in the audience nearby me, as they jumped more than a few times at key moments.What's really terrific is that the 3D was never obtrusive, but only improved the movie and made it more intimate.  It is as if we gained a new sense of experiencing a film beyond regular sight and sound.  And yes: the sound was even more improved as well.  Believe me, it kicked butt.See it if you can at the theater: on the big screen this is mind-boggling. I will bet those with a big 3D screen in their house (and a suitable sound system) will be totally impressed as well, but this was amazing to see on the big screen.It was stunnning: ""Jurassic Park"" HAS NOT AGED ONE DAY since it was released 20 years ago. Spielberg's movie is that good. Credit is due his special effects team (Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri), who received Oscars for their work (the movie won two Oscars for sound editing and mixing) and they deserved every penny they earned for their work.  Even on the big screen there was not the slightest hitch with their work.See it at the theater if you can, but I am sure you will love it at home, too. It is an exhilarating movie that hasn't lost a step in 20 years: truly AMAZING!NOTE: It makes you wonder if we'll ever seeJawsre-released this way, orClose Encounters of the Third Kind (30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition)...can you imagine them as 3D?

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A25UCFDN5BTM4R	Brian P. Kelley	I have been a fan of this film since it was first released in theaters as a teenager.Setting aside the 3D for a moment, the blu-ray is crystal clear, with no visible film degradation at all. The special effects are still stunning to this day. The mix of CGI and animatronics creates a balance of reality few films manage to find. The 3D conversion is quite good. In the scene where the group is watching Hammond on the screen with MR. DNA I was annoyed for a split second by the fact that there were people blocking my view of the screen, only to have reality remind me the characters on the screen are the ones blocking the picture. Obviously the 3D is not absolutely necessary for enjoyment, but it does add another level to watching the film.For those with good sound systems the 7.1 DTS master track is as amazing as I recall from the theaters. It is incredibly satisfying to hear the soft rustling of leaves from the left rear speaker, followed by a chirp from the front right. The visuals may draw you in, but the sound is what brings alive the immersion.Anyone who is a fan of the film should have this on Blu-Ray for the visuals. If you have a strong sound system, the film has never sounded better unless you heard the original DTS track from its theatrical release in 1993. If you also happen to have a 3D setup, this movie belongs in your collection.	5.0	Excellent transition to 3D	2013-04-23	2	2	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"An adventure 65 million years in the making... such is the tagline for Jurassic Park, the onscreen adaptation of Michael Crichton's wildly successful novel about the human-aided return of dinosaurs to planet Earth. One of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, Jurassic Park was, and remains, a special effects masterpiece unrivaled by its peers. Dinosaurs roam the plains and scour the forests against the backdrop of conductor John Williams's original score (some of the best music of his career, which is saying a lot). Unlike the Godzilla movies of years past, you can't see human hands or construction paper props in the background of this movie. The computer generated creatures are so amazingly animated, that you'll finish the film believing that Jurassic Park is a real life destination...Dr. Alan Grant's (Sam Neill) life is dinosaur bones and the study of the various ancient reptiles that once dominated the Earth. He and his colleague Dr. Elli Sattler (Laura Dern) spend their days excavating the barren hills of South Dakota and loving every minute of it. But when Dr. Grant is approached by the eccentric multimillionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) in regard to touring ""something of great interest,"" the man's world of dinosaurs becomes more realistic than he ever thought possible.Hammond's creation is an isolated island called ""Jurassic Park"" where his company uses dinosaur DNA extracted from mosquitoes encased in amber during the Jurassic period many millennia before to clone dinosaurs. Prior to opening his park to the public, Hammond wants to take a number of experts on a tour of the facilities, among them are Grant and Sattler, a lawyer named Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), and a mathametican/philosopher - Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When everyone but the lawyer expresses great reservations about the very idea of cloning dinosaurs (especially the carnivores), not to mention the safety concerns for an aspiring theme park, Hammond insists on putting their fears to rest personally.But John Hammond's dream goes terribly awry when a disgruntled computer programmer, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight of Seinfeld fame), compromises the island's security systems in order to smuggle some dinosaur embryos off the island, where a competing corporation has offered him a handsome monetary reward. Nedry's death, and the inadequate security systems of Jurassic Park, put the dangerous T-Rex and the lightning fast raptors on level ground with the island's human inhabitants. Now, Hammond and his guests no longer spend their idle time assessing the merits of Jurassic Park, but instead spend every waking minute fighting for their survival...You'll be hard pressed to find a film which rivals the brilliant special effects of Jurassic Park. The Star Wars films are the only movies even in the same league. But Jurassic Park also offers an interesting and compelling story, lots of action, and reams of suspense. Even an occasional lawyer joke helps to break up the intensity... Jurassic Park has it all. A summer blockbuster by a director who almost single-handedly invented summer blockbusters, Jurassic Park is a definite must-see movie. If you shy away from excessively commercial films, then make an exception for this one. I promise, you won't be disappointed...The DVD Report"	4.0	The special effects make this a must-see...	2005-04-20	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2E3F04ZK7FG66	calvinnme	"The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both. After I first saw this movie in the theatre 14 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when the Discovery Channel now has the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation. Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family, and the 50-minute documentary ""The Making of Jurassic Park"" was very interesting too. James Earl Jones narrates this extra feature in which the special effects are given particular attention and examination. The documentary also includes interviews with Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton. There is also a ""Dinosaur Encyclopedia"" with several pages of information on every dinosaur that appeared in the film. Besides that, there are two or three other very short features on how particular scenes in the film were done. The best of these short features is ""Raptors in the Kitchen"", which, of course, talks about how the scene with the raptors stalking the children in the kitchen was done. Highly recommended."	5.0	Good action movie with excellent effects	2007-02-15	2	2	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3AY3EV2MFRFGG	"Chadwick H. Saxelid ""Bookworm"""	Jurassic Park, while exciting and awesome in parts, is no Jaws.  The movie is really an excuse for Spielberg to mount the greatest Ray Harryhausen movie never made, and he succeeds far too brilliantly.  The commentary and conscious of Crichton's terrifying novel is disposed of in favor of easy thumbnail sketch characters and simplistic narrative tools to make the monster movie machine hum right along.  Once the dinosaurs do get loose the movie drops any pretense of developing or even caring about the 'characters' and invites the audience to simply enjoy the spectacle of the attacks.  The pioneering effects may make this an essential in some collections, but the lack of dramatic weight makes it no more effective that its 1950s drive-in cinema cousins The Black Scorpion or The Deadly Mantis.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AH43A9XCZ4YU5	Charles Foster Kane	As a college student now, I was 9 years old when Jurassic Park hit theaters and it couldn't have come at a better time. Watching it again, Jurassic Park holds up as great entertainment, even if the characters and storylines seem a bit flimsy at times. It's probably more worthy of 4 stars than 5, but hey, this is the movie of MY generation and I'm not going to apologize for its rating. Jurassic Park continually reminds its viewers that Steven Spielberg is the greatest entertainer since Walt Disney. Constantly filling the screen with visual treats, keeping the plot moving at a brisk pace (once the obligatory exposition is filled in), and allowing us to enjoy ourselves without stooping too low, nobody does blockbusters like this man. Since he was to direct Schindler's List that same year, this was more or less his kiss-off to the popcorn genre he helped invent (consisting of classics like Jaws, Raiders, and E.T.--some with more dramatic substance than others, but all damn entertaining). Like I said, I was nine when this movie premiered and I still remember watching in the dark theater as the whole show unfolded--perhaps taking it for granted that movies should be so thrilling and fun, and that every filmmaker was capable of such wonders. Wrong on both accounts, but it did spur me on to shoot my first movie on video camera that summer (admittedly, it was highly derivative). Now I'm a film student...thanks Steve5/6	5.0	This was THE movie of my generation	2004-07-11	5	3	2
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1SDHFGT5J7SYV	Charles J. Dickens	Jurassic Park is, on paper, a cheap B-movie. Not really any big name actors (at the time), and the story revolving around dinosaurs. Of course, it wasn't a cheap movie with all the special effects and marketing that surrounded it. And it wasn't a B-movie just because Speilberg made it. He had introduced the world to the blockbuster (Jaws) and had made audiences for the past 15 years laugh (the Indiana Jones movies have terrific comedic bits to them), cry (ET), and cringe (Hook). But Jurassic Park would change the ways movies are made forever. No longer did props, locations and, nowadays, actors have to be readily avaliable - put them in later with a computer. Name one movie today that doesn't have some CGI in it and I can name you 10 that do. 1993 was a turning point Hollywood will, at least for now, not stray from.But as far the movie itself - it is terrific entertainment. From beginning to end, the pictures on screen capture what the camera should be used for. And the CGI never gets in the way of the story, as it does in countless movies today. There isn't an explosion just to have an explosion - it is added seamlessly with great believablity. Of course, the story is simple...scientists go onto a billionare's island where he has been able to re-create dinosaurs. Everything goes pretty flawlessly until a staff worker shuts down the park to try to earn a quick buck - and in turn gets eaten by his own decision - and that in turn strands everyone there with the dinos. The now famous sequence with the T-Rex attacking the tour cars is some of the best suspense since the days of Hitchcock, and although Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Wayne Knight may just be those guys you've seen in that other movie, the acting is good too. It isn't great, but it doesn't have to be since the stars are the dinosaurs (like the shark was in Jaws, the movie that invented the summer blockbuster).One of my only complaints is the ending - it really wasn't very well thought out, although there is a great visual in it (for the three or four of you haven't seen it, I won't give it away, it just involves the T-Rex and a banner). So sit back and enjoy the movie that started the computer revolution that you now see in today's theaters. In fact, you could pop this in and enjoy it more than what's out today. FYI: Look for a pre-Pulp Fiction Samuel L. Jackson as a computer engineer.	5.0	The film that changed cinema history	2003-08-23	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3OXHLG6DIBRW8	"C. Hill ""CFH"""	"The original Jurassic Park movie remains my favorite of the three in the series. Released in 1993, this was one of the first movies to heavily use CGI effects seamlessly in conjunction with live action. The overall effect is nothing short of unbelievable or, more to the point, totally believable dinosaurs interacting with humans.The movie's plot centers on a Paleontologist (well played by Sam Neill) who is hired to give his stamp of approval on a new ""Theme"" park ahead of its grand opening. There is also good casting and acting from Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (a good fit as a ""Chaos-tician""), Samuel L. Jackson (way underutilized), and Richard Attenborough (very likeable as the entrepreneur, John Hammond). Rounding out the main cast are two kids (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Hammond's grandchildren) and an annoying programmer (Wayne Knight, ""Newman"" from Seinfeld).The movie does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pseudoscience but overall the plot is strong and the effects are believable.Once the action starts in this movie it really doesn't let up until the very end. This is one of the few movies that has the ability to keep you literally on the edge of your seat. I have ""nervous"" people in my family who can't watch the movie all of the way through because the tempo of the action is so intense.

His scientists managed to raise dinosaurs back from the dead, and he has a park full of them when a nervous lawyer (Martin Ferrero) and two archeologists (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) come to check the place out, courtesy of Mr. Hammond, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Timmy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazello), and a wierd (but wonderful) mathematician (Jeff Goldblum). However, when a weak link in Hammonds work chain, represented by Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), schemes just a little too far, all hell breaks loose.A suspense filled, action packed and charged atmosphere throughout, which continues to impress. Near perfect casting and screenplay make sure the action has a meaning, and, in this film, the division between reality and fiction becomes almost as thin as in the novel. Oustanding. The dinosaurs aren't half bad, either, with effects wizard Denis Muren A.S.C (of Star Wars fame) among others on the team.A marvel of cinema and a key part of flick history.	5.0	&quot;No expense spared...&quot;	2000-12-05	4	2	2
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AAOMG1YP0VNP9	Chris 'raging bill' Burton	If I had to say one good thing about this film its that the effects on the dinosaurs are very good and the overall feel (including the soundtrack) is very professional. But that's where it ends. Because Dinosaurs capture the hearts of many children Speilberg probably thought that his remade models of these creatures would carry the film by themselves. WRONG.This isn't even worth the comparison with the book. The first 120 odd pages are left out, not to mention about 80 pages taken from other places in the book. That's HALF THE BOOK. Really cool parts are just left out. And what's worse is that CHARACTERS are left out. Leaving out the technical stuff is all fair and good (it's great in a book but would be out of place in a film), but surely characters and whole scenes should stay in the film? There were relatively important characters in the book that appeared once or twice (if at all) in the film. Perhaps they were too adult to put in a film designed for the family, but its not a childrens story! If he wanted to do a spiritual sequal to ET then he shouldn't have chosen this film to do it!Many other things are wrong as well - in the film Alan Grant hates kids, in the book he loves them. In the film, Grant and Sattler are implied to be some sort of item - in the book there's a 20 year age difference and she's his student. People die who survive in the book and vice versa. (...) The overall feel of the film, whilst being professional like I said earlier, is just too much like Hollywood.There's too much effort to make it a simple plot (there are other themes that run through in the book) and the overall intention is to make this seem like a money-making blockbuster. It also misses out the important social commentry concerning science that the book makes (I'll leave that for you to find out). The book makes you believe that one day, maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to create dinosaurs. Of course you know it's not gonna happen, but for a short time, you feel like it just might be able to happen. The film on the other hand just seems like the fantasy that it is.Speilberg was great with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, and he proved that he could make gritty, powerful and realistic films.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1CYOHNGQ1WED1	Christopher Hivner	This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think it helps if you were enthralled with dinosaurs when you were a kid like I was, but I don't think it's an absolute to enjoy the movie. A rich Scotsman has hired a staff of scientists who have discovered how to clone dinosaurs from DNA found in ancient mosquitoes trapped in amber. He decides to build a theme park on an island, so the whole world can come see real live dinosaurs. The park needs to be peer reviewed by skilled paleontologists before the insurance companies will back the park. While the scientists are there, the man hired to tie all the computers together to run the park, shuts much of the security off while he steals embryos to sell to a rival genetics company. This sets the scene for dinosaurs such as the T-rex and velociraptors to escape their enclosures and roam the park freely. Since the paleontologists and the owner's grandchildren were on the tour at the time, they now have to fight for their life with huge meat-eating animals.This is a good, exciting idea and it's well written and well acted. The dinosaurs are so well done you can't believe they are special effects and this was over a decade ago when effects such as these were in there infancy. This is a high quality film in every aspect and I still find it exhilarating no matter how many times I watch it.	5.0	One of the best movies I've ever seen	2005-07-10	1	0	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"There's basically 2 kind of summer blockbusters: the big visually impressive film, and thrill rides that gets adrenaline pumping. The first one is kind of hollow; it's not as emotional or gripping but it looks spectacular. Examples are the recent Star Wars films and Independence Day. The latter half are the edge-of-your-seat types and Spielberg is best when he does these kind. Yeah Private Ryan and Schindler's List are great films but they're more ""arty"" than entertaining. And so we have Jurassic Park, which has oddly bad pacing but still great suspense. Phew.John Hammond is part of a genetic breakthrough: he's successfully brought back dinosaurs to life using a technique which integrates their DNA with that of frogs to fill in sequence gaps. He's on the verge of completing a theme park which has the dinosaurs has a zoo-like environment but an accident forces him to get experts to visit the island and say everything's fine. So he sends Ellie a paleobotanist(plant life), Grant(dinosaur bones/anatomy) Malcolm(chaotician, think Butterfly Effect) and 2 of Hammond's kids.Everything runs smoothly until a money-hungry computer programmer named Nedry decides to steal the valuable dino embryos and smuggle them to another company, plus a hurricane that's heading right for them. Nedry disabled the electronic systems so the dinosaurs can roam wherever they want; not good for our human heroes. So it's a race to get back to the mainland without being eaten.The film like I said has bad pacing, it takes awhile to set up the story/events than whoosh, 3 major sequences than pretty much nothing with little specks here and there until the end. Where the film succeeds is the effects and the suspense. These dinosaurs really look great and it's hard to find any scenes with bad CG/puppet work.As for the big scenes, they're quite thrilling. The first major one is when the cars stop(rather conveniently) right smack in the middle of the T-Rex pen which he escapes from. Played without music(unlike the trailer scene in the sequel), it has that feeling of not wanting to do anything but watch the scene. And the raptors are just as freaky as ever with fast running and big jumping, which they don't show off fully till the sequel.Spielberg in some ways has a knack for directing kids. Drew Barrymore in ET, Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds and Haley Joel Osment in A.I. but unfortunately the kids are quite annoying, but that's their job in the film but still. The other performances are great as well. And if the Star Wars and Jaws theme are his most popular, then Jurassic Park is probably 3rd(unless you count those 5 notes from Close Encounters).Yeah it's bad pacing, there's a ton of goofs and you gotta turn your brain off slightly but what better way to be thrilled than with this. Even if it is 12 years old."	5.0	Somehow, this is one of Spielberg's best	2005-07-13	1	0	1
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A203YJ9QKU84UX	"C. M ZIEBARTH ""Christian"""	A lot of the reviewers of this movie seem to be missing the mark and comparing the movie to the book too much. Obviously when a movie maker adapts from a book he knows full well that it is going to end up somewhat  different. That's no surprise. The movie does have great action and CGI and  all that but I liked some of the quiet moments in it, like the brontosaurus  eating leaves off the eucalyptus. I also liked the part when they went on  the tour and didn't see anything. It actually built up the tension. But the  movie still gets passed off as a mindless monster movie. That's what I was  afraid it would be before I saw it. I was pleasantly surprised when I found  out it wasn't. And a little let down when The Lost World was. Everybody  also seems to be completely missing the point that Jurassic Park is  basically a retelling of Frankenstein (another book not faithfully adapted  into movie form): presumptuous man brings back dead life, thinks there  won't be any problem even though others can see there will be,  monster/dinosaurs go on rampage, presumptuous man becomes sorrowful man.  Frankenstein, which can be seen by the shallow-minded as a mere mindless  horror story of a monster killing people, actually has some interesting,  contemplative moments that show the beauty of life while simultaneously  showing the ugly things that happen when mortal man presumes to take God's  place. And these are scenes that build tension. What could be more tense  than the Frankenstein monster looking at the little girl throwing flower  petals into the pond? On the surface it is a touching scene, but we all  know what happens. Frankenstein has stood the test of time and so will  Jurassic Park.	4.0	Jurassic Park = Good Updating of Frankenstein	2000-03-30	1	0	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3DTUMLBZCG47D	Connor J. Hamilton	"Jurassic Park is a landmark film, in that nobody had ever seen special effects like the seemingly living, breathing dinosaurs it assaulted the world with. Steven Spielberg does well on this film, with several classic scenes of killer dinosaurs dismantling vehicles and slowly pacing kitchens.To leave the best for last, I will discuss what I dislike with this film first.Jurassic Park's story line is not very believable--mosquitos that had fed on the blood of dinosaurs being found embedded in tree sap later, and the DNA in the blood being used to create infant dinosaurs.I strongly dislike and disagree with the evolutionary views in this movie. The old term '65 million years' is bandied about quite a lot, when in fact the world has been around for perhaps ten thousand years, and dinosaurs and people had lived together for a time after creation.There is too much swearing in this film--so what if a woman would belt out four swear words in a row when chased by a T. Rex? We don't need to hear it on screen. Spielberg should have removed all objectionable words from this movie.Another thing would be the musical score. It seems as though John Williams recycles his old scores in each and every film, and he does not improve much on his former work in Jurassic Park.There are, however, many fine points to this film. Spielberg's directing is good, with foreshadowing of Velociraptor attacks and great action scenes.The acting is fair, and none of the actors or actresses stand out as bad. Jeff Goldblum especially does a good characterization as the chaotician Ian Malcom.The special effects are super, especially when the time at which Jurassic Park was made comes into consideration. The dinosaurs are very believable and alive seeming.This brings us to the dinosaurs themselves.The gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex ensures that all eyes are riveted on her, with eerie roars and ground-shaking footsteps. The SUV attack in front of the T. Rex paddock is very well done (and fortunately sans any accompanying music from John Williams.)The Velociraptors are more low-profile killers, but their capacity for striking fear is probably more than that of the Rex--their intelligence is a step away from human rationality. They open doors, invade kitchens, jump on countertops, stage clever ambushes, and run at ""Cheetah speed, sixty or seventy miles per hour,"" as one of the movie characters puts it.This film is definitely good for what is usually a cheezy genre, and makes for a good screen spectacle."	4.0	Groundbreaking special effects and good directing	2003-07-06	6	2	4

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	"Steven Spielberg's filmmaking career could almost be divided into two categories: adventure and drama. In 1993 he managed to release films in both genres. First came Jurassic Park, a science fiction adventure based onMichael Crichton's brilliant noveland then cameSchindler's List, a Holocaust drama based on the haunting book by Thomas Keneally. Spielberg's filmed versions of these two stories were groundbreaking. Jurassic Park set a new standard for special effects in moviemaking, while Schindler's List proved that Spielberg could tell a serious, emotional story.With Jurassic Park Spielberg had to overcome the gargantuan challenge of creating realistic, believable, lifelike dinosaurs that would share the screen with actors. There were a number of approaches that he considered for bringing the prehistoric titans to life. His first idea was to use full-size animatronic robots for all of the dinosaurs, but this was too costly and too dangerous to do (not to mention highly unrealistic as it would have required years of technicians developing new mechanical elements). His second idea was to use ""go-motion"" animation (a variation of stop-motion animation, in which a model is photographed one frame at a time in order to create the illusion of movement) to create the dinosaurs, but this proved to be too time consuming and lacked the photo-realism that he was striving for. Spielberg then gathered together some of the greatest minds in the special effects field. He and Dennis Muren, Phil Tippett, Stan Winston, and Michael Lantieri discussed the possibilities. Dennis Muren, who had just worked on the revolutionary computer-generated T-1000 character inTerminator 2, suggested that CG (Computer-Generated) dinosaurs might be their best bet. Spielberg was desperate for a quick solution so he told Muren to show him what could be done with CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and Muren shocked Spielberg with a film clip showing skeletal dinosaurs running through a field. A later test, which was even more impressive, showed a tyrannosaurus rex stalking for its prey in the harsh sunlight (one of the most difficult illusions to create because of  the precision needed for believable lighting, reflectivity and shadows). Spielberg gave Muren the go-ahead and film history was made. Utilizing Dennis Muren's computer effects, Stan Winston's animatronics, and Phil Tippett's understanding of realistic movement they set out to create naturalistic dinosaurs. They even consulted Jack Horner, an esteemed paleontologist, to assist them in their efforts.In June of 1993 the highly anticipated film was released to eager audiences. Both audiences and critics were blown away by the most realistic depictions of dinosaurs ever caught on film, but not everyone was wowed by the film itself. Some critics felt that the story was oversimplified, that the philosophical subtext of the novel was lost, and that the characters were shallow and uninteresting. Even so, the film was a worldwide success and spawned two sequels (The Lost World: Jurassic ParkandJurassic Park III) and a boom in movie merchandising.The story focuses on an eccentric capitalist, John Hammond, who uses modern science to genetically engineer living dinosaurs from cloned DNA. He plans to open an amusement park on a remote island near Costa Rica, where people can observe and study these ancient leviathans for a price. However, Hammond is suffering from legal setbacks. His investors have doubts about the park's safety, so Hammond invites Alan Grant, a paleontologist and Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist to visit and endorse the park. Also along for the ride are Ian Malcolm, a charismatic mathematician and an expert on Chaos Theory and Donald Gennaro, an irritatingly skeptical and greedy lawyer. Hammond even invites his two young grandchildren, Lex and Tim, saying that they are the target audience and therefore perfect to prove the potential allure of the park. But it's not long before Malcolm is proven right and chaos engulfs that island. One of Hammond's employees, Dennis Nedry, betrays him and steals dinosaur embryos, which he plans to sell to a rival research company. In order to obtain the embryos, Nedry turns off the park's automated security system. Naturally the dinosaurs escape and Jurassic Park ceases to be wonder to its visitors and begins to terrify them. During a tropical storm Alan and the two children are separated from the rest of the tour group and their weekend excursion becomes a frightening struggle for survival. Can they survive monstrous predators from the prehistoric past?Though the film doesn't match Spielberg'sJawsin its portrayal of complex characters facing a primal force, it does succeed as an intense sci-fi thriller that will stun its viewers. The talented cast includes Sam Neill as Alan Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, Ariana Richards as Lex, and Joseph Mazzello as Tim. Other cast members include Samuel L. Jackson, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, B.D. Wong, and Wayne Knight.The DVD includes the following bonus materials: The making of Jurassic Park documentary, early pre-production meetings, animatics sequence, storyboards, dinosaur encyclopedia, production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and theatrical trailers for all three Jurassic Park films.I also recommend the beautifully evocativesoundtrack by John Williams."	4.0	The Prehistoric Past Has Just Caught Up	2008-09-16	6	5	1

He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks; he made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time.I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.The only thing left is to see this in high-definition Blu=Ray, which should bring another generation of fans to this innovative film.	5.0	He Does Get Our Attention!	2009-03-03	3	3	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3TYC8T6W81DDB	C. Sawin	"Surely you're familiar with Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" by now. It pretty much brought dinosaurs to life for the current 21-30 year old demographic all across the globe. A man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park full of cloned dinosaurs called Jurassic Park on an island near Costa Rica. Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island in hopes of getting their endorsement for the park to be safe for the public to keep lawyers like Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) off his back. Naturally, a park full of freaking dinosaurs wasn't the best idea and things don't go according to plan. ""Jurassic Park"" is being released in theaters in 3D to commemorate the film's 20th anniversary.Maybe it's because there's memories bouncing around in the back of this old brain of seeing this film originally in theaters at the ripe young age of nine or that revisiting the film on Blu-ray last year was just as spectacular as seeing it all those years ago, but personally speaking ""Jurassic Park"" never gets old. Seeing the film on a gigantic IMAX screen, with a modern movie theater quality surround sound system, and in 3D is almost like seeing the film again for the first time.John Williams score is as epic as ever. It seems to gleefully boom out of the movie theater speakers. All of the emotional, breathtaking, and memorable sequences still have the same impact after 20 years; Dr. Grant's scene where he confronts the kid who called a raptor a ""six foot turkey"" with a retractable talon is still fantastic, Dr. Grant's awesome view of children, the way the film made Barbasol cans seem cool, Samuel L. Jackson having most of his hair, mountains of dinosaur droppings, ""You didn't say the magic word,"" Robert Muldoon being a complete bad ass in short shorts, adding a new meaning to a ""Danger 10,000 Volts"" sign, and still getting choked up on their initial arrival to the park (""They're moving in herds!"").Hearing the raptors screech in an IMAX theater is one thing, but the T-Rex scenes are just incredible. That immense roar and its massive footsteps are even more amazing in this atmosphere. It is worth the price of admission for the T-Rex scenes alone. Even though the film has been around for 20 years, it's amazing that the special effects are still quite good even by today's standards.""Jurassic Park 3D"" is like being reunited with an old friend; an old friend that wants to eat you and maul you to death, but still. A classic is reborn in glorious IMAX with a vibrantly stunning use of 3D. ""Jurassic Park"" is one of those special films that can stand the test of time."	5.0	Hold onto your butts 'Jurassic Park 3D' spares no expense	2013-04-05	5	4	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	This film was a runaway hit back in 1993, and still carries quite a punch today. If a really deep story and plot are what you are looking for, go elsewhere. If you want jaw-dropping effects, sheer amazement, and spine-tingling chills, look no further.The point of this film is that dinosaurs can now be produced by cloning. That said, many different species have been created and put into a park setting for tourists to ride through and spend money in. Naturally, the parks developer doesn't see the danger involved, only the happy faces of children the world over as they hear that dinosaurs once more walk the earth.Of course, things go wrong. A disgruntled employee shuts the park systems down in order to steal and sell dino-embryos to an outside competitor. Of course, a tropical storm hits at just that time, disrupting his and everyone else's plans. In the chaos that ensues, several big dinos escape their pens, notably the T-Rex, who then proceed to have a buffet meal of the visitors.The main principles among the humans escpae at the end, leaving the dinos free to do what they will. Being a dinosaur fan since early childhhod, I was thrilled this movie came out. When the first sauropod walked majesticaly across the screen, I was in awe. It all seemed so real! That feeling of awe was keenly built by Spielberg in this film, which then was turned into a feeling of danger, then to doom.The real stars of this movie are, of course, the dinosaurs, both CG and robotic and puppet. They intermove with the real people so seamlessly you believe they are real as well. This was one I very quickly added to my DVD collection, where it has provived many hours of enjoyment. The picture transfer is perfect, and the sound is incredible.Despite some flaws, like one-dimensional charactors, amd weak plot, the breathtaking special effects more than make up for it, and make this one worth owning.	5.0	thunderous hit!	2002-03-24	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3I7CRNHGZVWXP	Daisy Ghostly	In a fair world, this film would've been the biggest flop of Spielberg's career, but naturally it wasn't, because the timing was right. So what's wrong ?. The characters are boring, the story's boring, the whole thing is  just one big disappointing bore. But why ?. Well, we came to see the  creatures, didn't we ?. So where were they ?. The island should've been  full of life, but you didn't get that feeling. It's almost like Spielberg's  making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters; giving  them suspense but no release. -Or a dino movie with no dinos. Neat. If they  were so proud of their CGI effects, why didn't they show us more ?. -Ray  Harryhausen at least gave you monster value for your money, with superb  stop motion animation for all to SEE. I'd much rather watch good old stuff  like &quot;King Kong&quot;, or live lizards in &quot;Journey To The Center  Of The Earth&quot;, or even those rubber things in &quot;The Land That Time  Forgot&quot;.	1.0	Empty dinosaurs.	1999-11-09	32	4	28
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	'Jurassic Park' is on my list of the best movies to never recieve a 'Best Picture' nod at the oscars.  Now, some of you may not agree, and then some of you may.  I feel that 'Jurassic Park' is still one of the best films to ever grace the big screen.  Adapted (loosly) from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name 'Jurassic Park' delivers a solid script, solid acting and SOLID thrills that can not and will not be repeated (as is proven by the failed attempts in 'The Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III', both of which are decent but nothing even close to the original)  Before the doors to the Amusement Park to end all Amusement Parks is opened, the owner ushers in a few experts to take one final look.  Amoung these experts is a Mathematician (Goldbloom) and dino-experts/Paleontologists (Dern and Neill).  Of course upon hearing that this park offers guests a chance to see extinct dinosours these experts are a bit (or I should say a lot) skeptical, but after their first glimpse at the finished product they are stunned.  The film quickly turns from awe and wonderment to fear and terror and it does so with smart and effective scenes and dialog, and what works so well here is that not only does it serve up great action and suspence but it also builds up the charactors and gives you a look into these people, creating a three dimentional cast and giving the veiwer a feeling of being there with these people as the try and survive.  One of the most effective thrill rides to date and well deserving of all the praise.  This is the film to beat.	5.0	One of the best!	2006-05-15	2	1	1
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AS59PR3XGY0MT	Dana Ogdon	By far my favorite movie of all time, Jurassic Park exceeds all expectations as a movie would from it's vividly believable dinosaurs to a stunning cast including Sam Neil as the infamous Dr Grant who would return to Jurassic Park later for another adventure. This movie is by far a visual and theatrical masterpiece, using both C.G.I and animatronic dinosaurs to stun us as they roamed the screen.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	Steven Spielberg won the Oscar for directing &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and it is as great as any other Big, Serious Movie you'd care to name. But that same year he also directed the pulpy &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; which, for reasons of its own, was just as special as his angry and deeply personal Holocaust masterwork.Here is a special effects movie that, like &quot;Terminator 2&quot; before it, heralded a new era of filmmaking. True, both movies announced the arrival of a lot of bad cinema (&quot;Jurassic Park III,&quot; anyone?), but &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is memorable because of the love and care its director lavished on his beasties. This is sci-fi adventure escapism at its best.The story is not terribly strong, more like a clothesline on which to hang some of the most exciting action scenes ever devised. The movie isn't as elaborate as Michael Crichton's book, but it's just as fast-paced and handles its resurrected dinosaurs with equal awe. Did Spielberg dumb-down some of Crichton's more difficult scientific concepts? You betcha, but you know what? I've seen worse.I will always admire this movie for the T-Rex sequence, which scared me so badly in the theater that I had to pony up three more times to take the ride again. What a great moment; it sort of makes me imagine what it must have been like to have seen the premiere of &quot;King Kong&quot; back in 1933, because &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; garners comparison.The velociraptors were also great villains, photographed in menacing fashion and given distinct personalities of their own. The final scene, which brings together the T-Rex and the raptors, is a fast, brutal classic that leaves you wanting more. Wisely, Spielberg gives us just enough.The acting isn't great, but it is efficient. I give high marks to Jeff Goldblum for his flashy portrayal of chaotician Ian Malcolm (is he trying to channel Bono?) and Sam Neill, for his Harrison Ford-like turn as Dr. Grant. Laura Dern grates a nerve, and Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond as if he were Santa Claus, but these are flaws I'm willing to overlook.	4.0	One of Spielberg's best	2003-10-13	5	4	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QU74B9N0830G	Dan Thompson	At the time this movie originally came out, I was only six and had no appreciation for the cinematic powerhouse I was witnessing. When I saw that the movie was getting a limited run for the 20th anniversary, I knew that, even though it was in 3D, I had to be there.Wow...20 years has not aged this movie one bit. The CGI and special effects may not be up to par with modern day blockbusters, but they still hold up very well. The film is one of Spielberg's best and is a masterpiece of suspense. Tonally, it works on every level and the pacing of the film couldn't be better. It's one of the last movies I remember seeing that makes great use of animatronics instead of heavily relying on CGI. I'm not a huge fan of 3D but I have to say the conversion to the format wasn't bad. In my opinion, Jurassic Park belongs on the list of greatest movies of all time, and will continue to stand the test of time for years to come.	5.0	An Ageless Masterpiece of Storytelling, Suspense, and Special Effects	2013-04-23	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29NRLC2CLHU6S	Darth Vegas	"First, I want to say that this movie 'was' ground-breaking.  If ""King Kong"" ushered in the wave of stop-motion effects, which would continue to get better and better over the next 50 or so years, ""Jurassic Park"" was the first to really convince the public that CGI was the next step to achieving realism with movie monsters, dragons, space ships, etc (yes, more so than Terminator 2).Having said that, in spite of what Spielberg and his cohorts repeatedly suggest and outright boast about in their ""Jurassic Park"" documentary, CGI did not kill stop-motion, nor is it much much better than stop-motion in creating 'realism.'  It's strange for Spielbert to cite Harryhausen as an influence but then to go on and demonstrate how he feels stop-motion is unrealistic and too choppy.  And indeed, most of the extras are just documentaries about how great CGI is.As a Harryhausen fan, I took slight offense to that.Yes, stop-motion creatures will always seem a little fantastical (read: unrealistic) in movies, but as Harryhausen himself has always suggested, why would you want anything else?  And besides, any realism of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park is negated by the unrealism of its human cast, most of whom do things in this movie that no human in real life would do or say.  This is even more of a problem in the sequel ""JP: The Lost World.""  That is, the poor writing of characters in this movie constantly reminds you that you are watching a popcorn movie -- so, what is the point of trying to go ultra-realistic  with the dinosaurs and then have humans not react to these ultra-realistic dinosaurs convincingly (note: this is not always true) and act like idiots in regular conversation?I did like Goldblum's character quite a bit, and he tends to steal whatever scene he's in.  But the T-Rex is the star of the show and I have to admit that he 'does' deliver.  The Raptors too are a great accomplishment (though it is important to note that they are scientifically inaccurate -- far too big and lacking in feathers that have been shown to adorn the entire species).Of course, ""Jurassic Park"" is a lot of fun to watch, and I think it's a great dino movie.  It ushered in a whole new age of movie effects and creature features, much more so that ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" or ""The Abyss"" (also two great movies that really paved the way for CGI).  But, I think the filmmakers have a lot to learn when it comes to what makes CGI realistic.  It has more to do with how the real actors interact with their CGI environment and less to do with how good the CGI actually looks.  Is is telling that most of the better scenes in ""Jurassic Park"" are with the full-scale mockups, not the CGI dinos.  And that's not because the CGI doesn't look great -- it's because the actors having something real to interact with on-screen (and not standing in front of a blue screen and imagining what they are seeing while looking at a set-point).Still, a great accomplishment and fun movie."	4.0	Falls short of being a masterpiece... extras are so-so.	2011-01-08	3	2	1

He brings in a team to evaluate his living attractions, and from that point forward everything that can go wrong does.The lean, economical screenplay, by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, does just what it needs to--it moves us efficiently from thrill to thrill.  Only at the very end do the writers get sloppy.  In this movie, however, it's really the special effects that matter.  These dinosaurs live and breathe.  I remember when I first saw this movie in the theaters back in '93; I don't recall ever being so impressed with the technical mastery of a film.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	I believe that Steven Spielberg's original &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; is the ultimate dinosaur flick. It is a truly &#34;fun&#34; movie experience from start to finish. And evidently a bunch of other folks agree with me, because &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; earned approximately 357-Million dollars at the box office after premiering in movie theaters on June 11, 1993, placing the film in the Top 10 of all-time money-makers in motion-picture history (as of this writing, the film ranked #10).Spielberg was making &#34;Jurassic&#34; at precisely the same time he was also directing the emotionally-draining &#34;Schindler's List&#34;, which is a film that would go on to win the 1993 &#34;Best Picture&#34; Academy Award. Talk about a large workload! But Mr. Spielberg seemed to thrive on this juggling act of making two pictures at virtually the same time. And both movies came out in fine shape too, a fact which is backed up by the accolades (and huge box-office numbers) each movie garnered. (&#34;Schindler's&#34; earned just under $100-Million at the U.S. box office; and approximately $321-Million in worldwide release.)The personal storylines that were written for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; are a smidge on the weak side, true. But that doesn't really matter all that much in the final analysis -- because the movie is so much fun otherwise! And the choice of actor Jeff Goldblum to play the part of &#34;Dr. Ian Malcolm&#34; was the best casting decision made for the whole picture, in my view. He adds a lot of humor to the film.I've liked Mr. Goldblum in everything I've ever seen him in; and the &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; films are no exception (he reprised his role as &#34;Ian&#34; in the second &#34;Jurassic&#34; picture as well). His dry humor and easy-going style come across nicely in this film. Such as his humorous line: &#34;Yeah, I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.&#34; And, of course, THE funniest moment in the movie, when Ian/Jeff utters the hilarious line of dialogue that I've used as the title of this review (after narrowly escaping a rather large predator in a high-speed chase). LOL!  :-)Plus, yet another witty Goldblum-ism (reacting to a disappointing dinosaur-less tour of the park): &#34;Now, John, you will eventually be having DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour, right? Right?&#34; :)Mr. Spielberg blends a great deal of comedy in with what should be a major calamity --&#62; dinosaurs coming back to life and running free, spreading death and destruction! Sounds pretty serious, right? Well, it is -- but Spielberg manages to lighten up this scenario skillfully, with several humorous scenes. Besides the aforementioned funny Jeff Goldblum moments, there's also &#34;The Guy On The Toilet Meets Dino&#34; scene; as well as the nerdish computer programmer (played nicely by Wayne Knight), who gets way more than he's bargained for in the end.The great John Williams composed the music score for &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; -- and it fits the movie like a glove. I don't know how Mr. Williams keeps doing it, coming up with first-rate musical scores for film after film -- but he does. Amazing.This Universal Studios single-disc &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; DVD of &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; offers up great picture and sound -- via a full and booming Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack and a handsome Widescreen (1.85:1) Anamorphic video transfer. Those pre-historic beasts really &#34;come alive&#34; while watching this DVD.A generous helping of Special Features is dished out by Universal, too -- with the top prize in the package being the very informative behind-the-movie documentary featurette, &#34;The Making Of Jurassic Park&#34; (hosted by James Earl Jones). Mr. Spielberg has lots of on-camera time during this eye-opening featurette, explaining much of the creative work that went into getting this film to the movie screen.This Making-Of program throws the viewer right into the center of Steven Spielberg's movie-making process. Included are many details about the computer-generated effects, which were quite new and untested in the motion-picture industry at the time of the film's production in late 1992 and 1993, making &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; a true pioneering film in many &#34;CGI&#34; ways.Other bonus items on the disc include: An &#34;animatics&#34; feature, storyboards, production photographs, design sketches and paintings, theatrical trailers, DVD-ROM stuff, a &#34;Dinosaur Encyclopedia&#34;, and some cast-&-crew text notes.Additional Data Concerning This DVD .....................&#62; French language soundtrack included (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround).&#62; Subtitles in Spanish.&#62; Running Time for Main Feature = 2 hrs., 7 min.&#62; MPAA Rating -- PG-13.&#62; Any Paper Insert(s)? -- Yes, a 4-page mini-booklet, with some behind-the-scenes pics and a Chapter List (20 total scene selections).----------------------Parting Jurassic Thoughts ...................There's a certain &#34;magic&#34; that emanates from &#34;Jurassic Park #1&#34; -- with its three main ingredients for success (and fun) being: Director Steven Spielberg, John Williams' terrific score, and those first-of-their-kind computer-generated images that we see on screen, which make the dinosaurs seem, almost literally -- alive!The &#34;Jurassic&#34; sequels that were released in 1997 and 2001 were, IMO, okay films in their own right.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3UUGZRTBS81YN	David W. Jones	This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Jurassic Park is quite good.  The details are crisp; the colors are strong; and the sound is clear.  The special effects hold up surprisingly well considering the film is now twenty years old.  It is what you would hope for a sci-fi thriller like this one.  There is some film grain, but for the most part is not distracting.  About the only complaint that I have has to do with a few night scenes, which come across as gritty in the transfer.  But these are brief and hardly ruin the movie.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.	4.0	Very good blu-ray transfer	2013-07-01	0	0	0

First, Jurrasic Park is a fantatic move, they use every inch of 5.1 encoding; i have a state of the art sound system it was bliss.Now, first you should know the &quot;hour of cut footage&quot; is 100% on the lost world CD not Jurrasic Park. the lost worl in my opinion was a very week movie. Almost like they were standing around with a bunch of Dino robots and extra film and they said &quot;why not&quot; So the lost worl cut footage was just as bad as the movie.I wish they released it on DVD without Lost world, but still - worthy of my DVD collection.Cheers.	4.0	A review of the Special Addition DVD Box Set	2000-10-12	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ARC5GYVVR3J2V	Decimated1184	"When young Steven Spielberg was first offered the screenplay for ""Jaws,"" he said he would direct the movie on one condition: That he didn't have to show the shark for the first hour. By slowly building the audience's apprehension, he felt, the shark would be much more impressive when it finally arrived. He was right. I wish he had remembered that lesson when he was preparing ""Jurassic Park,"" his new thriller set in a remote island theme park where real dinosaurs have been grown from long-dormant DNA molecules. The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values. It's clear, seeing this long-awaited project, that Spielberg devoted most of his effort to creating the dinosaurs. The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters. Richard Attenborough, as the millionaire who builds the park, is given a few small dimensions - he loves his grandchildren, he's basically a good soul, he realizes the error of tampering with nature. But there was an opportunity here to make his character grand and original, colorful and oversize, and instead he comes across as unfocused and benign. As the film opens, two dinosaur experts (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) arrive at the park, along with a mathematician played by Jeff Goldblum whose function in the story is to lounge about uttering vague philosophical imprecations. Also along are Attenborough's grandchildren, and a lawyer, who is the first to be eaten by a dinosaur.  Attenborough wants the visitors to have a preview of his new park, where actual living prehistoric animals live in enclosures behind tall steel fences, helpfully labeled ""10,000 volts."" The visitors set off on a tour in remote-controlled utility vehicles, which stall when an unscrupulous employee (Wayne Knight) shuts down the park's computer program so he can smuggle out some dinosaur embryos. Meanwhile, a tropical storm hits the island, the beasts knock over the fences, and Neill is left to shepherd the kids back to safety while they're hunted by towering meat-eaters. The plot to steal the embryos is handled on the level of a TV sitcom. The Knight character, an overwritten and overplayed blubbering fool, drives his Jeep madly through the storm and thrashes about in the forest. If this subplot had been handled cleverly - with skill and subtlety, as in a caper movie - it might have added to the film's effect. Instead, it's as if one of the Three Stooges wandered into the story.  The subsequent events - after the creatures get loose - follow an absolutely standard outline, similar in bits and pieces to all the earlier films in this genre, from ""The Lost World"" and ""King Kong"" right up to the upcoming ""Carnosaur."" True, because the director is Spielberg, there is a high technical level to the execution of the cliches. Two set-pieces are especially effective: A scene where a beast mauls a car with screaming kids inside, and another where the kids play hide and seek with two creatures in the park's kitchen.  But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs. Think back to another ambitious special effects picture from Spielberg, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977). That was a movie about the ""idea"" of visitors from outer space. It inspired us to think what an awesome thing it would be, if earth were visited by living alien beings. You left that movie shaken and a little transformed. It was a movie that had faith in the intelligence and curiosity of its audience. In the 16 years since it was made, however, big-budget Hollywood seems to have lost its confidence that audiences can share big dreams. ""Jurassic Park"" throws a lot of dinosaurs at us, and because they look terrific (and indeed they do), we're supposed to be grateful. I have the uneasy feeling that if Spielberg had made ""Close Encounters"" today, we would have seen the aliens in the first 10 minutes, and by the halfway mark they'd be attacking Manhattan with death rays. Because the movie delivers on the bottom line, I'm giving it four stars. You want great dinosaurs, you got great dinosaurs. Spielberg enlivens the action with lots of nice little touches; I especially liked a sequence where a smaller creature leaps suicidally on a larger one, and they battle to the death. On the monster movie level, the movie works and is entertaining. But with its profligate resources, it could have been so much more."	4.0	The First and BEST	2001-07-21	1	0	1

Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen. The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.	5.0	An Amercian Classic	2008-09-21	1	1	0

The movie inspired awe in anyone who first saw it in the theatres. this was the first time we have seen a REAL looking dino on the big screen. Richard Attenborough is a rich man who creates an island theme park full of cloned dinosaurs, and is one of the first films to deal with the serious issue of cloning. He invites a team of scientists to sign off on the island, which includes Sam Neill and Laura Dern as paleontologists as well as a mathamatician, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Attenboroughs 2 grandkids. Of course, the park breaks down, and the dinosaurs run amok, creating some of the best scenes in movie history. The special effects are good to this day, especially with the crisp clarity of the DVD picture and OUTSTANDING sound. There is also a load of extras, including trailers for all 3 films.	5.0	Jurassic Park on DVD? And you're stil reading this?	2001-02-28	3	3	0

It is superior and so much better than the one included in the Dolby Digital edition.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	The novel Jurassic Park gives us a glimpse of what could happen if the human were to tamper with the DNA of extinct animals. The movie brings that glimpse to life, using state-of-the-art special effects to create the  mammoth creatures and a talented cast to carry out the story. Sam Neill and  Laura Dern star as Allen and Ellie Grant, two archeological diggers who are  called upon by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to inspect and give  their OK for his newest park, a park that breeds dinosaurs through advanced  genetic technology. While being taken on a tour of the park, a tropical  storm strikes the island, and that, combined with the shenanigans of a  conniving park worker (Wayne Knight) on the take for embryos, begin to shut  down the park's security systems and electrical fencing. When the monsters  begin to break free of their restraints, what was supposed to be a fun tour  through the park becomes a nightmarish race against death and time for  Allen Grant and Hammond's two grandchildren. Special effects in this film,  while they were only made in 1993, are seamless and utterly believable. The  acting leaves nothing to be desired, with compelling performances from the  supporting cast as well as the leads. An interesting twist on the  not-so-unthinkable, this film is one of Speilberg's best. One question:  where is the DVD version?	5.0	Interestingly spun from the novel.	2000-04-12	38	25	13

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	Hard to imagine few movies as fun as JURASSIC PARK.  I had fun when I first saw this Spielberg offering in the theater, and I have grand fun every time I catch it on cable.  I have an eclectic DVD collection, and this movie needs to be a part of it, so there will be a parting with my coin in the near future.  Outside of the suspense, the sheer terror of running for your life from a T-Rex or a raptor, it was, and still is, the (then) state-of-the-art CGI effects that make this thriller so special.  And I still get goose bumps every time I see that puddle of water shake from the approaching steps of a mean-tempered predator.The cast is exceptional, but I especially enjoy Jeff Goldblum as a free-spirited science ethicist; his one-liners and zingers are priceless.  Wayne Knight is the rotund villain we all love to hate, and who isn't entertained by a chain-smoking Samuel L. Jackson pecking away on a keyboard?  Yes, the cast is stellar, but the dinosaurs steal this movie, gobbling up (pardon the pun) every scene they're in.  The effects are as terrifying as they are believable, even after all these years and subsequent technological enhancements; who knew hiding in a kitchen from two determined raptors could produce such white knuckle effects?  Four stars, however, instead of five; with the exception of the ongoing disillusion of Park founder John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) none of the other characters are fully vetted and fleshed out--including the leading roles, played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern (wolf howl).  Yet I'm being picky; in JURASSIC PARK, why should a character be fleshed out when they already have their real flesh at risk?--D.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	While I loved almost every aspect of the movie, its the dinosaurs that steal the show, naturally.  And it's not just because we see a T-Rex in full form or a pair of ruthless Raptors, but this is the first time something is presented in glorious CGI.  Jurassic Park made a huge impact with that for its time, just like Terminator 2 did in 1990 and the Matrix in 1999.  Jurassic Park had its place too, at bringing to life dinosaurs that look wonderful and real, and hold up even today on the screen.Based off the book by Micahel Crichton, one can't expect the over all feel of the film to be as good, but honestly the whole thing worked just fine.  If you compare this original to the sequals, its even that much better.  The cast is quite decent, and though huge amounts of dialouge are not shared as well as deep in depthness to most of the characters, its ok because this is about the dinasours and the park on the island.  The first hour is spent much like one would feel taking a trip to this park, almost a vacation if you will, though already the park has its glitches.  A tropical storm comes, and combined with a sneaky worker named Dennis (Wayne Knight - that big nerdy guy in Animal House) who is just too funny sometimes, all heck breaks loose - including the dinosaurs.  Thus begins the last hour thrill ride of chases and survival tactics.  There are two scenes that are very action filled.  The first is the T-Rex attack on the two park vehicles in the rain at night.  The other was just down right scary, the pair of Velociraptors hunting the two children in the dark kitchen.In addition to the dinosaurs, I enjoyed the characters and their acting was fine.  The story was excellent too, and though a bit slow at first, it works out well.  Time is taken to appreciate and learn the mesmorizing truth about these creatures and how they have been recreated.  Thanks to the directing of Spielberg and the outsanding score by John Williams, every scene is a good one.  And thanks to Williams usual impressive composing skills, he creates not just good music, but a theme for Jurassic Park that is easily recognizable whenever heard.Though this went down as a great film, I think it deserves even more credit.  It was created before its time, and holding up very well for today's standads.  The sequals can't even compare.  The story is fascinating and the dinosaurs themselves - breathtaking, and scary.Acting - 4.5Action - 5Characters - 4.5Story - 4.5Overall - 5	5.0	Welcome to Jurassic Park	2008-01-17	0	0	0

The point, though, is to hop on for the ""ride"" and enjoy it at all levels:  action-adventure, sci-fi, buddy film, curmudgeon discovers squishy center, social commentary on the evils of corporate greed, etc.  All in a big, glitzy, gorgeous, commercial Hollywood blockbuster by Steven Spielberg, the master of the form."	5.0	Just as fun...	2014-06-01	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2VJ80PM1G00QV	drkhimxz	If memory serves, despite the great technological advances in the 60 Years between King Kong and Jurassic Park, the Great Ape still has the edge over the Dinosaurs. The difference fundamentally is, of course, that the Great Ape had a heart and a soul: he could and did love the White Goddess, Fay Wray. There is no love between these monsters and humans (although some possibilities occur-unexplored by any but the merest gesture-are adumbrated that there is some evolutionary possibility of love emerging between the non-carnivore leaf eaters (pre-giraffe) and our representatives.Happily, one can see and enjoy both today and anyone seeking adventurous thrills in a film should see both. This is one of the films one should see not only for the entertainment thrills but to share in one of the pioneer movies in the movement toward animation which today has almost displaced the human actor and tomorrow....well, who knows. The human actors are limited by the scriptwriters to stereotyped responses but do an acceptable job within those narrow confines. Richard Attenborough, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum handle the co-starred roles as well as they are allowed; Josh Mostel is the fat-man villain who earns his comeuppance as a just penalty for his vile nastiness. Above all, the creatures are the focus and do a bang-up job thereby earning the reward of making the two additional films their performances allowed. The two kids were suitably terrified and, hopefully, will suffer no lasting harm from their exposure to the Hollywood spotlight.Need I add that Spielberg can be proud of his achievement, as well as being happy over the fortune he earned from it.If you have not done so, you will want to see this picture; if you have seen it, as did I, the second time can be even better than the first.	5.0	After Two Decades.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	Although the concepts and general framework of this story are faithfully lifted from the Crichton-penned source material, in action it's got Steven Spielberg's fingerprints all over it. That isn't a negative, really, as the director was still clearly in his prime, but it does fit quite snugly next to the other family-friendly adventure flicks in his portfolio in that it's big and intense without going so far over-the-top as to scare the kiddos. Of course, at the time the real star here was the film's fantastic effects work - it was CGI's coming out party, after all - and that aspect has aged surprisingly well over the past two decades. Sure, if we look closely a few seams might show here or there, but the raptors remain unsettlingly vivid and our first glimpses of a grazing brachiosaurus remain nothing short of stunning. Some excellent casting decisions enrich the whole package (Jeff Goldblum is pitch-perfect as the muttering, brainy Ian Malcolm) and there are plenty of character moments scattered about to flesh out the more extravagant action sets.	4.0	Spielberg's Action-Adventure Monolith Stands the Test of Time	2013-05-08	1	1	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AXPN8L8QI2Z4A	"Dr.||\\//|| ""To Hope is to do Magic"""	Unfortunately, the typical American movie goer doesn't know a thing about rhinoceros hunting; so it's not really their fault they don't know: guns can't kill dinosaurs; but the production team for this movie should have known or at least should have consulted a rhinoceros hunter; if they did they would have known: the rhinoceros has a thick skin, a dense bone structure, an incredible hulk; and it is still much smaller and frailer than a T-rex and many other dinosaurs; but even a rhinoceros hunter has to buy a gun way bigger than anybody in Jurassic Park had; and even that gun is so weak there's only a tiny little area the size of a quarter where the gun is able to actually able to bring down the rhinoceros; anything outside that area will either just plain bounce off the rhinoceros or it will penetrate enough to give him a slight irritation enough to make him mad enough to maybe: turn on the rhinoceros hunter and charge (Hope the poor hunter can run!) Now dinosaurs: Dinosaurs like the T-rex are much thicker skinned than the rhinoceros, much denser boned, and much heavier. Anything those guys in Jurassic Park fired would have bounced right off them. There are some weapons like hand grenades, missals, tank, and mounted guns that could bring down a T-rex. (Are you seeing how much potential for flash, bang, and explosion was lost?) Next thing I must complain about is first they seriously over rated guns then they completely underrated the intelligence of professional gun men! Just about every single attempt to fire a gun ended in a malfunction due to bad hardware or tampered with hardware. That is just stupid. A real gunman doesn't walk into a T-rex without checking his gun! No, this movie is just living proof that you don't have to have a brain to thought of as a genius. I really hope somebody goes back and completely remakes a similar story line. (And don't get me started on Reign of Fire!)	1.0	Best Action-horror wan-a-be flick ever!	2003-02-21	33	1	32

I was lucky that I was able to get it working in about 15-20 minutes. Then I decided to interrupt and clicked pause. After some time the screen went to a screen saver and all my tried to return it back to a normal mode failed, &#34;you are not authorized...&#34;. Ok, ejected the disk, inserted... nothing, just a black screen. Making the long story short - it took about 20 more minutes to get it working again. I didn't want to give up since it was working, although badly, and the entire family wanted to watch it. So, I'm not sure who actually designed this Blue Ray disk and why it cannot be recognized in my latest generation player with all required features and the latest firmware. I've heard, that a number of people are having similar issue and it's even known as the disk creators failure.

Hetke	On the small remote island of Isla Nublar, seventy-five miles off the west coast of Costa Rica, man brought nature's most extraordinary creatures back from the past using a special technique of recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA.  Now dinosaurs extinct for sixty-five million years roam  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, an amusement park on the island created by  Scottish professor John Hammond (Richard Attenborough, Lord of England) and  his genetic engineering company, InGen (International Genetic Technologies,  Inc.).  But when something goes wrong, and security systems fail all over  the park, including the fences that keep the animals in their paddocks,  paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobontonist Ellie Sattler (Laura  Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum, star of this film's  sequel) and more make a desperate attempt to escape the island gone  haywire... in one piece.  With appearances by Bob Peck as raptor expert  Robert Muldoon, B.D. Wong as Jurassic Park genetic scientist Henry Wu,  Samuel L. Jackson as control room computer operator John Arnold,  Martin Ferrero as John Hammond's lawyer, Donald Gennaro, Wayne  Knight as the fat slob Dennis Nedry, and Joseph  Mazzello and Ariana Richards as the young brother and sister Tim (othy) and  Lex (Alexis) Murphy (last name is only mentioned in the novel).  A  marvelous full-length adventure vividly entertaining and suspenseful from  maybe the most successful director, Steven Spielberg (&quot;Jaws&quot;,  &quot;E.T.&quot;) and author Michael Crichton (writer of &quot;Congo&quot;  and many more successful novels).

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A34GZPHWYPSY2T	"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry"""	This 1993 immortal offering from Steven Schpielboig is No. 2 on my Deeply Personal Series of film reviews. You'll have to hunt for the others. Like a disappointing Easter egg.JURASSIC PARK was a kind of comeback for Spielberg, who ruined himself with revolting THE COLOR PURPLE. Not just that: JURASSIC PARK yanked Hollybrood out of the late 1980s, which was badly needed. The CGI...well! Those velociraptors!! My mother jumped and ran from the living room when she saw those. She asked me if they were real animals. She was born in 1917, give her a break. She was nearly 25 before she knew of the existence of alligators.This movie defines smart, elegant, cool, action, adventure and education without breaking a sweat. Spielberg's heart was still in his work--that would evaporate rapidly after this film--and in JURASSIC PARK, it shows all of Spielberg's heart. Like a latter-day E.T. The idea that a devious billionaire (Hammond, played by the long-lived and legendary Sir Richard Attenborough) could manipulate dino-mtDNA and create living dinosaurs was so incredible. This film gave the idea to the public, because the genuine research that inspired the film was just too boring, kinda like this review.Hammond's InGen Industries was scary as hell, even though the film did not go into it like Dr. Crichton's original novel. It is worth watching because of that alone: the corporation as angel-of-death, the billionaire-owner-as-God, the mathematician-as-warning-prophet-of-doom, and the innocents (Alan and Ellie) who just want to keep doing science and experience the wonder. Later they accuse Hammond of destroying the natural order and its wonder.Einstein made that same charge against scientists in 1944. And no, that is not a communist idea. It is what is on the screen and it is the truth as Spielberg wanted to express it. He was only following Einstein's lead in this line of thought.The crown jewel of JURASSIC PARK is the CGI. There was nothing like it at the time, and the CGI being used here and there in a few frames of other films was as bad as cel animation. Here, the dinosaurs, though not 100% CGI (it was impossible back then) leap off the screen in a way no one thought possible. They looked like real animals, and it can be said JURASSIC PARK introduced CGI to the world. It's a major landmark in film......so much so that Lucas tried to CGI Yoda 100% in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE. He couldn't even get a few seconds of Yoda, because CGI was in its infancy and while a herd of dinosaurs isn't easy, it is a far-away cry from doing a film character 100%, and doing it successfully. That is why PHANTOM MENACE nearly didn't make its deadline and has a crummy Yoda muppet.JURASSIC PARK changed lives, as did all my Deeply Personal film choices (such as BUCKAROO BANZAI). Lots of people I know are paleontologists today because of this movie (and in spite of Dr. Alan Grant's urine-hued 'Indiana Jones' hat). It gave us a dynamic Sam Niell, a new and glossy Jeff Goldblum, a sexy Laura Dern, an impossibly grumpy Samuel L. Jackson (who was nearly unknown back then)--wow, I could go on forever.One last thing is the soaring, riveting score by John Williams. What the hell are we going to do when we lose him?Get this sweet dinosaur classic--there aren't many, you know--because it is the grand-daddy of much.	5.0	Chilean sea bass, I believe	2010-06-07	2	2	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29TKSIWA3JKF3	Einsatz	This is my go-to movie when I just want to watch some mindless adventure and, of course, some dinosaurs.  It is, like most of Spielberg's work, highly manipulative rather than artfully done.  Not necessarily a bad thing, it just lacks depth and finesse.  Spielberg loves to take shortcuts, hitting the obvious notes at the prescribed time.  He doesn't lead us through the story, he shoves us forward; like some obnoxious tour guide pointing out the sights.  He is a director from the sledgehammer school of film, continuously thumping you on the head until you get it.  Fortunately, because of the subject matter, most of his work is already done, who doesn't like dinosaurs?  They are the stars of this film.  They are the reason I've watched and enjoyed it many times.  I would place Jurassic Park near the top of my list of favorite films (but I loved the book more).Some of the characters/actors are more successful than others (my favorite is the ever snarky, and always right, Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm).  Richard Attenborough is charming as a slightly warped Santa Claus type, jovial but a definite menace with ideas that are best left to more responsible people.  The one sour note was the cartoon performance by Wayne Knight as a greedy disgruntled employee (perhaps someone should have informed him that this wasn't a sitcom accompanied by a laugh track).On the plus side, the plot tears along at a breakneck speed, keeping you from languishing over the ruts in the plot.  Most of the deaths are cowardly done off screen.  And then there's that one pesky problem of placing children in jeopardy for the sake of easily gained discomfort.  I've never appreciated that ploy; at best it's just a cheap shot and one of the easier tricks to educe apprehension in a viewer.  I'd have to say I suffer a love/hate admiration for this film.  And yet, I will keep watching it.  It's those dinosaurs..................	5.0	"""What's going to happen to the goat?"""	2013-05-04	1	1	0

Never mind that the sequels have more dino footage, and more advanced dino footage, which is, after all, why we watch the films.  This film still has something which the other two do not have.In a word, chemistry.  While all the films lack any real character development, this one has more characters that we really care about.  With the others, you could pretty much predict who was going to get eaten first, as they generally went after the most unlikeable actors.  Yes, this one went for the blood-sucking lawyer first, but even he had some charisma.  In the other movies, we really didn't care that the ""bad guys"" got wasted.  In this film, we feel bad for just about all the victims.And yes, the number of dino-minutes are down in this film, but where they do occur, they are used well.  Our very first glimpse of the herds on the island is still breathtaking.  The feeding of the ""veggie-saurus"" by the kids is vintage Speilberg.  And the timing of the T-Rex coming out of the trees to chase the jeep is cut so tightly, one still is unsure whether they are going to get away, even after multiple viewings.I rate I, III, and II as my favorites, in that order."	4.0	Still the best of the three	2002-04-09	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1GBVCADZBO8YG	Emc2	"I read Jurassic Park for the first time in 1992, right after the paperback edition was published. I had never read science fiction novels before JP. I just devoured it during a flight from New York to Costa Rica.  I was captivated by the smart extrapolation of science, particularly the clever use of biotechnology for breeding extinct animals, the warnings about uncontrolled uses of new technologies (Crichton's recurring theme), all the new and updated information about how dinosaurs really were, and by Crichton's trademark in his earlier works, a storyline full of verisimilitude, imagination and originality. What a great SF novel this is!And then, in 1993 my disappointment was as high as my expectations were for the movie, except for the new computer-generated (CGI) special effects, the dinosaurs looked very realistic, fully integrated with the actors. The merit of the movie is indeed the successful introduction of CGI, a technology that was a revolution in cinema, from which we are benefiting from up to these days. Together with Star Wars and The Matrix, JP is a landmark in modern cinema's history. Just for this reason is worthwhile to own the DVD, or if you still have small children, they will love it.As compared to the original plot in the book, the movie it's a deception, and it's also misleading to judge Crichton's work. Spielberg made a typical kids movie out of the original plot. Also, the brief scenes showing Costa Rica are ridiculous, the setting is a fake with a 100% Mexican flavor. The book makes a more realistic description of how Costa Rica really is. Michael Crichton did his homework, Steven Spielberg did not.Unfortunately, for the sequel, Crichton wrote a PG-13 action movie script instead of a good SF novel, including the resurrection of some of the key characters who had died in JP I. Then Spielberg changed the plot again, and the resulting JP II (""The Lost World"") was even worse, including an undeserved ending, sort of King Kong craze in the US streets.For those of you who were kids or teenagers in 1993, when you watched the movie for the first time, I highly recommend you to read the book, especially if you already are a SF fan. Thereafter,  watch the DVD and compare. You're not going to regret it."	3.0	You have to read the original Crichton novel. The plot is better than in the movie	2007-07-05	4	3	1

Everybody loved the special effects and seeing realistic dinosaurs on the big screen (remember, this was the FIRST time a movie had realistic dinosaurs as opposed to Godzilla-like monsters). But what really made this movie click was the characters. It's a perfect mix of lovable and oddball characters. I love the subtle character development over the course of the movie, particularly with Dr. Grant and John Hammond. You actually do care if they get eaten and you want them to survive.Jurassic Park is also the only time I've ever thought that a movie was better than the book. The book was more like a B-rated horror story with flat characters and more violence. The movie by contrast embraces the wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen and is much more fun to watch.

It's perfect. This is one of my favorite films so I was overly excited about its DVD release. Special features include: &quot;The Making Of Jurassic Park&quot;, Theatrical trailors for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot;, Dinosaur Encyclopedia, Production Notes, Cast &amp; Filmmakers, a Direct Hotlink to the Set of &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot;, and for DVD-Rom, a screensaver and access to Live Web Events!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3L2U581LL17EB	Eric	"When I was a kid, I always had an obsession with dinosaurs, so it was natural that, at the tender age of 9, I embraced Jurassic Park as THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE.  I have since grown considerably since then, and now in my late teens, have come to the conclusion that Jurassic Park is indeed not the greatest movie ever made.  But it's a damn good one, and it's an even match with any of the Indiana Jones films for sheer escapist adventure (thank God Steven Spielberg directed films during my adolescence).This movie is, of course, hardly plot-driven, but a summary of sorts is in order.  Sam Neill stars as Alan Grant, a paleontologist who doesn't much like high-tech equipment, or kids for that matter.  Laura Dern stars as his girlfriend, Ellie Sattler, apparently a paleobotanist.  Both of them (along with Jeff Goldblum as a chaos theoretician) are invited to an amusement park by a rather kindly, enthusiastic old man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough).  Well, it turns out the park is full of cloned dinosaurs and they've arrived as experts to deem whether or not the place is safe for tourists.  But a saboteur within the park knocks out the power, leaving the guests stranded somewhere in the island, and the hungry dinosaurs on the loose, searching for food.Premise like that sounds like fun, doesn't it?  And yes, Jurassic Park is very fun.  It's unlikely anyone who's reading this review has never seen the movie, but it's always nice to reiterate to a fan (or detractor) why it is I hold such adoration for this film. Ever since Jurassic Park's initial theatrical release, the movie's always had a lot of unfair criticism thrown at it, a lot of it aimed at how Spielberg should have learned his lesson from Jaws and show restraint toward presenting the dinos, or how the character development was somewhat lacking.  I'm guessing the fact it was directed by Spielberg set it up for far more nitpicky complaints than if it had been helmed by someone else (which makes it all the more amazing how acclaimed Spielberg's movies, especially his most recent ones, are).To both alleged faults, I cannot agree with.  Whether or not anyone actually noticed, Spielberg actually showed restraint by not revealing the T-rex (or dilophosaurus) right off the bat, waiting patiently until the perfect moment, when all hell breaks loose.  As a result, its first appearance is truly terrifying.  Besides, these are dinosaurs, gargantuan sights that are appropriately astounding and awe-inspiring (with these images nicely boosted by John Williams' rousing score), and with such great special effects on hand, holding back the sight of the dinosaurs would be a pretty silly notion.As for the characters, most everyone here made at least a slight impression on me.  Sam Neill is great as always, playing the likeable Grant as a convincing action hero who never resorts to ridiculous stunts.  The friendship he develops with the two kids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) is ""typical"" Spielberg, but what's typical of his is still far better done than your average, first-rate filmmaker (yeah, I admit it, I'm an exremely ardent Spielberg fan).  The other performances are good; Jeff Goldblum is very funny as the sarcastic chaotician, Laura Dern makes a sexy heroine, and Bob Peck is simply too cool as the park's game hunter.  Loved the man, wish he was in the movie more.It's interesting to note that the pacing is so good, I never noticed that the film doesn't get into the dino action until almost the halfway mark.  The film was enjoyable before the dinosaur mayhem, and once the dinosaurs start chomping down on puny humans, the movie jumpstarts into a remarkable thrill ride.  There are two action sequences, in particular, that stand out.  The first is the T-rex assault on the motionless cable cars, which nicely builds up suspense, then pays off in spades.  The climactic cat-and-mouse game with the raptors is an even more impressive nail-biter, initially set in a kitchen, then turning into a full-blown chase through the ducts, all the way to a wide-spaced museum.Opinions for this movie have always been rather mixed, but with the majority aiming toward the positive.  JP's got great action, first-rate special effects, and charismatic leads; what's not to like?  Personally, I enjoyed it a bit more than Jaws, probably because Williams' score never goes inappropriately playful at any point in JP.  By certain definitions, Jurassic Park might not rate as a great movie, but it's great entertainment, and what more could you ask from a film?"	5.0	Great escapist entertainment.	2002-11-23	4	3	1

The pacing is first-rate, the comedy is well done, and the special effects are........well, do I really need to say anything? They practically speak for the whole movie. And the cast is perfect; Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant (one of his best roles), Laura Dern as his partner, Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Dr. Ian Malcolm (hence came the now-famous line &quot;Must go faster! Must go faster!&quot;, which he hillariously repeated three years later in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which is just as good). The scenery and location are also A+ material, from dense jungles to wide open plains.I'm definitely going to get this on DVD...probably in the &quot;Jurassic Park Trilogy&quot; 3-pack boxed set. It's to bad the sequals weren't as good, but then again, they never are.	5.0	One of Spielberg's Top 10!	2002-03-06	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	Steven Spielberg has always been my favorite movie director because of his innate ability to tap into people's fears, hopes, and aspirations.  And while he may not always be successful at it (1941 and HOOK being examples), he is successful far more often than not.  JURASSIC PARK, based on Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, is a prime example of Spielberg's abilities.The story revolves around the dreams of an eccentric billionaire (Richard Attenborough) to construct an amusement park on an island 120 miles off of Costa Rica that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, created from cloning dinosaur DNA.  He invites two paleontologists (Sam Neill, Laura Dern) to the island to check it out for themselves, along with a hugely cynical &quot;chaos&quot; mathematician (Jeff Goldblum).  But while the park itself is overwhelming to its visitors, including Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards), there is a strong feeling that Attenborough and his fellow creators have left a few things out.Then it hits.  An overly ambitious security expert (Wayne Knight) has involved himself in smuggling dinosaur embryos off the island for a competitor.  But the only way to pull it off is to shut down the entire park's security systems...which is exactly what happens, unfortunately.  With the fifty miles worth of electrified fences shut off, and a tropical storm lashing the island, the dinosaurs break free of their enclosures.  What results is some of the most terrifying and suspenseful sequences of 1990s cinema, from a director who clearly studied the techniques of the Master, Alfred Hitchcock.Winner of three Oscars (Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects) and a $1 billion box office winner to boot, JURASSIC PARK, scripted by Crichton and David Koepp, is a hugely entertaining and relevant science fiction/suspense thriller that, while giving audiences the requisite chills and thrills, also has a warning about the potential dangers of cloning, which now seem to be coming perilously true in reality.  Even well-meaning enterprises like this film's amusement park are susceptible to human failures or lapses of morality.Neill, Dern, Goldblum, and Attenborough are pretty good in their roles; and, contrary to what others might think, I don't think the special effects overshadow them.  John Williams, yet again, provides Spielberg with another memorable music score.  Followed four years later by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (a very respectable sequel), and in 2001 by JURASSIC PARK 3.	5.0	When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth...Again!	2001-11-28	2	0	2

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2UYXNDGENSAMK	Fabio Ornelas	"65 million years ago, dinosaurs became extinct. In 1993, imagination, science and technology came together, bringing these remarkable creatures back from extinction in a spectacular motion picture that became a worldwide phenomenon: Jurassic Park. A Steven Spielberg film starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough, Jurassic Park is a breathtaking adventure that opens the gate to a lost world, the incredible world of the dinosaurs.On a remote island in the west coast of Costa Rica, a venture capitalist called John Hammond figured out an astonishing recovering and cloning technique to re-create dinosaurs from DNA fragments preserved in amber. He started a company called InGen, which placed the genetically engineered dinosaurs in a theme park called Jurassic Park. Before opening the attraction to the public, Hammond invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park and help calm anxious investors. However, their visit is anything but tranquil as the park security system breaks down and the prehistoric creatures break out... This is the original story of Jurassic Park, a simple but well developed idea based not only on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, but also on truly scientific evidences.It presents a world lost by time and by the human kind, a world where nature and its inhabitants used to live in perfect harmony. In order to evoke this lost world, Jurassic Park makes use of striking visual and sound effects that depicts faithfully these extraordinary creatures which were the dinosaurs, how they were and how they lived;  and a wonderful soundtrack composed and conducted by John Williams, which is the spirit of this unforgettable adventure, one of the greatest successes in the history of Cinema, winner of three Academy Awards.This incredible motion picture goes 6,5 million years back of evolution to inspire millions of people today and give us what we humans must need: hope. Because although dinosaurs appear to be the real creatures, we are the villains of this story  which is life. And as the birds fly away at the end of the film it is time to think about our own existence and our place in the world habitat. Nature cannot be contained, cannot be controlled by men. ""Life finds a way"". As Spielberg said during filming of this biogenetics adventure ""My interest is in making a good movie that honors the existence of dinosaurs"". And he really made it!"	5.0	Jurassic Inspiration!	2000-10-10	12	8	4

The extras are cool too. Sell your &quot;The Making of Jurassic Park&quot; VHS on e-bay because it is on the disc. You'll also see production sketches/paintings, and a fly-on-the-wall effect of early production meetings. Steve and the effects guys really look like 10 year olds playing with toys it's great! I could have used a commentary track by Steve but I guess you can't have everything. Incidentally, make sure you get the widescreen version, at first I gut the full-screen one (by accident I assure you) but everything looked weird. Everything was short and fat.

I have mixed feelings about this particular 3D edition. In geneal, the 3D feeling is not spectacular, yet nice, with rounded edges and lots of volume; but there are flaws. First of all, there's far too much ghosting. Second, and most importantly, Universal has done it again (yes, yet again!!) and has gone too far with the DNR reduction. There is an unfortunate loss of detail (the previous 2D blu-ray edition is much more detailed), all clothes look like they are made of plastic, faces are waxy (especially middle shots, where they look plain ridiculous) and the background vegetation often looks like green jelly. This was in a 55' Sony TV with active glasses; maybe smaller screens or passive glasses with diminish these defects. But most of all, this movie was never intended for 3D, so there are no ""on-your-face shocking effects"" or intended use of the environmental 3D either. What was the need of this? Oh, yes, extra cash on a film already sold in many other different formats, of course.

They take a vehicular tour of the park accompanied by Hammond's two young granchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazello).What starts as a fascinating foray into the re-awakened world of prehistory, turns into a nightmare, as sabotage and a fierce tropical thunderstorm, traps the tourists, and unleashes a bunch of dinosaurs gone completely wild.The film can be best remembered for the incredible special effects, and the amazing recreation of the dinosaurs making for some thrilling soundbites.The real stars, apart from of course the dinosaurs, are Ariana Richards Joseph Mazello who are just naturals as the kids who accompany the scientists, and get just the right balance, as American kids in a  fantastically surreal situation.	4.0	Great recreation of Jurassic dinosaurs and great acting by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazello.	2007-11-16	2	2	0

It still has kept its suspense and is still freaky and fun to watch. The visual effects are amazing for the time that this was made. Steven Spielberg is a great director. A lot of the scenes are amazing, especially the cup of water rippling, and the raptor looking in the kitchen window. The best scenes are the T-Rex chase and the velociraptors in the building. Although the scientific believability of the movie is iffy, I really don't think that the story is that bad. It's not too in-depth, but enough to keep you interested. The movie draws you in and you feel scared with the characters, and relieved when they finally get off the island. Arguably the best in the series, I really hope they don't kill Jurassic Park with the release of the 4th movie next year. The 3rd movie lacked, and I hope the 4th is better.

No problem with that, but you can't restart the movie where you left off. The same is true if you push the stop button, you have to start the movie over and go through the menus.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1W4NIQH1XRZM8	Gerry K. Biffle	Steven Speilburg has changed us all. He's kept us out the water for nearly 30 years with JAWS, He's helped us make contact with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, He's taken us on a journey with Indiana Jones to find the ark of the covenunt with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK,he's introduced us with a friend 300 million lightyears away in E.T. and now he's brought us to a remote island and showed us the most majestic yet terrifing creatures that we could only see in fragments of our imagination with JURASSIC PARK. JURASSIC PARK is probably one of the greatest movies of all time and it's the 7th top grossing box-office hit in movie history. Dinosaurs them selves astound us. Even their fossil remainments haunt us and awe us with their great sizes and shapes of many assortments.The DVD of Jurassic Park is rather good. With over 75 minutes of behind the scene features and featurettes. But it needs some improvments. It sould have been produced under the DTS sound system rather than DOLBEY DIGITAL. DTS has clearer and crisper sound and the picture has alot more quality. So try to by the DTS standard if you can. Eitherway the dvds are the same just different quallity of sound.Now you now the story, peolple on Island, park on island, people in park, park has dinosaurs, dinosaurs get out of park, people get chased by dinosaurs, dinosaurs eat a couple of people, and the remaining people get of the island and all the dinosaurs die. Okay? But otherwise than having good visual effects, fun roller coaster plot, and good actors, JURASSIC PARK has a fonominal soundtrack. John Williams has brought us THE JAWS SAGA, STAR WARS SAGA, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, INDIANA JONES TRILOGY, SUPERMAN, JFK, E.T., and of cource the JURASSIC PARK TRILOGY. The themes have that authentic John Williams style with it's exciting and thrilling yet sailient themes. Expessualy the end when the Helicopter flies into the sun set. A slight piano conceirto fades into a majestic and most absolutly beutiful orchestra ensemble then later into the triumphent trumpet/french horn fanfare and the into a mysterious end with a deep euphonium and piano ending . The music is wounderfull and with out John William's tallent for writing motion picture scores it wouldn't have been truly JURASSIC PARK.(while your here on Amazon.com buy the sound track while your at it.)So, its got amazing special effects, fun plot, great cast, and a monumental soundtrack. This is JURASSIC PARK (hum the themes now.)	5.0	A Cinematic Mile Stone in Technology and....Imagination	2003-11-22	6	5	1

I watched it with my 12 year old daughter at night out in the backyard (DVD projector) for extra affect. We both were anxious during some of the scenes where two children and others are being chased or eaten (not the good guys or kids of course) by either a TRex or those nasty Raptors. Raptors are like the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz...you might remember them FOREVER. Pretty good graphics for that time period too. Good scary fun if your kids are old enough to sleep it off.

""Andromeda"" showed the dangers of technology getting out of control, and J Park should have done the same. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Of course, the special effects were stupendous, and that is what makes the film tolerable, but the real technological issues raised by the film are barely discussed and compeletly ignored at the end. The climax of the film is a real ""deus ex machina"" and the heroes are saved by an incredible piece of luck and not really due to their own efforts. Behind the serious issues of the story is an inappropriate humorous backdrop which really gets out of hand when a man is killed while sitting on a toilet. This is incredibly infantile, but unfortunately common in modern films which have to have vomiting, bathroom scenes and foul language. I am a fan of Richard Attenborough from the movies ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" but here he puts in a lifeless performance which reaches a nadir when he is enjoying eating ice cream and reminiscing about his earlier days, all the while his grandchildren are in great danger. Although I would not consider it a waste of time to watch this film, I think I will pass up the two sequels."	3.0	Badly Flawed, but  Still Moderately Entertaining	2002-09-17	4	1	3

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3E68QNSCABRVW	"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)..."	"This movie probably doesn't require reviewing at this point, but for the sake of continuity in reviewing movies I watch over the weekends, I feel I have to do it.  Obviously this movie needs no introduction at this point; it's already considered one of the best films Spielberg produced.  It all started with a book written by Michael Crichton, and whoever said it would make a great movie is now, clearly, a millionaire.  This is one of those things where the million dollar idea is true.  Granted the novel to movie transfer isn't a hundred percent, but few novels that go to movies are.  I've personally never read the book, but from people who have, they've told me it's not hugely inaccurate, so that's a good sign.  Granted a novel is almost always better than the movie, but I'll still watch the movies if they don't change the novel a ton.The movie was expertly executed, as the billionaire in the film is apt to say ""we've spared no expense"".  The story is based around a live zoo-like theme park where the billionaire has spent a large amount of money on research to figure out how to reconstruct dinosaur DNA so they can physically bring them back to life with what we know about genetic research already.  As you can see it's a very ambitious film.  The story is very impressive from the perspective of a ""what if"" scenario.  It's probably not all that applicable in the real world, but it certainly is a great premise for a film and it's presented in a fashion that seems like it's almost possible.  I think that fact alone makes the movie even more impressive to watch.  Also they seriously ramped up the industry of animatronics to produce this film!  Huge amounts were spent on the robotic elements to make the dinosaurs interact with the world in a very realistic fashion.  This was an ingenious move over having computer graphic dinosaurs.  I think, even by 2008's standard, CGI would do it a disservice!Basically the billionaire character, Hammond played by Richard Attenborough (famous for his documentary narrations), has a problem in opening his park, which is located on a remote island.  His investors and officials won't let him open the park to the public unless it's examined by a team of experts.  The movie is about that team's examination, sounds kind of boring from what I'm saying, but that is until something goes wrong.  The viewer is astounded by the sheer beauty of the creatures and the park throughout the entire film.  They developed special grids that are fenced off with high electricity wire... that is until the power goes out.  This is where the movie gets really exciting.My favorite character was the paleontologist Alan Grant played by Sam Niell.  I have to say, I like the characters Sam Niell typically plays and this movie was no exception, but maybe I'm slightly biased in this perspective.  Granted the third Omen wasn't anything special, but I thought Niell was really good in the film in the end!  Jeff Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm, was pretty good, but he does get a little annoying once in a while.  That's kind of his point though.  I have to admit that I still don't quite understand why a Chaos Theory Mathematician was needed to survey a park about dinosaurs.  I understand the paleontologists, but not the mathematician, it just seemed out of place to me.  Maybe it was explained in the book.  Many people will enjoy seeing some smaller characters roles show up, such as the one played by Samuel L. Jackson.  Granted he's not as bada** as he normally is in films.  Sienfeld fans will surely appreciate the appearance of Newman as the character Dennis Nedry who interacts with Sam Jackson a lot and that pairing was simply a great idea!  It made those scenes pretty funny.There were a few scenes here and there that were mentally jarring because some parts were just silly and characters probably wouldn't do that in the real world, but the point was to create a suspenseful moment or to move the story along.  So I suppose I can forgive the part where Grant tells Malcolm not to move and then Malcolm does... it made for an intense moment.Anyway, I don't want to give very much of the film away just in case someone hasn't seen it.  I know, that sounds shocking at this point, but I know people that have never seen the original Star Wars films and that just shocks me.  Either way this movie is superbly filmed and very well written.  I simply can't recommend it enough and I can't really think of someone who wouldn't enjoy the sheer adventure of this film.  So take a nice tour through Jurassic Park if you haven't seen this yet, they've spared no expense."	5.0	A movie that needs no introduction	2008-04-08	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10NSJ3UY0X0E0	Graydon G Frenzel	The remake of the classic Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park now not only 3D but also in Blu-Ray. When a group of scientist, journalists, and thriller seekers alike go on a preview tour of a unique amusement park something goes horribly wrong. The park's power grid shuts down and all control of the attractions are lost. The attractions being cloned dinosaurs. This film that almost brings dinosaurs back from extinction, is reason enough to see it again if you saw it in its original format, but accompanying this film with 3D enhancing effects makes this film a true a visual master piece. The best 3D remake I have ever seen. Now in stunning Blu-Ray quality gives this movie justice allowing the audience to view it in the manner in which it was meant to be seen. Also included are many awesome special features such as the Dinosaur Encyclopedia and Making Of. I personally love knowing more about the dinosaurs depicted in the film. Also when watching Jurassic Park the viewer envies in how much it fun would be to film with robotic dinosaurs on a tropical island, the Making Of feature allows the fan to truly understand what production was like. This film appeals to the die-hard Spielberg fans, Jurassic Park enthusiasts, and children who were not born when the film was available in theaters. This film was one of my favorite childhood movies and will always rank high on my list of greatest movies. I give Jurassic Park 3D on Blu-Ray 5/5 stars.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3S738GO35SH0W	Greg Hughes	I saw this film when it was first released six years ago. The film explores the theme of cloning. Using the DNA of an insect preserved in amber, dinosaurs have been brought back from extinction to populate a theme  park. A small group of people get a sneak preview of the theme park (called  Jurassic Park), but inevitably things go wrong, the dinosaurs are running  wild and the group are running for their lives.I remember all the hype  that came with this movie. You couldn't go anywhere without seeing a  dinosaur being used to advertise a product. Pizza Hut were giving away toy  dinosaurs with every meal etc. When I was 10 I had an interest in  dinosaurs. (I think most kids do at some stage.) I remember the frustration  of trying to convince other kids that dinosaurs wern't around at the same  time as cavemen, as it was made out in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. I got  into an argument about the pronounciation of diplodocus. It was  di-plod-ocus, not dip-lo-docus. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; brought all these  memories flooding back.The film has plenty of action, thrills and  chills, but I've heard it's a poor version of the novel. I like Sam Neill's  acting, he's been in some good movies. If you are not a  picky stickler for  logic, this film is good entertainment.	3.0	Action with teeth and claws	1999-12-10	2	1	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3P0KI3M51LI01	Gregory Masciola	"This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest adventure/sci-fi films of all time.  It was very smart of the makers to cast not ""Huge Stars, but great actors"".  The acting is great, and the musical score is great.I noticed in someone else's review that they commented that the movie is totally unrealistic because guns couldn't penetrate a dinosaur's skin.  That could be true, but I don't see how you could possibly know that, considering that dinosaur skin isn't dug up with their bones.  The skin has decomposed and is long gone, so I don't see how you could possibly know the thickness of their skin.Some think that this movie was only successful because of the great special effects, but I think you are way wrong.  The film does have great effects, and a very interesting story as well.  Also, one thing that I like about this film is that they only used the CGI dinosaurs when they needed to.  There are many scenes that use robotic dinosaurs during close-ups, and the CGI dinosaurs are mostly used when they need to show the creatures from head-to-toe, so the movie makers weren't as obsessed with the Computer effects as they are today.At first glance, this DVD may seem to have a small selection of bonus features, but don't be fooled.  In amazon's description, one feature is a ""documentary"".  But this is one of the greatest in-depth movie documentaries that I've seen.  It's not just ten minutes of cast and crew mentioning a few things about the movie, it goes into great detail about how the movie was made, how they aquired sounds and did the effects.  You will not be disapointed."	5.0	A great movie	2004-08-08	2	2	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A9YTARTKZRXL	"""greysky"""	Remember seeing early dinosaur movies? Bad animation, no plot, and terrible acting- the dinosaur movie had made an infamous name for itself in film history. However, when Jurassic Park first came out at the theaters,  the name of dinosaur movies was forever salvaged.This movie is nearly  perfect in so many aspects- unlike traditional dinosaur movies, its plot is  very deep and involved. The entire plot is what would happen if man tried  to harness the power of nature, and the tragedy and horror that could  result. When Dr. Hammond, an eccentric millionair, invites two notable  archeologists, a lawyer, and an offbeat chaos theory expert to his new  Dinosaur theme park, no one has any idea what they're in for.At first  the idea seems very nice, as the entire group, with the addition of  Hammond's grandchildren, begin to explore the park, amazed at the wonderful  creatures all around them. Things turn for the worse, though, when a  tropical storm blows in, and a gluttonous computer operator at the park  tries to steal some dinosaur embryos. In turning off the systems to disable  the alarms, the computer guy ends up turning off the power to the electric  fences that keep the dinosaurs in their pens.Bad move.The rest is now  movie history, as this brilliant and often funny thriller plays out. This  is a must have for a movie fan- Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best  films. The computer animation is revolutionary, one of the best examples of  this art in history. The plot and the acting are great too, making this an  incredibly strong and well-rounded movie.	5.0	Ultimate Dinosaur Movie	2000-06-16	3	3	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A23INOBJ1LVGNM	G. Wayne Cochran	Jurassic Park is a science fiction movie based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. It is a story about how as much as man tries to be in control of everything, life will find a way around the boundaries we try to confine it to. Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough.An incident at a biological preserve on an island off the coast of Costa Rica has prompted a review of the resort by the investors. John Hammond (Attenborough), CEO of InGen, has invited several consultants as guests for a weekend to determine the safety of the park. They include paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum). The guests are stunned to discover that the park is the home of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Hammond's grandchildren arrive to join the adults on the tour of the park. However, as a storm approaches the island, an espionage scheme is afoot to steal dinosaur embryos that results in the total failure of the security system. Its up to Dr. Grant to get Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello).Jurassic Park was an awe inspiring visual effects masterpiece when released in 1993. At that time, very few movies had computer generated characters that interacted with live actors, and none of them at that time had the level of realism seem in the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Compared to a lot of other action movies from the 1990s that relied heavily on CG effects, Jurassic Park's effects still stand up fairly well. I am interested in seeing how well it has been cleaned up for the 3-D release next year.Jurassic Park is rated PG-13 for intense science fiction terror. This movie requires a personal judgement call on whether its suitable for young children to watch. There is only a very small amount of strong language, most of which can be attributed to a then relatively unknown Samuel L. Jackson. The main scenes that you may not want your small children to see are the ones where people are killed by dinosaurs, although there are only one or two death scenes that are truly gruesome, as most of them leave the blood shed to the imagination. Basically, I'd let a nine year old watch Jurassic Park, but would be hesitant to let a five year old watch it.Just a note, this is a review of just the movie itself, and not the presentation or packaging of any specific release.	5.0	"""Welcome to Jurassic Park."""	2012-11-21	1	1	0

If no one in the world has said this before, may I be the first.Jurassic Park is one hell of a disaster. Those who made this should be eradicated from earth.  The biggest turkey in cinema history (and let us not forget the giant pelicans too), if you're buying this because of its achievements in special effects and sounds then count yourself as someone who has no clue at all what cinema is about. A film that is simply a waste of time and talent.As for Spielberg voted as the No.1 director in AFI (?)'s Best Director list, are you kidding??	1.0	Jurassic Park & Spielberg - Best Selling, Best Director??	2002-05-11	42	3	39

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A16CZRQL23NOIW	Hiram Gomez Pardo	It has been told so many times: we have withdrawn so far from Mother Nature that we tend to forget it. So, intrenched in our own modern Trojan world, we are trapped in our words `s jungle: even we dare to believe in certain imported mind terms with such strong that we use to think they exist.Jurassic Park is in last instance, the tempting Pandora `s box, the final choice and golden opportunity to recreate thanks our undeniable genetic advance, a part of the lost world in the night of the times, in our ancestral genes and the minutely investigation of scientists, investigators and Historians. Once more Michael Crichton  retook the ancient myth: to look behind , immersed in Orpheus punishment respect his wife,  Eurydice,  Lot `s woman in the Holy Scriptures and finally in Goethe `s Faust.The script is a bitter vision about the eternal and never satisfied love for the knowledge, to challenge the question: what if I ... ?  The final result was an admirable exercise of vivid and unconscious terror respect our antipodes, the recreation of a primitive world; a entry through the tunnel of the time to experience the primordial fears with its logical consequences.Perhaps the film made no use of the mythical load immersed within this post modernist tale. Maybe this punch would have been extremely profitable to achieve a striking picture where entertainment, and humor would have shaken hands with the mythical experience.A splendid cast delineates a kinetic plot with the secure and accurate vision of this unbeatable entertainment 's wizard: Steven Spielberg.	4.0	If you open Pandora 's box, then do not mourn yourself!	2005-11-25	2	1	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2PNKC1AQYIF6D	hockhamb@hotmail.com	Jurassic Park has come under many criticisms and many adulations since it's release. Main areas of upset over the movie cover everything from lack of plot, not adhering to the original book, being a Crichton movie (his  plots all generally involve the same theme - watch WestWorld) and generally  being sold on graphics rather than anyhting else.I'm not going to argue  any of these points. They are all valid, and they all have some  worth.However, I do believe that in essence, the movie is well  intentioned. The idea was to utilise computer generation graphics to bring  us dinosaurs - which it has achieved. The plot is sturdy enough to support  this original premise, and the action enables us to watch the slick work  without, on occasions, even realising the non-existance of the  creatures.If you can accept that original premise, and realise that you  are not going to get 100% accurate dinosaur behaviour (as if we could  tell...) then this movie is definitely worth a watch.	4.0	Enjoyable escapist romp	1999-05-14	0	0	0

I preordered it and it arrived the day before official release :) ***My wife and I watched it and the 3D is very well done, they clearly did full 3D mapping with curved shapes for faces and pixel infill behind things when you can now see around them. My wife found it as good as 3D gets. As an engineer with image processing background I noticed a few things like artifacts around fast moving stuff and places where (of course) things would not be in focus that were not originally in the plane of focus. I think if you don't go looking for flaws it will just be a great 3D experience, this isn't a cheap cardboard cutout change to 3D, it's the good kind.The Bluray took a while to start up and then would repeatedly get stuck showing ""downloading new attractions from BD-live""; until I turned off BD-live for the Bluray player. .... Update on BD-Live: It would seem that getting stuck at ""downloading"" was likely due to getting the disk before release.

The characters are all well-acted, the storylines are engaging, and the effects will stick in your mind for a long time to come.  You really do feel as though you're in the car trying not to be seen or heard by that horrifyingly convincing T-Rex.  The Raptors are Spielberg's finest movie creation since Jaws, and the sets, combined with a first-rate soundtrack, really makes you feel as though you're on some faraway island.	5.0	This is the peak of dinosaur adventure films	2004-11-12	1	1	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	I have a friend who thinks Steven Spielberg basically is a B-movie maker.  Actually, Spielberg takes B-movies, and transforms them into A-movies.  This is a case in point.  It is full of dazzling special effects, yet the human actors stand on their own, with performances that keep your attention.  The pacing also is excellent, with intense action broken up with character development, some philosophizing, and plenty of humor to make the suspense more effective.One thing that Spielberg effectively does is introduction of characters.  This movie is an example of this.  The first time a dinosaur is actually seen is very effective, and the same is true with the first appearance of the Tyrannosaurus.I would divide science fiction into three categories:  1) true science fiction, that is based on realistic speculation; 2) science fantasy, which is non-realistic (e.g. Star Wars); and 3) science horror, which is a horror story in a science fiction setting.  I would consider the book to be true science fiction; the movie creeps more into the science horror category.I mentioned the book, written by Michael Crichton (who also worked on the screenplay).  People who read the book first liked the book better, as is often the case with movies based on books.  I saw the movie first, and I realize that there is a difference in the two.  The purpose of the book is to show the dangers of genetic engineering, when man enters the realm of God.  While this point is not absent from the movie, the purpose of the latter was to be a money making exciting blockbuster movie, which it succeeded at.This explains some of the changes; for example, some characters that survive the book die in the movie, and vice versa.  John Hammond is more likable in the movie than he is in the book.  Some of the changes are to make the picture more enjoyable, and some are probably to keep the people who read the book guessing.One last comment.  I am a recent creationist, which means I believe dinosaurs and man co-existed.  There are people who share my beliefs that think Jurassic Park promotes evolution.  I disagree strongly.  I have no doubt that Spielberg and Crichton are evolutionists.  However, the references to evolution in the movie are not strong enough to indoctrinate anybody.  The plot for this movie would work as well from my point of view as from an evolutionary point of view.So, if you want to be well-entertained for a couple of hours, this is an excellent way to achieve that goal.	5.0	One of the best sci-fi adventure movies of all time	2006-11-24	12	9	3

My comments will focus on the DTS version of the DVD.  In short, I believe that this is a reference quality DVD.  I own over 50 DVD's, including most of those that you can use to demo your home theater (Matrix, Air Force 1, Eagles Hell Freezes Over, several Bonds, etc.), and I think I'll be using the T-Rex scene as my personal HT demo scene.  The sound is the best I've heard (I believe Jurassic Park was the first film to use DTS in theaters).  During the T-Rex attack scene, the rain and other sounds surrounding me made me feel like I was in one of the Explorers.  Hearing T-Rex approach, as the drink spits out concentric circles, was unreal on my Hsu subwoofer, with tons of low bass information.  T-Rex's roar was truly frightening, and I've seen this movie a number of times.Visually, the movie is also stunning.  The dinosaurs look as I would imagine them, and the transfer to video seems excellent.  My only (small) nit would be a momentary pause fairly early in the film when the disc is probably changing layers, but this could be a function of my player (Panasonic A120) as much as it is the disc, although my player hasn't experienced this momentary delay except once or twice before.  Overall, this is a must-own DVD for HT buffs.	5.0	Reference Quality DVD	2000-10-13	3	3	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A11KRMIA0ES88I	"James Ronald Colyer ""Jim Colyer wrote Save Th..."	Dinosaur-mania peaked with the movie based on Michael Crichton's novel. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic Era between 65 and 220 million years ago. The Mesozoic Era is divides into Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. Jurassic Park brings dinosaurs into the present by cloning them from DNA. They are kept on an island with plans of making them an attraction. They get loose. The velociraptors are fierce. T Rex goes on a rampage. I felt that not enough species were represented. Where are triceratops and stegosaurus? duckbills and ankylosaurs? The theme that man should not tamper with nature is ridiculous because the whole point of science and technology is that man can better himself by understanding and harnessing natural forces. Movie makers are negative. Both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg use dark, chaotic scenes.	4.0	Jurassic Park	2008-02-27	0	0	0

I am a big fan of the 3D format and after seeing some of my other favorite movies brought into the third dimension, I couldn't wait to see Jurassic Park and all of its dinosaur-attacking fury!  The image (on my 55&#34; LG) is crisp and clear and all the scenes I expected to be awesome in 3D totally were.  The surround sound is great as well.  As far as the movie itself goes, sure some of the science is outdated, and yes, it's kind of cheesy in places, but hey, that's what makes it great.  If you're a fan of 3D and giant man-eating dinosaurs, I highly recommend this new version!	5.0	Updated classic!	2013-05-03	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AERFWMRGA8ZML	J. A. Ritland	I will not get into the technical aspects of the making of this movie other than to say it is stunning to watch.  This is what movies should be about... entertainment, fun, action, and a pleasure to watch.  When it was first released it was a stunning visual spectacular with all of the special effects of the time that audiences had not really experienced before.  The only complaint I have about the movie is how far it strayed from the book in some instances.  The switching of the 2 children's personalities (in the book the boy was the computer geek and the girl was the follower of dinosaur history) was minor in the scheme of things, but still bothered me somewhat the first time I saw the movie.  They left out the pteradactyl's in this film even though that was a big part of the book.  I am sure there were other things, also, that I cannot recall at this time, but still overall it was a fantastic movie.  I have not seen the DVD as of yet, but I have owned the VHS for a number of years and still enjoy watching it.  I really enjoy movies where I don't have to look for a hidden meaning and just enjoy the show.	4.0	One of the best	2003-02-16	2	2	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AA1QV3V2IFE75	Jason Boodoosingh	When an ambitious but fragile capitalist decided to lease an island off the coast of Costa Rica and build an animal park there, he was totally blind of the consequences.........at least considering the type of animals he was to rear and exhibit. When the island park of dinosaurs was almost finished, he decided to invite a small group of scientists to inspect and endorse the park so that the investors' lawyer could give permittion to continue its construction. With all the security features in place, the group would not be ready for the terror that awaits them. An important worker in the park has made a previous illegal agreement with another company to smuggle some dinosaur embryos out of the island and he will accomplish it at all costs.........even if it means shutting down some of the security systems, even the fences that keep the viscious T-Rex in its paddock. The visitors are in for the night of their life.Steven Speilberg has overdone it with stunningly detailed dinosaurs and visual effects with the help of Industrial Light and Magic of California. With this DVD and a home theater system, it feels as if you're in the park with dinosaurs surrounding you. This is an excellent portrayal of Michael Crichton's best seller. The DVD also includes a 'behind the scenes' documentary for those of you who would like to know how they accomplished this masterpiece.	4.0	Entertainment Breakthrough	2002-12-31	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	"You really can't say enough about Jurassic Park. This first film was above superb! But they did horribly with the second film. I mean it made a lot of money, but did'nt make a lot of sense. The reason it held the single grossing record of a 3-day movie premiere (which WAS the record until Harry Potter came out (...), was the kids wanted to see it. Above all the third was so-so. It had great action scenes, but not a thick plot with it. However the first is original, and totally unprediactable.The film is about a rich scientist who offer a couple of paleontologist three years more research on there project if they will just come and visit his ""amusement park"". They agree and off they head for ""Jurassic Park"". They finally get landed and they find out the park had REAL dinosaurs. But the rich scientist needs the aproval of the paleontologists (played by Laura Dern & Sam Neil), and another scientist (played by Jeff Goldblum). A storm then hits Jurassic Park, and with the help of the son of the owner, the electricy gets shut off. They then realize the mistake they made, when the dinosaurs cause havoc all of the ""amusement park"".This film is one of my favorites and I think that any parent will love it as much as your kid will. This dvd is a great addition to any dvd library.DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:&#8226; Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)&#8226; Color, Closed-captioned, DTS Surround Sound, Widescreen&#8226; Production notes&#8226; Documentary&#8226; Industrial Light & Magic Dinosaur Encyclopedia&#8226; Theatrical Trailers for JP, Lost World, and JP3&#8226; Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)"	5.0	A Great Action/Adventure Film for All Ages!	2001-11-23	2	2	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3DE1IYJGU5HPW	Jason N. Mical	This review is mainly intended for people interested in buying the DVD, which most likely means you liked the movie and want a collector's version you can enjoy again and again.Do not hesitate for a minute to buy this disc.I loved Jurassic Park from the word go.  I read the novel long before the movie was even announced, hiding it in schoolbooks and finishing it in a day.  When I heard about the movie, I was everjoyed, and was not disappointed when I attended the opening.  It lived up to all of my expectations, which is saying a lot.Now, seven years later, Universal is finally offering us fans a chance to own the ultimate edition.  The dinosaurs are still amazing, the story still interesting, and I've already enjoyed this disc three times.Although there are no deleted scenes or commentaries, the DVD version is great.  The video transfer is perfect, no lines or dots, and the sound is clear and precise.  If it seems quiet to you, remember that Jurassic Park came out before action movies had really pumped-up soundtracks.  If you insist on loudness all the time, crank it up, but be prepared because the sound packs a whallop at all the right times (T-Rex roar, etc.)The extras are groovy as well.  The &quot;Making of Jurassic Park&quot; is a little 30-minute short of the kind that probably ran on HBO or Showtime, and is informative, especially about one of the movies that birthed the CGI-effects we all take for granted these days.  The &quot;dinosaur encyclopedia&quot; isn't all that informative, but has some nice pictures of the various dinos in the film.  The trailer for Jurassic Park III is a joke, it doesn't show anything, but I wasn't really expecting it to.If you want a version of this classic to enjoy for years to come, I can wholeheartedly suggest this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  Now, if only they can come up with a decent Jurassic Park themed computer game...	5.0	Outstanding Transfer of the Ultimate A-Budget B-Monster Film	2000-10-15	4	3	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A10H47FMW8NHII	"Jay B. Lane ""professional audience member"""	"Yes, it's Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic, based on Michael Crichton's exciting novel, tweaked into 3D and redistributed to scare the piddle out of a whole new generation! As for creating tension and thrills, Spielberg never misses a trick; I had to smile at all his gimmicks...even as I reacted to them. Remember, clich&eacute;s became clich&eacute;s because they WORKED!A scientist finds prehistoric DNA in mosquitoes trapped in amber; from this he has cloned dinosaurs and wants to open a theme park in a highly controlled environment so children can have first-hand lessons about the Jurassic Age. He invites a small cadre of scientists and investors to tour his Caribbean Island facility, but as they tour...Oops! they have a power outage. Excitement ensues...I'll use fairly current credits, but think back, you'll remember:* Sam Neill (""The Vow"") is Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is pro-science and anti-children. He is very interested in this pro- posed theme park, he is NOT interested in marriage or children. Born in Ireland and raised in New Zealand, Neill works all the time.* Laura Dern (""The Master"") is Dr. Ellie Sattler, a botanist who works with Dr. Grant. This scientist is interested in both children AND marriage. Daughter of Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, she is another professional who has acted all her life. She looks so young here!* Jeff Goldblum (""The Switch"" and ""Portlandia"") is Dr. Ian Malcom, who questions the wisdom of trying to override nature's method of extinction. I had forgotten what a hunk he was (and still is).* Richard Attenborough (""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"") is John Hammond, a scientist who dreams of using dinosaur DNA to create clones for a theme park. This multi-talented actor/producer/director is one of Britain's most honored professionals.* Samuel L. Jackson (""The Avengers"") is Ray, one of the tech- nicians at the theme park. Along with other achievements in his varied career, Jackson has gone on to become a mainstay of Marvel's Superhero series.* Ariana Richards (""Jurassic Park"" trilogy and lots of TV) is the terrified big sister, Lex. After decades of television work, Miss R. has a new movie, ""Battledogs,"" scheduled out this year.* Joseph Mazzello (""The Social Network"") is all grown up now, his adventurous little 1993 Tim, a distant memory. Mr. M. has managed to work a college degree into his busy schedule.* Wayne Knight (Lots of TV) is the scalawag who tries to steal prehistoric embryos from the labratory. It is his rear-view mirror that cautions ""Objects may be closer than they appear"" when he spots a T-Rex in pursuit of his jeep.Some of us today think ""Thesaurus"" is a dinosaur, so maybe we need to brush up. Remember those velociraptors hunting the children in that kitchen? For some reason, that indelible scene has stayed with me all these years. Spielberg made a memorable movie in 1993 and now, 20 years later, it's fun to visit it again. One big difference: Today's children have their bladders set for a commercial break every 10 minutes or so (Ah, television); there was an annoying stream of school children sneaking in and out during the film.It's PG-13, so expect humor, suspense, violence (dinosaurs eating each other), bits of corpses (human and otherwise, with very little blood), and everything else Spielberg can throw at you. Just remember, this was terrific in 1993 when it was in 2D, so there is really no need for the extra 3D expen$e. But it's great either way!

I have very fond memories of the raptor jumping up to the ceiling to get the little girl near the end of this movie and how the audience in the theater squealed and jumped in their seats.  There were other scenes in this movie perfect for 3D as well and I couldn't wait to get this DVD.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  This is the worst 3D movie I've ever seen.  It's like they took the normal film and sliced it into 3 parts - front - middle - back and that's it.  Drove me crazy and was hurting my eyes near the end.  If they were showing stuff from &#34;the middle&#34; the front was so blurry it hurt and likewise from other positions, but the clincher was the people!  When people were talking to each other in lots of scenes they weren't looking directly at each other at all.  You could tell the film had been split and it put everyone out of alignment.  Unbelievable!!!  I truly have not been this disappointed in any 3D movie before.  Stick to the Blu-ray version.  The 3D movie is a waste of money, time, and will send you to the eye doctor if you're not careful.  Take my advice and run from this one!

The story is established in the beginning as an employee of the dino park is not satisfied with his pay, so he sets himself up with another company who pays the employee to steal some of the dino embryos and smuggle them out of the park. To escape the island the turncoat employee played by Wayne Knight shuts down the entire park&#65533;s systems, phones, lights, computers, and the electric fences keeping the dinosaurs at bay! Which in Knight&#65533;s escape off of the island with the embryos, he meets some of the dinos he released. Meanwhile, the main characters in the story run into some escaped dinosaurs, such as the amazingly huge T-Rex and the pack hunting Raptors. As for the DVD features, they are rather original, such as the original claymation concepts for the raptors and the studio idea table with animators, all ending with a 60 minute documentary.	5.0	What else can be said?

There are two reasons for this:1.) the 3d conversion is simply stunning. The helicopter flying toward the island, the T-Rex chasing the SUV, the flock of dinos running through the field... it's better in 3d than the vast majority of movies that were filmed in native 3d, and better than every single other conversion out there bar none.2.) it always wows people, because they are so familiar with the movie in 2D that it blows their minds to see it in such an eye-popping new format.Bottom line: If you have a 3D TV, don't hesitate any longer to buy this movie.	5.0	Best 3D conversion available, and it's not even close	2014-06-01	0	0	0

I ended up seeing my favorite movie of all time. The characters were great, and ofcourse the dinosaurs were the made out of the some of the greatest most unbelievably believable special effects ever created.The T-rex, velociraptors, brachiosaurus', parasaurolophaus', the spitter, triceratops, were all amazing! The film for me is every bit as good as Spielberg's Jaws and better. It's a GRAND motion picture with terrifying creatures, aswell as pleasant creatures.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3KNGGHPT859N	"J. Gibson ""Movie Lover"""	"First, I would like to say that as far as great family adventure movies I have always LOVED Jurassic Park.  And, this past year we got a new big screen TV and decided to go 3D for the fun of it.  So, we also have purchased quite a few movies to enjoy with our grand children.  Many of the new movies have lived up to their hype and even the new Disney classics such as Lion King and Beauty and the Beast we all thoroughly loved in the 3D format.With that said... I was intrigued when I thought of Jurassic Park in 3D and I did my due diligence and read the reviews of what other customers on Amazon thought of the 3D version and they mostly were very favorable. But, frankly after watching it I feel very under impressed.  In fairness though I have to say that the movie was filmed before 3D was considered an option so when Spielberg made this movie he didn't film it to showcase 3D. I think the movie is best viewed in the format which Spielberg originally shot it in.  It's going to be a classic ground breaking fantasy adventure film.Examples of the difference between a movie made in 3D vs 2D would be shot from a different vantage point than a standard 2D movie.  3D can make images that appear to be in front of your TV screen and seem only feet away... but a film in 2D (and this is how Jurassic Park was shot) has the dinosaurs threatening the people in the movie and the people are running from them with the dinosaurs giving the people chase.  In Jurassic Park the scenes with the T-Rex for example has the T-Rex not shown in the foreground and coming right into your living room which is the whole point of a 3D movie... right?I already owned the Jurassic Park Adventure Pack of the DVD trilogy in a nice box set.  I didn't have the bluray version when I ordered the 3D bluray of Jurassic Park.  If I had known what I know now... I would have just bought the 2D version and passed on the 3D one.  Fortunately, the 3D version also comes with a 2D/ DVD & ultraviolet versions included.  The 3D is not poorly done it's just not special like the movie ""Oz the Great & Powerful"" which had 3D literally jumping right off the screen at you!  If cost is not a problem then go ahead and get the Jurassic Park with all the viewing options but if you'd like to save 5.-10. dollars then just get the Bluray/ DVD & Ultraviolet version."	3.0	I Was Expecting More... and Frankly I was left feeling dispointed.	2013-08-05	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	I can't remember looking forward to a movie more than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after having read the book umpteen times.  The movie does some justice to the book, and should have done a lot more.  The acting is adequate; the casting ranges from good to awful (I liked Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm but Sam Neill was not, and is not, Alan Grant, and Laura Dern was terrible as Ellie Sattler), and the plot changes were unneccessary and detract from the story.  There was no need to make Ellie Grant's girlfriend; there's not enough fire between them to generate any interest; and the movie tried to take P.C. too far with the children and transformed the nerdy older boy and the bratty younger girl (she was so obnoxious in the book I wanted to feed her to a raptor) into the computer whiz older sister with a whiny little brother.  If it weren't for the dinosaurs, the movie would be a washout.  But the dinosaurs save the day.  The computer effects are so breathtaking that one wants to drop the popcorn and gasp, good goshamighty, those are REAL DINOSAURS!!  The dinosaurs, in fact, have more personality than the people.  The tyrannosaurus is the tough guy on the block and the raptors are the boyz in the hood, lean mean killing machines.  I would have liked to see some more plant-eaters (a stegosaur or two would have been nice) but what there was, was terrific -- the gallimimus stampede is so real it makes you want to duck down in your seat, and there's a hilarious spot when the girl goes &quot;kitchy-koo&quot; to a brachiosaurus, and the reptile responds by saying &quot;achoo&quot; and spraying a gallon of brachioboogers into her face.  The movie's ending is far more upbeat than the book, anticipating &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot;, and the dark undertone of the book, that playing God is one of man's worst mistakes, somehow doesn't come across as strongly in the film.  But the dinosaurs are a miracle in themselves, and make the movie the ultimate fun ride it is.	4.0	The dinosaurs saved the movie	2002-04-04	4	2	2

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AGWWYBSKYQX45	"J. Newell ""wowhorse"""	JURASSIC PARK. What more can be said about this brilliantly made film? Steven Spielberg is a creative genius, and this is the movie to prove it. Paired with the musical composer John Williams, every single moment of this movie leaves a cherished memory for me! From the moving moment when the first dinosaur in the film is shown, history is changed. The awe-inspiring size and gracefulness of the Brachiosaurus leaves the visitors to the park spellbound, and movie audiences in amazement. JURASSIC PARK started a revolution of what we think of dinosaurs today. They were not huge bumbling beasts with pea-sized brains. Actually, some of the dinosaurs were quite beautiful in their own way. Some were incredibly intelligent, too. With the cunning and deadly Velociraptor, audiences were kept on the edge of their seats and wondered what could limit the animals' abilities. The biggest star of the silver screen, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is the best villain and best redeemed character of any movie. Although he ravages through the park, escaping paddocks and killing visitors, the Rex ultimately saves the characters we really care about in the end from the ravenous raptor's certain attack. The movie teaches people to respect the wild of the natural world and to not play God. &quot;Life will find a way.&quot; ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT cinematography, musical score, book adaptation, and creation of realistic dinosaurs for a hard-to-impress generation.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	Mega-blockbuster about people and the dinosaurs who eat them. Actually, it's more about the dinosaurs, which makes it ultimately a disappointment. Ironically, this movie about a theme park shares all their flaws: it's exciting, but ultimately, it's a shallow experience.Based on the effective Michael Crichton novel, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is about a group of people trapped on an island amusement park where biotechnologists have resurrected childhood's favorite scary monsters. Sam Neill is a bland paleontologist who hates kids- guess who he bonds with in the park? Well, it ain't Vegas showgirls (although that would've made for a more interesting film). Laura Dern, easily the best actor in the movie, flounders without a character to play; she mostly giggles and mumbles. Samuel L. Jackson goes to waste (literally, after the dinos eat him) and Wayne Knight pretty much plays his &quot;Seinfeld&quot; character, Newman.There's one scene in particular that illustrates the major problem with this movie. Paleobotanist Dern studies a leaf and mutters how this &quot;shouldn't be here&quot; and how it's extinct, until Neill taps her shoulder, which causes her to look up and see a giant brachiosaur for the first time. Behind her, everyone else is already reacting to the as-yet unseen brachiosaur.The only reason she's looking at a leaf in the first place is so Spielberg can build suspense by delaying the dinosaur revelation. But in order to do this, they have to give her a reason to be so fascinated- ergo, extinct plant. Enter plot hole, in the service of audience manipulation. Did the Jurassic Park engineers also clone extinct plants? Or did they just happen to find an island with extinct plant life? And if it's not important, why introduce it in the first place?  It's a manipulative trick that's shocking in its clumsiness.It's not that manipulation itself is a bad thing (Alfred Hitchcock was an admitted arch-manipulator)- it's just &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; does poorly so many of the things that makes a movie great. Think of &quot;Jaws,&quot; another Spielberg movie about a fangs; it's one taut bit of filmmaking. Not a bit of fat on the bones, not a wasted scene, even when they're not pursuing the shark.With &quot;Jaws,&quot; and Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds,&quot; you can forgive very dated effects because the people in the film are so believable and memorable, and the manipulation isn't so cynical or transparent. Despite photo-realistic dinos, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; has no more reality to it than &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean,&quot; which is referenced in one of the few intentionally funny bits of dialogue.That said, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is fun for casual viewing, and I find it remarkable Spielberg pulled it off at all while also working on &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Plus, there are two very effective set-pieces: the tyrannosaur attack on the tour cars, and the velociraptors-in-the-kitchen sequence; here, Spielberg uses his tricks to perfection. It's just a shame they're in the service of a special effects fest that's so... unspecial.	3.0	Realistic Dinos Devour Plastic People	2001-01-26	7	3	4

Imagine further that a couple of scientists get invited to look over the park before it opens. Imagine as a final step that the visitors, along with some kids, are on a tour of the park when a saboteur brings down the security systems and the giant monsters are let loose. The only thing left is the tremendous technical challenges to make all of these imaginings come to pass. Spielberg pulls it all off.It is a fight for survival when they are caught in the park when the power goes down. The only thing the people have going for them is their intelligence. Unfortunately, some of the dinosaurs are intelligent themselves. They can learn and they are hungry. They are also hacked off at being cooped up. Everyone has to run for it.The story presented in this film is interesting and fun to watch. Just as interesting and fascinating in its own right is watching these flights of fancy come to life on the screen. The dinosaur footage is worth the price of admission all by itself. It is truly miraculous. The dinosaurs are the real stars of this show. The excellent performances by all the rest of the cast are just the icing on the cake.This version of the DVD has a ""Making Of"" featurette.

There were a few things that irritated me about this.1. The preachiness of the of the ""experts"" in declaring that the park is bound to fail. That they were tampering with things they shouldn't and it would blow up in their faces. Well, sure, things blew up in their faces, but solely because Nedry shut down all the security that kept the dinosaurs locked in. There is nothing in the movie to suggest (other than the in your face sermons) that the park would have failed otherwise.2. The second, and bigger, problem I had was the fact that ALL the technical personnel are sent home on the day they are running their first trial run! Who does that?!? It wasn't even optional. They were ordered to leave. I'd imagine that if I ran a place like that, I'd ALWAYS want a support staff on hand, even when the park's closed, and most certainly when I'm sending people through it."	3.0	Dinosaurs save this	2007-08-16	5	4	1

Groundbreaking computer effects make dinosaurs frighteningly real, and once more, Spielberg knows just how to build tension, inch by gut-wrenching inch. The initial Tyrannosaurus scene is downright terrifying (particularly the first time around), along with those raptors in the kitchen. Whole cast is fine (including Samuel L.

The movie follows a pair of paleontologists, a chaotician, and some stupid kids as they are invited to come check out this sweet new island park that's about to open. The hook? This island is inhabited by living and breathing dinosaurs. Things go wrong, dinosaurs run amuck, and the main characters must escape the island without being stepped on or eaten.Enough about the story, you'll have to take my word that it's good if you haven't seen the film before. If you've already seen it, and you're hovering over this review, then you're wondering if the 3 &#34;D&#34;s are worth it. If you already own a copy of JP on blu-ray I would say pass, unless your life depends on seeing Jeff Goldblum in 3D.

The invisible hand behind the drama --- and this is a drama --- is Chaos Theory: Newest god in the scientific pantheon. Predictions of imminent collapse made by the chaotician (deftly portrayed by Jeff Goldblum) rapidly manifest in just one afternoon: ""Boy, do I hate being right all the time"".At its release, Jurassic Park was a dream-come-true for children.

You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the source of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax!Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which battered and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp on and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton salivating monster sneak up behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why chase puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians to hunt? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the ""god (dinosaur) in the machine"".I understand Spielberg was so impressed with the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been a better climax.Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?P.S.:  JP does not have many illogical scenes, but another one recently came to mind.  Of course, everyone remembers the glass of water rippling from the T-Rex's vibrating footsteps.  God knows I love monsters that can make the ground vibrate with their footsteps.  However, the T-Rex stomping around like Godzilla really does not make much sense.  Everyone knows that if a predator wishes to capture prey, it does not announce its presence until the very last second, when the prey has no chance of escape.  Any unusual noise, like STOMPING, would scare the prey away."	4.0	Deus Rex Machina and Foolish Stomping	2010-09-24	1	0	1

It's groundbreaking, entertaining, funny, scary, like Jaws genetically engineered.  Jurassic Park is one of the finest pieces of Sci-Fi ever filmed.  I remember seeing it opening day.  I was....7 or 8 years old.  And I was mesmerized by these hulking giants of 65 million years ago suddenly in the real world.  The Tyrannosaurus Rex is the definite star of this film.  She has the most kills, the most screen time of all the dinosaurs, and is just fun to watch, especially the classic scene where she saves the humans from the raptors.  This movie probably IS owned by eveyrone in America right now, and the DVD edition will make it able for future generations to experience what we all did eight years ago.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AILI5DN3IT8IX	John Treble	The technology involved in making the 1993 2D version of Jurassic Park was pushing the computational and graphics processing boundaries at that time. The results were mind-blowing and box-office busting. So now, you take those effects and transform them into 3D and you have an experience that is nothing short of stunning. The conversion not only added depth, but inserted special effects (like raindrops in the foreground) that were not in the original. And even the sound is enhanced beyond the original.I sure hope that the trilogy is converted so that a pure 3D set becomes available. Jurassic Park, in 3D, is what Steven Spielberg intended all along. What an experience!	5.0	Outstanding conversion to 3D will have you jumping out of your seat!	2013-04-24	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1KCQ1ZCSCP1KN	Jonathan Coish	Why is it that according to critics, movies and music for that matter always has to be arty and have a lot of depth? Sure, Jurassic Park might have a weak story, but who cares really? It's interesting nonetheless, and damn if it isn't exciting and amazing. I still remember the first time I watched Jurassic Park. It was in the theatre, and my goodness, I was totally blown away. The special effects in this movie are amazing, even today, and the scenes with the T-Rex and Raptors are absolutely thrilling, especially the raptor scenes. I love the scene where the two raptors are in the kitchen with the two kids. Definately my favorite scene in the movie. I can appreciate a good, critically acclaimed movie when I want to, but sometimes you just need to sit back and let yourself be thrilled, and endulge yourself in great special effects without having to worry about the symbolic meaning of this, or the meaning of that. Critics need to learn to enjoy movies like this for what they are, thrillers. You pay your 6 or 7 dollars, and for roughly two (in this case 3) hours you're brought on an exciting roller coaster ride of a movie. And really, the Jurassic Park series so far is one of the best in that category.	5.0	One of the best thrillers!!!	2001-07-19	0	0	0

But the 3D effects are largely all 5 stars in their own right. Typically the dark scenes are an issue for 3D in general and they sometimes are here too. But the oveall 3D effect was more immerseive than most 3D treatments. They did not go so much into the wow factor but just gave you a more realistic visual environment. After about 10 minutes I pretty much forgot this was 3D. I think a lot of made for 3D movies could learn this!It seemed to me that they made the 3D version warmer than the 2D or the DVD versions. People looked more tanned than pinkish. I tried a cooler setting on my TV but it only made it look blue and the flesh tones were still not what I thought they should be. Any one else see this?

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	A few movies I've seen in my short time on earth, I call them &quot;movie epics.&quot; Those that top that list are Men In Black, Titanic, and Twister. But the movie that easily surpasses those three films is the epic of all major movie epics, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park.The plot is known to almost everyone. A brilliant scientist, John Hammond, discovers a process that is able to bring dinosaurs back to life, and succeeds in doing so. He soon has a giant setup on a secluded island, where he plans to begin a sort of dinosaur park. Hammond invites a group of scientists, archeologists, and his two grandchildren to be the first ones to experience Jurassic Park, but when a scientist who works with the park screws something up, the dinosaurs are let free. And everyone must fight for their lives.Jurassic Park is the truest thrill ride you can get out of a movie. Although it takes an hour to set everything up, the second hour is when the action begins and barely lets down. The story by Michael Crichton, from beginning to end, is a well thought out and exciting story. The story was initiated very very well by director The acting is brilliant. With performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenburg, Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, Joseph Mazzello, and Ariana Richards. All performances were right on the mark. I remember being a little kid, and actually looking up to Sam Neill's characters, having a crush on Laura Dern's, and relating to Joseph Mazello's and Ariana Richard's. And the special effects. Never had, or have I been so convinced. They still seem to surpass today's standards. The dinosaurs looked so incredibly real. Whether they were CGI or animatronics. Very awesome.The DVD presentation is a mentionable one. The picture and audio  transfers are amazing. I actually found myself yelling at the T-Rex for making so much noise. There are some nice supplements. We get plenty of info on the animatronics and EFX of the movie. There's a behind the scenes deal, and a neat dino encyclopedia complete with sound effects. The menus for the dvd are neat too.Jurassic Park was absolute fun as a kid, but now, as a 17 year old, I'm able to laugh at the grown up jokes and enjoy the actual piece of cinema from the viewpoints of looking at acting and directing. Yet, I still find myself getting hyped up for any scene dealing with the T-Rex or raptors. Always will.	5.0	The Epic Movie which I Love	2002-07-28	4	1	3

It's a well written and developed action/dinosaur flick. I don't know what more you'd want! For a movie which came out 20 years ago, the special effects still look quite realistic, and I think I would rate the movie as high had it come out today then as I did when it came out two decades ago.So the five stars go toward both the streaming quality of the movie, as well the movie itself - truly one of my all time favorites.Enjoy!	5.0	Great Movie and Great Streaming Options	2013-01-13	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2TFXWU9CZ5WEQ	Judy Berman	The new theme park on a tiny island off Costa Rica contains deadly living biological attractions. Dinosaurs roam Jurassic Park. But there is much more to this film. Steven Spielberg's basic ideas are family values, illumination and flight, according to Douglas Brode, author of The Films of Steven Spielberg; and a film professor at Syracuse University. Before the park opens, one of the Velociraptors tries to escape its crate and kills one of the workers trying to contain it. The park's owner invites two scientists to his park, hoping they will endorse it so the park can open. His two grandchildren join the adults on a tour. The computer-controlled vehicles break down, the T-rex and the Velocipaptor are a no-show, and the Triceratops is ailing. A computer programmer, who hopes to steal the dinosaur embryos, deactivates most of the park's 10,000-volt electric fences. Soon, there is an uninvited guest on the tour - a Tyrannosaurus rex - and the children are in its sights. A deadly romp ensues. This film, first released in 1993, still thrills and has the in-your-face scare factor. (In my opinion, the original film is excellent. The 3D version released this month does not add anything to the original.)(review by Judy Berman)	5.0	Jurassic Park is much more than a sci-fi creature feature	2013-04-13	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1QHYYND7Q7ZOE	Justin Lowry	Stephen Spielberg brings dinosaurs to the screen in a way no one has or could before.  The special effects are fantastic.  They may be a little dated in comparison to the more recent &quot;Lost World&quot;, but as  computer generated effects (which are often done poorly in other movies),  it sports some of the best.  Never have I felt such awe at the sight of  special effects, effects that look so real that the dinosaurs can be true  characters. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; contains excellent direction and good  acting, escpecially from the children.  The movie also finds a good balance  between the suspense and the humor - and the awe.  With a  score by John  Williams, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; also has some of the greatest music of  any movie.  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is one of my favorites.	5.0	A great suspense/adventure/sci-fi movie	2000-06-29	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AFRZL05D54MPM	JWolf	This movie has adventure, science, genetics, twists, comedy, scary monsters, and a great cast. While the movie is a little old now, it was really among the first to predict some of the headway we'd make in genetic manipulation.  This movie was especially important to me because it really piqued my interest in both prehistoric history as well as genetics and world change.  For the technology available at the time, the graphics are extremely well done and believable. Viewers are made to feel as if they're actually in the movie. And no one could ever forget the raptors in the kitchen, perhaps my favorite scene.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A25TUXM2LXYXOX	"""kaijuking54"""	Admittedly, this is a spfx bonanza.  That alone warrants multiple viewings.  However, as is typical of Big Ole Hollywood, the story is severely disabled.  Either watering down or altogether trashing the darker,  more intellectual elements of the source novel, JP instead plays it safe.  Sure, it is tense, exciting and involving but, did anyone else walk out of  the theatre feeling empty?  Did anyone else feel pandered to?  As a  dinosaur enthusiast, I have to recommend this film for its spectacular  effects and its overall sense of fun and excitement.  However, anyone  seeking any depth or an exploration of thought-provoking ideas should look  elsewhere.  But, that's okay!  Nobody cares about plot anyway, right?

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	Jurassic Park rates five stars but only because that is full scale (I would award this movie 10 stars if I could)! Never have we seen anything like this fantastic film before. First off, with a great and seemingly plausible story by Michael Crichton, good casting and performances, and absolutely wonderful cutting edge CGI by ILM and the full scale creature effects of Stan Winston this movie will be very hard to ever top. The work that went into paleontology research, animal motion and design studies for the full scale dino work of Stan Winston made me feel like I now know what actual prehistoric animals look like in action.Most important was the basic story which was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. The author is reported to have discussed his cloning ideas with friends at MIT who were in agreement that the described approach seemed most plausible. I would expect the actual cloning of a mammoth to occur in our lifetime. Of course, only a Steven Spielberg and his great eye for composition, editing and direction could have pulled all the necessary talent together!  Hats off to Sam Neill and the entire cast for their great performances.  A movie experience this great only happens a couple of times in a movie goers lifetime.The documentary on the making of the film was also excellent and very informative, as well as the other extras provided on the DVD. Although many later new movies have incorporated credible dino CGI, the excellent detailmovies. This movie sets the new gold standard for state of the art CGI and full scale creature effects.	5.0	Jurassic Park - The Gold Standard!	2009-06-12	3	3	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13EUSV15UDAUG	"kennedy19 ""kennedy19"""	Spielberg creates some genuinely terrifying momnents in this popcorn thriller about dinosaurs brought back to life and running amok on an island. The film is well-paced for tension, and includes a few moments of  deadpan humor like the &quot;objects in mirror are closer than they  appear&quot; sign on a car mirror when a T. Rex is closing in from behind.  This movie is probably too scary for children.

I remember how everyone freaked out when this movie was new in theaters. I think I went to see it at least 5 times. Every time I left the theater I was practically shaking from excitement. Excluding the ever boring Jeff Goldblum this film has amazing acting. The soundtrack is also one of the most famous movie scores of all time. The scenery, action and drama are all incredible as well. This movie is a legend. I know I'm preaching to the choir, but if you haven't seen Jurassic Park, then you need to as soon as possible.	5.0	A movie legend.	2012-11-14	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NVN6RBBBQ0JQ	Kevin Pazyck	I got the DVD hoping the movie would still be fresh after all the years of not seeing it. Its theater release was amazingly successful. You know why? It is a Spielberg production to a Michael Crichton novel that is treated with respect. This is not trash that is all too prevalent in cinema today. This is a movie for all to enjoy, except for those who try to find something wrong purposely.The cast is great. Sir Richard Attenborough has been in acting for quite a while and is perfect as Hammond, the tragic millionaire who's honest intentions prove disastorous (even if it's not totally his fault). Sam Neill and Laura Dern are totally believable as scientists who find themselves coming to grips with the revelations about their work and why their way of life could be jeopardized. Jeff Goldblum is immersive as the 'mathmetician' who argues the moralities and possible repercussions of the park. Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson support an already stellar cast.Aside from the great performances, the story is really what makes the movie work. Michael Crichton sparked a timeless screenplay. You just have to assume that the innovative and ground-breaking visual effects at that time can hold an audience only for so long. The audience has to care about who's on screen as well as what is. It's a classic and merits its longevity. Oh...the DVD's transfer is great and sound is theater-quality perfect. The DVD extras are above normal fare. However, the whole package is a steal for basically an average priced DVD. I rank this as a must-have for collectors everywhere.	5.0	&quot;Hold on to your butts&quot;	2004-03-03	46	34	12
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	This is the DVD you bought your Dolby Digital or DTS sound system for.  Though primarily famous for its visual effects, this film has a highly active and creative surround soundtrack that should give your 5.1 speakers the most workout they ever got.  Compared to the old laserdisc's Dolby Prologic sound, the DD 5.1 sound (I haven't heard the DTS version) has much clearer and louder dialogs, much stronger and richer surround effects, and much better integration of dialogs, effects, and music, so they sound more cohesive to, and yet distinctive from, one another.  The sound effects span the entire frequency spectrum, from the deep bass of a triceratops' groaning, the earth-shaking tremble of a T-Rex's footsteps, to the shrill cries of a velociraptor. This is one DVD that really takes advantage of the newer sound formats.The picture quality has nothing to complain about except the flesh tone on John Hammond looks a little too red at times, which was something I didn't see on the laserdisc.  There are only 20 chapter stops on the DVD, compared to 47 on the laserdisc.  The PCFriendly software that comes with the DVD appears to be an updated version, but it still causes frequent crashes to my PC.  Exclusive DVD-ROM features are nothing but web links, wallpapers, screensavers, and such; they are for Windows PCs only, but Mac users won't miss them.The supplements on the DVD are good, but not great.  The '95 documentary &quot;The Making of Jurassic&quot; has been aired on TV countless times, but it does provide a nice recounting of how the visual effects got made.  The &quot;dinosaur encyclopedia&quot; includes only info on the dinosaurs that appear in the film, and some info is not accurate, such as the unproven claim that a dilophosaurus could spew venom.  The &quot;go-motion&quot; film clip of the &quot;kitchen attack&quot; scene done by Phil Tippett is very nice, and I wish more such clips were included.  (Although Tippett's clay model work was later replaced with computer graphics to his dismay, the clip shows that he contributed much to the scenes' visual style.)  There are camcorder video segments of a Spielberg-Winston pre-production meeting and a location-scouting session; both are noteworthy but superficial.  In a way-too-brief video segment called &quot;Foley Artists&quot;, a few sound artists demonstrate how certain sounds are recorded.  The best supplements, in my opinion, are the storyboard sequences of 5 dinosaur attack scenes, including 2 that were omitted from the film.  Storyboards are an excellent way to show how key shots were constructed and got translated into the finished film.  Other supplements include the usual production stills, cast &amp; crew bios, production notes.  There is no shooting script, no outtakes, no film clips of deleted scenes, no director's commentary.  Perhaps the biggest regret is there is not one word about DTS or Dolby Digital (in fact, the topic is rarely mentioned on any DVD).  It would be nice to mention at least what they do and what their advantages are, especially on a disc where DTS and DD are put to such good use.The Jurassic Park DVD is sold in 3 versions: Widescreen/Dolby Digtal, Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital, and Widescreen/DTS, but no Pan &amp; Scan/DTS. There is also a 2-pack edition that includes The Jurassic Park DVD and The Lost World DVD, and it comes in Widescreen/Dolby Digtal and Pan &amp; Scan/Dolby Digital versions, but no DTS version.  So make sure you order (and receive) the right copy.	4.0	Great sound, mediocre DVD	2000-10-16	5	4	1
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"Perhaps one of the best films ever to grace a big screen, ""Jurassic Park"" is a suspenseful thrill ride that I never tire of watching.  It's hard to believe that this film came out over a decade ago and yet the advances it made in special effects are still influencing films today.  I won't waste much time on describing the plot because just about everyone already knows what happens.  For those not so inclined, here's a brief run-through:  Scientist screws with dino-DNA, clones a few of the beasts for an amusement park/zoo, needs legal and scientific approval, Newman steals information and shuts the entire park down, people begin to die, the surviviors attempt to escape.Now that you have an idea of what is going on, just know that this is one of the most suspenseful films made in the last twenty years.  It features a wonderful cast headed up by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.  Richard Attenborough turns in a wonderful performance as the park's visionary creator and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello play his very eager grandchildren.  In fact, Mazzello almost steals the show with his constant bickering over the facts in Dr. Grant's (Neill) book on dinosaurs being related to birds.Since its creation, I have yet to see a film influence movie-making as much as this one did.  The special effects are almost flawless.  The action is thrilling and suspenseful and the sound is amazing.  Even the cinematography provides some stunning visuals for the viewer.  Speilberg outdid himself with this one.If you purchase only one film from the nineties, this is the one to buy.  It was followed by two sequels, the horrible ""The Lost World"" and the popcorn friendly ""Jurassic Park III,"" but both pale in comparison to this original classic.Highly recommended to ALL fans of cinema.  I don't care if you're a lover of Westerns, Comedies, Sci-Fi, etc.  This one film is one of the best of all time."	5.0	"""Objects In Mirror......,"" You Know The Rest"	2005-12-16	11	8	3
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	"Jurassic Park is good entertainment, but take most of the ""science"" it presents with a grain of salt.Innovative in its presentation of realistic looking dinosaurs, Jurassic Park is the name of a new dinosaur-based theme park that is sabotaged while a few scientists and kids are on a pre-opening tour. It becomes an adventure to see who will escape alive.Mostly good acting by Laura Dern and Sam Neill as dino experts, Jeff Goldblum as the chaos theory mathematician, and Richard Attenborough as the park designer. The kids, played competently by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello had some of the best lines.All the characters seem to think the idea of cloning dinosaurs is a good idea except Goldblum who wonders if we should do what we (in the movie) apparently can do.An entertaining adventure, but no big concept. Not quite the same level as Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Jaws. The movie is best when there are dinosaurs on screen.The only nit-picks include wondering why Jeff Goldblum wears black leather to the tropics, and why a pre-teen girl can save the day on a complex computer (again - see S1m0ne) with her knowledge of UNIX.DVD has wide-screen movie, a behind the scenes documentary, and a few other minimal goodies."	4.0	"""This is a UNIX system.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park is up there with the all-time greats. Taken from Michael Crichton's thrilling novel, Jurassic Park is one of the most entertaining and exciting films ever made. The special effects are from FX maestro Stan Winston, who did the special effects for Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 (1991). The seamless combination of CGI and robotic creatures creates some truly terrifying action set- pieces.Despite what some critics thought when the film was released, I feel that all the principal actors give good performances, especially Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm. But admittedly, the special effects are the main attraction, and Winston's dinosaurs (which won him another Oscar after Terminator 2) are truly frightening. Great entertainment.The film's transfer onto DVD is first- rate, with superb picture and sound. The special features are exceptional, with a 50 minute 'making of' of the film and trailers for Jurassic Park, the Lost World and the teaser for Jurassic Park 3. Most interesting, however, is the footage of early pre-production meetings with Spielberg and the FX team discussing how certain shots and effects should be done. Also, there's a Phil Tippett animatic &quot;Raptors in the Kitchen&quot;, showing how claymation assists the director in visualising the shots and camera angles. Also there are storyboards, production photos and web links. A 5 star film, 5 star extras. Excellent entertainment.	5.0	One of my all-time favourite movies	2002-09-07	2	2	0

The family watched this with our Epson3010  3d projector and Sony 7.1 amplifier and was totally blown away. Yes there are age-related limitations of the material, but by far and wide its looks nearly brand new. The 3d depth effect is evident through most of the movie, and pop-out effects are used for some fun 'gotcha' moments with the critters. The soundscape is beautifully used and the 7.1 environment really immerses you into the sounds of the island. I won't go into 'banding', 'crosstalk', 'color reproduction' issues because I feel that many reviews on these topics often involve users of equipment most of us can't afford and there's no guarantee that its been properly configured either.	5.0	The way it should be seen!!!	2013-07-07	0	0	0

I adore dinosaurus, and this film portrays them greatly, although of course there are faults, the Velociraptors in here are portrayed much larger than their actual real size(6ft long, 3ft tall, and around 40 to 60lbs)Speilberg made them larger to make them look more impressive, mission accomplished I have to say. This movie starts out with a very ominous filling to it and ends with a great scene(my favorite part of the whole film). Sam Neil(Alan Grant)is a fantastic actor and did great. Richard Attenbourough(forgive my spelling) once again shows off his fantastic acting skills here. However it's the dinosaurs who really steal the show, and if you haven't seen it you will be awe struck with the majesty and power in which Speilberg portrays these awesome creatures. For me however the King of the Dinosaurs really stole the show. Tyrannosaurus Rex has always been and will always be my favorite dinosaur of all time. The power in which he brings to the screen is incredible, his awesome power and massive presence is astounding. The Velociraptors are what really brings the fear to the movie, this is a movie however that can only be expierienced by viewing it for your self. The ending remains my favorite part to this day and I never get tired of it. Seeing you favorite dinosaur you love so much truly makes your stomach tingle and fills you with a great amount of pride. Leaving you thinking to yourself(thats my boy their),(laughs), I know thats what I was thinking when the big T came on screen. Truly a great film.	5.0	WELCOME, TO JURASSIC PARK	2004-12-31	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A12OTDIWIG841L	Leslie Thompson	"I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. ""Life finds a way...""(In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and ""random"" --unpredictable-- events result from the ""normal"" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, ""survive,"" in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex (""I prefer to be called a hacker"") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice."	5.0	"""ha ha ha, you didn't say the magic word, ha ha ha..."""	2006-08-24	4	2	2

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A20GVJZ021BLSN	littletexas	This is absolutely, without a doubt, the most beautiful cover art ever released for Jurassic Park, and I own EVERY edition ever released. I was blown away by how beautiful this was upon opening my box. It's absolutely stunning. That being said, when I opened it up and saw the generic black for Blu-Ray and red for DVD I was very disappointed. They missed the mark for what could have been some beautiful art for the disks as well. These are just the generic ones that have been thrown in different packaging of the last 3 releases. VERY disappointed by that, and the background behind the disks is just the unpainted tin. That isn't enough to make this review drop any stars because of how truly breathtaking the cover is to any die hard fan like myself, but those changes could have taken this to a completely unparalleled level.	5.0	Jurassic Park Steelbook	2014-05-07	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	There are several ways to critique this movie, each of which would lead you to a different conclusion.  It can be critiqued as a story, which is a bit weak.  It can be critiqued on development of the characters, which is even weaker.  Or it can be critiqued on the basis of being a special effects thrill ride, which is exactly what it is.This movie was based on the Michael Crichton book, which has a much better story and character development than the movie.  However, the book is also much longer and while better in the story development, it is unable to compete with the adrenaline rush you get by seeing what appears to be a full-sized tyrannosaurus rex chasing after a jeep, giant jaws and sharp teeth gnashing inches from a passenger.  The special effects in this movie make it the equivalent of a ride at Universal Studios.The plot device is that John Hammond has been collecting the blood from mosquitoes entombed in amber, and using the DNA from that blood to create dinosaurs.  His goal is to put those dinosaurs into an animal park where people can visit for goodly sums of money.  Of course, just because you can do something, should you, a question asked by character Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).  As it turns out, greed on the part of one of the characters helps in the escape of the critters, including the highly intelligent, carnivorous and agile raptors.  While the raptors are somewhat larger than raptors as we know them from paleontology, they are fearsome and scary and designed to give anyone nightmares.What ensues is a non-stop chase as the perpetually hungry dinosaurs attempt to make a meal of the humans, and the humans do their best to avoid becoming a meal and trying to get off the island.  While the plot has a few weaknesses in spots, ignore them.  This movie is about the special effects and the chase.  Avoid analyzing the events and allow the dinosaurs to be scary.  Plug this DVD into your home theater system and crank up the bass to get the full effect of a running dinosaurs.This movie is great entertainment.  It is a thrill ride and you do not examine thrill rides too deeply; you just experience them.

The movie was phenomenal. When I saw it in the theatre, I was amazed at how real the dinosaurs were. They were real looking and life-like and right in front of me on the screen.The energy of the film was adventurous and who can forget Jeff Goldblums best line ""at least when the ride breaks down the Prates don't eat the guests..."". Sam Neil and Laura Dern were superbly cast in this film. The kids were charming and right on the money with their reactions.Visually the film is eye candy. The mechanical effects of the creatures and the digital effects of some of the long shots made my mouth drop. The story is again simple but the plot is very obvious. Even Sir Richard Attenburough gives a stellar performance.The DVD is filled with behind the scenes footage of the film and its production. The interviews with Spielberg, the cast and crew are very interesting.

Hopefully, you've seen it by now and if you haven't you must. This techno-savvy thriller from Steven Speilberg doesn't follow its source novel to the letter, but it's just as fun to watch this movie as it is to read the (very good) book. It's about a theme park gone horribly wrong. The test tourists exploring the dinosaur park soon become dino fodder for the main attractions. This is an immensely fun movie, and is just as deserving to be called a classic as Speilberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; The special effects are still incredible. That scene with the brontosaurus still sends chills down my back. It looks so real! There are plenty of mistakes in this movie, but they're mostly continuity stuff or little things. All the important stuff they got right. Speilberg is a master behind the camera, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; proves why. This is a must-see.	5.0	A special-effects classic...	2003-05-01	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	"Please note that this is on the movie which I saw on HBO a few days ago, not on the DVD transfer, so I can't speak to the quality of that.I would like to make a few comments on the video and animation, though. I just saw the movie again for the first time since it came out, and I have to say it still holds up very well from the standpoint of the special effects and animation. Certainly, the CGI effects are better today, but for the time this was state of the art.The dinosaurs are realistically rendered, and movement is very fluid and realistic also. One difference between then and now is that high level optical effects still weren't very highly developed, such as the ability to render certain kinds of reflections, such as those involving chromatic aberration and specular highlights, and the ray-tracing programs were not as technically capable. But overall this is still an impressive movie from the standpoint of the special effects.The dinosaurs were seamlessly inserted into the Jurassic backgrounds with the humans, and the movie benefited from the revolution in dinosaur theory that began back in the 70s with the new ideas about dinosaurs being much more agile and faster and possibly even warm blooded. The paleontologist, played by Sam Neill, even suggests that they had the ability to communicate through calls like birds and mammals. Today, it is thought that mammals like foxes, not just primates, have as many as 50 distinct calls.As to the other things like the acting, it was fine but let's face it, the dinosaurs were the real stars here and I think they upstaged the more advanced mammals in the flick, and my vote goes to them for their performance. :-)  But I have always liked actor Sam Neill and this might be his most famous role as the enthusiastic and intrepid dinosaur expert. And Mr. Attenborough is always good in whatever he does.Overall still a great adventure classic that still holds up well today.By the way, if you like animated flicks, I have to put in a plug here for the movie, ""The Battle for Terra."" It's an independently produced fully animated movie that didn't receive wide distribution, since it was done by Hollywood outsiders. But it's a beautiful and visually appealing movie about a war between a peaceful race and warlike humans who attack their planet. If you compare it with say, ""Titan A.E."" from almost ten years ago, you can see how much the animation technology has changed in that time. ""Titan A.E.,"" although great for its time, looked more like an animated cartoon. This movie looks like they're shooting actual 3D models, the figures and sets are so realistic and lifelike. It's a totally different world, literally.Even technically difficult lighting effects such as simple and complex reflection and refraction such as specular highlights are rendered realistically, which many world-class painters have trouble rendering (Vermeer and van Eyck are two of the greats who could do this well). As if this wasn't enough, at the very end of the movie, amazingly, some erudite visual jokester inserted chromatic distortions that look like the internal reflections typical of compound optical lenses, which various high-tech optical coatings are designed to minimize, as if the movie was shot with a real film camera. Too funny.So if you're into CGI stuff I can recommend this movie also."	5.0	Still holds up	2009-10-31	1	1	0

As usual, Amazon provided not only the DVD, but great service.  Watched it the minute I got it, even though I've seen the movie many times.  I've always loved the subject of dinosaurs -- since I was 9 years old and visited the Museum of Natural History in New York.  Now, this movie isn't a scientific documentary, but it's Spielberg -- anything by him is fun to watch.  The animatronics are so real -- I'm glad I didn't see this as a very young kid, or it would have scared me to death.  But now, it's big fun -- great characters -- the whole ball of wax.

Even the book, by Michael Crichton,  was written after the first movie in order to have the storyline for this  follow up. The story is a little weak but the special effects are almost as  good as in Jurassic Park (due to, I think, the much less time they had to  prepare this, compared to the first). For those who have seen J.P. and have  big expectations for these movie, hold on a little bit and yo&uacute;'ll enjoy it  very much.

This is one of just a handful of movies that are better than the book.  There are a few small facts that are changed a bit and some things are left out but it has a much nicer &#34;flow&#34; than the book.  I highly recommend this to anyone who, like me, loves movies that are exciting and stimulating for adults but don't contain silly sex scenes or unnecessary gore to keep them interested.  This movie is appropriate for anyone, from pre-teens to adult.  If your children are not desensitized by incessant TV watching and movies that are out of their range of comprehension and are possibly prone to being scared, wait until they are a bit older.  There are some pretty scary scenes in this movie and they are very realistic.  Give your little kids a break and watch something a lot milder with them, to keep their young minds innocent.  Older kids will get enough of a fright to keep it interesting but are probably not going to have nightmares because of it.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has come up with the most incredible idea for a theme park yet.  He has found a way to clone dinosaurs.  He's thought of all the controls to keep the population in check and the dangerous ones under control.Unfortunately, his investors aren't sure that the park is safe.  So, before he can open it, he has to bring in dinosaur experts Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler (Sam Neill and Laura Dern) and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to sign off on the park.The three are admittedly impressed by what they see, especially Alan and Ellie.  But the wonder soon turns to horror when security goes down, freeing the creatures.  Suddenly, the group finds themselves stranded on an island in a storm fighting to survive these creatures from the past.  Will any of them make it off the island alive?This movie was one of the first to use computer effects, and it revolutionized the industry.  Frankly, these effects still hold up even today.  You'll really believe that these people are interacting with the dinosaurs.The biggest weakness is the story.  It starts out very slowly while the science is explained.  There's lots of talking in the first hour.  Once the dinosaurs get loose, the movie kicks into high gear and becomes an edge of your seat thrill ride.  It doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, I still get knots in my stomach during most of these scenes.  Unfortunately, the climax is again weaker then it could have been.I have never understood why this movie was marketed at kids with fast food tie-ins and action figures.  This isn't a kid's film.  It's downright scary for at least half the length.Despite the weaknesses in the story, this is still a well deserved classic.  If you haven't seen it, you're in for a heart pumping thrill ride.	4.0	"""Remind Me to Thank John for a Lovely Weekend"""	2007-08-02	1	0	1

There are some mild spoilers in the following review:My sister-in-law woke from a dream suddenly a few years ago, startling my brother awake as well.""What is it, honey""? My brother asked.""I just dreamed that the ending of Jurassic Park made sense.""We all shared a good laugh when they shared that story.  An absolutely fantastic dinosaurs-gone-wild story reached the climax of the story.... and I guess no one could figure out an ending that would satisfy Hollywood Producers and make sense as well.Sam Neill and Laura Dern play dinosaur experts who are hired to give their impressions of Richard Attenborough's new amusement park: Jurassic Park, where dinosaur DNA extracted from fossilized pre-historic mosquitos is used to clone a forest full of very impressively real-looking dinosaurs.The scene where Neill and Dern first come upon a scene from millions of years ago enacted before their very eyes captures us with it's awesome dino display.  Later, we get a world-class set piece with a terrifying attack by a T. Rex on a car holding two of Sir Richard's grand-children.The rest of the film is pretty standard ""oh no! let's run!"" kind of stuff.The final scenes build a decent amount of tension, but rather than coming up with an intelligent, or at least believable, resolution, we instead have a 20 foot tall deux ex machina dropped right into the middle of the climax. Didn't Speilberg go to great lengths to show us that when the T. Rex was stomping along the ground shook - even from pretty far away?  Can someone please explain to me the logic that this critter could sneak into that last scene, INSIDE A BUILDING, without anyone - even the raptors - noticing?"	3.0	5 Star Special Effects - 1 Star ending.	2005-05-08	9	4	5

I say that not just because I'm a dino-fan.The thing that makes JP the most special is that fact that Steven Spielberg Originaly was going to use robotics for the entire film. They moved pretty well for robots, but even Spielberg himself stated that they were ""too jerky"". Then, he was shown the power of the computer. He saw a computer-animated scene of a T-rex chasing some gallimimus. The movements were so smooth, so real, he decided that computers were the thing to use.JP simply blows you away with the special-effects. Especially the scene where the T-rex catches a gallimimus. It's incredible the technology we have.After seeing Jurassic Park (for the 900th time) I can say with confidence that it is the best movie ever.

The movie shares the same concept and characters but more scenes were added to the film and some scenes deleted. But the film's plot smoothes as easy as [poop] through a goose. Alan Grant is played by the great Sam Neill, Ellie Sattler is played Laura Dern, Richard Attenburg plays the owner of Jurassic Park, and Ian Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum. An original storyline got many butts into the seats of the theater which got Speilberg's film to be his highest grossing film to date(not counting the re-release of E.T.'s money in theaters). Critically acclaimed by critics and people who have seen this great film. This film is a work of Speilburgian genius in his earlier films such as E.T. and Gremlins. The next sequel was horribly bad and the next one was A-OK and the forth in the series has been green-lighted by Universal Studios which means more menacing dinosaurs on the loose.	5.0	One of the classic films ever made!	2002-08-12	3	1	2

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	If you haven't seen Jurrasic Park yet you really need to crawl out from the rock you've been under for the last decade.Off the coast of Costa Rica a wealthy business man is creating the theme park of all theme parks. He is secretly cloning dinosaurs and will soon feature them in this park. Before Hammond(Richard Attenborough) can open his park he must get it sponsored by the tops in the dinosaur and science fields. Alan Grant(Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler(Laura Dern) Ian Malcom(Jeff Goldblum) and Hammonds two grandchildren are brought to experience the park. After a storm and some suspected sabotage the movie turns into a race to get out of the Park alive.Steven Spielberg has made a cinematic masterpiece with this movie. I can remember being nine years old and just being awe inspired by this movie. The Dinosaurs look fantastic. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job creating the prehistoric creatures. They really are breat defeying throughout the movie. The movie is shot so well. Spielberg is a master story teller and he sets everything up well. The movie uses so many things to make it good. There is action, suspense, comedey, and just enough seriousness to make you think.Jeff Goldblum as Ian Macolm to me had the best performance of all the actors in the film. Very few people in Hollywood can reach the level of weirdness that Goldblum can achieve on screen and he has another one of a kind performance in Jurrassic Park.All the other actors are solid all the way across. It'a a fantastic cast. It's solid all the way around with stars like Neil, Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, and Goldblum. Goldblum has the best performance, but the others don't disappoint.The music is great in Jurrasic Park. Once again John Williams has shown us why he's the man in one of the best movies ever scored. If you like to see why Williams is the best just watch the movie and see how his score makes the movie so much better.This is a fantastic movie. At one time it was the most successful movie in box office history and it's easy to see why. It's a fun movie. It doesn't insult the hit book it was made from. It raises questions on whether cloning should be legal. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all.	5.0	One of the best ever	2004-04-12	2	2	0

The acting is superb and is filled with great action and some hilarious dialogue.  The only flaw with the dvd is the disappointments: 1. The Jurassic Park 3 Preview is nothing.  No actual shots of the movie.  It is basically just telling you that there is actually a JP3 which several people already know.  2. No deleted scenes.  This is one of my favorite features in all dvds and I would have loved to see some deleted scenes because I know there were some.  For example, when the movie was released in theaters, there was a scene where Ellie (Laura Dern) picked a leaf from a bush while driving in the beach.  That scene had a great shot to it, but they left it out when they switched the movie over to video.  Why?  Other than those 2 reasons, the dvd is a great buy, and I totally recommend it.	4.0	5 Star Movie With Only 4 Star Features	2001-05-31	0	0	0

There's also many scenes that have objects that pop out of the screen and into your living room.But no blockbuster such as this is complete without blockbuster sound and the DTS 7.1 soundtrack is unbelievable.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1LIH906YS1K03	M	Among the criticisms brought to Jurassic Park over the years, the most prominent one seems to be the complete lack of any artistic value and the complete reliance of the movie on special effects. Having viewed the movie a great number of times, I feel compelled to argue against this point of view. True, the dinosaurs do steal the show, but the value of the other elements is almost as evident and praiseworthy. First of all, Michael Crichton and David Koepp's script does magic in limiting the book (which is significantly longer) to an hour and a half of footage that maintains a convincing story line. Secondly, the suspense of the developing plot opens the way for a series of fast-paced action scenes that live up to the movie's thriller nature. Thirdly, extraordinary camerawork, overall construction of the set and creation of a truly breathtaking atmosphere contribute to a re-creating of the past in the present with astounding results. And finally, great performances by Sam Neill (who is perfect as a conventional scientist whose views are shaken), Richard Attenborough (in a triumphant return to the big screen as a genetics tycoon whose dreams end up shattered by disater), and especially an unforgettable Jeff Goldblum (as a sarcastical, good-natured, and foreseeing mathematician who seems to be a prophet for the park's fate). The groundbreaking technological achievments resulted in an almost revolutionary interest in the film.It is this immense success that makes Jurassic Park one of the great movies of the 1990s and one to be viewed by generations to come.	4.0	An unlikely classic	2001-08-11	2	1	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	If you go back in time to 1993 and remember the awe you felt when you first saw the spectacular effects that brought us real-looking dinosaurs, you can see why JURASSIC PARK remains a marvelous film.  Although CGI has come a long way since then, you can't deny the wonder of seeing those larger than life creatures come to life in Spielberg's classic fashion.  While the storyline isn't as strong as some of Spielberg's other movies, it's still a terrific roller coaster ride of stunning action and terror scenes; once the dinosaurs get out, the fun doesn't stop.  The T-Rex attack on the cars and on the lawyer in the john; the raptors in the kitchen; the cute little somethingsaur that spits acid onto Wayne Knight's face; the grandeur of the larger brontosauruses or whatever (I'm not a dinosaur connosaur!!).  They're all still as much fun as when I saw this one thirteen years ago.  What makes the movie work so well is Spielberg's patented gift of looking at the world through child's eyes, seeing the wonder of the dinosaurs and not realizing just what the results would be.  The movie has a great cast:  Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Knight, and an early role for Samuel L. Jackson, but it's the dinosaurs who own and motivate this film.	5.0	IT'S THAT DINOSAUR MOVIE	2006-02-05	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2JU4FUSW1PBEC	Michael Pappalardo	When a rich entrapreneur finances a bold experiment, and succeeds in the cloning of Dinosaurs, he needs the authorization of a few experts and critics to ok his new attraction after a fatal accident occurs.  However, during the tour, a Tropical Storm hits the secluded island of Isla Nublar, and all hell breaks loose....and that pretty much sums up one of the greatest movies ever to grace the silver screen.  It was only a matter of time before the release of the Special Edition DVD.Usually when you see the words 'Special Edition' you can look forward to Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and behind the scenes documentaries.  Well, unfortunately, there really isn't much anything 'special' about this.  Don't get me wrong, the quality of the movie is outstanding.  I have never seen the movie in such great sound and picture quality before.  There are a few 'making of' documentaries and other related things. There are also a few trailers.  However, there is some footage that is still missing from the movie, footage that was NOT cut in the theatrical release, but was cut in the transition to home video.  Now on DVD you would expect some of these scenes back.  That is not the case. There really isnt much making the DVD 'special' other than its incredibly high quality and behind the scenes documentaries.  There are also some fun facts about the Dinosaurs on the island, but it still feels like there could have been more.  All in all, a very good DVD, a must own for fans of the movie.	4.0	Great movie, but DVD falls short of expectations	2001-06-24	88	66	22

I love this movie.  I love dinosaurs.  Ever since 1st grade(I'm almost 34 now)I've loved these beasties.  The whole Jurassic Park Trilogy (and how long will it simply remain a trilogy?!?)are simply great, sit-down, grab a bucket of popcorn, eye-candy movies.  Plot?  They have some, but if you want plot, watch Shindler's List, or Gone with the Wind.  This is dinosaurs running wild, and what's wrong with that?

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic.  For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real.  Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell.  The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other.  He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago.  He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters.  To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.For those who have a decent home theater, I would urge you to watch this on a Blu ray disc.  It is only available as of this writing as part of the ""Ultimate Collection.""  It will give the dinosaur's roar and foot stomps the proper treatment, not to mention a beautiful picture."	5.0	Action adventure as good as it gets	2012-04-24	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1QVFHPY8418HC	monkuboy	This is a movie I especially wanted on Blu Ray because of the picture and sound. I waited for the individual titles to be released instead of paying for the 3-movie pack since the 2nd and 3rd movies are terrible. The Blu-Ray version does not disappoint in terms of the picture and sound - both are excellent.  The video is vivid, with beautiful colors and details. The audio is maybe a little bit less excellent because the dialog is too low in a few places. Given the age of the film, however (doesn't seem like it was that long ago but I guess it was), it is very good. The surround effects put you right in the middle of the action and the low frequencies will shake your house if you have a decent subwoofer.The story itself - nowhere near as good as Michael Crichton's book but then you can't expect it to be. The book was much more detailed. I did find that parts of the story were implausible. Yes, I know a dinosaur park is implausible to begin with, but what I meant were some of the things that happened in the story did not seem very realistic in common sense terms (such as the appalling lack of security for the park). I know the idea is to tell an exciting story so I figure they have to have things that don't really make sense.Also.. I had forgotten just how annoying those two kids were, especially the girl. I found myself wishing the dinosaurs would eat them both.  I had to laugh at how villainous Newman was in this movie. I don't remember his real name but he'll always be Newman to me. He might as well have been Newman here, too.	4.0	blu ray quality is good	2013-03-29	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ	"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003"""	In 1993, the year that Steven Spielberg received the Best Director Oscar for Schindler's List, Steven Speilberg made another classic that would goon to have two more sequels: Jurassic Park.  Jurrasic Park is a great thriller about several scientists who find D.N.A and use it to create dinosaurs.  They invite several doctors, physicians, etc. to test them out but when the dinosaurs break out, the humans will become their prey.  And as one by one the people are swallowed and torn to pieces, the remaining must find a way to get out...before they get eaten.  Jurassic Park has amazing special effects and an all star cast including Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Samuel L. Jackson.  It's not very bloody and basically anyone over the age of 10 can watch it.  It's defintetely a classic and is much better than its two sequels.  I recommend it highly.	4.0	A satisfying thriller directed by Steven Spielberg	2002-08-29	1	0	1
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2CZGWJNKCKJDY	MovieLover	Jurassic Park remains at #2 of my top five favorite films of all time. Everything about it is just amazing and magical.Acting:The whole cast did an amazing job, but in particular, Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards, Sam Neill and Laura Dern did the best and gave their 100%. Jeff Goldblum, Samuel L. Jackson, Richard Attenborough and Bob Peck also did magnifacent jobs at acting in their roles. The cast also fit their roles perfectly!Direction: You would expect the direction of a movie thats directed by Steven Spielberg to be creative and original and well...it is, the direction of Spielberg adds originality as well as tension and chills to the already magical and thrilling as well as frightning scenes.CGI/Anamotronics: The animatronics and CGI were just, whats the word?...AMAZING! I would say Jurassic Park and it's first seqeul have the best CGI/Ani to date, the dinosaurs are just so realistic and look so real that you wish you were inside this theme park ride.This film contians some of the most memorable scenes of all time which include SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER: When Tim and Lex Murphy(Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) are trapped in the kitchen and are being stalked by Velociraptors, the scene is ultimatley chilling as well as magical and jaw dropping. Another scene is the Tyrannosaurus Rex's first appearence in which it attacks and overturns the explorer car that Tim and Lex are inside of, the whole scene is magical and terrifying. The film is great from a very chilling scene to one of the best climaxes I've seen from a movie! The movie is just...magnificent, and ear pounding, one of the best movie scores of all time! This movie is just so many things put together. If you haven't seen this film yet then where the heck have you been??? You have to see this film!	5.0	In my top five of films...	2005-03-23	2	1	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3FJ0PV51QQRZW	mr.3D	"Jurassic Park is perhaps my favorite film of all time. I remember I was 8 years old when it was first released and I was almost certain what I was seeing on the screen where without a doubt, real life dinosaurs. Considering I first wanted to become a paleontologist in first grade,prior to this films original release, it's safe to say with  spielberg's take on Crichton's ambitious novel,my interest in Dinosaurs has been sealed ever since.Now with the 3D release of Jurassic Park I get to relive that great childhood memory in a new format.Is it worth the purchase?If you have a 3D TV and have yet to purchase this film on standard bluray I would say go for it without hesitation.The picture clarity and sound are restored very well. The audio more so than the video.My favorite attention to detail is looking at the refrigerator (John Hammonds introduction scene)and reading the headline on the paper which says, ""Aliens stole my face"", and then behind Hammond a headline that says, ""Dinosaurs on Mars!""Perhaps Alan Grant and Ellie Sadler where huge fans of Weekly World Wews?I've been watching this movie for nearly 20 years and have never been able to notice little things like that. The last bluray release to make me go wow for minor details such as that was the bluray version of the original Halloween.The 3D itself adds to the original experience but not by leaps and bounds. Theirs just enough pop out factor to notice it and just enough 3D depth to feel any immersion within the world of Jurassic Park. Yes I'm a little disappointed but not enough to feel like this release doesn't have any merit to it. That first scene where the score hits and you see the brachiosaurus in all it's glory I still cracked a smile.When the T Rex first shows it's huge head devouring the remains of a goat it looked absolutely terrifying and gigantic in 3D.In the end,Jurassic Park 3D takes you back to the island of Isla Nublar in style but I feel only the most hardcore fans of the franchise will be willingly to take the ride in 3D.The 3D adds a nice subtle touch I admire as a fan but really does little to compete with other 3D titles out their."	5.0	5 stars for the movie,3 stars for the 3D.	2013-04-28	8	7	1

Its amazing that a film this old can be turned in to 3d in such spectacular fashion. The conversion to 3d adds real depth. The only downside is a slight blurring of the image in some background scenes. Jungle scenes and the dinosaurs look great. A special mention for the audio also. On playing it through my 7.1 surround set up it seemed very dynamic and much more active in the surrounds. In the 3d behind the scenes feature its revealed that the 3d disc has had its audio remixed and it shows! An essential purchase.	5.0	Great fun!	2013-05-25	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Whilst obviously comparable to Spielberg's other big monster movie, 'Jaws', this is still excellent in its right.  Based on the Michael Crichton novel it retains the barest threads of the scientific argument.  Indeed, this argument is mostly represented by Jeff Goldblum who is rapidly demoted to a back seat.  That's not too important though seen as this is the kind of movie that manages to genuinely fascinate its audience with its outstanding special effects.  Even several years on, the sight of the T-Rex clawing its way past metal fencing remains spectacular.Basically this is a rollercoaster ride and little else but for what it is, 'Jurassic Park' is great fun.  Placing its little humans in various apparently inescapable situations seems to be the story, but what situations they are!  There's a car falling through a tree inch by inch, a huge T-Rex and a particularly nasty little one that seems cute and innocent at first.  Most impressively though, it remains pretty scary.  Rather than overusing the big T-Rex, the raptors are much scarier and more efficient at making the audience jump.  One particularly well constructed scene has two kids hiding out in a kitchen which is being stalked by two vicious raptors.The acting, as in many movies like this, is incidental.  Neill plays a pretty flat main character, Dern excels as a feisty archaeologist, the kids are good value, Goldblum is fun whilst Attenborough doesn't appear to do anything.  Most importantly though 'Jurassic Park' grips from the very beginning and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's not the most complicated movie ever,..., but it's definitely thrill-packed.	4.0	A real thrill ride	2002-03-18	1	0	1

The directing, animatronics, acting, graphics, and casting were perfect in this movie. The beginning was perfect, no sitting around waiting for action. It opens with a worker being attacked by a velociraptor and Muldoon(Bob Peck) trying to help him.You meat a character named Nedry(Wayne Knight) who is working for a company that will pay him 1.5 million dollars if he steals the dinosaur embryos.Then some other stuff happens, yaddah yaddah, anyway, Grant(Sam Neill), Ellie(Laura Dern), Gennaro(Martin Ferraro), Malcolm(Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond(Richard Attenborough), reach the island. The island is owned by Hammond the billionaire. It is a theme park with real dinosaurs. The main four go on a tour with Hammond's grandkids.Needless to say, the tour goes bad. Nedry steals the embryos, pulls the power and runs off. The five remaining characters are stranded out by the tyrannosaur paddock. Ellie has already gone back to the visitor's center where she, Hammond, Muldoon, and Mr. Arnold(Samuel L. Jackson) try to figure out what Nedry has done.The tyrannosaurus escapes, eats Gennaro and nearly kills everyone else. Moments later Ellie and Muldoon come to try and find everybody, but they have left. They find Malcolm lying in a pile of hay, and the two cars destroyed.Now Grant, and the two grandchildren, Lex and Tim, must find their way back to the visitor's center while Ellie, Malcolm, Muldoon, Hammond, and Mr. Arnold try to get the power back.	5.0	Unbelievable	2003-04-09	7	3	4

Take this one out for a spin and enjoy the ride!  The DTS version really rocks.  There's room for many genres of film, and this one is a great for what it is.  The acting is fine, the soundtrack is great, the cinematography is fantastic, and the computer graphics are as good as it gets.  The sound quality is jusy phenominal (another great example of DTS at its finest).  Watch this one when you want to escape reality and enjoy the rush of great action.  This isn't the film for profound thinking, but does it have to be?  Relax a bit, Amazon reviewers, and enjoy the action side of Spielberg.  No, it's not one of the finest films ever made-- Citizen Kane is not in danger of falling-- but I watch this one for escapist cinema!  Want to think a bit?  I just saw The Manchurian Candidate (try this one for deeper thought!)  ENJOY Jurassic Park!  If you're going to buy, I suggest the DTS if you have the system!	4.0	The Great Escapist Film	2000-10-14	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A38921VU3NJDFK	N. Anno	Another instant classic from Steven Spielberg, this spectacular translation of Michael Crichton's famous novel entertains with constant, enduring bouts of excitement and a full plate of terrorizing sequences as memorable as they are awe-inspiring. A forewarning of the possible cataclysmic effects of meddling with biology and genetics, Jurassic Park exercises one of the most engaging, smartly-conceived plots in Hollywood history--simple, yet beyond the realm of most peoples' imaginations. Spielberg's use of special effects (in particular, animatronics) is absolutely perfect--the dinosaurs are more realistic than anything similar that anyone's ever seen. This film's cast is pleasant and applicable, and its sound effects rival its visuals, making it one of the most technically flawless films of all time. For any film aficionado, this is an absolute essential piece of any DVD collection.	4.0	Jurassic Park (1993)	2010-02-17	1	1	0

Amazon's sneaky way of getting out of accountability for their Prime Instant Video service is messed up, for lack of better words.After realizing the convenience of renting an HD film like this, I thought my baby cousins were in for a treat. One out of the three had never seen or heard of the movie. My Prime account allowed me to select the HD version. It then proceeded to restrict me from playing that version while still charging the higher fee. The software detected that I was playing the movie from a PC. With no explanation I was not able to stream HD from my computer. Then after pulling up the standard version I plugged my hdmi cord into the TV so that these three kids can enjoy the movie. I got a message that the ""device is not HDCP compliant."" All this arose from the remotes gone missing; we had the DVD but could not play it because the ""select"" button was not on the front of the player. Finally I played it through the PC; by then it was too late for everybody to stay up to watch this wonderful film. The four dollars (3.99) is gone and there's no way to refund request nor is there any troubleshooting about failed streaming video.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A14SRB2VNHKO3J	"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot"""	I'm not really going to review the movie itself, but rather its conversion to a 3-D feature. Because let's be honest here... Jurassic Park is the best and there is no arguing otherwise. End of story.In today's day in age, seeing a film in 3-D isn't anything new. Who knew!? But where that might be super cool, this is also a time where studios are quick to give movies the 3-D treatment in post production rather unnecessarily. The unfortunate product of this greed-driven agenda is an often sloppy, subpar and rather uncomfortable viewing experience. As an avid movie-goer, this makes me all sorts of sad. So when I heard they were re-releasing Jurassic Park in 3-D, I was somewhat hesitant albeit still very excited. I remember seeing the original release in theatres so my expectations set the bar quite high. Were they about to ruin one of my favourite features of all-time? Or were we in for cinema gold?By the time I sat down on movie night with my liter of cola and Twizzlers, my nerves were shot. The lights dimmed and I watched it in my well-founded anticipation. In 3-D. And after two hours of in-your-face drama, the hubby and I walked out totally speechless. Words can't even describe how blown away I was by it. Next to Tron: Legacy, Jurassic Park was the best 3-D film (or any film) I've ever seen on the big screen. This is the real deal! Where in many cases, 3-D is used as a distraction technique, here it only serves to enhance the film's magical qualities.StereoD took their time (over a year) with the conversion process and it really shows. Steven Spielberg is one of those painstakingly careful directors that has a mind and an eye for depth, detail and vision which only helped the film in this case. Jurassic Park strikes a careful balance between the CG effects and 3-D without coming across as being too much to handle. It breathes new life into the lush, exotic sets and adds a whole new level of thrills to the action that's culminating on screen. I really appreciated Spielberg's selectiveness on which scenes to present in 3-D---the initial dino reveal, the T-Rex escape, the Jeep chase, the Gallimimus herd, and raptor kitchen scene (among others)---they were all appropriately chosen and the new depth of field really added to the sense of wonder, awe and danger we as an audience felt.In addition, we're privy to an added level of detail that we've never seen before. From the scales on the dinosaurs to the patterns and textures in the scenery, it's enough to make the already impressive CGI seem even more real. Jurassic Park was already at the top of its film-making game when it combined digital effects and animatronics. It's a happy surprise to see that 3-D didn't detract from the from the movie at all, in fact, the effect was just the opposite---it enhanced it. The added layers intensified my viewing experience to the max and allowed me to feel the same sense of imagination and wonder as the first time I saw it on the big screen. THIS is what the technology was created for, my friends!Food for Thought: Jurassic Park is exactly the type of movie that's meant to be seen in 3-D! The attention to detail and careful conversion process gives new meaning to movie magic and helps to create a heightened sense of depth and added drama. This movie was a vision that was expertly executed and is beyond worthy. It's even enough to justify the few extra dollars on the hefty price of admission.	5.0	Worth the hefty admission price!	2013-04-24	3	3	0

Steven Spielberg's box office hit ""Jurassic Park"" is good enough to rival ""Jaws"" (well, maybe not).  The story is a very original one, even thought Michael Crichton thought it up.  Richard Attenborough owns and finances a huge island amusement park.  Why is it so special?  Because it's populated with cloned dinosaurs!Sam Neill is perfect in the role of Dr. Grant, the dinosaur-loving scientist who, along with his assistant/girlfriend, is invited to review the Park.  Jeff Goldblum provides comic relief as a mathematician who is invited also for reasons unknown.And what's a plot without a problem?  After losing electrical power, several vicious dinosaurs escape and wreak havoc on our characters (but where did all the hundreds of Park employees go?  Spielberg never got around to that).  And the computer-animated special effects are AWESOME!""Jurassic Park"" boats several very frightening scens, particularly where a pair of deadly raptors stalk Attenborough's grandchildren in a kitchen.  And then there's the infamous part involving a jeep and the T-rex.Spielberg has done it again!  He has created a modern classic!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1XYJ3UXLWO082	"pbk63 ""RS"""	I must admit I had reservations about remakes of movies in 3D.  I grew up with the red/green glasses watching Vincent Price in theaters in House of Wax. Yes I really do go back to 50 cent movies with double features and cartoons and news plus collections for fighting polio.  Was a bit past WWII war bonds at least! 3D back then was fun but hardly made you feel part of the movie.  When Titanic came out in 3D it was first movie in 3D I purchased and I thought it was fantastic.  Then Top Gun came out.  Not quite so good 3D but still very good.  Now Jurassic Park.  I have not watched all the extras but I recommend anyone watch the 3D extra with Steven Spielberg on Disc 1 discussing how Titanic remake made him want to do Jurassic Park in 3D.  Unlike some behind the scenes explanations of how a movie is made watching this before you watch the film will not spoil it for you.  I remember after the Universal Studio tour my wife saying she wished she did not known all the tricks and effects as she could not get them out of her mind when watching a film.  That will not be the case here.  In fact it will make you appreciate even more the 3D effects.  This extra goes through how a 2D movie is converted into 3D and how Spieberg worked with the studio scene by scene to give his input into what he wanted.  The result is probably the best 3D I have seen. While it is not genuine 3D made with 3D cameras  in some ways the result may surprise you and may be even better. The studio and the director can pick out those elements they want to emphasize and enhance in 3D.  Having a master film maker like Spielberg directing the work results in a quality product.  It makes me look forward to more and more remakes in 3D by the studio that did Titanic and Jurassic Park.  With so little TV 3D I have bought numerous DVD's in 3D.  Some are good, some are great and this falls in the latter category.  Give it my highest recommendation for a 3D film. Have on order the new Star Trek movie when it is released in 3D this fall and it will be interesting to see how a made from scratch in 3D movie compares to  a high quality  remake in 3D. I have a sneaky feeling that the methods used in the remake may be even better than had it been made in 3D originally.  We will see.  If you get this one hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	5.0	Terrific 3D well worthwhile	2013-06-23	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QGGDITUTK619	"P. Dua-Brown ""patchdb7"""	Michael Crichton's novel gets the Spielberg treatment, doing for dinosaurs what Jaws did for sharks.  Sam Neil, in his good guy persona (a la Dead Calm, not Event Horizon!), and Bruce's daughter Laura Dern (Nic Cage's wife  in David Lynch's Wild at Heart) play the husband and wife paleontologist  team invited to view a monumental advancement in amusement park technology  by billionaire oddball Richard Attenborough (Ghandi director who failed in  his Great Escape years earlier).  Jeff Goldblum (The Fly and that Pilsten  Hols /Apple advertiser) makes another canny mega-movie appearance (remember  Independence Day?) as a chaos mathematician also along for the tour.  Samuel L. Jackson is seriously wasted as a lowly computer technician - his  `action' career took off over the next three years with the triple whammy  of Pulp Fiction, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, and The Long Kiss Goodnight.  Throw in Dickie's grandkids, Bob Peck (Slipstream) as a big game hunter,  and a nerdy insurance/accountant type and you've got plenty of fodder for  the real stars of the movie - the animatronic and Silicon Graphics  generated dinosaurs!  Most full body shots are computer generated, most  body part shots are animatronic - who cares when the effects are so  gobsmacking and seamlessly integrated.There are plenty of holes to pick  in the plot if you want to get scientific, but that's not what this film is  about.  It's a terrific rollercoaster ride of a film that all the family  (except the smallest maybe) can hold hands together to watch.  One point  that many argue is the velociraptors were only six-foot long and half the  height of humans - Spielberg obviously wanted more dramatic impetus.  Strangely enough, during filming scientists uncovered evidence of a  10-foot-tall variety, now named Utahraptors - so how's that for a bit of  Spielberg magic?The soon to be released DVD edition is a Universal  Collector's Series (like Dragonheart, End of Days, Fast Times at Ridgemount  High, Conan the Barbarian, and many a Hitchcock classic) and Universal  rarely puts a foot wrong with these specials.  Expect a first class  transfer -especially since it's taken Spielberg long enough to approve the  release, and maybe throw in some trailers in the Universal showcase or  recommendations sections, and this should be one memorable monster movie  release!	5.0	Spielberg goes pre-historic!	2000-06-20	9	8	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3BBTREGJEE99S	Peter Ashford	The movie is great.  What more can be said?Well, I'll tell you.  I bought this DVD to replace my aging VHS tape.  The tape actually sounds BETTER!  When Universal had the initial master made, the level of the bass track wasn't right.  When T-Rex walks, you're supposed to FEEL it.  The VHS tape (in THX) and the Digital Dolby DVD both have the bass level set properly.What did they do?  They made a new master (after six months).  They did NOT recall the bad DVDs from distributors.  The new DVDs are available (they sound great), but VERY hard to locate.  They also didn't change the UPC on the case, so there's no way to tell which DVD you're buying, until you open it up.  Finally, they didn't tell anyone that a mistake had been made, so that it could be corrected.  In short, they didn't so ANYTHING that might cost them one cent.How do you tell the difference (other than sound)?  The bad DVD has a code of 'D2R1' on the inner rim of the disk.  The good DVD has a code of 'D2R2' in the same place.	1.0	Great movie, bad soundtrack (DTS)	2001-08-12	252	184	68
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1EX6NR08YH874	Peter Soule	When I first saw this movie, I was only around seven years old.  I liked it, but that was mostly because it was &quot;a PG-13.&quot;  I didn't understand the plot, didn't have any idea that it was based on a book, and didn't appreciate the special effects (I just thought that the dinosaurs were robots with a guy driving them inside).  Then I realized it was a book awhile later and then finally decided to read the book just a few weeks ago.  After reading it (it was a excellent book, by the way), I wanted to see the movie again to see what changes it had in it.  It is very different, but Steven Spielberg makes it very good.This movie is probably one of the most chilling movies that I have ever seen.  The special effects still remain amazing (nine years later), they still fully explained the plot (which is brilliant), and is just plain very good.  It was definatly focused more on the excitment than how they made the dinosaurs and got the the DNA and all that, but that is ussualy the way movies based on books are and they ussualy are a dissapointment (The Perfect Storm, need I say more?), but this movie is no dissapointment.  I mean, who wouldn't be thrilled by the idea of a Tyranasaurus Rex terorizing a present day island?  I now would.  And another thing that I noticed as that it really doesn't stop once it has gotten going.  Like after the first part when the T-Rex attacks the jeep, you think that all the fun is over once the jeep has flown into the tree.  But then, there is always the possibility that the jeep may fall out of the tree, right when Tim and Dr. Grant are climbing down it.  And that the electrical fence might just turn back on right when the those three are climbing over it.  That is a rare thing in movies, they ussauly pause for a long time in between each little three minute thrill seen.So, in the end, this movie was very different from the book, but not dissapointment from the book one bit.  I reccomend it to pretty much everybody who is old enough to apprectiate movies.	5.0	Very Different From the Book, But  a Very Good Movie!	2001-03-15	1	1	0

What Spielberg did was take a bunch of second rate actors (except Richard Attenborough), so the real stars are the Dinosaurs.  Really action packed like Jaws, heart pounding, scary, with a touch of dark humor (Man eaten on toilet).  Perfect blend of all emotions.  Not for small children, as it could be very nightmarish. As said this is the perfect vehicle for 3D and it is used and done in an excellent manner.  I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  This movie has not aged, after all it is about Dinosaurs.

But even though it doesn't follow the book, it is still one heck of a movie.The widescreen edition DVD has a great look and great sound that makes you feel as if you are in a theater.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1S5A7QTE7PESI	"""pick33"""	This should be a DTS/DVD owner's dream come true. Granted this movie isn't an Academy Award winner, nor does it deserve to be. It's for pure fun, and  it preforms that use almost flawlessly.Hollywood, in the past years,  seems to be cranking out the mindless movies more than it use to. 'The  Mummy', 'Anacanda', and 'Lake Placid' are a few of the more recent films.  Some are worse than others. However, 'Jurrasic Park' is a gem in the  category. What else could be more frightening, exciting, and sometimes  humorous than a bunch of dinasaurs chasing humans around a tropical island?  Yeah you all know. Basically every American back in 93 went to the theaters  to see this prehistoric flick. It deservingly held records for all time  attendance untill Titanic took over a few years later.The only flaw to  this film is it must be watched in certain conditions. It needs the digital  sound and the digital quality picture to deliver it's emotions most  effectively. VHS just doesn't serve it justice. Any one that owns a DVD  player, or more specifially anyone that has DTS compatable stereo equipment  should be overwhelmingly excited for this film's October release onto DVD.  For you few DVD owning individuals that haven't seen this film, don't  worry, it's a sure thing and one of the reasons why DVD was invented. On a  scale of movies made for DVD, Jurrasic Park deservingly scores four out of  five stars.	4.0	DVD Owner's Dream Come True	2000-07-04	0	0	0

The sight of seeing life-like dinosaurs roaming across the screen was a visual and technological marvel.  The plot of the film and its dialogue are thin and slight at best, but they are really secondary to the effects.  Watching the T. Rex storm across the screen is mesmerizing and the Raptors are among the scariest screen villains ever.  Stephen Spielberg is the master at this genre and he deftly guides through the suspense and tension of the film until its dramatic climax.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ	Private Quentin Tarantino Fan	"Spielberg's Jurassic Park still stands on it's own as being a great film, nearly 20 years later after the film was first released.  While there has been tons and tons of movies that have used CGI and CGI has been commonplace everywhere, Spielberg's film still has the emotional power to stir and move like a legendary filmmaker should.  Jurassic Park will be the work of an aueter that keeps it from growing old, while so many films like it are now forgotten within a few years.  We all know that Spielberg's Jurassic Park is terrific entertainment, with thrills and chills on every corner.  But it also manages to be quite a powerful cautionary tale, doing something that films like Frankenstein still haven't been quite able to master.  Now how exactly can a film that made close to a billion and was a franchise starter and marketing powerhouse do that?This is why.  Michael Crichton book has more detail, science, and more ideological intelligence, but Spielberg's film has what Crichton's novel doesn't have: emotional intelligence to make his own viewpoints through behavior come across in a much more convincing way.  Behavior is real but an idea is not necessarily real.  Obviously, this is not an absolute, and the former can justify the reality of the latter, but this makes for a much more convincing and real argument.  Some people call this shallowness, but in my opinion, being able to paint the experience and emotional content of a complex emotional experience is not shallow, and Jurassic Park's scenes of consequence and danger are able do so, with kaleidoscopic emotion andThe initial T-Rex scene, one of the most famous of them all, is a good example of this.  Spielberg directs the scene with danger, and the Dinosaur is absolutely primal, stripped down to it's instincts at dangerous cost.  This is a prime display of why Spielberg's Jurassic Park EXTREMELY succeeds in showing WHY tinkering with genetics can be so damn dangerous.  Spielberg also never sugar coats these animals abilities, reminding us of just how primal and vicious they can be.  These creatures can tear up a goat in half a second, they can find their way through environments looking for something to eat, stalk their pray and having no sense of right or wrong that humans do (like animals), and how these creatures are, all in all, extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY dangerous.  It's one reason why this is a valuable and piece of science-fiction, and why it's very much essential as much as other great films.Understandably, this is still a large budget thriller, with more thrills and chills than a roller coaster, but it's damn good one at that, made with talent and passion by Spielberg and company.  There are some underwhelming moments here and there, but some of these are overpowered by Spielberg's awesome visuals, spectacular sound design, and humanistic acting.  The CGI here, despite being somewhat stiff at times, recreates these Dinosaurs as you would expect, and there's a HUGE sense of AWE and BEING, LIFE, even nearly 20 years later.  But it's the sound of these creatures that works.  The ground shaking when a dinosaur lowers it's foot, the huge roars, and the primal ferocity of these animals that will send chills down your spine.  The bone chilling roar of the T-Rex makes you want to trample a city (seems fitting that Mastodon sampled it). I also think the production design is great as well, for what that's worth.  John Williams score is also amazing and uplifting.The character development is a little thin, but I think this is easily transcend with good performances.  Spielberg has a knack for being able to make his characters seem very real (no matter what other people try to convince me.  Nice try but you can't convince me), which really separates his ability from lesser hacks.  There's not a feeling of ""cardboard"" character, as they feel very much like what you would expect if you saw one of these people in life.  Even if you didn't have, Regarding the I give some props to Spielberg to not having a cloying ""I'm ready for children I love THEM!"" moment, but instead some subtly that shows Alan Grant's very realistic alleviation to his dislike of all children after finally opening his mind (or forced to, for a better word).  It's not too deep because characters are second, but it's got enough pathos to move you.I do think that Crichton's book is much more technical and layered, considering that he's a scientist and didn't have to work with David Koepp.  And I do think that the book obviously has value and does thing that Spielberg's film can't do (and vice-versa).  But the movie, for me, is better because it's just more convincing, and simply showing the is much more riveting and makes you think about the consequences of tinkering much more, simply because Spielberg.  On top of that, it has enough heart stopping moments to give, so that certainly doesn't hurt either.  I suggest reading the book to get more of the ideas and applying to the behavior on screen.It's too bad that Jurassic Park is considered to some to be a big soulless, dumb blockbuster film, because there's a lot here to chew on along with awesome special effects, entertaining performances, and white knuckle terror (this definitely isn't a film for young children).  Skip the sequel, as it's merely a cheap facsimile of this film, a big (and boring) budget monster movie with a 100 million dollar budget (the book isn't bad, although it was written more hastily because Spielberg pressured Crichton to write another book).  Whatever you do though, see this one for it's relevance and artistic intentions within one of the most well known pieces of entertainment."	4.0	A Seamless Blend of Thrills and Chills, and Behavior Based Sci-Fi	2011-01-05	3	3	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AQR22MPF45M3P	Rachel Ford	"I have to admit to some bias in this review - this film came out when I was about eight years old, and has been a favorite of mine ever since. It helped that as a kid I was a huge dinosaur nerd (my coloring books, story books, movies, etc., were all dinosaur themed); but what sealed the deal were the fantastic animatronic and CGI dinosaurs. Back then, story and characters didn't matter so much, as long as the bad guy got what was coming to him and the good guys made it out ok - and the dinosaurs looked awesome.Since then, my tastes have, I trust, matured somewhat. So I was extremely pleased when I watched Jurassic Park recently to see that the story and characters that I had accepted so easily as a kid still stood up. And, yes, I was pretty thrilled to see that these dinosaurs from 1993 looked more believable and ""real"" than anything I have ever seen in film since - including in Peter Jackson's King Kong.An overview of the story of this film probably is not necessary by this point, but, just in case...the main characters are Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleontologist and a paleobotanist (respectively); they are called, for their expert opinion, by a wealthy investor, John Hammond, to ""Jurassic Park"". Jurassic Park is a theme park created by the aforementioned Mr. Hammond, on which he's created live dinosaurs. Throw in a greedy programmer (whose screens show what looks to be real code, btw :) ) who wants to steal and sell dinosaur embryos to a rival company, a giant storm, and power outages ... and, well, I'm sure you can imagine: chaos ensues. There is much chasing, running, hiding, etc., until, at length, the escape is made. As to who lives and who dies, well, you'll have to watch the movie to find that out -- and I highly recommend that you do!5/5 stars."	5.0	What can I say?

The second half is where stuff hits the fan.The movie also gives a believable reason why the dinosaurs are there; they just aren't thrown into the movie out of nowhere, expecting the audience to get over that fact they came out of nowhere.The soundtrack is astounding; the theme of this film is one of the most beautiful pieces of music my ears have been blessed with.The direction Steven Spielberg took near perfectly matches the tone of the original book. Not too corny or too serious, Spielberg does a fantastic job directing this movie.What I love most about this movie is the magic it brings to us. This movie literally revitalised dinosaurs in film. Imagining these vast creatures roam the land we stand on sixty-five million years ago just blows my mind.This is my all-time favorite movie. A fourth film has been announced for release next year, so I trust Spielberg to bring us the magic we got back in '93.	5.0	My absolute favorite movie of all time	2013-03-30	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	ATC6W2PJ6EK1C	"Ramsey Tupper - Raven's Foot ""Ram-sey Tup-per"""	This film is silly! Taking the preposterous notion of recreating something like a dinosaur from ages old DNA is just a warping of scientific theory, not fact. Also, who says what color dinsaurs were? The not so special effects that every one raved about are terrible, actors pretending that something is there that isn't only to be superimposed later is poorly done. Roger Rabbit and Bob Hoskins did it well as Roger had to act as though Bob was there when he wasn't and did really well, proper eye contact too. No, Jurassic park is badly scripted, based on poor science, badly acted and cheap looking. Don't waste your time and money on this over-hyped cheese.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1SVXJZ3386U2D	Randy Keehn	"I may harp a lot about how modern technology has taken a lot of the artistic element out of modern cinema.  However, when modern technolgy is placed in the right hands with the right script, some pretty great things can be accomplished.  I offer as Exhibit A; ""Jurassic Park"".  This is one terrific movie that captivates our attention with its creation of the realistic image of modern-day dinosaurs while, at the same time, captivating us further with a thrilling tale of suspenseful adventure.  The acting is terrific as well as the writing, cinematography, directing, editing, and, of course, the special effects.The story line is a bit of a stretch.  For example, I never really understood how the frogs fit into it all.  Then there is the challenge of finding so many different mosquitos frozen in amber.  The mine was a nice touch but I had a hard time that they would find so many who had just the right blood properly preserved for this all to happen.  However, we could just let it be and accept the possibility that it COULD work.  Once we did that, the rest of the movie was spellbinding.  Most people have seen the movie and are familiar with the Adventure Park concept that several ""experts"" were brought in to review before its' grand opening.  How everthing looks so terrific until something goes wrong.  If you haven't seen the movie, take my word for it; you should!  Some may scoff at this or that aspect but I was wrapped up in the whole experience by the time it finally ended.  (By the way, what was with the pelicans?  Was there some message there that I missed?).A brief disclaimer; This movie came out at a time when dinosaurs were a real popular thing with kids; especially elementary school children.  Lots of moms took their kids to see the dinorsaurs that the advertizements said were in the movie.  There were a lot of subsequent complaints about traumatized youngsters who weren't ready for some of the reality of what might happen when man and dinorsaur met.  If their bed time is before 9PM, you might want to let your kids skip this one until you've previewed it.  It's worth staying up past 11PM to watch."	5.0	The Positive Side of Modern Technology and Cinema	2004-10-04	3	2	1

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A16GM9G38VTJMV	RedConOne	I love this movie and man does watching it take me back. Want to feel old? Its been something like 18 years since Jurassic Park was released in theaters. Even after all that time Jurassic Park still leaves me awestruck. The acting is awesome but lets not kid ourselves here the real top star of the film is the T-Rex and they do a good job with the T-Rex especially for being so old it is hard to tell its not real (the CGI parts). Never before was a dinosaur brought to life so realistically and the robotic one certainly looked awesome (leaving me more than once thinking i would love to have that thing for Halloween). I love this film its a classic favorite of mine that is always a pleasure to watch. All the actors play their characters to perfection, the two scientists who are awestruck to see the things they dig up and day dream about are alive in front of them. The old man who just wanted to amaze the world, the greedy lawyer, the two kids who are along for the ride, and the cooky scientist named, Malcolm (Jeff G), the only man who from the beginning respected the power and danger of that island and its new inhabitants. The acting is great you can almost feel the tension and stress in the air at points. I dont think this movie has ever disappointed me. The mix of awe and terror is perfectly done leaving the viewer really happy with watching it.5/5 stars for this classic, it is a nail biting thrill ride that i would recommend to anyone!	5.0	Amazing Movie	2012-10-08	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A35MX4QYGZ25FN	"Ren Hek ""Animator"""	This film has to be one of the greatest movies ever created, I have never seen a film that could top this one. I mean, this movie has everything, sci-fi, fantasy, action, adventure, thrills, chills, suspense, comedy...everything! Speilburg was deffinetly the perfect choice for director. I'm not going to get into the storyplot because lets face it, everybody has seen this movie, and if you haven't, where have you been the last decade?The special effect in this movie are among the best I have ever seen!!! And it was made in 1993! This was before those computer graphics and a all that jazz we have today. Even movies today with computer graphics can't match Jurassic Park. It used minitures, string puppets, stop animation, animatronics (huge T-Rex head), and even guys in suits (raptors in some pictures)!The acting is good at all times, it never falls behind, and the characters are well developed. The script was slightly different from the book, however, very few movies follow the books storyline word for word and when this does happen, the movie drags on forever *coff Lord of The Rings coff* (not even those movies are exactly the same). Non-the-less the script was brilliant. I read the book after seeing the movie, I thought it was amazing too!(even though you don't even see a dinosaur until the second half, that is one thing that the movie has over the book)!!So in conclusion, this movie is amazing, there is absolutely no reason not to see it, even kids can see it (because its PG-13, in fact i saw it as a kid). If you read some of the bad, one star reviews, they dont even sound like they were watching the same movie, or they were drunk as they watched it (or when they wrote the review.....) and they really shouldn't be watching movies if they are going to point out every tiny little mistake in the movie, and write a paragraph about it and exploit it, making it sound worse then it really is...I've been watching this movie for 11 years, all the time!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with ""Jurassic Park,"" a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he ""Spared no expense,"" and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen.  Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is ""real"" from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely.  Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the ""blood-sucking"" lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park.  The wonderful thing about a movie like ""Jurassic Park"" is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies."	5.0	When Spielberg Ruled The World	2001-01-02	33	25	8

I'll be discussing the Blu-Ray here.Second, I own several movies on both Blu-ray and DVD. In most cases I bought the BD for the extras.Some small personal history: very small, I promise. When I was six years old. I lived in New York, and visited the American Museum of Natural History with parents or on school field trips. My favorite? The Dinosaur Hall. I remember being tiny, staring up at these immense creatures, falling in love. Movie technology from &#34;The Lost World&#34; to &#34;Valley of Gwangi did its best to recreate them, but even the best was clearly an effect, and most were far worse. But they were dinosaurs, and they were what we had then. Until.When I first saw &#34;Jurassic Park,&#34; I had exactly the same feeling looking up at that superb Brachiosaur. That, and the paras by the lake, showed me real, believable dinosaurs for the first time, and it was an overwhelming experience, really the fulfillment of a lifelong desire: to see dinos alive, muscled, in the flesh.So while it still played in the theatres, whenever I took my wife and kids to a movie, I'd check the start time, and my kids and I would sneak out of the movie we'd paid to see, and sneak into &#34;Jurassic&#34; to see that sequence. I'd watch the beloved Brach, rapt with wonder and delight, utterly identified with Dr. Grant. My kids, amused and patient, would watch me staring at the screen with tears in my eyes. It was that powerful a reunion.And so, at last, to the Blu-ray release of &#34;Jurassic Park.&#34; I referenced earlier that I have several DVD/BD duplicates in my collection. I can tell you that never before &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; have I seen such a profound difference in the quality of the visuals, and hence, the power of the experience. It's very much like being in the theatre again that first time, taken beyond myself by the brilliant work of ILM and Spielberg, showing me something I'd wanted to see all my life. I couldn't be happier with the BD version of &#34;Jurassic Park,&#34; and look forward to seeing all three films in that format. A magnificent job of transfer makes this fairly economical purchase more than worth the price for anyone who wants to be in the room with a dinosaur.

I have owned the 1-3 collection (on DVD) for over a decade now and I love every single minute. I shelled out and got this Blu-Ray pack of the first one 1) because we have a 3D TV and I've never used this feature and 2) because I love JP and wanted it in HighDef. I couldn't believe it when I saw in the cinemas that they were re-releasing the film in 3D. Made perfect sense to me! I not only paid an extortionate amount of money to see the 3D film in the cinemas, I also immediately bought this as soon as it became available.One of the main reasons I purchased this particular pack is because of the cover design. It's embossed of the iconic gates and has minimal information on the front (rating, legal copy, logos etc), so as to not spoil the overall design.Any die-hard JP fan should get their hand on a copy.

The remake is true to the theatre experience - a thrill ride, especially the point-of-view with a T Rex chasing you, or high up in a tree rapidly falling as limbs are breaking underneath you.Depth of field is well presented, so this is best experienced on as large a 3D HDTV as you can get. I used a 47&#34; LCD and it was a lot of fun to watch.

So the big question is: does it substantially add to the viewing experience of one of the most beloved blockbusters of all time?  The answer is a resounding YES it does.  It opens it up immensely and it brings you into the proximity with the T-Rex that you dived under your seat to avoid in the theater not to mention the Raptors (shudder).  I love this version.  It's like seeing the movie again for the first time and refortifies Spielberg's genius for the big canvas.  Money well spent.  Rare today.  I hope I answered the big question for you and I urge you to experience this new Jurassic Park before it fills up and the long lines wear you out.	5.0	Review Of Jurassic Park 3D Retro-Fit	2013-12-07	2	2	0

Predictably, the unpredictable happens, as the dinos wreak havoc on the visitors. This exciting and intense film is not necessarily enhanced by the 3D effect, but is still quite good twenty years later. The visual effects used to portray the dinosaurs were revolutionary at the time, and are still awe-inspiring to see.

I was expecting better from both audio and video.  The picture is not very good (I'm comparing it to Batman Begins on DVD), which was a surprise given the cutting edge effects and the budget at the time, but the audio quality was also poor.  I had to bump up the volume even during the inital encounter with the T-Rex.  I was expecting to rattle the dishes during this scene.  Man, it was a major let-down.I have to assume that when the blu-ray edition comes out, they'll correct both issues, so with that said, even at $20.00, for all three, it's still not a great deal (considering the first movie was the only one, of the three, worth watching.) so you might want to rent it first and judge for yourself.If you are looking for a movie worthy of your home theater, check out the Transformers movie on Blu-ray.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3QIVWJX6TJ0YE	"Rocky IV ""metrohillbilly"""	"The idea behind this movie was a rather ingenius plotline. The special effects were superb. It beat the hell out of the cheesy dinosaur flicks in the fifties and sixties, not only in the special effects department, but in the storyline as well.However the suspense and the raw viciousness of the carnivorous beasts seemed to have been kept to a minimum, or at least contained, so that this movie could remain ""family oriented"". Now I'm not saying that it's necessary to give children nightmares, but as is typical in hollywood family movies the only characters that would become seriously injured or devoured would be characters that no one would miss. The lawyer, the annoying fat guy 'Newman', the token black guy 'Sam Jackson', and of course the macho thick egoed hunter guy. You know, those characters whom were designed specifically to ""die"". Of course our heroes will be safe, and especially the children will evert a tragic demise. God forbid children would be killed in a hollywood film. Even though realistically the children probably would have been the first to get captured, being smaller and probably easier to chew. But Spielberg did not want to answer angry letters from soccer moms and other sensitive Americans from the midwest, so he kept the movie enjoyable for the whole family.Overall it was an entertaining movie. I would recommend seeing it. But avoid the sequels at all costs."	4.0	"Intelligent theme in this movie, but shouldn't have gone ""disney"""	2007-01-12	2	2	0

The awe and wonder is abruptly replaced by terror and a fight for survival after the park's security system is sabotaged, granting the resurrected behemoths free run of the island!Director Spielberg is at his creative best in this tour de force of suspense, acutely blending action, thrills, awe and humor. Equal to the challenge is composer John Williams with an appropriately rousing and kinetic score that sounds something like Stravinsky on melodic steroids!Expert direction, superb performances (Richard Attenborough is particularly effective as the eccentric billionaire entrepreneur, John Hammond) and breathtaking, unprecedented visual effects (the ILM computer generated dinosaurs are completely convincing!) more than compensate for less than dimensional characters and rudimentary plot.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AM2PV53UX1JEQ	R. Penola	This movie contains some of the most laughable dialog in recent memory, as well as some of the most ridiculously bad performances EVER in a movie (the Laura Dern/Richard Attenborough scene over the ice cream is classic).  Yet  the terrors are great fun, and, though over-the-top with a typical  Spielberg flourish, deliver in spades.  I particularly love the raptors in  the kitchen and of course the T-Rex, whenever he/she appears.  But unlike  so many of Spielberg's other movies, this one has not held up in terms of  watching it over and over -- after two viewings, I am essentially DONE.  I  think the violence is extreme for kids, so if you are looking for something  for the family and have younger kids, wait a few years.  The special  effects still look terrific, and the basic conceit of dinosaurs somehow  being resurrected certainly inspires one with awe; too bad the populace and  script surrounding this idea are so often ignored. Since this movie was  being completed at the same time Steven was wrapping Schindler's List,  which is infinitely more considered, perhaps Steven figured it would still  make a gazillion dollars without too much attention to, oh, CHARACTERS or,  oh, PLOT.  He was right, of course.	3.0	WELL...	1999-12-24	2	1	1

Some things really do pop, like the foliage and some key action scenes, but the real power of 3D is the depth.The video fills the screen, no black bars top and bottom, and the depth immerses you into the movie.Some excellent examples are when their climbing down the tree while the vehicle crashes towards them and the climbing over the fence scene which looks like you're actually there looking up at a tall fence and into the seemingly endless sky. Words probably can't do it justice and I'm also doubly impressed because the visual hold up very well for a 20 year old film.Sterio D does pretty much all the 3D work in Hollywood with varied results but the really went all out on post converting this movie. So much so that there is even an extra feature on the 3D disc that shows their process.

This DVD contains some great bonus features, about half of which I have actually watched. As should be expected of any movie labeled ""special edition"", the sound quality is superb and the picture has been remastered. They didn't just say that, you can tell. This is an amazing version of a modern classic and it's probably the best version you're ever going to find. On the other hand, you could always get the whole trilogy box set but, the picture quality is a bit better on this. If you have not read the original book, read it.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1C58YXM2A30CY	"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re..."	"Spielberg's Jurassic Park was for the most part a revolutionary film, mixing the then-new CGI with traditional model effects to bring us dinosaurs.  The nitpickers might complain that the dinosaurs were all from the Cretaceous period.  Still, it won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction film for a reason.You know the plot:  a rich philanthropist, John Hammond, has found that cloning dinosaurs is a reality and decides to introduce the world to this phenomena by making a park that will entertain the rich masses to his little island.Everything is fine until we find the fat computer programmer is actually trying to sell dinosaur embryos to the highest bidder (Dennis Nedry, played by Wayne Knight, from Seinfeld).  In trying to escape and get his goods off the island and get his money (in the middle of a hurricane, no less) he shuts down the park's security system.This shut down then leads to massive failure of the electric fence system and many of the dinosaurs get out -- and begin their mass destruction of the human's activities!The movie's main draw for me was the actual dinosaurs live on screen.  You knew that one of the characters was correct -- this was nature's power and she decided to have the dinosaurs up for extinction and yet Man brought them back is looking for trouble -- but to see them grazing, running, herding and killing each other was really thrilling!Much of the book's charm and character development was cut out of the script, written fairly well by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the novel) and David Koepp.The DVD also had some great features, including a fascinating ""making of"" and the decisions to use computer-animation techniques and meld them with traditional model techniques was fascinating, as well as an interview with Spielberg and what was going through is mind in shooting this film.  His excitement and interest over the project was fascinating.  A director's enthusiasm often translates to the crew and cast and this was evident in the film.The film achieves the ""awe and wonder"" that other reviewers have stated, but is missing the development of character that is very evident in Crichton's original novel.  Still, well worth watchingOther Spielberg Films of Interest:Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)Jurassic Park TrilogyE.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (2-Disc Widescreen Limited Collector's Edition)And of course books of interest:Jurassic ParkThe Making of Jurassic ParkJurassic Park"	4.0	Cretaceous Park?

I first saw it when I was eight years old and it scared the bejezzus out of me, but I saw it later and  enjoyed it so much. It has a great message that preaces against modern science and greedy corporations, especially the ones in the life sciences.The Dinosaurs look almost life-like, and I commend the puppeteers on their excellent work. The acting is also really great. Joseph Mazzello, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Sam Neill are all great in it.This movie is great and if you haven't seen it, (Which I doubt you haven't,) go buy it and see it.

But when they get trapped in the park with the dinosaurs, and the body count rises, they must find a way out before they are dino droppings!!!I liked this movie because the acting is well done, and the dinosaurs look sooooo real you wouldn't believe!!!  Speilberg really showed what he was capable of, though he was better in the notorious JAWS!  The only bad thing about the film is the science.  Some dino's are too big, some too small, and some plainly overexagerated.

If you're wondering if it's worth the 3D, it depends.  If you like things to pop out in front of you (like I do), you may be disappointed.  But, the way the 3D was implemented was still very good.  The depth looks great and the picture looked very clean.  I had to keep reminding myself this movie is 20 years old because it just looks that good.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L	Solid Snake	Jurassic Park is one of the best Crichton film adaptations thus far. Though the screenplay is only marginally faithful to the plot of the novel, the basic premise, people being hunted by prehistoric beasts in a tropical paradise, remains intact.The animatronics and computer technology used to bring the film's dinosaurs to life have aged remarkably well, and the action sequences remain as gripping as ever. The fantastic video quality and available Dolby audio makes for a great viewing experience on wide-format TVs and surround sound systems. DVD extras are sparse for a 'Collector's Edition', but I normally don't care for special features anyway.This is one of my favorite films and it was certainly a crowd pleaser when it was released in 1993. Spielberg keeps the introductions relatively brief and once the action starts, it continues pretty much unabated until the closing credits. His knack for giving the audience what they want creates a few glaring continuity issues (ex: The T.Rex paddock seems to be at road level when when the T.Rex walks through the fence and between the two cars. Moments later, Lex and Grant must rappel down into the paddock, which is now a long drop down from the road.) but the film is so enjoyable that one hardly notices them.The relatively one-dimensional characters are nevertheless filled out nicely by the cast, with Wayne Knight in a great performance as Dennis Nedry and Sam L. Jackson adding his trademark, smoke enveloped cool. I can highly recommend this film and DVD version.	5.0	The T. Rex Wants to Hunt!	2008-09-22	1	1	0

I don't know how they did in theater versions (if this was even released in 3D in theaters), but on the home screen, especially in the Jurassic Park logo, the Red colors were not well incorporated into the dimensional space, causing some visual effects that were glitchy or confusing.  Other than that, the movie is fabulous in 3D and it makes me wish the technology had been ready when Spielberg had originally filmed it.  I am very glad to see this movie converted from it's 2D, rather than re-made and filmed in 3D.

Action aplenty and a slam-bang adrenalin rush (once it gets off the ground), but boy oh boy, did someone forget to check the continuity and logic!  F'r instance:  The T-Rex paddock  is on ground level with the road (we see the soon-to-be-slaughtered goat  and we watch the &quot;T&quot; walk through the opening) until the attack,  when suddenly that ground level opening is a 100 foot drop!; A cow is  lowered into the raptor cage, we hear it savaged and see the trees shake,  but when the hoist is hauled up there is a tattered harness but no blood!  Hmmm; The parade of jeeps hurl down the road nowhere close enough to any  plant life to snatch up a piece, and yet Laura Dern has one in her hand  when we meet the Brontosaurus; there are rain-flecked windshields before  the rain falls; and when Sam Neill and the boy are racing down that tree to  beat the rapidly approaching Jeep, why didn't they just shimmy over to the  other side of the tree trunk?  The jeep can't do that and would fall safely  away from them.  There's more but space is limited here.  The film also  takes way to long to get going and the premise that the park's downfall is  caused by Chaos Theory is bone-headed:  Wayne Knight's character's greed  caused the mess, not chaos in technology or misguided science of restoring  dinosaurs.  But DAMN, aren't those great dinosaurs!	4.0	Always Have Someone Check Continuity and Logic	1999-10-14	3	3	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3RC1F0ILSBFUS	Steven Masotti	The film Jurassic Park is an excellent movie that portrays the apprehension that the public feels towards biotechnology and cloning. Many members of the public fear this new technology because of the unethical behavior of scientists and capitalists. This film enhances these fears as scientists and capitalists are depicted as unethical monsters who use the technology they have created to revive extinct species of dinosaurs for profit. Unlike the experts who are enlisted to review the park, the scientists who created the dinosaurs are depicted as machines doing the bidding of the greedy capitalist John Hammond. Instead of following scientific processes and ensuring that ethical behavior is observed, the scientists merely follow the orders of the capitalists. In this sense, Jurassic Park is not only a commentary on the unethical actions of those involved in both science and capitalism, but a commentary on how the current system for scientific research is so reliant on outside funding that it is impossible to ensure that scientific research is done without the threat of unethical behavior.The unethical behavior depicted in the movie has a major impact on public perception of the biotechnology and cloning. Rather than supporting the positive aspects of cloning and recognizing how cloning and other biotechnology can improve their lives, members of the public are more inclined to fear this technology. This is a direct result of the exaggerated scientific processes that are depicted in Jurassic Park. While it has been stated by several scientists that it is extremely unlikely that scientists will ever be able to actually clone a dinosaur, members of the public still believe that it is possible to revive these ancient creatures and others like them. While the public would benefit from the cloning of human organs and other body parts, it is hesitant to accept cloning because it fears that scientists will act unethically when using the technology. Overall, Jurassic Park exaggerates the threat that unethical scientists pose when using cloning for medical purposes.	5.0	A Scholary Review of Jurassic Park	2013-12-05	2	0	2

Even now, the magic of this amazing piece of art holds a deep place in my heart.The film is simply too real; you don't see a CGI  T-Rex or a puppet Triceratops. You see living, breathing creatures, just as real as the actors.This wonderful piece of nostalgia, 65 million years in the making, has the heart, humor and excitement of the perfect weekend watch.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3NI7CDPZ2OCT1	"superstar ""Sam"""	"When I was a kid, I watched ""Jaws"" with my family. Since then, i have become terrified of sharks and swimming in the ocean. I also watched ""Jurassic Park"" when I was little with my sister, and my sister has never gotten over her fear of dinosaurs, despite the fact that they're extinct! While the dinos didn't scare me, I couldn't help but be amazed by this movie. Stephen Spielberg created the ultimate thrill ride when he made this movie. In my opinion, almost everything about the film is perfect. Many people have said the plot was weak, but if you compare it to a lot of other blockbusters gracing the screen today it holds up pretty well. The special effects also hold up perfectly, especially when you compare it to Spielberg's recent film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (now those were bad effects). The dinosaurs still look pretty realistic. My favorite thing about Jurassic Park is the suspense throughout the movie. Without a doubt, my favorite scene is the first T-Rex scene. It starts off with the goat disappearing, then the water in the footprints start to shake and...well, you know what happens. Though other sequels followed, to me there will be nothing better than the first one: Welcome to Jurassic Park!"	5.0	One heck of a thrill ride	2008-06-29	2	2	0

Spielberg's cinematography was 3-dimensional, long before 3D technology was available. Among the Best 3D Post Conversions so far. (I did find that the base HD image seemed a bit softer with less contrast than my old DVD release - highly recommend adjusting Contrast and Brightness accordingly!) I haven't seen this movie in ages, so watching it in 3D with the re-worked, more expansive DTS soundtrack was very immersive. I have a modest active 3D projector with an older 6.1 surround setup with two subwoofers and a Buttkicker system. Watching it on the home big screen really added to the scale of the 3D, and the subwoofers and Buttkicker really added to the T-Rex scenes.  FYI, d-Box effects are included on the BR-3D - that should be lots of fun! (I'm working up to owning that.)  Mr. Spielberg, Excellent Job Again!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A5TZXWU8AALIC	The JuRK	Steven Spielberg has directed some of the biggest and best movies ever made: JAWS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.But, when kids are involved in his movies, he indulges them and spoils them--and the movies are ruined by a deadly amount of The Cutes.Those first truly great movies I've mentioned all have one thing in common: no cute, adorable kids as main characters.Watch INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, and compare it to RAIDERS and you'll see what I mean.  It's like Mr. Spielberg loses his genius-like ability to craft a film when cute kids show up on the set.  Still don't believe me?  One word: HOOK.Unfortunately, that's my major problem with JURASSIC PARK.Michael Crichton's original novel is a brilliant, well-oiled machine of a story.  Read it.  But although some of Crichton's excellent ethical arguments make it into the film, the menace and suspense of the original storyline are lost because Sam Neill's character has to warm up to the idea of having some cute, adorable kids himself.The priority of the novel was: Not To Get Eaten.The priority, at times, of the film appeared to be: Kids Are Just Too Darn Cute For Anyone to Resist Them.The best scene in the movie was also the most exciting chapter in the book: the first time we see the T-Rex tearing its way out of its pen and rampaging against the guests.The special effects were the real stars of this movie.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	Lets face it, Congo and Sphere just both bombed one after the other, but Jurrasic Park sure showed what you can do with a great author's story when you combine it with a great director. Point taken that the movie does not follow the book, but I think it made it appear to people in another way of what might happen if someone of Crichton's level remade his story.Jurrasic Park is the story of a man named John Hammond, well in his senior years, who is a billionaire that decides to open a park on an island off the coast of Costa Rica. There is one difference with his park, or should I say, there is a big difference with his park.His park has full grown disonasuars, from herbivores to carnivores, any type you can name of, and some you might did not know even exist. To show that his park is safe, Hammond decides to invite several guests to his park for a special tour. They include two palenantologists, a mathematician, a lawyer from the company Hammond owns name InGen, and Hammonds own grandchildren.Sam Neil plays Alan Grant, the head hancho in my opinion, who is obsessed with dinosaurs and doesn't really know what to think of the park. Laura Dern plays Ellie Sattler, the second paleantologist, who thinks that the park isn't a good idea. And then you have the best character in the movie, again my opinion, Jeff Goldblum, whos plays Ian Malcom, who hates the idea of bringing the dinosaurs back to life.The park tour goes smoothly, if not for some sick triceratops and some no shows at some exhibits, but when a storm comes, and a park employee decides to cash in on the embryos with the Dino's DNA, thats when the movie gets really interesting.The Dinosaurs are some of the best special effects you will ever see, I guarantee it, even if you hate the plot you have to respect the power the dinos are shown in. A lot a mayhem, and a especially scary scene when the T-Rex gets out makes this a super chiller.But the good part of the movie are when the Velocoraptors get out, now they are the truly nasty son's of b*tches. And the Dinosaur that has a fin on his neck is trully creepy. [I know it sounds funny, but when you see it spit acid maybe you wouldn't want to meet it face to face afterall.]Luckily all the annoying people get killed; So if you think someone should just shut up when he or she talks don't worry, they probably will be silenced for good. Although I did like Samuel L Jackson's character in it, but why kill him off, he was cool. [Sorry if I ruined that part to those who haven't seen it]I enjoyed this movie, it truly is a classic, and if Spielburg directed, you know you will get your money's worth, no matter what happens in it. Also look for the incredible special effects, both terrifying and aw-inspiring, add all those things up and you have yourself a great movie.	5.0	The only true remake of Michale Crichton's book...	2005-03-20	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A6WR7KBK3PCTV	TicaToon@MindSpring.Com	I was 13 years old when I first watched Jurassic  Park back in 1993. When I was much younger  in the mid to late 80's, I was a dinosaur fanatic.  I will admit on grand opening day, I felt a little  anger because I just got  the feeling Speilberg  was meaning to commercialize dinosaurs. If  you  remember Land Before Time, Speilberg  was also involved in that in 1988.  Land Before  Time was a commercial success.  After the film, everyone in  the theater stood up  and applauded. It was absolutely incredible  and  something I never experienced in a  theater before, and never imagined  because it  was on film and the actors don't see who is  watching them.  Speilberg did his best to follow as closely to  the book as possible, as  well clean it up a bit  so the whole family could enjoy it. I mean  Speilberg is a director of family films. It is his  trademark and style.  You have to admit the  novel was pretty bloody. West World sounds  interesting to see. From what I read, it is like  any other writer or  director. Chrichton has a style  and trademark that he has perfected. I  believe  it is important for all artists to have their own  style and  originality. It makes them unique and  special.  Jurassic Park presented a  moral view-point,  while it may seem obvious that dinosaurs and  man don't  mix. It presented the issue that we  must be careful and responsible when  we  tamper with creation. The characters were  strong. You had a  wise-cracking, smart alec,  moral chaotician, an isolated child-hating  paleontologist, a passionate, observant  paleobotomist, a self-absorb  lawyer, a greedy,  overly opened-minded, dreamer John  Hammond, and two  adventures, star-strucked  children.  The movie had the qualities of a  classic film;  drama, horror, comedy, adventure, and action.  Jurassic  Park will also be remembered as the  film that pioneered the age of  computer  technology for movies.  Cheers!

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2H2XPA4BFS533	"Tige Lewis Quintina ""Tige Lewis Quintina"""	Steven Speilberg's Jurassic Park, is a classic example of the power of movie's to use special effects to generate money - real movie magic.  And the special effects are dazzlingly realist, the dinosaurs are alive and superb, and the action sequences are tense.  The story, by M. Crichton, was well thought out and impressive.  The plot is a good one mixed with many horror-movie type scenes as well as Speilberg's off the cuff sense of humor.  The only shortcomings of the film were the screenplay by Crichton and the un-satisfying ending by Speilberg.  The screenplay lacked many of the important issues brought up in the book such as the dinosaur's escape from the island and the international effect of the prehistoric creatures on the world.  And Speilberg's ending was too unrealistic.  No one spoke of the dinosaurs running wild or of the island's fate.  They just said, `park's closed.'  Both of the shortcomings in script and end leave the viewer wondering what for - it was such an interesting idea.  Will the dinosaurs migrate as they did in the book?  Will the island be destroyed?  I guess Steve Speilberg liked his new dinosaur buddies so much that he's decided to leave it wide open for a Jurassic Park II, only this time it will be called Lost Cash - the money that we missed the last time...Tige Lewis Quintina	4.0	A Classic Example of Real Movie Magic	2006-01-15	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A27ALTKLJ2WMYH	Tilly	I will admit, Jurassic Park is a great video to watch with the sound system way up, the lights off, and a big screen TV at the ready.  The dinosaurs are quite stunning, and seem almost alive.  However, it pales in comparison to the book.  The movie focuses mainly on the plot of the  dinosaurs escaping and generally creating chaos.  The science is downplayed  in favor of killer dinos chasing people.  How lovely.  The book, on the  other hand, seems much more...well, realistic.  It could almost happen, if  you were to pretend that cloning was more reliable than it is now and that  nearly complete dinosaur DNA was found.  It does go into a lot of detail in  the scientific areas, but not in a boring way.  The dinosaurs are much more  lifelike-the raptors are not out to kill humans, merely on the run and very  hungry, with nothing to eat and a bunch of humans wandering around.  All in  all, if you want a story full of awesome special effects and not much else,  watch the movie.  It's at least worth a rental or two.  If you want to read  a suspenseful and well written story that combines thrill with science (and  learn a bit about the chaos theroy at the same time), read the book.	3.0	Too many special effects, too little plot...	2000-05-02	1	1	0

Everything seems fine and dandy at first, but a big, fat jerk tries to steal D.N.A. samples to sell it to a smuggler.

A Tyrannosaurus Rex eats a guy off of a toilet, chases a speeding jeep, and then eats other dinosaurs/animals. What's the matter kid? You don't like lamb chops?

Okay, sure the CGI work was beautifully done, but they would have meant nothing without somebody to play against them.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A18CMGIQZ1OAA2	toby	"oh man hes awesome.  the color purple, jaws, jurassic park, et.  never other than a film maker basically guarantee the ""wow"" effect every time.  this movie never lost its magic with me or anyone ive known.the gist of the movie, dont screw with mother nature.  its a scarey thought really.  ive read how there are scientist trying to re clone the wooly mammoth.  whats next, the sabertooth tiger? god forbid dinosaurs.well, this movie shows what could happen.a couple of fossil hounds are called in to look at a new project that a fellow scientist is working on.  a park set to open to the public full of all the pre extinct dinosaurs, including the T Rex, though i think the velocoraptor was the scaries one to me.  He invites them for a tour along with some other scientist and his two grandchildren.  during a bad storm they wind up without power and the electric fences are turned off.  Feeding time!  The dinos have no rules and these people are running around like white mice.  People are getting eaten, animals are getting eaten, theres alot of chasing, its terrifying, but at the same time the movie has some of the most beautiful scenes ever.  Its all shot on a beautiful island, there is one particular scene where they are overlooking a family of brontosaurus.  the music adds so much and there are one or two peaceful dinosaurs in the movie but dont get me wrong, the rest are meat eaters and there's a whole lot of chasing and sneaking up on humans going on.i think the first one was definately the best.  the other ones that followed were great too but they didnt have the beauty of the first one, they were mainly just violent.  after the first one you really wanta scream, ""are these people that stupid?!!!"".  I mean people get ripped in half, 2 children are almost killed, you look around and see a big bloody mess of an island, millions of dollars are in the toilet and you think ""hm, maybe we should try this again?!"" some numbskull decides to transport a t rex for a viewing in the middle of the city, the scientist who started it all decides to have another go at it.  it gets to the point where you want to hit the old guy in the head with a stick and say ""look at your grandkids, old man, arent they probly warped enough from the first time?""lol anyways.  the first one was the best but in one of the sequels, i think it was the second one but im not certain, they see the kids again and i love the look the kids give them.  its definatly got the whole ""grandads gone nuts, do something, people are gonna die again"" thing going on.jurassic park does for the jungle and science what jaws did for trips to the beach."	5.0	steven at his best	2011-08-08	0	0	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	How many people haven't heard of it?  In ten years JURASSIC PARK has become a contemporary classic and spawned two sequels.  It's definitely among Spielberg's most fun films ever made and one of my favorites.JURASSIC PARK, adapted from Michael Crichton's runaway best-seller, is the tale of a group of everyday people (including a chaos specialist and two paleontologists) who journey to a Costa Rican island to see the brainchild of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) - an amusement park that stretches across the entire island and is of yet top secret.  Disney World copy?  Not so, because this amusement park is home to walking, roaring, breathing and hungry dinosaurs.  Emphasis on hungry.The animatronics are perfect, along with Spielberg's always great directing.  Michael Crichton and David Koepp write the suspenseful screenplay from Chrichton's novel; the cast is also very good (especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum, who would both return in the sequels), not to mention John Williams' always terrific score.  Williams' score really stands out in this one.JURASSIC PARK is definitely a magnificent film and will continue to entertain us for generations to come.  In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films in years.  But don't listen to me jabber about it.  Go see this wonderous thriller for yourself.OVERALL: 4 [Nearly a Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]	4.0	One of the most entertaining films in years	2003-06-19	0	0	0

The 3D is flawless.  It was like it was meant to be in 3D.  There is a feature with Spielberg, who said, he saw what they did with Titanic and he asked the same people to do Jurrasic Park.  He said that when he made the movie, in a way, he as thinking in 3D, yet at the time it was in its infancy stages. Not that he thought of it in 3D, but looking back he said he saw all the way he shot the film with angles and distance.  I found it to be enthralling and one of the most astounding 3D movies ever made.Looks like it was shot in 3D.  And not just a lame conversion at all.  The music is still fantastic.

Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results. The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension. Steven Speilberg will take you to places in this movie that no one else ever will.

It's also one of only a handful of movies ever made based on a novel that was already in preproduction before the novel ever was released.  It's also one of the first movies to use CGI in significant scenes throughout the film.  It's also the movie that gave Sam Neill a break and reinvigorated the career of Jeff Goldblum.  The movie (promoted by the release of the novel about a year earlier) got the general public (and not just kids) excited about dinosaurs again and did to paleontology as a major what RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK did to archaeology.The premise, seeped in pop science, is that a multi-billionaire, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings dinosaurs back to life by cloning the dino-DNA taken from mosquitoes trapped in amber.  He builds a zoological theme-park he calls Jurassic Park.  However, in order to call off a bunch of lawyers after an accident with one of the park's workers, Hammond has to get a group of scientific experts to endorse that the park is safe and viable.  Thus, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) arrive to tour the facilities.  Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello), are also along for the ride as test subjects.  Due to a hurricane and the shenanigans of a greedy employee, the park experiences a major breakdown and the dinosaurs get loose.JURASSIC PARK set records upon its initial release in 1993 and it isn't difficult to see why.  The CGI effects that have become common in just about every movie since then were in their infancy then, yet the creatures appear completely lifelike.  Of course, Spielberg not only used CGI but he had some live action dinos and models involved as well.  It was a massive undertaking, but one that had a huge payoff.There's not much to complain about with JURASSIC PARK.  Sam Neill is great as Dr. Grant (the role was originally offered to Harrison Ford and I'm actually glad he turned it down) and Jeff Goldblum is almost always a delight to watch on screen.  After 15 years of directing his own movies, Richard Attenborough came back for the perfect part as John Hammond.  The action sequences in the film are still as exciting to watch as they were when the film first was in theatres.  The movie is classic Spielberg and those are some of the best movies ever made.This DVD includes a very informative documentary about the making of JURASSIC PARK, some clips from an early production meeting (it's probably the closest an average person can come to meeting the real Spielberg), some storyboards and other illustrations, Phil Tippett's Animatic of the ""Raptors in the Kitchen"" sequence showing the raptors as they were originally conceived with having lizard-like tongues, trailers for all three JURASSIC PARK movies, a dinosaur encyclopedia featuring the dinosaurs seen in the movie, some production notes, and a list and partial filmography of the cast & crew."	5.0	We're Going to Be Extinct.	2006-09-01	16	13	3
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A184PHYDPJWS3K	Tyler Jacobson	My thoughts about Jurassic Park were AMAZING!!! Even though it came out in 1993 when I was only 1, I still claim the movie is amazing! In fact it is my favorite movie of all time.One of the most successful movies in all time is also a movie that changed the way movies were made forever with it's awsome computer animation.What made me think the movie was so awesome, was the life like dinosaurs. But my favorite part was whith the T-Rex. It was the most amazing thing I had ever saw the first time I saw it. Spielberg really made an awesome movie that time.From what I think, Jurassic Park was an success, but The Lost World didn't do as good as the firt Jurassic Park. But then there was Jurassic Park111 which was practicly a failure. I mean whith the spinosaurus and somehow it always finds the people. Sort of like Godzilla...sort of.Also from what I heard, is that there is going to be another Jurassic Park..Jurassic Park4. If there is going to be a Jurassic Park4 then the first thing I want is the T-Rex to be king again. The next thing is John Hammond to be back. And maybe Tim and Lex back also. Then I would like the original music back from Jurassic Park.I would like the movie to take place on Isla Nublar, I mean that it would be cool to see the visitor center in ruins. And also from what I heard was that John Hammond might die in Jurassic Park4. Then he would pass down Ingen to Tim. But John Hammond can't die.....John Hammond is Jurassic Park..John Hammond dies.....Jurassic Park dies!	5.0	My thoughts about Jurassic Park history.	2003-11-07	3	2	1
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AYQF4Z1EQDACU	Tyler Reece	One of the greatest movies of all time. Steven Speilberg's thrilling blockbuster masterpiece that became the highest grossing movie in worldwide box office history for some time. On an Island of the coast of Costa Rica, John Hammond has set up a biological reserve with genetically engineered dinosaurs, the result: JURASSIC PARK. He has invited paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, Paleobotanist Dr. Elly Satler, Dr. Ian Malcom and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. When the power is shut down and the dinosaurs get loose from their electric fences. the park is no longer safe. The menacing T-Rex,Velicoraptors and many others are out on the island. What began as weekend excursion became a fight for survival from prehistory's greatest beasts. This film is one of Speilberg's best,an imaginative,brilliant,thrilling roaring ride,a triumph for all ages to enjoy. Steven Speilberg was the king of movie animals from JAWS to Jurassic Park. One of the most honoral films ever and  one of the most honorable for visual effects, the dinosaurs are one of the most real looking animals ever on the screen. I recommend this for a dinosaur movie,a speilberg movie and great movie all around. If Like Jurassic Park you should see the Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. this is an thrilling epic not to be missed and it seems only yesterday this was this ruled the box office in 1993, it is the highest grossing movie of 93 and in my opinon the best of 93.

It has stood the test of time.  It's always a movie worth watching, like if you're looking for a movie to watch even though you've probably seen this lots of times it's definitely one that can keep you entertained.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Spielberg has always excelled at directing thrillers. While Jurassic Park is far from his best film, it's an entertaining thrill ride for older kids and adults. Others have given a pretty good synopsis of the plot, so I'm going to focus on the technical side and strengths/weaknesses of the film.The visuals are still stunning nearly a decade later. The transfer is first rate with stunning clarity and no analog artifacts that I can see. The dual layer disc is one of the few where the transition between layer 1 and 2 is handled well (some go into still mode during the transition as the least opportune times). Audio mix is quite good as well and managed to give my system a work out.The extras include a very good documentary: test footage using stop motion Go Motion; storyboards from the various effects sequences; trailers for all three movies (although only the teaser trailer is included for the 3rd film. Understandable given the fact that it was still in postproduction at the time the DVD was first issued); an early pre-production meeting that gives us a peak into the creative process and a short documentary on how the foley artists created the sound effects.The film isn't without its flaws. Crichton's original novel was filled with a lot of assumptions and scientific blunders (using frog DNA to fill the gaps? Why when birds are the closest living relatives? The lysine contingency, i.e., the fact that the creatures are dependent on outside food sources for lysine and will die without it is goofy. We're all (including humans) dependent on our food sources for lysine). There's a mighty leap of faith when it comes to extracting the DNA from insects. Who knows what you'll get? Still, like most science fiction the story is a valed morality play so I suppose we can forgive the scientific implausability of the film (read The Science of Jurassic Park if you're interested in any of this).The most important fact to keep in mind is that Spielberg designed (like Crichton)Jurassic Park as an entertainment with a moral. Keeping those flaws in mind, it's an entertaining and at times awe inspiring film. Hitchcock used to alternate his serious work (Vertigo) with his popcorn work (North By Northwest). Spielberg has taken a very similar approach to his career since the early 80's.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A2H4G2AEGQ23Y	Will Black	Man this movie is intense. It is soo great. At the time, it had to be the best movie of the year. Spielberg really mad a classic out of that movie. Now it is an 8 year old movie. In the movie it shows how scientest fickle around with dino DNA, and frog DNA to create...Dinosaurs. It might seem as if everything is going right at firtst, but the senario of the movie is changed. The big turning point of this flick is when the power shuts down, and the dino's start exscaping. Not good. SO get up and go rent this and you will see that it is a wonderful movie. Also in 1998 ,i think, spielberg brought Jurasic Park back with &quot;The Lost World&quot; (a sequal to Jurasic Park). Now this movie wasn't nearly as awesome as the first. But it still was a good movie. Just the people actually new what they were up against, they were prepared, but in the first they were not as prepared and that is what makes it so intense. So go watch this and enjoy it.	5.0	AN AWESOME ACTION THRILLER!	2001-02-17	0	0	0

I do not have a 3D TV but I am sure it would be totally awesome in 3D!!! It puts you in the movie and I am totally blown away, it is even much, much more scary than all the other formats. I have a 15&#34; Velodine sub woofer and I thought the ceiling would cave in on me!!!!! Parents beware it is very, very, very graphic and you should consider not letting your younger children view this all time classic!! I can watch all three movies every month and cannot get enough. My wife ask's me not to mouth all the words but I do anyway. Get it and you will not be disapointed.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A3O536E2YOKK4Y	Wuchak	"I saw ""Jurassic Park"" at the theater with my then-girlfriend wife in 1993. There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers. The story is a good-enough stage for the dinosaurs and the characters are okay. As my title blurb points out, this is essentially a Disney adventure with horrific dinosaurs.The latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive. The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation. (""Jurassic Park III (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"" does the exact opposite and suffers for it). When the t-rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying. Two other thrilling scenes are memorable - the t-rex chasing the jeep and the closing velociraptor sequence, particularly in the kitchen.As far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough. She doesn't trip my trigger in the sex appeal department, but that's just a matter of taste. The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus. Wayne Knight plays the quasi-villain and he originally struck me as wandering off the set of another movie. Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.The film runs 127 minutes and was shot in Hawaii, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.BOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good-enough. This is a straight-ahead family-friendly adventure with little depth and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since the film delivers what we came for - realistic-looking dinosaurs, and more - total horror.GRADE: B"	4.0	Family adventure mixed with total horror	2012-12-16	0	0	0

Only JP-I can really offer you breath-taking scenes.

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A95A9XOSHTQKX	"YeahSoMaybe? ""computersandmusicperson"""	"I love this movie.  It's an amazing story.  I read the book and have owned various releases of it over the years.  So JP comes out in 3D and I get excited.  (I have a 60 plasma that supports 3D.  I thought this would be the movie that makes me go out and buy the 3D glasses.)  To be honest I normally regard 3D as frippery and an annoyance.  However, Universal spent $10 million alone on making this remaster an excellent experience.  I'm sure it is.  I almost bought it.I did some research to see what the quality differences are (if any) between this new 3D Blu-Ray version compared to the 2D Blu-Ray version.SHORT AND SWEET:  There are problems with the color rendition (sometimes called ""Color Timing"") on the 3D version.Go to Youtube and search for ""Jurassic Park Blu-Ray, Side by Side comparison""I'm sure the 3D is awesome but I won't trade it for accurate color balance.This practice of remastering movies with what's called the ""Blockbuster look"" (teal / orange cast) is a practice of late with the Hollywood studios. It's supposed to only be used in certain scenes but the studios go ape and put it on EVERY scene.It reminds me of Jeff Goldblum's line in the movie(paraphrased):  ""You should have asked yourselves just because this * could * be done whether it * should * be done.I can say my 2D Blu-Ray from the import JP Triology set looks stunning.  The only Blu-ray disks I have that rival it for visual quality are Lawrence of Arabia, Baraka, and the iMAX scenes in the Christopher Nolan Batman blu-rays.  The audio - geez - it's a perfect surround mix.  And I only have 5.1.  I can only imagine what 7.1 surround is like with this.Your mileage may vary.  3D is not a big deal to me.  Picture and sound quality is.  If you are into 3D buy it - just realize there's a color rendition quality trade-off in doing so.Over and out."	4.0	There's a reason I did NOT buy this Blu-Ray in 3D -  COLOR BALANCE	2013-09-10	1	1	0

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A1PXGVYBOQ3SQC	Yoda	This movie is spieldbergs greatest masterpiece. While Schindlers List may be his best movie on story, this is far better. The story is very simple and with a movie about dinosaurs rampaging how complex could it be in the  first place? The effect may not be as overwhelming on the small screen, but  considering the power of this movie it shouldnt take long before you are  engulfed in it. This is in no means a classic based on deep and riveting  story line like the above mentioned schindlers list. It is more of a  classic because of the extremely high entertainment factor based of  effects, and the fear that is conveyed from the actors to you. I remember  when this first came out I was about 9 and I saw it 24 times in the  movies(seriously), and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic.	5.0	Greatest Movie of All Time	2000-06-19	6	0	6

0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	A36QWEFBJDCVH0	Yuko Shinozaki	I was just a 20 something year old when I saw this in the theaters and it was incredible! The digital characters were of quite good quality for that time as well as the animatronics they used with the digital images. The cast was solid and the humor to scary scene ratio was perfect. This remastered 3D version updates this movie perfectly for my children to enjoy it as well! The only thing I can compare this movie to as far as epic adventure movies go would be Transformers 3! But that is only because of Transformers 3 was 3D. The first transformer movie had better writing and so that movie is more comparable to this in that aspect.	5.0	Excellent 3D Conversion!	2013-07-08	0	0	0
0783222734	Jurassic Park (Widescreen Edition) [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"Far too many times, movies that tackle very complicated, edgy topics end up taking too much of a ""black and white"" approach and not showing the shades of grey that exist in all areas of life.  Fortunately, director Steven Spielberg doesn't let this happen, and instead lets the plot play out to its fullest.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic Park"" sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs.  However, in order to get the corporate ""O.K"" on the whole project, Hammond calls in two scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective.  However, largely due to some corporate intrigue, the park is completely shut down during the tour, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably.  The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.What really gives ""Jurassic Park"" a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't ""take sides"".  Equally screen time is given to both perspectives: educational and biological.  The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.Overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters.  Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later."	4.0	Playing God	2010-12-31	0	0	0
