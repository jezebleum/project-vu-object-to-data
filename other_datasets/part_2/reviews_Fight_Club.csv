B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AAQ9ECTGUSUVT	01001101 01100001 01110010 01101011	Fight Club is a metaphor for embracing our humanity, in all its gory glory, in the face of crushing modern pressures to settle for sterilty and comfort instead.  I watched this movie repeatedly before I took the plunge and quit my soul sucking corporate job.  It's been a ride ever since.If you liked Fight Club, check out American Beauty, Office Space, and The Matrix.  They all riff on basically the same (worthy) theme.	5.0	It's not about the violence	2008-05-22	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8	"1337 ""It'll either be night to treasure or a ..."	Fantastic movie. I had mixed feelings and feelings that the movie would get destroyed eventually, because it looked like there was a sect, and people shaved their heads, I felt like they were like nazi at some point. I was like: what the hell is this movie? God I hate nazis. And I was wrong. Thought this was the end, but it wasn't. A movie changed. The dude turned out to be crazy. In fact he is insane, but it also changes. The ending when he tries to pull a plug on everything he achieved, I thought was another imminent downfall for the movie. It did not happen. The dude tried to kill himself, it didn't happen. And then.. the ending. It made me rate the movie from 4 to 5 stars. it was amazing. The whole ending was just amazing.	5.0	Publish it in 4K quality!	2014-02-19	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AK1TMZ8NSAL9Q	"A. Anderson ""ann0314"""	This movie was remarkably well done. It mixes wit and suspense with a &quot;What's wrong with the world these days?&quot; flare. Brad Pitt is outstanding-he plays a bit of a nut, as he did in 12 Monkeys. The person that makes the movie though is Edward Norton...with such movies as Rounders  and American History X..it isn't hard to see how that could be. The movie  had me from the beginning to the very end. It's hard to say much about it  without ruining the movie, so the best I can say is that it is a wild ride  that takes you through the life of a person at his breaking point..if you  liked Falling Down...this is 1,000 times better and had more twists than  6th Sense. Definitly a must see for those who don't like movies that are  predictable, and people who like movies that are fresh in concept. I would  actually buy it [now] just so I could be watching it while everyone  else was waiting for the price to drop..I watched it 4 times in 2  days...it's definitly a movie you watch more than once!	5.0	Take Your Seat..You're in for a RIDE	2000-05-05	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A13G33EI52T6LN	Aaron	"Fight Club is a wonderful movie.  Even though it gets a little weird and past itself at the end, it is still great to watch.  Fincher is one of the best directors around and never compromises.  Norton and Pitt are top notch as usual.The first half of the film is really the best.  ""The things you own, end up owning you.""  The scene where Pitt threatens the 7-11 clerk to follow his dream of being a veteranarian or he'll kill him.  Why men join the ""fight clubs."" These are themes that I wish the movie would have explored more.  Instead the second half takes us on a rollercoaster plot to blow up a bunch of office buildings.Another great Fincher film.

Back in those days movies were either thrillers/action or comedies or romantic comedies .. and such. This movie was like a breeze of fresh air .. totally standing out from the stereotype ..... What can 1 say about the story .... the more you watch it ... more you fall in love with it .... You walk out for 5 min ... and you totally lose the thread .... Visually compelling .... powerful dialogues ..... and total powerhouse performances .... Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are mind-blowing ..... rarely get to see Brad in such a role (Snatch is his next best) .....

Imagine an underground chamber like a cave, with an entrance open to the daylight, and running a long way underground.  In that chamber are men who have been prisoners there -- since they were children, their legs and necks being so fastened that they can only look straight ahead of them and cannot turn their heads.  Behind them and above them a fire is burning, and between the fire and the prisoners runs a road, in front of which a curtain-wall has been built, like the screen at puppet shows between the operators and their audience, above which they show their puppets.&quot;  (Plato; trans. H.D.P. Lee)&quot;We are shown the ascent of the mind from illusion to pure philosophy, and the difficulties which accompany its progress.  And the philosopher, when he has achieved the supreme vision, is required to return to the cave and serve his fellows [by telling them about the Truth which he has seen...], his very unwillingness to do so being his chief qualification [for they do not want to listen... the knowledge of the Truth hurts their ears, disturbs their illusions...questions their living and their  lives...].  As [Francis M.] Cornford pointed out [in his edition of *The Republic*], the best way to understand the simile [of the cave]is to replace 'the clumsier apparatus' of the cave by the cinema [the movie theater!!].  It is the moral and intellectual condition of the average man from which Plato starts; and though clearly the ordinary man knows the difference between substance and shadow in the physical world, the simile suggests that his moral and intellectual opinions often bear as little relation to the truth as the average film does to real life.&quot;  -- H.D.P. Lee, *The Republic.**  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *	5.0	&quot;Step forward...into the cave...&quot;	2001-08-18	2	0	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2G4HD2GFUHBE6	A Customer	ok, i must admit that this is a good movie.  even with the blatant product placement, big hollywood actors (well 2 at least) and a seemingly unlimited budget, this was a great film.  when i first saw this movie, i was amazed with my jaw wide open, wondering how this could get so many terrible reviews!  the actors are excellent, and the amazing direction by david fincher is just that... amazing!i (like most people) saw past the fighting and violence to see the movie's underlying meaning:  our lives are so controlled by what we own, who owns things, our corporate ties, our wealth, and so on.  BUT... after seeing this movie about 6 times i wondered, what is the book like.  well after reading it i found that it is so much better than this film that i don't even like the movie much any more.  the book doesn't focus on excitement, fighting, cool camera tricks, or despicable corporate advertising!  it focused on the futility of our existence!  why we are here, how much we really know about ourselves, and so on!  the movie barely touched on these issues.  the movie was a thriller that surprised us at the end.  that was about all.  the movie really butchered many scenes, and excluded some really important plot details.  the book is also written in the most unconventional way i am aware of!well, my real point is that this is really a &quot;guy movie&quot; meaning that mostly guys will enjoy the violence, and the overpowering testosterone influences, but may not be interested in any deeper meaning.  the book has much testosterone as well, but it is more important to the plot.  i recommend reading the book after seeing the movie to see what i mean.  i could be completely wrong, but this is just my opinion.  2 3/4 stars	3.0	good movie, but the book is so much better...	2001-04-02	3	1	2

The Fight Club DVD is better. Sound &amp; picture are excellent, but that's to be expected. What makes the DVD special is all the additional features that make you enjoy the movie even more. This DVD does what DVD's should: give you an in-depth look at the filmmaking process. It also makes good use of the angle and audio button on you remote, (yes, those two - the ones that were collecting dust) giving you shots of scenes from all possible angles. The commentary tracks (plural!!) are good, but my one beef is that some seem spliced together, creating a weird listening experience. All other features, notably the public service announcments, are very good. Worth the purchase.ac	5.0	Best DVD. Yes, it really is.	2001-02-11	4	3	1

This is probably up there in the top 100 movies of all time.  Its in my personal top 5.  Look, it was exciting.  True, it wasn't a movie where they go around beating people up, but there was a good amount of harddcore fighting.  Yet, it also managed to keep an incredibly interesting plot throughout, with a surprise ending as good as that in the sixth sense.  Yet, on top of all taht, it's funny!  Yes, there are some truly funny parts in this movie.  I can't see why anybody wouldn't like it.  So, if you're willing to try something new, and get a terrific blend of action, and deep htought buy this movie now!	5.0	Brilliant!	2001-06-22	2	0	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2WDL6CSXAXHMX	Adam J Pepin	&quot;Fight Club&quot; is the best picture of the year.  No, I'm not surprised that it was spurned at the Oscars. Most films of this nature never receive immediate praise, but become classics nonetheless. David  Fincher is quickly becoming one of the best directors we have. It is great  to see that someone's not afraid to take risks in film-making.  Also,  Edward Norton is fantastic; I love his acting.  He's real, interesting, and  fun to watch.  This film does have an odd twist, which I'll admit, is tough  to swallow, but if you show patience (and an open mind) &quot;Fight  Club&quot; will certainly pay off.	5.0	If you were forced to watch &quot;Titanic,&quot; this will help	2000-04-24	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A24PCDGVKRNUCV	Adam Perin	The best reason I can think of to see this movie is just the fact that you've never seen anything else like it.  Considering most of what today's Hollywood puts out, that should be enough.More to the point,  &quot;Fight Club&quot; is simply brilliant.  Brilliant that is, for the  right audience.  It's not for the faint of heart, it's not for anyone  wanting mindless action, irrelevant banter, it's not for someone who wants  a simple story told in episodic fashion.  And yes, it's probably not for  the squeamish, either.  It's not supposed to be.It's a complex narrative  focusing on the life of a nameless narrator (Edward Norton) as he copes  with his own feelings of emptiness, drudging through day to day life  without direction or satisfaction, filling holes in himself with  meaningless material wealth.The Fight Club, which he co-founds with  Tyler (Brad Pitt) serves as a place where he and other &quot;lost  souls&quot; find some spark to life, something beyond the prestige of  owning all the designer furniture from IKEA.  At the Fight Club, everyone  is equal, anyone can dominate.  As Norton says in voiceover during one of  the meetings, &quot;this kid, Ricky, a supply clerk, couldn't remember  whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ink...but Ricky was a God  for ten minutes last week when he trounced an actuary twice his size.&quot;Many critics of the movie, I think, are missing the point.  They see it  as some kind of white male anger movie that condones going out to beat the  hell out of someone to feel alive.  That's not the point.  If you come away  from this film thinking that, you need to watch it again.  I think overall  this film is about the feeling that there must be more to life than  this...something everyone feels at one time or another.The film moves so  fast, you need to see it twice to take it all in.  It bursts out of the  gate at the beginning and takes the attitude that if you can't keep up, too  bad.  For two and half hours, the tempo doesn't slow down much.  But this  isn't because of scene after scene of action...the story itself just moves  that fast.If you haven't seen this movie, put aside all the sniping and  SEE IT.  Excellent acting, superb dialogue, incredible direction (David  Fincher is one of the up and coming BEST in the business), and, finally,  it's FUNNY.  That seems to be overlooked a lot but this movie could been  seen as a very dark comedy (in fact, Fincher himself regards it as  that.)It may not be for everyone, but if you want a good, unique,  intelligent and bumpy ride, give it a look.	5.0	A Unique and Brilliant narrative	2000-02-18	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ADNMYGOEWWWX	Adam Schulz	The answer is:  It's too good of a movie.  It makes you feel like you should have known what was up, but you never had a clue until the end.  There is so many hints you almost feel stupid for not catching them.  It is better understood the second time around.  And even more so the third.  Just give this movie a chance.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2S166WSCFIFP5	"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com"""	"It's hard to limit one's review of Fight Club. It's such a great movie and there is so much going on that I could write pages on it. But I'll do my best to keep it short. In my opinion this is one of the best movies, not just of our time, but of all times. The story is so full of political, social, and philosophical statements and themes, and there is so much going on in every scene that you can't just watch it once or twice or even three times. This movie demands to be watched over and over. To start with we have one of the best directors of his generation: David Fincher. I've no doubt that he'll one day take his place among the greats: Hitchcock and Kubrick. It has two of the best living actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who so fit their character that it is easy to forget that they are not Tyler Durden and Jack. And Helena Bonham-Carter is heartbreaking in this movie. The set design, wardrobe, and special effects are spectacular, but without overshadowing the story itself. This movie ranks with Citizen Kane, North By Northwest, and the Star Wars trilogy as the best movies of all times.Now for the dvd. First of all whoever designed the packaging did a brilliant job. It is a two disc set in a slipcover case designed in such a way that you can think of no better packaging for this movie. It even includes a small booklet ""How to Start a Fight"" which various members of the production staff chronicle the making of the movie. They even include quotes from reviewers, both good and bad. Disc One contains four commentaries. The first is David Fincher alone, and his commentary puts so much insight into the film you have to watch it again immediately after the commentary. The second commentary is Fincher, Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena. And if you thought that Fincher put in as much insight as he could in the first commentary then you'd be wrong. The third commentary is the novelist, Chuck Palahniuk, and screenwriter Jim Uhls. They add another level of meaning to the movie. And it is especially nice to hear Palahniuk's take on the movie. The final commentary contains five important members of production. Director of Photographer Jeff Cronenweth, costume designer Michael Kaplan, production designer, Alex McDowell, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Haug, all of who add another level of understanding to the movie. There is even a little bit of Doc Baily who was the digital animator of the final scene. Disc Two contains all sorts of supplemental material such as outtakes, deleted scenes, 17 behind the scene vignettes, publicity, and more.All in all this is a smart movie that everyone should watch (and let's not forget, this movie is hilarious). And as a dvd, it is what all dvds should be made like."	5.0	This is the movie of our time	2002-05-28	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	... once you get over the violence in the film.Yes, the movie contains a lot of violence and other sorts of disgusting stuff (bags of fat from a lyposuction clinic, etc.) - which is intentional, but you'd have to watch the movie a few times to get over these things and get to the points it raises.I think that 'Fight Club' is somehow similar to 'Dead Poets Society' in its message about how wrong conformity is. But where 'Dead Poets Society' is very naive and is plainly from the teen age point of view, 'Fight Club' is the adult version of the same theme, more cynical and disillusioned. 'Dead Poets Society' gives you some hope when it ends, even after Neal is dead, and you see Mr. Keating leaving the classroom after being fired, because his message would 'live on' with his remaining students. While in 'Fight Club', on the other hand the ending is seemingly happy - 'Jack' has gotten Tyler 'under control' (I'm trying not to spoil this for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet), but we all realize that all the damage that's already done has to be fixed, and that the 'Space Monkeys' are still around to do some more.I think the movie goes beyond showing us in what a 'rotten' society we live in. Even though Tyler tries to build a completely opposite kind of society, but instead of creating a 'perfect' society based on lessons learned from mistakes we've made, he gets a very similar society, that suffers from the same problems that ours does. Does the phrase 'group of nameless people dressed the same' describe Tyler's 'Space Monkeys' or what he sees as 'slaves with white collars'? Tyler can only give 'Jack' a view of his problems - not find a solution for them. Even when he tries, 'Jack' finds himself in the same place he started in. In one of the commentaries someone says that Marla is the equivalnet of 'Jack' only she has her life under control. Only when he makes peace with Marla, does he start to actually solve his problems, and not expect someone else to do it for him.	5.0	A movie that will change the way you think...	2002-06-04	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	This movie was awesome. Very awkward at parts, but quite passable. The fighting and action was crazy, but watchable. Edward Norton is a very good actor, and he's so damn cute. He has a great scene, where His Boss Enters the room, and he starts to kick his own butt. He punches Himself repeatedly, and Proceeds to throw Himself into a Glass Shelf, and He's very, very bloody, By the End of it All.Blood can be Seen, On His Face and Shirt, but He gets Pay For the Rest Of the Year (50,000 grand or so), And is Emancipated from His Dead End job!! I loved the character He played. Apparently, He was Nameless in the movie. However, I skimmed through the Wikipedia page, and it stated His name was Jack. We'll just say He was Nameless. &lt;3I think the most interesting character though, was the chain smoker, Helena Bonham Carter aka Marla Singer in the movie. She was quite intriguing to say the least.Pros: Nice fights. Lots of blood. Some violence. Explosions, FTW!Cons: You see Brad's abs, but we fail to see his wonderful backside.

Enough already with passive criticism, Action needs to take on, So far, So good.Fight Club is a unique story of every day odds against the uncomfortable human tolerance that has become all about consuming, we are consumers, and we at some point asks the inexorable question of our own existence that has become nothing more than a compulsive pushing for the perfect life in this none sense world of Sit-Coms and junk food, slowly learning the fact that we will never be Rock Stars or movie Gods, even though we have been raised to believed it (a quite hypocrite statement by movie God: Brad Pitt), in contrast, the more you are an stupid and superficial teen, the more you will fit into this society (Teens are the biggest social group of consumers, and maybe, the dumbest of all. Almost every market have target them), buy today's top music hits, buy today's latest designer's clothes, buy today's newest video game, buy sex, buy your happiness, this is your life, and is ending one second at a time.The audacious and keen artisan, David Fincher, narrates with a fine eye and straight style the anarchical story written by Chuck Palahniuk, of this underground fighting clubs, and how its individuals develops a revolution of idealistic breakthrough, towards self freedom. Eye opener, violent, and rough, Fight Club is an honest and fair critic towards this superficiality. Of course, Palahniuk takes it to the extremes, and Fincher portraits it with humor and deep understanding of its concept and message. Brad Pitt as the anthological Tyler Durden, brings credibility and force to this character, a very good performance, Edward Norton as The Narrator (also known as Cornelius, Travis, and other stupid names), conveys both fragility and moral strength to his excellent work, both actors and the director as a team are simply magnificent. Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf are great two. But, what is the pathological profile of The Narrator and Tyler Durden, both as the same person? Well let me tell you: According to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic Criteria for the most common Mental Disorders), the two protagonist (as one individual), clearly shows the patterns of the Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, 300.14). The various criteria for this disorder are: A. The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self). B. At least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior. C. Inability to recall important personal information that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. D. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during Alcohol Intoxication) or a general medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). In children, the symptoms are not attributable to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.Individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder may manifest post traumatic symptoms (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, and startle responses) or Post traumatic Stress Disorder. Self-mutilation and suicidal and aggressive behavior may occur. Some individuals may have a repetitive pattern of relationships involving physical and sexual abuse. Certain identities may experience conversion symptoms (e.g., pseudoseizures), or have unusual abilities to control pain or other physical symptoms. Individuals with this disorder may also have symptoms that meet criteria for Mood, Substance-Related, Sexual, Eating, or Sleep Disorders. Self-mutilative behavior, impulsivity, and sudden and intense changes in relationships may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. Dissociative Identity Disorder appears to have a fluctuating clinical course that tends to be chronic and recurrent. So, I hope this explains it to you, dear Amazon reader.An accurate and psychologically intone photography adds a lot to the film's content, also the excellent music by the Dust Brothers, brings more humor to the humoristic scenes and more power to the Fight and moral exposure scenes. Great script, but the problem of the film is that it's ambiguity doesn't lets the narration explain in a more clear way certain events of the story. Any way, this doesn't really hurts the movie.The two DVD versions are excellent and full of good extras, specially the Two Disc Special Edition. The visual and sound transferring is perfect, an ideal movie to watch on DVD.So, to resume Fight Club's message, and that is: just to give you the finger man, so watch out with the soap Punk.	4.0	Punk and Company.	2004-08-20	2	2	0

I pretty much saw the twist the whole way through but Edward Norton and Brad Pitt keep this movie from sinking into a pool of blood. The premise of the film is pretty simple, no one talks about Fight club etc. This film just seems too out there and never fully exciting. The violence is somewhat brutual but hey Pitt's body is nice to look at. Good movie but not a masterpiece.	3.0	Misunderstood psycho?	2008-06-17	3	0	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1AAN285FE45GP	A. Fultz	I didn't see this movie in the theaters because it had gotten very mixed reviews from the so-called professional movie reviewers.  But, when it hit the local vidoe store, I thought I would give it a try.  WOW, what a kick  in the teeth, interesting, and fast moving journey into one man's mind.  The path this movie takes is fantastic.Norton and Pitt are perfectly  cast, and supported by a crew of fight club members that make for a  well-acted show.  Meatloaf, Ed Gil, Jared Leto, et. al. are great in  support as the members/followers of the leads.  Helena Bonham Carter has  the only real female role in this film and is perfectly cast.  But as much  as the acting, this movie is made by the story.  Unconventional, with a  great twist at the end, the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  As  with many great movies, it is hard to classify the genre (action, comedy,  drama), as there is a sampling of all in this film.  In the end, I would  just classify this as a great film.Much was made of the violence of this  movie when it first hit the theaters.  Those critics overstated the case.  There is blood and violence in the movie, but it is not excessive and it  serves the plot well.If you missed this in the theater, see it now.  If  you saw it once, see it again.  I will.	5.0	This Movie is Why &quot;Professional&quot; Critics Must Go	2000-04-29	238	202	36

There are many of us out there who enjoy a movie for entertainment's sake, and do not wish to use our over-used minds.  However, Fight Club is amazingly entertaining, and not only that it is a picture of what society could become.  In life we become so concerned with what we own and how much we make; we forget to live our lives.  Fight Club beautifully portrays a decaying society, and in the process throughly entertains the viewer.	5.0	Mind blowing	2004-10-10	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1AUOVXPT5MYX4	"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx"""	"Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films (at that time) has already set his stamp on filmmaking. Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven"" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less. Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again. ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka. This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation. ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac. He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore. On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here). This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts. Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great. Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again. Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups. These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says. Norton obliges by punching his ear. Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire. Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other. Naturally, other men gravitate. Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring. The object: Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group. Nihilism by way of Fascism. You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters. Only problem is where does one draw the line? ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Brave and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator. So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as well. Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted. The camera swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his pad even seeing the price for each item. The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top-notch."	4.0	Go Ahead - Hit Me!	2007-10-05	4	4	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1VQY8XWM19IXB	Alan Cerny	FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that cannot be fully judged until several years from its release.  I consider it the BLADE RUNNER of the 90s - BLADE RUNNER was hugely influential and changed film in many ways.  FIGHT CLUB is the same.  It is the ultimate guy film.  I was fortunate enough to see this in the theater and I wish this had done better at the box office, because it deserved it.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt do career work here, as well as Helena Bonham-Carter.  David Fincher has crafted a masterpiece of timing and precision.  You literally do not know what will happen next.Is FIGHT CLUB violent?  Well, duh.  Of course it's violent.  For these characters violence is catharsis.  They are incapable of expressing themselves in other ways.  Does it celebrate violence?  No.  It just shows how it honestly is.  For men, violence IS a rush.  It IS a drug.  And like most drugs, it becomes addictive and unhealthy.  FIGHT CLUB is about men so frightened of change that they have to stoop to violence because they simply can't think of another way.  As the box set says, it is the first film of the new millennium.And how about that box set?  Funny how a film that makes fun of our need for &quot;stuff&quot; has the best packaging of any DVD this year.  But that's part of the movie too - don't need it, gotta have it.  But for the DVD fetishist, this one has everything - 4 commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, hidden stuff, previews and trailers (my favorite are the public service anouncements - those should have been released as trailers).  The picture and the sound quality are top-notch (hopefully Fox will release a DTS version in the future, but that's the only complaint).  The people who produced this DVD knew what they were doing, and now FIGHT CLUB is the watermark to measure all DVDs by.  Even the Criterion collection cannot compete (except maybe for BRAZIL).Love it or hate it, FIGHT CLUB is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a film fan.  And the DVD is pretty much required owning.	5.0	Outstanding movie, outstanding DVD.	2000-12-26	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A31BVQSZUVW9CE	"Alan DeNiro ""alan_deniro"""	...Hollywood could ever hope to make, Fight Club pushes envelopes like a busy mailroom. This is a movie that, ultimately, is a vicious and fun attack on capitalism--usually the subject matter of scrappy indie films,  but not so here. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton have great chemistry--the former  being a revolutionary thoughtful AND sadistic at the same time, the latter  doing his best to drop out of his meaningless corporate life (itself filled  with violence--he checks gruesome car accidents to see whether to raise  insurance rates) with fists flying.  Literally.  Yes, this is an incredibly  violent movie, but the violence isn't senseless--the director and the  actors use violence as a tool to smash easy assumptions about basic  constructions of the everyday reality of American life.  Take this for what  you will, disagree with the film even--but Fight Club forces the viewer at  the very least to challenge his or her own thought process, in a clever,  visceral, sometimes outrageous way.There are so many amazing aspects about  this film that its hard to pin this one down or that one--the great  supporting cast that includes Helena Bonham Carter as a &quot;support group  tourist&quot; and Meat Loaf as a guy with, er, breasts, in his best role  since Rocky Horror.  In this film, you'll find out why a penguin is Ed  Norton's character's spirit animal, the strange origin of soap, how  gruesome the safety instructions for an airplane can be and...well, I'll  stop there.  See the movie, be impressed by how a Hollywood film can  actually break the odds and actually mean something greater than the sum of  its parts.	5.0	Possibly the most subversive film...	2000-04-30	4	4	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1MFGGZ4IQFL8F	A. Leung	Fight Club is the type of film that provokes two types of reactions, the first one being that you have just enjoyed the last two hours immensely, and the second being that underneath the facade of seemingly mindless amd gratuitous violence, there lies a luminiscent core which ultimately constitutes a witty and incisive satirical of modern life.Critics were extremely divided over this one. The majority of them dismissed the film as a thoughtless and manipulative exercise in subjecting the audience to a deluge of obscenities and a heavy but pointless visceral punch in the face.The minority of critics, whom I side with unreservedly, were initiated enough to explain that Fight Club may lead many to the specious conclusion that it is shallow and frivolous. However, they point out quite rightly that after one more viewing, these misconceptions are demolished by what turns out to be an absorbing and intelligent criticism of Western Society.Fight Club is engrossing, humourous, thrilling, raw and primal; it is an exemplary film with an ulterior motive, of which is to impart upon the viewer the tragic reality of the world we live in. And while it goes along with this task, it is vastly entertaining. Violence is not the point of the movie; it was merely the medium through which the angst of the characters trapped within the confines of a bleak life expressed themselves. The movie grips you from the start and maintains its hold until the ending, which, while I'm at it, is actually quite a stunner.The chemistry between the two protagonists, acted to perfection by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, is very appealling, and the antithesis of what they fight for is personified by the character Marla, who  serves to turn this film into a neat, contrasted and well-crafted package. The director ensures that the film is immensely watchable during the whole 2 hour excursion, and when the end comes, it leaves a puzzling yet strangely attractive aftertaste which eventually causes coagulates into the realisation that Fight Club is a great movie.The reason why I don't rate this film with the extra, elusive fifth star is because there are times when it is insensitive, unnecessarily crude and frustratingly inconsistent. These quibbles are minor ones though, and in the end they do not detract too much from the overall experience.Buy this DVD. It is the definitive edition of a superb film that, while not soaring to the great heights attained by the best films of the 90s, manages to reassure us of Hollywood's capability for manufacturing something that is worth watching for what it is.	4.0	Thought-provoking, visceral and supremely entertaining	2001-06-05	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ACAO2J1XCS4FL	Alexander Suraev	That &quot;thought-provoking&quot; mantra of 98% customer's reviews is very yawn-provoking. Do you really need to see the guys beaten into the bloody pulp to start the thinking process?What has prepared Mr. Fincher  for his &quot;penetrating&quot; look at the modern society? Making music  videos for Aerosmith, Madonna and - Oh my God! - Paula Abdul?  Shooting  commercials?I find it impossible to relate to any character, act or  emotion in that film. It seems that for the director and the movie's fans  only 2 alternatives exist - total boredom or extatic frenzy. You are either  a mindless consumer or a fierce destructor. Nothing in between?Ever  heard of contemplation, meditation, elation? Ever saw happy and content  people living their meaningful lifes? I do not mean the populace of Nora  Efron's idiotic paradise but real people living all around. Why is that  fascinationn with marginals?The film starts with the main character's  complaining. Let me translate it for you. - I am obsessed with that  condominium! - In human language it means - I love my home so much! --  I leaf through IKEA catalogue ad nauseam.- It means: - I like IKEA's style  - it's affordable, sensible and contemporary.-- All the contacts in  planes and tranes are brief, one-time.-  - So what? Some of these episodes  are little gems that would be spoiled by prolongation. What do you want? To  follow the guy you've spent a couple hours sitting next to to his home,  meet his family, stay for a week, see the photos, take his grandma to the  park?There are less infantile ways of seeing the world , dealing with  the problems and letting the steam off. Want to kick and punch - go to a  local dojo. It will take you years to learn the right moves.What is so  charismatic about Brad Pitt's pissing-in-a-soup character? Do you giggle  mischeviously seeing him insert a gigantic penis in a kiddie cartoon? That  is nothing else but the result of postponed adulthood of the pisser and the  gigglers.Do you fall for Helena Bonham Carter's heroine - the  psyched-out punk with a small Neanthertaloid face and Halloween hairstyle?  Want to share a room with her and listen to that - Hear me die...- creaking  on a daily basis?You can argue that watching a movie about Hitler you do  not necessarily enjoy what he is doing. But I've never seen Hitler played  by a stud icon. Fight Club guides you where the real excitement is. The  life outside is portrayed as a pitiful parody.What we see is a hellpless  dualism, the love/hate relationship with consumerism. They either wallow in  that or smash their head against that. No one is trying to use it  reasonably, to enjoy the benefits. No one is strong and wise enough to be  above - they either submit or attack.And the touch of conspiracy theory  is added, the much-loved urban paranoia. No one wants to be alone in a big  city, to accept the fact that the world around is mostly indifferent. So  the notion of a club - however weird - is very appealing. And I am sure the  film's fans consider themselves a club of a sort, the union of cool  guys.One of the funniest things is the club's franchising at it's  branding stage. When I see these chemical burn marks on the hands of the  initiated I imagine Tylor going through that eye-to-eye routine hundred  times: - Only when you are at the threshold...blah-blah-blah...you can not  stop the pain...blah-blah-blah...- then the guy drops and he is all  yours.The film has nothing to tell. All that contrieved pretentious  nonsense is laughable in it's efforts to &quot;tell the truth&quot;.  Millions of dollars were spent to glamorize the freaks doing their freaky  stuff and now the studio wants it's money back with the profit.Are you  willing to contribute your time and cash? Better buy something useful from  IKEA.	1.0	I love IKEA.	2000-06-20	83	27	56

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A39IBJB2PBVC7I	Alistair McHarg	"Though stylish and well crafted, it would be hard to find a more disingenuous, manipulative, and hideous movie than Fight Club.  Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful - then, five minutes before the end, a spokesman for the American Heart Association came on screen with a warning that high fat foods cause heart attacks.  Or, imagine a film showing scantily clad women in provocative poses until, five minutes before the end, a representative from N.O.W. came on screen and warned that we live in a sexist society and, simply by watching this trash, viewers are validating her point.  Such is the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.The basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.  To see how a better director approached the idea of innate violence, revisit Clockwork Orange, a masterpiece that director Fincher (Se7en - a much better movie) has certainly studied.  Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.  The second act of Fight Club is an orgy of brute violence with absolutely no redeeming qualities, and the third act offers one of the shabbiest, cheapest, and stupidest ""reveals"" - or ""aha"" moments - in the history of recent film.  Ed Norton is a really fine actor, but his performance is wasted.  Brad Pitt, by contrast, doesn't get beaten up nearly enough to redeem this abomination.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JQRM0U1T8QRO	"Allan Ostermann ""allan"""	This is hands-down one one the best of 1999 (along with Election and The Limey). It is also one of the most sophisticated movies to come out of Hollywood in years. In fact, I almost can't understand how the script made  it through the process. I mean it's anarchist, anti-materialistic, and  offers us Meat Loaf with testicular cancer. Oh, and by the way, it doesn't  really have a lot to do with fighting. That's just a, as they say,  vehicle.I can't wait to see it again. I was so blown away the first  time. I only saw it because I happened to be at a mall at the time, and  someone recommended it.I don't want to give anything away. I just want  to point out that is a venomous attack on &quot;the American way&quot;. In  fact, it puts American Beauty to shame.Norton's character is an  existential shell of a man, living in a Pottery Barn apartment, and  spending his free time checking out the self help circuit just to connect  with the outside world.That's until he meets Pitt. A club starts. Guys  fight. There's a machismo factor. That's what may have sold the script,  because after that the film enters the surreal and dangerous ideas surface,  ideas that, gosh, just ain't American.So see this film, then see it  again. All of the acting is phenomenal, including Brad Pitt. It's one of  the few films of our generation that actually challenges the audience. If  the WTO doesn't make it to your city, see Fight Club. It's just as  subversive, but without the teargas.	5.0	And I thought Brad Pitt couldn't act...	2000-04-20	8	6	2

Based on a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk, this 1999 feature film takes on thirtyish male alienation with a few simple ""Fight Club"" rules (the first two of which are the same, to never talk about it) . . .  but then broadens and deepens into a kind of postmodern satire on the corporate mentality and the perils of perception.  Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter head up a talented, over-the-top cast.  Bells-and-whistles are all anyone could ask, and at this time the DVD is insanely cheap.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1TD9JUXG1DGW3	"Allie Kat ""sarahphin"""	I very nearly did not watch this one, I bungee jumped head-first into the conclusion that it would be about some macho guys fighting to determine who was the most macho. I was so wrong. Edward Norton plays the main protagonist, a cubicle worker for a large corporation, a man who's so devoid of life-force he can only find peace by attending self-help groups for the terminally ill. On a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, an easy-going salesman. They find that fighting - simply fighting, with no animosity or purpose - fulfills a need within themselves. Others join them, until they eventually have a club as fascist and mindless as the corporations they scorn. Along the way, the plot delves into some very dark and masochistic places, and the surrealistic story not so much draws us in, as forcibly abducts us, and we are played with, teased, and disturbed. The acting through-out is excellent. Brad Pitt completely becomes the charismatic Durden, who serves as our guide to this warped Underworld. Helena Bonham Carter is the morbid and trashy Marla Singer, a kind of groupie to the dying. Another excellent job was done by Meatloaf. There is a lot of pain here, but the pain and ugliness gives rise to black and sardonic humour, and by the end every last part of my soul, no matter how hard and critical, had been touched.The questions this story asks are disturbing. How much pain are we inflicting on ourselves in order to feel alive? Are our comfortable modern lives at odds with, and at risk of being destroyed by, our innate need for struggle? When we reject one set of values do we fall prey to another? Oddly enough, given the violent theme and the black humour, there is no meanness here, and the characters are not set up to be made fun of, (which I felt was the case in American Beauty), nor do they need our sympathy. There is no intent on the part of the characters to destroy life, but rather to destroy that which prevents us from experiencing life. I loved it, I loved being held hostage by it, and I am grateful to the artists who made it.	5.0	Really, Really, Really Good.	2000-10-18	38	31	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1KED9UTGDZHSW	Alpha Centauri	"An excellent action movie with a physcological thriller effect that comments on the current tendency of society to obsess over modern-day conveniences and desires to live a posh lifestyle of wealth, self advancement, and comfort.  The paradoxical lives of the lead character's alter-ego in contrast to his depressing modern-day desire for self-improvent and perfection shed light and warning on values of the American public. How consumerism and marketing has brainwashed us and how we have lost senses of ur true selves and the things that makes us individuals.  How we strive to live to the expectations of how we think others will percieve us.  And how the male psyche has been watered down by political correctness, feminization, and ironically our own self perceptions of manhood.  The movie is a satire on how we strive to control our lives against fate and how we depress ourselves trying to live up to something we are not.  And how we give up on being ourselves.  Brad Pitt plays an excellent role.  One of his best acting performances I have ever seen.  The movie has an element of ""Blue Velvet"" feeling to it of a twisted psychosexual control of the male ego."	5.0	A Modern-Day Psychological, Social Commentary Thriller!	2002-08-04	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1YA72SM7JXQ1O	"""always_the_critic"""	I recently saw two movies about middle class crisis: American Beauty and Fight Club.  Fight Club's better.Both are about middle class men getting just a little disillusioned with their lives.  Both document a descent into rebellion and insanity.  America Beauty does this by providing us with a timid, watered down &quot;Surrealism, Unplugged&quot; glimpse that attempts to redeem itself by taking itself far too seriously.  Fight Club does this by punching you square in the nose - definitely the choice for people who aren't afraid of having their sensibilities challenged.It's nice to see a movie that doesn't pull its punches, and it was refreshing to see that this movie was nothing like what the title would imply.  It is further gratifying to see all the confused people who take the rebellion seriously, just as it was fun to see others wet themselves out of fear that their beliefs might be challenged.Ultimately, Fight Club (as well as American Beauty) is about the self-absorption that comes of realizing that things aren't working, and the inevitable purile fantasies of rebellion and revenge that follow.The directing was fantastic, showing quite a bit more originality and creativity than that provided by a bed of rose petals, and the acting was spot-on.  The only downside to this movie was the ending that took itself almost as seriously as American Beauty, attempting to give a logical explanation to everything, rather than leaving what came before as the cartoon that it really needs to be.  Kind of like this review.And, oh yeah, I nearly peed myself, I laughed so hard.  This was just a fun, in-your-face funny movie.

I suppose the reason is because this was the subject of a bomb threat phone call I received about 8 years ago when working in a large call center.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2PUYMR4W89GUY	Amanda	"Have I completely lost my mind? Call me crazy, but I consider ""Fight Club"" to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I'll start off by saying that I am a girl, and this is definitely a guy movie. But I don't care. The one and only complaint that I have about this film is that when its trailer appeared in theaters, it made it look like a beat-'em-up, macho guy-flick revolving around a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other. Well, it didn't sell it to me, and I completely dismissed it. LUCKILY, one of my female co-workers rented it when it came out on video and highly recommended it to me. It wasn't until another co-worker said it was something to check out that I did exactly that: I reluctantly paid the cash to rent it. I went home. I put the tape in my VCR. I fell deeply in love.This film had me from the very beginning. First of all, I had never really seen Edward Norton in any movie before, and if I had I just couldn't remember. I spent the first half of the film marvelling at his wonderful performance as a no-name character who suffers from insomnia and a support group addiction. Ever since this film, I have been a huge Edward Norton fan. And, even though I have never really liked Brad Pitt, I thought even he was perfect in this movie. He plays Tyler Durden, the wild and crazy man Edward Norton's character meets on a plane. They become best friends, and decide to start their own little ""support group"": Fight Club, where any man can join, and where every man takes a beating. Yes, the macho fighting is a major part of this movie, but there is a LOT more to it than that, but that is all I will say because I wouldn't want to spoil anything. I will just say that ""Fight Club"" warrants at least two viewings, if not more, in order to digest everything.When I finally got a DVD player 2 years ago, ""Fight Club"" was one of the first DVDs I bought. The double-disc set is all I could ever want and more: Great commentary by the director David Fincher, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and there is even commentary by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote the novel the movie is based upon (I also recommend that you read that - it's a great book). Plus there are a ton of deleted scenes, public-service announcements, behind-the-scenes featurettes...tons and tons of stuff to satisfy even the biggest ""Fight Club"" fan.People have asked me before what it is I see in this movie. I always tell them I love it because the acting is great, the mood of the film is great, it's funny, it's tragic, it's...a little confusing. It's just overall great. And for anyone who saw the trailer and was turned off, I remind you that looks can be very deceiving. I realize now that had I gone just by what I saw previewed at the theaters and not given it a chance, I would have missed out on seeing a really great film. And given the fact that there aren't too many great films out there nowadays, that would have been a real loss."	5.0	The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: Buy This DVD	2002-11-02	4	2	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A180WAKRIE7PN4	"Amazon Customer ""darknessdreaming"""	I dont think there is enough space to explain what this movie is about so I wont go into detail. However, the central plot is about a disgruntled  yuppie who is in search of something more, a higher meaning to life, of  trying to break out of the zombie mentality that he sees all around in  society. The movie was beautifully filmed, many scenes have a 'trippy' feel  to them and I think you only really start to appreciate that the second  time you watch the film. The lead actors are incredible. I am no fan of  Brad Pitt, but he did a tremendous job. Norton, as always, gives a killer  performance (its only a matter of time until this buy has a shelf full of  Oscars). In terms of a DVD package, this rocks. Two discs worth of insane  Fight Club goodness including 4...yes I did say 4 commentary tracks.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2878VES5TZVQ3	Amazon Customer	Fight Club represents a virtuoso performance from all three of its principal actors (Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter), as well as in the cinematography and direction that transform it into a  surreal experience more meaningful than a first glance might reveal.  Edward Norton is well know for the depth his brings to conflicted roles  (Primal Fear, American History X), but the surprise here is in how  effectively Pitt assumes a persona both supremely irreverant (&quot;God  hates you,&quot; he says at one point) and with the spiritual gravamen of  Nietzche's Zarathustra.Indeed, for all the press given to the violent  aspects of the film, it is not a film about violence.  Nor is violence even  the medium for a greater message, as might be argued of such films as  Saving Private Ryan.  Rather, violence is a passing example of the  existential message the film examples:  What is reality, and how can man  transcend it?  How does man become the ubermensch?  Nietzche is a powerful  spectre over the entire film, and the brilliant and diorienting skills of  Jeff Cronenweth keep you from ever truly pinning down the  &quot;truth.&quot;  This elusiveness is, of course, inherent to the  message.But even as Fight Club examines questions that deal with the  very soul of mankind, it still appeals to the casual viewer.  It is of  importance that the viewer not be drawn into the trap of deriving some  perverse pleasure from the violence.  Rather, the violence so ludicrously  decried by some critics (Ken Turin of the Times likened the film to Nazi  propaganda) is an example of the failures of mankind, something we can be  fascinated by but never approve.  The mystery of the story envelops the  viewer, drawing us into a seemingly normal life that rapidly spirals out of  control into a mesmerizing sequence of revelation and epiphany.  We are  edified along with the protagonist; his confusions are our confusions; his  triumphs are ours; the film's triumph is ours as well.This movie would  easily rate five stars for its searching message and enthralling  production, but it has received such venom from some reviewers that I  cannot in good faith totally ignore their opinions that the movie dwells  too much on the violence.  I must state categorically that it dos not, but  I must recognize that the movei did not appeal to everyeone.  Moreover,  those squeamish of violence with enjoy this movie no more than Last of the  Mohicans:  a good movie with far more violence than this one.  Still,  amovie that cannot appeal to everyone does not merit a full five-star  rating.But as long as you can take a little blood on your way to the  ending, do indulge yourself in the brilliant tour de force--consider it a  philosophy lesson and rollicking trip at once.	4.0	A Difficult But Rewarding (And Entertaining) Experience	2000-06-13	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1NN34SZ7LWB6Y	Amazon Customer	There seems to be one constant in &quot;professional&quot; reviews of Fight Club it seems that each reviewer finds this film to be somewhat confusing and disturbing. I would have to say thats the way I first felt,  then I watched it again, and again, and again. Fight Club isn't about  fascism, homoeroticism, or machismo. Fight Club is a film about taking back  control of reality from the invisible societal forces that run our lives.  Fight Club is about being fed up with complacency and doing something  about. The dark and compelling story is complemented perfectly by Pitt and  Norton's acting and taken even further by Director Fincher's unique vision  of the modern world. Perhaps with the exception of The Game there has never  been a Fincher movie without grime and decay, Fight Club takes this beyond  the sets and into a metaphysical realm. If you are looking for a well made  and well acted film that will provoke thought then this is for you.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A16358DSH3LW21	"Amazon Customer ""megynn"""	Fight Club, for many reasons, was one of the best films of 1999, and disappointingly overlooked. The author of the book on which this film is based (Chuck Palahniuk) introduces us to the main characters in a horifying  scene in which Brad Pitt is about to blow Edward Norton's head off at close  range, with the gun in Norton's mouth. Confused, the audience is lured into  the story which roams through the recent history that explains the opening  scene's situation.The lead characters, played by Edward Norton, Brad  Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, are all quirky, neurotic archetypes of the  20th century - each personality clearly nurtured and twisted by the  materialism and violence and dissatisfaction of urban American life. Their  roles are woven together incestuously as their characters are developed and  unfolded through Fight Club.The club that emerges in the movie becomes  more than just a support gathering, and seems to take on a life of it's  own, like some computer system gone awry - like HAL in 2001. At last, no  one is the leader, and all are bound to be led, to be destroyed.Does  this at all make you curious? Are you intrigued by the film at all? Have I  successfully avoided giving away the important bits of action and  revelation?The most significant thing about Fight Club is how shakingly  close to home the subject matter hits. While we drug ourselves into  indifference with chemicals and furniture and busy-ness, we lose sense of  life itself. We lose power over our environment and over our own individual  existence.

A time when the economy allowed for investors to front money for the production of more risky pictures as opposed to sticking with the conservative 'plastic coated'...'popcorn' garbage that has been produced in the past few years.For a movie that attacks a value system that is partially reasponsible for its production is the sweet irony that made me reflect upon myself when the timing was absolutely perfect.Fight Club is a perfect addition to your Blu-ray collection.  Very reasonably priced.  This movie is a man-cave must.I you liked 'Fight Club' try 'Momento'.	4.0	I Want You To Hit Me - As Hard As You Can	2011-09-10	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A17CBL85MWT15T	A. M. Figueiras	This is vivid proof that there's still some intelligence left in Hollywood: a daring straight-forward, in-your-face story, Fight Club is an outstanding film that takes no concessions whatsoever towards the viewer, becoming a cult film years after its release like often these type of films do, Fight Club is flawless, from the performances to the cinematography to the well blended special effects. Not since Stanley Kubrick a director has been so bold in talking about these subjects of alienation and the nature of violence in the consumer society we live in. It's worth more than one look.	5.0	"""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a  time"""	2006-10-12	6	5	1

And that can be either good or bad, depending in your sensibilities.  Many critics seem to have been thoroughly divided by this film.But everywhere I go, I seem to hear nothing but good things about it from friends and strangers alike.  I have to agree with them; I think this movie has more good things than bad.  It is a mesmerizing story with lots of memorable moments (both funny and dramatic), and it is well-developed.  It has some interesting thought-provoking content, including some comments and themes about consumerism and capitalism.  With a seemingly nonsensical twist toward the end, the plot makes sense in its own way (and seems really sublime on repeated viewings).  Characters are strong; the narrative is very interesting and there are a lot of memorable lines.  Acting and writing are excellent.  There are some interesting special effects, most of which hold up to this day.  Photography is solid, and the editing style is interesting.  It all works together to create some distinctive imagery.  Production design (sets, props, costumes, sets) is excellent.  Music is really interesting (performed by the Dust Brothers).This disc has awesome quality.  The picture is very sharp and detailed, with excellent color and contrast.  There is a fine layer of film grain; it is noticeable and noisy in some scenes, but detracts very little from the image overall.  Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1), with a few of the more exciting scenes being really loud and the rest of the movie being clear and solid.  This disc includes lots of extras, including a few commentaries, some featurettes and deleted scenes ported over from the old DVD release, and a couple of new features (some awards footage and something that lets you fiddle around with the sound mixing on select scenes).  My copy came with a cool slipcover that can fold open.There is also a nice little gag with the menu screen.  If you put the disc in your player and you see a menu screen appearing for a romantic comedy called ""Never Been Kissed,"" don't panic.  The screen will flicker, and the real menu will appear.  Bet you thought it was a manufacturing error, didn't you?I am Jack's joyous satisfaction."	5.0	"""We are the all singing all dancing crap of the world."""	2009-11-29	5	4	1

So I'll just say to this you- this film is a MUST SEE (for men and women). Don't let the trailers and the title scare you. This movie is not at all what you think it is.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1B90H4YYCCCET	Andrea Ellison	First of all, let me respond to the reveiwer below- if you like this movie- you are not a bad person whose judgement should be questioned.If you liked this movie you are an intelligent person who understood the  message it presents.  Fight Club is not about violence and those who like  the film do not necessarily like the violence.  This violent content is  however necessary to deliver the point of the movie.  Fight Club is not  advocating anarchy and does not want you and your drinking buddies to go  out to the nearest bar and start pummeling each other.  The movie in fact  wants just the opposite.Now, some people may not be able to get past  the violence but if you can- you are in store for quite a ride.  Good  acting, score, and quite funny jokes for those who think enough to get them  are all great aspects of this film.	5.0	Not horrible if you understand....	2000-02-21	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	For a while, people have kept telling me to see this movie, saying that it is amazing, and it will change my life, so I went into it with some really high expectations.  It's a shame, because I feel that if I had been expecting a little less, I would have liked this movie more.  I'm not saying that Fight Club is a bad movie, all I'm saying is that I don't get it the way some people do (although there are many people who don't get some of my favorite movies the way I do, such as Lost In Translation and Garden State).Edward Norton plays the unnamed Narrator, an insomniac who is obsessed with material goods, namely furniture.  When his condo, and by default, all of his furniture, is destroyed in an explosion, he moves in with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a strange but intriguing man that he met on an airplane.  Tyler's home could not be more different from the Narrator's; the house was dilapidated, it had almost no furniture, save a few beds and tables, and was beyond an eyesore.  But it doesn't matter because the two men become good friends.  Eventually, they start Fight Club, which is kind of like a support group for men who want to just let loose and blow off some steam.  At first, the two are really into it, and it is a small, exclusive little thing.  But soon it grows until there are clubs all over the country, and membership reaches numbers greater than 1,000.  That's when things start to get weird for the narrator.  People start acting very different around him, and they seem to blindly follow Tyler in whatever he does.Also, there is this girl named Marla (Helena Bonam-Carter, who does not look to good in this film) who is somewhat of a mystery to the Narrator.  She always seems to be over to make love with Tyler, but when they're done, she tries to talk to the Narrator.  He is confused by the situation, and it causes her to get really angry and storm out.I don't know; some of the people I know have said that this is one of those movies that you have to view more than once in order to fully understand, but as much as I enjoyed it, I feel that once is enough for a while.  I would suggest checking it out- as long as you can handle a lot of violence (the movie is called Fight Club, so what do you expect?), and some nudity.	4.0	An Interesting Film; A Bizarre Look At Life	2005-01-30	5	1	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AGH9UVR8C51SC	Andrew Xanthopoulos	This movie was truly spectacular and moving. With a very original plot and an uncany cast, Fight Club is a mind-quenching film on all of it's thought-provoking levels. I saw this film thrice and loved it every time  even more than the last! And for all for all you Brad Pitt or Edward Norton  fans , you shall also be impressed with Norton's usual greatness, and  Pitt's previously unseen side of acting in this film. This is NOT a film  for people who do not like to think beyond what they see on the screen. It  is a film in which can, and should, be seen on many different levels in  order to really understand it. Overall, it is a must-see masterpiece which  will invoke many thoughts and emotions within any open-minded viewer.	5.0	One of the GREATS!	2000-02-10	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2JV2UWIQAKZRR	Andy Beck	I've read some of the reviews on this page and am disturbed by everyone expostulating on the &quot;true&quot; meaning of the movie.  I agree that there is a powerful message, actually there are several.  But I also think that it is for the viewer to decide what to take from the film, not people doling out reviews.  I will break from the norm and avoid touching on what I thought the film meant.  I will say that the dialogue in this movie is fantastic, sometimes funny, sometimes scary.  The fight scenes are ultrarealistic.  The supplemental disk has some really cool features, notably the PSAs and deleted scenes.  The commentaries, from many different individuals, are good.  If you can't handle graphic hand-to-hand violence, don't buy this movie.  If you like memorable characters, smart, funny writing, plot twists, and on-screen violence, buy it now.	5.0	I love this movie	2002-09-17	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AAQOHC2YPMO5G	Angelo	David Fincher is definitely a great Director, his first movie was ALien 3 (Maybe the worst alien made), but not for that is a bad movie. The he made Seven, one of the most succesfull thriller movie made, the game, a good  film but not terrific. Then I buyed this DVD because all my friends say  that Fight Club is the best of the best, When I saw it, I have to say that  is true The fight Club is one the best 10 movies ever made. The plot is  inteligent and the same time full of irony, Brad Pitt made one of his best  work doing Tyler Durden, but who take the show is Edward Norton his  perfomance is brilliant, perfect, and definitely his has to be nominated to  an oscar, and win it.The movie is amazin, but more amazing is the DVD  version, two disc, in the first we have the movie, with no two or three  audio comentaries, FOUR AUDIO comentaries we have in the disc. The movie is  anamorphic and look terrific, is THX certified and is one of the best video  transfer I ever see, except Bugs Life that is a digital direct transfer.  The sound is Amazing definitely one of the most interactive sound, I think  that for that was made th 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround.The second DVD has  more aditional material than any DVD made, has pictures, promotional  videos, even the Spanish promotional videos, Special effects, deleted  scenes, and many surprise.If you want a excellent movie and a terrific  DVD, this is the best choice you can do.I recommend this DVD.	5.0	I can't believe A film of this quality exist	2000-06-28	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1BKMU7Z6D856N	anna	This is a movie unlike any I have ever seen, and a story unlike any I've ever heard of.  The direction, writing, acting, shooting, and music are all brilliant.  It's a shame that the violence (I admit I looked away once) and  the rather extreme and original plot turned so many people off.  Edward  Norton is amazing--he is one of the best (if not the best) actors of his  generation.  Brad Pitt also turns in a great performance, certainly proving  he is a consumate actor and not simply nice to look at.  Helena Bonham  Carter is wonderfully trashy, quite a switch from the beautiful women of  period films she's known for playing.  I think the thing that struck me  most about this film, though (other than Norton, as I haven't seen any of  his other movies yet) was the way it was shot.  Did anyone else notice  Tyler (Pitt) popping up on screen every once in a while for split-seconds  before he actually showed up as a character?  So brace yourself if you  need to and check out this fabulous movie.  Violent, yes, but also (and  moreso) intelligent, creative, and actually often hilarious.	5.0	nothing else like it	1999-12-23	30	24	6

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1DB351WVDZFBF	Anthony Spears	"Maybe I'm a blasphemer for saying this, but I think Fight Club falls short of being as thought-provoking or surprising as others seem to tout it as. Chuck Palahniuk's stuff in general just does not elicit from me any deep or profound thoughts -- not in the slightest; and Fight Club's pop-profundity is kept simple enough for the masses to digest -- the same masses that this movie seems to be poking fun of.The ""plot twist"" or ""surprise ending"" is an old and tired one. The first time I started watching it, I turned it off. Not because of the violence (I've been watching Freddy Kruger since I was in Pampers), but because I knew where it was going. When I decided to give it a full viewing, it turned out I was spot-on. Being that so many people hold this movie to be both sacred and clever -- I thought it would be a lot more creative.As-is, the movie is only ok. I enjoyed the contrast between the gritty fight club ""Superman"" version of the narrator, to his ""Clark Kent"" -- but that contrast was already so clearly defined that it made the ending not only unnecessary, but a huge disappointment.

I think ""Fight Club"" was a pinnacle of David Fincher's career (we'll see). Some people got the movie's message wrong and thought that if you are bored with life - go and beat the [...] out of someone, receive a kick in the teeth yourself and you'll become happy. Everything is not that simple. The film tells us that there is more to life than your everyday breakfast-work-beer-bed schedule. People tend to escape from annoying routine and want something new. This movie is about searching. Searching something new. ""Fight Club"" is really cathartic - it gives the feeling of freedom, it gives hope, it gives the sense of deliverance from the weight we carry on our shoulders (everyone has his own).The movie is entertaining and serious at the same time like other works of David Fincher (""Se7en"" at least) so it's the perfect opportunity to have fun and food for thought in one film. Obviously not for the fans of mindless amusement.I guess the two-disc edition is much better for it has a load of extra features, but it's hard to find nowdays."	5.0	CATHARSIS	2005-09-14	4	3	1

Aside from the eye candy (Norton and Pitt), I don't think it's a movie I could watch again. I know there was some symbolism in the movie, but I couldn't really follow. No doubt though that the acting was really good. I would have to say the way the story unfolded was interesting and it drew me in for a little bit. There were the fight scenes where you can witness lots of bleeding and punching. It has its humor, it has it's dark appealingness to it...it sounds good, but I guess I just wasn't interested. It is not your average movie and it is rather unusual. Maybe I'll try it again another time.

I was forced to watch the film, but after the first ten minutes, i was hooked. The plot line follows an average joe-shmoe (Norton) who's life is going down the sewer.  He then meets Tyler (Pitt), a do-it-yourself kind of mentor.  Together they create &quot;Fight Club&quot;, a free organization of beating.  But this is just the start. Fight club contains great plot twists and every scene is AMAZING.The acting is top-notch and David Fincher (director) keeps the same satire-yet-drama feel as the book.  A must see for everyone.

So that was what was happening!' Since I already read the book before I saw the movie, I knew what was happening all along so I have no say. But my brother and his friends, all of whom watched the movie first, caught on in first twenty minutes and things became kind of stale after that.Then there's the sheer impossibility of it all. Yes, it's a dark fantasy not meant to be realistic in the fist place. Yet the book managed to stay true to life and believable because of the blase manner in which it is presented and the foggy atmosphere of the book. The movie tries too hard for too much and in effect makes itself look ridiculous. The director tries to make everything too cool, so that there's nothing but coolness. The bare suppressed seething rage of the book is nowhere to be seen. Brad Pitt struts his muscles and cool yellow sunglasses, Norton becomes a super-anti-hero, so what.I believe that the movie would have been a lot better if it had kept true to the book's version of the story. This is bad screen adaptation at its worst. The ending was a standard Hollywood &quot;Everything's gone and done now, let's be happy and party!&quot; kind of happy ending. God, PLEASE. This simply isn't that kind of movie! It's meant to be about rage, about loss, about self-contempt, and about all that it promised in the beginning. Going for a cheap trick end, though, it ends on an unbelievable turn and will leave a lot of you disappointed.	2.0	I can't believe it got so many rave reviews!	2003-10-04	13	2	11

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1WC1E7VM3XKXM	armchair-voyeur	The wife and I sneaked into this movie and we missed the crucial first 10 minutes or so.  She wanted to barf (due to the raw violence) but stuck it out.  Even though she didn't like it she stayed because there was something about it that drew her in.  She won't say what it was but it was enough to  get her to sit there through the Fight Club's entirety.  For sure the gore  must have over-shadowed everything for her.I, on the other hand, loved  Fight Club so much I went out and bought the book.  The book disappointed  me and gets a 2-star rating.  So kudos to the screen adaptation...very  talented job in re-writing and adapting the book to movie script!  This was  a clearly under-rated film mired by the shadow casted by the Columbine High  School shooting.I love the social commentary and how true and well it  fits into today's society.  Fight Club is an excellent dark comedy with the  message to fight the power that the media has on our psyche. The fight  scenes are brutal but appropriate for the film's message that we have all  become too soft and disconnected.  ...who  thinks that the brutal fight scenes and chaos in the movie was used to  glorify violence and promote anarchy and social unrest.  To quote Ed  Norton, when interviewed about the movie's violence and message and how it  might promote events like Columbine High shooting in real life he simply  said: &quot;I think that is just lazy journalism.&quot;  I can't agree  more.In my opinion, the gory violence goes to extreme to show how  ridiculous brutal violence is.  The violence was not used to hurt other  people who were innocent by-standers.  It was only inflicted upon men who  wanted the violence to make them feel alive.  So the message is not to go  out there and do harm unto our countrymen but to break out of the mold and  free our selves from the grasp that the consumer society has on us.The  message is we are getting too soft as our lust for material goods dominate  our lives.  We prostitute ourselves for that great job so we can get a loan  to buy all the great and expensive things we must have because the  marketing people tell us so.  Also, we have become too detached from our  true selves and from nature.  We can no longer live simply or simply live.  We measure our success, and others' success, by the ability to accumulate  money and goods money can buy.  Our idea of re-connecting to nature is  taking our gas guzzling SUV out for a ride at the local/state/national park  or worse, our daily commute on our well paved streets and highways!Fight  Club's message is we need to get back to nature and live simply.  Do the  tough and challenging things that make us feel alive.  Setting up fight  clubs to beat ourselves silly  is one example but there are other ways.  If  we need to ask what those ways are then the movie is correct in its  assessment of how far removed we are from our true and simple selves.  We  survived for thousands of year without SUVs, BMWs, the latest bikes and  bike gears, the Versace dress shirt, that beautiful dress or those high  heel shoes.  I can go on but let's get back to the movie...=)The fight  scenes were not made for the audience to enjoy but squirm because of their  extreme.  If you really enjoy the fight scenes check in with your favorite  local therapist.  As for me, the closest I get to this primordial  celebration of manhood is taking up Kardio Kickboxing at the local gym to  lose weight.The director is very dead-on and the actors were superb.  Norton is very talented and Fight Club should have been to him what  American Beauty was to Kevin Spacey.  At this pace Norton should be  nominated if not awarded an Oscar very soon.  Norton's role in this film  makes his work in Primal Fear looks pale in comparison.Pitt shows  maturity  and range in this film...he has been doing a lot of great works  via Twelve Monkeys, the Seven Signs(?) and such off-the-beaten-path movies.  Overall a Fight Club is a great film and will probably become a  classic.I deducted one star for the ending.  I thought it could have  been handled better.  With all the special features in the DVD it is  definitely a collectible item.	4.0	Movie goes to extreme to make a point, not hyping violence.	2000-06-15	5	4	1

With this blu-ray edition, there are a few new extras but what I've only had time for (and the primary reason I'd ever want it) is for the film itself. In high definition, Fight Club is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Great detail, a boost in depth, color and blacks (especially the blacks) and the audio tracks are perfect. All of the supplemental material from the previous release is carried over. I've only watched one of the new extras (where Fincher, Norton and Pitt recently accepted an award for the film and quoted negative reviews; they're introduced by Mel Gibson on a horse?!) but not a lot of new material is needed or wanted. The full package was already there. Very affordable and one of the best blu-ray releases EVER.	5.0	Definitive home video release of Fight Club.	2010-12-26	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"LOL. Good old ""Fight Club"". Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Meat Loaf (?!). OK, I admit it. I loved this film when I was younger. Ten years ago? Watching a TV rerun of it just a few hours ago, I felt nothing special. I suppose I have other interests now.But sure, it's not a *bad* movie. If you like bizarre, unusual stories with unexpected plot twists, you're gonna love ""Fight Club"". It's not a co-incidence that this twisted story is considered a cult movie!The main character (who is unnamed) is a bored, lonely white-collar employee with some pretty weird pastimes who meets a mysterious stranger on the airplane. The stranger, Tyler Durden, convinces him to join a fight club which turns out to be a cover for an advanced terrorist operation against modern civilization. The plan is to recreate a more natural, primitive society with economic equilibrium by blowing up all major credit institutions. Sounds eerily familiar, somehow. The Unabomber? Deep Green Resistance? However, the political message is really a footnote to the rest of the story, with its various subplots, each more insane than the other. ""I know you are a tourist"".Apparently, ""Fight Club"" is based on a novel and is supposed to have some really deep message about the alienation of the late 20th century White male. Or something to that effect. Others see it as a protest against consumerism. I admit that neither I nor my buddies got it. To us, it's simply an absurd cult classic, featuring Brad Pitt - neither more nor less. It's a movie you might like if you enjoyed ""True Romance"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or (perhaps - but that's a very big perhaps) ""The Matrix"". If the film is ""about"" anything, I'd say it's a fictionalized case study of a very severe bout of schizophrenia!And don't forget: The first rule of ""Fight Club"" is... ;-)"	4.0	I just broke the first rule	2013-04-05	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1SI8CKUGT19JB	"""atlantisserpent"""	-Personally fight club is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. it is brutal and in your face with all the wrongs and rights of life. A movie that was truly overlooked until its video release. With the movies cult like success there have been two views created. One view is that fight club is a pointless over thought gore fest waste of time. I believe a lot more women think this then man. Its not a sexist thing, but most guys I talk about fight club with seem to at least some what like it and most women seem to hate it. I think its a little funny because a lot of women love to see shirtless ripped men.-Beyond the who likes what part, we come to the actual movie. Most people who read already know the goods about fight club so will just skip to why they should see it. First of all, despite being the title of the movie, this movie had little to do with fight club. Its in depth look at the go nowhere life of a man in middle management (Edward Norton). So anyone who was turned off by the previews, don't worry its a completely different experience. This movie is based on a book (of the same name) that is intense and well thought out so anyone who thinks this movie might be a scriptwriter's weekend off mission, you should once again think twice. Edward Norton (my favorite actor: American history X, primal fear, etc.) and Brad Pitt give one of the most insane duo performances ever. David Fincher (my favorite director: se7en, the game, panic room, and sadly alien 3) does in outstanding job of making this movie dark and hard to swallow.-I can understand why people would hate this movie. it has a style that is very masculine and has a dark overshadow but no one by any means should over look this movie.	5.0	two sides- i pick the high road	2002-04-03	2	2	0

If this is so, they clearly have a weak knowledge of film, as there are MANY MANY more films out there that are 10 times as violent.I'm not going to bother to write a pretentious, opressive review, and instead tell it to ya straight.Fight club is the tale of an unnamed office worker (played by Norton)- a slave to money and merchandise, living in somewhat of a shrine to IKEA. Bored, disillusioned, and suffering from insomnia, he attends cancer support groups to wallow in sympathy and self pity with others, to alleviate the turmoil of his sad lonley exsistence.His life changes, however, when he meets Tyler Durden- a hedonistic soap salesman- who is literally everything that Norton's character isn't.the rest of the story documents the growth of 'Fight Club'- an underground bare knuckle fighting network that Tyler and the narrator create, and riddled with Tylers twisted anarchic philosophy, the film compels due to its slick direction and sublimely satisfying visceral content.yes, it is violent, but life is violent, and you cant spend your days sheltered from the facts of life.	5.0	Beauty in violence	2002-02-07	6	4	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2J2RIV8YXW0XJ	Avenging Taco	I was 18 when I first watched this movie, and it has been one of the most important philosophical lessons of my life.It has provided me with perspective.  In a world where people mentally torture themselves over trivial consumer pursuits (&#34;The things you own, end up owning you.&#34;), this movie makes a mockery of such greedy, hollow lifestyles.  It provides a reset button and a sense of perspective on what you value and why you value it.  It starts with a chance meeting between Tyler Durden and the Narrator on a flight which through a series of odd events leads to the narrator giving up his middle class lifestyle in favor of moving into a derelict building in a run down part of town.This minimalist lifestyle that the Narrator embraces is ultimately a rebuke of the consumer driven choices he made and the series of desires that he has no reasonable foundation for possessing.  As a result, Tyler and the Narrator become unlikely roommates living in desolate poverty in the ruins of some post-industrial neighborhood.The fight club is initiated by Tyler who asks the narrator to hit him as hard as he can.  This marks the beginning of their male therapy which uses fighting as an outlet for their accumulated repression which has been the result of a lifetime of social mores and feelings of insufficiency because their bank account wasn't big enough, or that they didn't look like the men in underwear advertisements.  After fighting, (&#34;The volume gets turned down&#34;) life becomes manageable and stress free.  The presence of a true adrenaline rush stress has makes office politics and other non-survival related issues utterly meaningless.  The narrator became at peace with society through changing what he cares about, but Tyler remains unsatisfied and seeks greater change.This movie taps into many sources of male frustration, parades them around as the farce they truly are, and then attempts to destroy them.  It is a realist perspective which states that only truly necessary things for survival are important, and everything else is &#34;masturbation&#34;.  It makes you question why you want something, and then shames you for feeling guilty about not having it.  I wish more people would evaluate their desires according to what is necessary as opposed to being led around by popular culture.  Its dictates are fruitless, and will always leave you feeling incomplete and insufficient.Thank you Chuck Palahniuk for writing such an amazing book.	5.0	What you think is important, isn't.	2014-02-22	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A27B02KYOJGSH7	"A. Webb ""avidreader00"""	I am a mother of 3 teenagers and I resisted watching this movie because I, too, thought it was about nothing but senseless violence. As usual, when I pre-judge, I was wrong. This movie IS violent, but the violence is necessary to prove a wonderful spiritual truth: when you are pushed to violence to make yourself feel something..anything in this life, then you need to 'face the abyss' and the horror of life and make something constructive out of the destruction. As Tyler Durdan says (paraphrase), 'It's only after you have nothing more to lose that you can begin truly living.' The problem with Fight Club is that is was VERY poorly marketed as a guy flick with nothing but loose testosterone to recommend it. Well I'll take Norton's and Pitt's loose testosterone any day, but the movie is much more than that. Watch it once, twice, or even four times until it sinks in and THEN AND ONLY THEN, diss it or recommend it.	5.0	Endorsed by Mom	2001-08-04	0	0	0

It has a very original story line, and is well acted. The only idea presented in this movie and that kids seem to take literally...and the part that is REALLY BS...is the line in the movie where the narrator (Norton's character) says that fighting turns your a$$ into stone, or something like that. Folks, fighting is not exercise. It is not healthy. It does not build muscle like lifting weights or burn fat like aerobics. It INJURES, period. It's the ultimate machismo release, yes, but it will damage your body, not harden it up. This was entertaining as a movie, but the idea of kids actually forming their own fight clubs in real life is totally STUPID. It's not cool, guys, it's just stupid.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AKJZ39PJV375S	"""badboyssj"""	A side-splitting comedy, a heart-pounding thriller and a thought-provoking social statement all at once, Fight Club requires several watches to comprehend (it'd also be better to read the book before seeing this). But once you fully understand the plot and take it all in, you'll be astonished at the brilliance of this film.The movie begins with our narrator, Jack, staring at a gun sticking right in his mouth; &quot;People are always asking me, do I know Tyler Durden?&quot; he tells us. I won't say anything more so as not to risk spoiling anything. The acting is superb (particularly from Edward Norton, who plays Jack). The film is full of explosive ideas as well; for instance, there are many anti-consumerism messages. Brad Pitt's character points out to Norton that &quot;the things you own end up owning you.&quot; A little bit ironic considering how well this movie was advertised and marketed by FOX, but ah well.I really can't think of much else to say about this movie; I'm starting to get writer's block so I'll stop here before I start to ramble incoherently.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3EUSH8DPW75LR	barry	FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that has warranted its huge cult following.  Whatever your opinion of the film  it delivers a wallop of intensity and thought-provoking drama in a way that follows no standard film stereotype of storytelling.  This film is very unique and one that many die-hard fans have been anxiously awaiting to see on blu-ray.  Well, here it is - with superb, unique packaging.  But was it worth the wait?  And is it worth a purchase if you have the dvd?  A resounding yes to both.When blu-ray is used to its fullest potential any film takes on a new life.  That is what happens here.  Everything that was intense intensifies - darks take new form, colors are vibrant.  There are many unique scenes and backdrops in this film.  On blu-ray  you see even more clearly what the director wanted to portray.  The 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer is a huge improvement from the dvd especially when it comes to overall clarity and color depth.  The audio is impeccable.  At times you can hear a pin drop and the expected explosions are so realistic you will be dumbfounded.  And all inbetween brings the film to a bigger reality.Fans rejoice.  Finally FIGHT CLUB can be seen in all its glory.  The impressive cast led by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter is astounding and the lead three give performances so creative, so unique and so intense that they rival the best in their careers.  The same is true for director David Fincher - this is truly his masterpiece.I highly recommend this movie in any form but particularly on the superb blu-ray.  This film is so well done it is in no way dated.  One of the best films ever made shown to its greatest potential.	5.0	Review of superb blu-ray version	2010-04-21	13	11	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AIPMN3GKV5KF5	Barrymore Tebbs	This movie is just brilliant. Read the other reviews for more in depth examination, but as a film lover and always preferring &quot;relevant&quot; films, this one stands with the best commentaries on american mores and  standards like &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. As  a fan of great cinema I was flabbergasted. I own all of Fincher's films and  he ranks as one of our most important voices. As a man watching a film  about being a man in today's society I was shaken to the core of my being.  I've spent days re thinking my own addictions to consumerism, my fear and  loathing of other men, unresolved conflicts with my father...this movie  does what i want every movie i see to do..change me through the experience.  PLUS the DVD release is so chock full of extras it will take me a month to  get through it all!	5.0	A Brilliant American Film	2000-06-19	2	1	1

I most sympathize with the reviewer who said that it wasted two hours of her life.Honestly, folks, what is it about?  The acting and cinematography are excellent.  The dialogue is that ""quirky and edgy"" garbage that passes for ""Literary"" writing these days.  (Read Hemingway to learn how people actually talk.)But the plot is mindless.  It's all about showing off how progressively weirder you can pile things up as a writer, but it is just plain nonsense.  It reeks of Iowa School plotting.  Or Irvine.  Which is the only part of California technically located in Iowa.Rent ""The Station Agent"" and see what a really good script can do for a really low budget movie.The stuff in here, man...I about threw up.  I kept waiting for a payoff, but it was just a lot of sadistic violence and an ""apocalypse"" payoff that comes from what, what?  The doppelganger stuff doesn't work.  There is no motivation.  Boredom does not count.  The notion that somehow bringing down New York ""frees"" debt slaves is stupid.  Computers in Podunk have the information.All in all, unless you are a very angry person stuck in a terrible and pathetic adolescence, this is not a decent movie.  Too bad.  I could see places where it might have worked.If you like this movie, you'll love ""Triumph of the Will.""  Just get real with your inner self.Sorry!"	1.0	Sorry.  It is just bad.	2005-08-08	57	16	41
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A4YXC8JQIO5XL	Beanie	"Watch it twice.  No joke, the second time is so much better than the first, kinda like getting high. Anyways, this movie is a complete 180 of what i thought it would be.  The previews made it look simple, two guys hate life, so they start a fight club. in reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie.  By the end of the first watch of this movie, i just didnt know what to think at all.  It was just so....yeah. But after letting it sink into my mind and giving it a second viewing, it was just amazing.  My friends and I dont even refer to Brad Pitt as himself anymore, we call him Tyler Durden because this was obviously one of his best performances.  As Durden, Pitt is damn near addicting, you begin to see why so many people would follow him.  That ""who cares i do what i want"" personality is portrayed perfectly on Pitt's part, and Norton, what an underrated actor. This man is a chameleon on the screen, so much so that in the same year he played the neurotic, scrawny wreck in Fight Club, he played the ripped, hate-filled, relentless racist in American History X.  He's one of the best character actors around.  This movie is hard to follow on first watch mainly because its all so out there, it took me til the second watch to realize that Norton is unnamed throughout the entire movie.  If you don't watch it twice, it probably wont be as good. And dont, for the love of god, watch it on TV. FX played it one night and it was just not the same thrill.  Alot of people complain about the violence in this movie, saying its poorly done. Well, thats the idea, these men arent ninjas or professional fighters, they're just normal men, so the fights are filmed just right.  Word to the wise, if you're squemish during brutal fight scenes, turn away when Norton fights Jared Leto (blond guy) its pretty intense. All in all, this movie is a classic cult flick.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AW3UL3PDO8QY5	Beaver	If you liked David Fincher's Se7en as much as I did (and I liked it a lot), then you will be able to experience these emotions again when you view this wonderfully chaotic masterpiece: Fight Club.  Again he continues with witty social commentary, chewing and spitting out the middle class urban and suburban lifestyles.If you don't like Fight Club, try watching it again, and rather than preparing for the escapism that accompanies most films, start thinking when play is pressed.  Join the protagonist in questioning, in dissecting life as we know it..For some people, Fight Club is a paradigm-shifter, and you'll never be able to forget it.  For others, like myself, Fincher and Chuck Palaniuk combine to reinforce my beliefs in a most astounding way.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2WDSO1DQZ7J03	behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de	When I'm looking at the Top Ten list's of America's critics and the nominations of the DGA,WGA and all the other guilds and press associations, I terribly miss David Fincher's outstanding film &quot;Fight Club&quot;,  which is possibly the best film of 1999.Not only is the film visualy  stunning, it is also very thought-provoking, wickedly funny and, above all,  extremely entertaining. Only few films managed to be so many things at  once. David Fincher, in my opinion one of the most exciting directors of  the decade, fills his movie with so many ideas that it would be sufficient  for three more movies, and they are not just gimmicks for their own sake,  they all mean something. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant in the  leads and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers fits perfectly to the  images.Many reviewers thought the film was fascist. I think you can only  call this ridiculous, since that assumes Fincher sympathizes with Tyler  Durden's project mayhem. In fact, he invites us to form our own opinion,  like Stanley Kubrick did in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. &quot;Fight  Club&quot; hands over the resposibility  to the viewer. This may be  uncomfortable to some, others (like myself) will embrace this.	5.0	The most underrated film of the last year	2000-02-10	393	349	44
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3PS6HIFQWWXB0	"Belgie ""A reader"""	Fight Club is one of the best films critisizing western type life of today. Film is about the psychology of destroying the current life dynamics and dream for a simpler, more humanistic life style. However, in the film no executable alternatives of better living were given, like todays american way of life:)For a better execution of critizing todays life, with everyting in it, I highly recommend Stalker from Tarkovsky.	4.0	Excellent Critic to todays life	2005-01-09	5	2	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A264Q1VUO96DWY	Ben Dover	This is an absolutely original movie, unlike anything else. Its a satire with a really grim sense of humor. Designed to encourage thought rather than to just entertain. The situations are just presented straightforwardly & the audience is left to make up its own mind. I'm grateful somebody's making intelligent films like this & we get a choice & an occasional change of pace. This is quite possibly the weirdest mainstream movie out there & extremely worth the viewer's trouble. The 3 leads are fantastic & they all do a top-notch job. I read the book after seeing the flick & I'm glad I did it in that order. The movie's plot twist wasn't ruined for me beforehand & I got a better understanding from the book. For example, in the book its explained that Tyler Durden gets all his clothes from the lost-and-found at bus stations & so forth. So you see why he dresses so strangely.  Again, only try this one if you're looking for something unusual.	5.0	The ultimate cult film, IMO	2008-03-14	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1IYT79HOAGLJT	Ben Evans	Past the action filled commercials, through the title of the film, amd seeping within the extreme violence, there is a message.  A message that most everyone will feel but try to avoid further action.  Edward Norton  does not avoid it, in fact, he actually enjoys this venture into a world of  excitement, danger, and anger management techniques.  Unfortunatly he is as  the movie progresses, clearly insane.  He creates a character he needs,  someone to help him discover who he is.  This movie never fails to be  boring, repetitive and certainly not predictable.  But hey, what can you  expect from the amazing directing of David Fincher of SE7EN?  Dialogue can  be very clear and ingenious if listened to carefully.  Watch this beauty  with full attention and surely more than once.	5.0	Fincher does it again!	2000-04-27	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A24456FPYCCSMG	Ben hayden	In 1995 director David Fincher and Brad Pitt teamed up to make a little film called Seven that still creeps people out this day. Last year they teamed up with Fight Club. In this movie it is about an unknown character  Played by Edward Norton who lives a white collar exsistenz and is getting  very bored with his life. So he meets Tyler Durden pplayed by Brad Pitt.  This film mainly works as a black comedy and as a social comentary. Those  two start a club which they fight. This movie is not for the weak stomached  it no holds bared violence.Director David Fincher shows kinetic visual  style and offers up some bone crunching entertainmant. What i am really  surprised with is Brad Pitt after the lame Meet Joe Black. Also i would  have liked Seven years in Tibet if it didn't feel like seven years. This is  easily one of his better movies. After the great Twelve Monkeys. Edward  Norton holds his own and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla is great.	4.0	Fight Club	2000-05-20	15	6	9

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3A5284WCLDFQK	Benjamin Black	When I saw Fight Club in theaters, I witnessed a truly disturbing and intriguing movie. I followed the path of a young man (Edward Norton), made so hollow and emotionless by our society that he must resort to attending  testicular cancer (among other deadly diseases) meetings so that he can  feel emotion.  However, the movie is called Fight Club because soon  enough he can no longer even get support from the groups and so he and his  new and mysterious friend, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) start Fight Clubs to  feel the emotion and adrenaline of fighting for life.  The movie twists  and turns into some somewhat unrealistic turns, but the audience gets an  amazing glimpse of the human psyche and the dark recesses of the soul that  are hidden to society.  All that having been said, the marketing team  and technical team really went all out on bringing the movie to DVD. The  cover box is even great to inspect and look at, and once you get to the two  disk DVD's you are stunned. You get all the added features listed above,  and so the DVD takes what is really a 4 star movie to the next level.	5.0	Great Use of DVD Format	2000-07-21	1	1	0

This is a beautifully constructed piece of art that hammers against your senses from start to finish!David  Fincher has an excellent track record with Alien 3 and Se7en and you can  almost taste the darkness he brings to this story. Is it about a man's fall  into insanity or his painful path towards becoming his true self? Is he the  dichotomy in all of us or is this just a great visceral movie?You must  see this and then decide for yourself (and then argue with all your  mates).The first rule of this movie is, if you are going to have  fighting, make it look like it hurts. The second rule of this movie is if  you are going to have actors, pick Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. This is the  best I have seen both of them. Brad shines like a light as the muscular,  taut alter-ego and Norton gives the whole spectrum of a man going out of  his mind to seek solace.Rule three is if you are going to make a DVD,  package it likes this one.Like the fact that this is no ordinary movie,  this is no ordinary DVD. It is wonderfully packaged and you actually get  two discs. (Disc two contains outtakes, behind the scenes stuff publicity  and more than I have seen on any other DVD.The final rule of this movie  is that if you are going to make a movie, make it one that shakes everyone  up and gets them arguing amongst themselves.	5.0	Defies description	2000-06-14	25	19	6
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A24AAZLXP428VG	Big Dog	I am Jack's sense of utter disbelief.  How is it that the general America public completely missed the boat on a movie that struck dead center as a  perfect parody of our society?  I have to draw the conclusion that Fight  Club was received relatively poorly at the box office because most people  could not understand its primary themes and messages.I'm a 30-something  male living in 'middle' America and from what I see; our society is  tittering on the edge of self destruction.  Children are rampaging through  schools with shotguns reenacting scenes from Quake and the consensus  solution is - take away guns?  The polar caps are melting and the news  reports that scientists still have no proof of global warming?  The  population is growing at an exponential rate as our health care system  approaches financial melt down attempting to sustain every human  life.What does this have to do with Fight Club?  Obesity is at an all  time high in this country, and it serves as a flawless metaphor of America  - Fat &amp; Happy.  Fight Club puts America (in all of its ugly glory)  right in your face, and it appears that the majority of the public is too  close to the forest to see the trees.  Fight Club says &quot;We'll take  their liposuction fat, repackage it in a nice wrapper and sell it back to  them as soap&quot;.  That's an ugly concept that most people don't want to  even think about.I have asked a number of people what they though this  movie was about, and they essentially respond - guys with mental problems  who start a club to act as a venue for macho brawls.  Were my peers  sleeping during their viewings?It was reported that when this movie was  first screened at the movie studio, the executives involved were concerned  about being investigated for promoting fascism.  This movie takes aim at  &quot;the system&quot;, &quot;the man&quot;, &quot;the establishment&quot;  and strikes dead on.  On the DVD, there are supplementary commentaries from  all the major players involved with Fight Club.  At one point during the  dialog, Ed Norton says that when he read the script; he was amazed by the  depth, complexity and originality of this movie.  After the movie was  released, he was criticized along with Pitt for pandering to Hollywood's  violent tendencies.It may be true that the only reason Hollywood  green-lighted this picture was because of the violence, but I don't think  they truly understood what they had authorized.  If you choose to watch  this movie for the first time (or repeatedly which I highly recommend)  focus on getting past the violence.  The fighting is used as a concept  vehicle - we all live in a stress-induced coma that is perpetuated through  the daily trials and tribulations of life.  The way that the characters  wake up from their coma is by experiencing primordial pain - fighting.  Once they are awake, they recognize that they have been asleep all of their  lives.  Oddly similar to The Matrix, but the similarities end there.By  endorsing this movie, I'm not purporting that we are all silently asleep at  the wheel.  Neither movies nor their reviews can completely cover complex  concepts in a nice simple package.  As Norton touched on in the commentary,  this movie has more thought provoking ideas than almost any other I can  think of.  The sad part about Fight Club is the fact that it has become a  self-fulfilled prophecy.  Its mediocre showing at the box office reinforces  Hollywood's perception that the general public is becoming increasingly  comatose - we want intellectual Big Mac EXTRA value meals as opposed to  Steak au Poivre.Could you make sure to put heavy violence and low  thought on that Big Mac?  Fincher, Norton and Pitt all proved that they had  big coconuts to make this movie, and I don't think anyone even noticed  their contribution.  If you like a well trimmed New York strip steak topped  with cognac peppercorn demi-glaze then bon appetit!	5.0	Why do I love thee. . . . let me count the ways	2000-09-02	36	30	6
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3QLZ79JF6R1A4	Bigflu	When this film aired in the theaters, I had no desire to see it. It was marketed by trying to sell viewers to see Brad Pitt, which doesn't work for me - I need more than star power to see a movie. I believe its very hard to advertise for without giving away anything that makes it so unique. But I caught it late night on cable and LOVED it. I love movies that suprise me, and this one did.I can't get into too much detail for fear of giving any of the good stuff away, but suffice it to say that both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deserve Oscars for their roles. Norton as the quirky, mild-mannered, easy going guy who has allied himself with the exact opposite outlandish Brad Pitt character.A definite must see for anybody wanting to see a movie different from most of the mindless, heartless, and plotless movies made today.	5.0	Different form most of the other mindless [movies] out today.	2002-05-27	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30XGTWOP8ZHW7	Big Mike	This was the best movie of the year, with American Beauty right behind it.  Why can't people overcome the violent content?  I will tell you why, they go to movies to see a mouse in a car and they call that entertainment, they  go to see movies where things blow up and people say catch phrases that we  have heard so many times we want to puke. People watch movies that have an  endless amount of merchandise, people don't go to movies for the reason  they are intended.  Movies are intended to take us to a place we cannot go  on our own, movies are also intended to give people the view of the  director, there should be a point to every movie. Most movies these days  lack this, Fight Club is not one of them.  Fight Club tells you to do what  you want, do what makes you feel good.  There is a fight in everyone's  life, the fight with themselves.  To overcome this battle you shouldn't  start a fight club.  The term fight club could have been anything, if the  movie was called Quilting Club I don't think it would have a huge impact.  The point I am trying to make is whatever  you want to do to make yourself  happy do it, I loved this movie because it helped me to understand that.  I  give this movie the highest rating I can, and I urge you to see this movie,  mopre than once to get the overall feel and emotion it was intended to put  out.	5.0	Best film of the year, puts a new spin on life	2000-02-29	12	10	2

Norton plays Jack and Brad Pitt plays Tyler who is a soap salesman with a twisted way of viewing life. Tyler thinks the way to get the most out of life is by testing your durability in other words beating yourself till you can take no more. And if you if can endure the most painful of pains then what's there to be afraid of. Together Tyler and Jack start an organized underground Fight Club where the members Fight each other. The club has rules. It really is strictly insanity. But a twisted ending will totally expand your mind and make you think outside the square. A classic.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AE0GRHP455FGF	Bill C	I'm writing a review of the 10th Anniversary Edition Bluray, not the film itself. The film is in my top 10 movies of all time so my rating does not reflect the movie. I watched this Bluray last night on a 65 inch Samung LED and I have to say that it looks really nice. Though most of this film is dark and can be tough to tell that you're actually watching a Bluray at times, you will notice how clear it is when it moves to brighter scenes. It looks most impressive once you get to the house on Paper Street. The cracks in the walls, graininess and overall decrepit look of the house is a pleasure on the eyes. Audio is also top-notch. I watched it with DTS 5.1 and could hear every drop of water, wail, stomp, punch and explosion in glorious surround sound. As far as the extras go, don't expect much difference from the DVD that was released about 10 years back. It features several audio commentaries alongside the movie as well as deleted scenes. For the most part there's nothing new there, which doesn't bother me much because I've always been about the movie itself and not cared too much about 800+ hours of extras. I have a box full of old DVD cases where all of the &#34;extras&#34; DVDs are residing - extra's are just not important to me, but I know they are to some so that's why I'm mentioning it. Bottom line is buy this if you love the movie and don't care about getting AMAZING extras. Every time I watch this movie, I notice something new and this Bluray is by far the best cinematic experience of the film to date. The 4/5 stars I give this more of a &#34;really like it&#34;.	4.0	10th Anniversary Bluray review	2012-11-30	3	2	1

They aren't real to begin with!Anyway, Fight Club deals with a narrator (the awesome Ed  Norton) who's life is adrift. His existence has absolutely no meaning, and  he goes to support groups for diseases he does not have so he can feel  warmth and love. Then another support group &quot;tourist&quot; shows up  (Helena Bonham Carter) and he cannot feel good at the meetings anymore.  Then a chance encounter with a soap salesman named Tyler Durden changes  everything. Together they form a new type of therapy for men who feel  discarded from society. Very soon Fight Club grows into a nationwide cult.Fight Club is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All of  the actors turn in superb performances (even Meat Loaf!). There's a lot of  great black comedy throughout. If you like movies like Pulp Fiction,  Reservoir Dogs, or The Usual Suspects you'll probably enjoy this one.	5.0	Definitely not for everyone!	2000-05-30	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3VZVYWCTGIEV0	"Bill Your 'Free Form FM Print DJ ""bill nicholas"""	"WARNING. THIS REVIEW GIVES END OF FILM AWAY.Critics and viewers who think this is about getting your macho up miss the point. So do those who think this is a ""violent"" film. Fight Club is really about personal liberation, and genius that osolates into insanity.Ed Norton's no name character is living a banal, materialistic yuppie life. He has no friends, no gal, and his possessions define him. Low and behold, he can't sleep.Our hero first seeks refuge in support groups and new age mush. He goes to meetings for diseases and addicitions he does not have. He is a ""tourist,"" and at first, a very sound sleeping one.Until he meets Marla, fellow tourist. Marla is much better at this game than he is. She is also alot more crazy, or liberated, or both. She walks in traffic, realizing life can end any moment. She outwits her rival tourist, and soon, he is back to sleepless square one.Soon, he meets Tyler. Tyler has no use for material objects, but has as much distain for the touchy feely, microwave sensativity alter-exisistance of our protagonist. Tyler beleives in living in the moment, which requires shedding of all attachments, physical and mental. ""It is only when you have lost everything,"" he says, ""that you are free to do anything""How does one get here? The two start an underground, secret fight club, where other young men with similar plights can go and box, with total abandon. Eventually, this grows,  to the edge of sanity. Soon, boxing is found to be only a means to an end--stripping ones self down to primal instincts and being truely alive. Between bouts, Tyler starts a fling with Marla.But even fighting and worrier simplicity is not enough; the fight club decides to spread the gospel, and devise a plan to blow up several financial institutions, wiping out credit records and thus the whole base of materialistic capitalism, which, fight club members would say, binds us all into emotional sleep  in pursuit of $300 neckties and Dolche Gabana armpit razors.Fair enough, but anarchy  was not what our narrator intended--all the guy was really trying to do was get some sleep--and he sets out to stop Tyler from executing his  master plan.Only one problem: Tyler does not exist.This raises one of several major points in the film. Our hero did not feel he could make such big changes on his own, and sets up an alter-ego, which is really his ideal self--all the things he aspires to be and can't. This sounds insane, but to a degree,  we all have a fantasy about doing what we want when we want, saying what crosses our mind, and being free from the demons-material, social, and psycological- that stop us from being ourselves. Usually, we see our ideal selves as another person, devorced from us.Now, if we believe our heros version of events, he has gone quite mad, but on another level his madness is genius. We all have this internal process. He just externalized it, and probably came closer to getting free form his chains then most of us will. Where does personal liberation end and anarchy begin? Good question, and isn't it the fear of stepping over the line that  stop most of us from finding out. Which is scarrier--staying how we are or wading into the forbidden zone? I don't know.Fight Club  makes more keen social comments. When our hereo begins to let go of his yuppie lifestyle and begins his 12-step programs, he is only trading one costume for another. The film is as critical of the 'lets cry and find our power animal' psudo-psychology that has infested out culture as it is the crass materialism it replaces. It is like the alcoholic who goes to AA, and this replaces the liqour as the base for his or her identity.The violence in Fight Club is really not violence as we think of it. Everyone fighting wants to be there, and the intent of the fighting is collective liberation, not to do harm to another. It is a means to an end: with other characters, the boxing could have been pottery or fly fishing. So it is difficult to be upset by this ""violence"" when you consider its unique roll in the story.Two other points about violence stand out: First, the one time he takes  a fight to far and disfigures a fellow member, it is at a point in the film where he is about to go over the edge; a turning point.Second, yes, empty skyscrapers are blown up at the end of Fight Club. But remember, this was two years before September 11th. We knew in the back of our minds a large scale terrorist attack was possible, but our biggest focus in 1999 was how much the NASDAQ went up each day; this was a very different time. America was partying. No one knew the unthinkable would happen soon, so you really can't say, retroactively, that the destruction in the film was in bad taste.Regardless, Fight Club is a funny, entertaining, thought provoking film, its points much more nuanced than the title and fight scenes indicate."	5.0	classic	2009-07-07	6	5	1

It's a story of a man who's life falls in shambles but after he meets a stranger on a plane he buddies with him and the chaos that the two combine are able to brainwash every male being in their perimeter of contact. Alot of cool facts are discoverd in this film and I would put this under the mullholland drive, pulp fiction type of movie watcher. The cinematography is really good in the film and you can even see some surprising pop-ups on screen where you will have to keep on rewinding and looking back closely to see if they actually bleeped that image for a second....maybe they did maybe they didn't...only you can find out when you watch this film.	4.0	Good filmmaking with a good story!	2003-04-16	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	I have to admit from the beginning that I had never seen FIGHT CLUB before 2010. Yes (hangs head in shame), I'd heard all the hype and thought it to be just that: hype. Although I did notice that most of the kudos came from guys, not gals, even though the well-built Brad Pitt (Inglourious Basterds) was liberally smeared on cover displays along with witty (and not unhandsome) Edward Norton (The Painted Veil). Hmm. So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu-Ray copy.Although brutal along the lines ofGoodFellas, Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark. It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd). I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles. She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together. In 1995 they did the excellent filmSeven. If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one. Fincher loves to play mind-twists but he doesn't do it in a heavy-handed way or even in a directly misguiding one (unlike M. Night Shyamalan with his groundbreakingThe Sixth Sense).Although the twist towards the end was enjoyable, I was an astute enough viewer to realize what was going on long before its reveal. Which didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.Some of those who haven't seen the film might want a kind of blow-by-blow description ...and many reviews like that can easily be found. DON'T READ THEM! They will absolutely ruin the film for you. I have, in the past (and probably will in the future), given descriptions of films, but not here.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A29VBB22SMIB1L	"bob20799 ""bob20799"""	This is an wonderful film.  Intelligent, well directed, great acting, and deeply symbolic.  There is no need for me to go into detail here as I see many have more than adequatly described the plot and many of it's nuances.  More so, becuase many of the points raised don't lend themselves to discussion in the space provided ( in which on could hardly do justice to one of it's themes. )On the otherhand, I will point out that, as many have stated, people love or hate this film.  ( some probably do both ).  I will not decend to the egotism of those who say if you don't like it you aren't bright enough to understand it ( not that I am not that egotistical) but I did notice that most of the negative comments seem to reject the films world view.Tyler clearly has a world view that many, particularly young ( perhaps predominently white ) men feel these days.  Lack of purpose, no worthwhile goals ( other than a cool new car or nice furniture ), a society that trys to create our opinions for us.  I unstand why this would bother some views.  They may not understand it, they may think that such people, the favored childeren of society, are just being foolish, or perhaps they are afraid of a world were people reject the comfortable values that make their little sterile and safe society possible.  ( More pessimistiacally, perhaps they fear the effects on accepting such values themselves.)In anycase, the fact that one does not agree with the message of a film does not make it a bad film.  ( You may as well condemn The Ten Commandments for being about religion ) The acting is outstanding, the direction is marvolouse, the vast majority of the dialog is sharp and in many cases very insightful, and ( for those who thought it was advocating all those things that scared them so much ) it spends it's last act with the &quot;hero&quot; trying to stop what is going on and recognizing the inhumanity of what &quot;his&quot; followers have become.Agree or not.  Empahize or not.  But if you open your mind you may gain some insight into how some people see the trap that their lives have become.  This film gives insight into the human condition of many young men in the modern world and, like that view or not, it may help you to understand some of things that drive people to the edge.- post script  am I the only one who thought that this was a modern Steppenwolf and that Tyler should have been a cute babe named Hermine?	5.0	Great Film	2003-03-31	2	2	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AYC3Y4QX7GATV	"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts"""	"Frightening - Not the movie, necessarily, which was definitely thought provoking, but what I read in the other reviews about how many people want to embrace a message it may contain as the key to salvation and freedom in our modern, Bourgeois society.Its frightening to me how quickly the depressed, downtrodden, and lonely adopt violence toward, and destruction of other people as the solution to their ills.  Reminds me of Nazis, or the KKK, al Qaeda, or any other organization seeking to hurt other people to make themselves feel better. Perhaps a few hundred of the prior reviewers might ask me to justify my position:1. I judge everyone I meet with a simple test - who's needs are about to be met - mine or yours?  While Brad, Ed, and the boys were tearing each other up I think the message was just peachy.  Whatever floats your boat. But when they started terrorizing, maiming, and killing other people it became clear that they were meeting their own needs at the expense of everyone else.  Way uncool.  No, you say, way cool.  Have you ever been a victum of violence?  Apparently not. I'd ask you to withhold judgement until it happens to you.2.  Tyler says; ""We are by-products of a life style obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear."" To combat their terrible insensitivity to what is important, the boys immediately snap into action, and suddenly become very much interested in murder and crime, - causing more of it.3.  I judge every society on how it treats those who are less powerful.  I would have found the message more credible had it been wrapped in anything other than an all-star team of various ways to abuse power.  While the Ed character occasionally cops a conscience (the scene when Brad terrorizes the store clerk), he is also particularly vile, invading the privacy of the support groups, mentally abusing the girl, nearly killing and permenantly maiming the other fighter near the end of the movie Why? ""He was beautiful,"" and in general, preying on the weak and easily influenced.I give ""Fight Club"" five stars for provoking thought (see terrorism comments below).  But it was hard to overlook (one point taken away) and not be repulsed by the cheap, commercial display of nearly every conceivable way one person can diminish, dehumanize, and destroy another person as a surprisingly effective means of selling theater tickets.What I took away from this movie was not how terrible our society is, but how great it can be - if we can find a way to confine Brad, Ed and the boys to their own basements.  Better yet, finding a way of removing any reason for them to go down to the the basement in the first place.If there was ever a movie that had something compelling so say about our society and where its going....its what this movie has to say about terrorism.  Did you see the buildings get blown up, one after another in the last scene?  Perhaps I was the only one who saw the twin towers.  Are we to react with more violence, or something more fundamentally and compassionately human...Final thought (among many): Imagine for a moment if all this ""fight-clubbing"" is exactly what we're seeing in the large recruitment of middle eastern terrorists.  Tyler's message about the ugly banality of modern bourgeois society now seems cheap and banal itself.  Perhaps something much more real and important - the starvation, poverty, abuse and neglect of vast numbers of people in middle eastern societies is a much greater, much more real threat, not something as superficial as ""...500 channels of television..."""	4.0	Very Frightening...not the Movie.

I was blown away by the amount of action and humor contained in this single film. I thought the screenplay was genius about a office worker whose alter ego creates a stress reduction fight club in order to then create an army of followers that threatens the very fabric of society on a worldwide scale. The humor is intermittent with the narrators ramblings one moment then fight club induced crimes the next that left me on the floor laughing uncontrollably. The cast is fantastic especially Edward Norton as he falls continuously into the confusion and deceit of daily life.I bought this DVD a few months back in order to relive the moments that I enjoyed when first watching it all those years ago.

Although  &quot;NBK&quot;&quot;~ was a great movie &quot;The Fight Club&quot; just  blew me away.&quot;~ Club&quot; is a very smart film that raises a lot of  different questions.

He meets  Brad pitt on a business trip and the two hit off.&quot;~&quot;~ in my  opinion but that's just a small complaint. Ever since &quot;the Usual  Suspects&quot;, Hollywood seems to be feeling the need to throw in these  great surprise endings. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is a mediocre movie  with a great ending, &quot;The Fight Club&quot; is a great movie with a  mediocre ending.&quot;~ one of those cutting edge movies from the 70's.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AEF0HUXSV6M08	Bored in Boone, NC	This film is an example of just how strong the media these days is controlled by conservative morals. Smothered by underpromotion, this film was shunned for terrorist allusions and other anarchist subject matter. Of course, as is par for the course with them, conservatives lacked the intellectual depth to see the true meaning behind this film, the metaphor of the desolation of a modern existence. Conservative viewers and media moguls saw the forest for trees. The violence, the bombings, the sex acts. Then they make their predictable logic jumps of what effects it would have on society.For the controversy alone this film generates, and for its determination to become a succesful cult smash in light of the recent pathetic Victorian morals backlash, this is one of the defining films of my generation. Bold enough to still take risks and not be smothered by money-grubbing corporate hypocrites, right-wing religious folklore pushers, and inept governmental administrations. This film is a classic.Everyone knows the story, despite the trailers at the time misbilling this as a film about bareknuckle boxing, or whatever. An isolated, disaffected young man, working a dead-end Wilmington, Delaware office job, is lured upon the burning of his apartment into the dangerous and complex world of Tyler Durden. Elaboration beyond this point would be detremential to a first-time viewer curious about this remarkable film.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a dynamite pair, and it was wise casting to accentuate the close friendship these two share in real life. David Fincher's directing style has ushered in a slew of copycats, the true mark of an impactful, brilliant director. But it is Helena Bonham Carter, a British and mostly classical actress playing very much against role here as the slightly whorish, mostly mentally unstable Marla Singer, that makes this film. There's a reason she won Best British Actress at England's version of the Oscars for this role. The conservative Academy shuns anything groundbreaking these days (see their pick of the cliched Gladiator as best picture over Traffic a few years back). The watered-down, sugarcoated American cinema, fearful of censorship and further violations of our freedom of speech and press, needs to step up to the plate with more films like this. And as for the Palahniuk novel on which this is based, it's suggested as an additional read to the film because it is very different in certain essential ways.If  you care about cinema and its current state of right-wing suppression at all, go and rent this film. Support revolutionaries not oppressed by Bush and his tyrants, and who refuse to be kept from their artistic instincts.

Fight Club is an unflinchingly stunning and stylish film that sucks you in and propells you along its high octane trajectory.  Yet when the secret ""twist"" is revealed, it's a huge letdown that has been done before in countless other films.  This is definitely a guy flick, highly entertaining but low on substance.

Certain teen comedies nowadays have more blood-letting than 'Fight Club'. The title itself suggests the violent nature of the film, and as a result, it is not the main attribute of 'Fight Club' that will linger after the viewing. David Fincher ('Seven', 'The Game', 'Panic Room') astonishes with the confident way he leads his audience through over two hours of no-holds-barred, full-throttle controversial energy. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's chemistry is as electric as the fight scenes of the radical Fight Club members; Helena Bohnam Carter fits in perfectly, her character both atrocious and sympathetic. If you're in for a uncompromising illustration of radical ideas on contemporary society, represented through an intelligent director's control over two of the best actors of their generation, that rivals the flabbergasting effects of Tarantino pictures, you can't, CAN'T go wrong with David Fincher's instant classic.	5.0	ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS	2003-12-15	3	0	3

The irony is that the movies not about that at all.  You have to watch it yourself, but most people miss the point.  If you can't handle abiguity this movie will really irritate you.  Especially disturbing to me was the dialog between Ed Norton and the female character where they are discussing which days they will attend the victims groups, spooky.

That, i think, is one of the reasons why so many people don't like this movie. Many people don't like to have their beliefs challenged, which this movie wil do. Also, so many people are shocked by the violence in here, but throughout the enitre movie *one* person dies. These same people sat through the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan where dozens to hundreds of people were brutally killed without complaining. The violence just comes in a different context, which is entirely justified in terms of the movie.The men who go to fight club, go for a reason. They go, knowing that they WILL get beaten up. But they also go, and this is the motivating factor, to FEEL. They live their lives feeling nothing, just doing the same *meaningless* stuff day after day. They ae searching for something, for happiness ultimately, and the path society tells them to take to be happy isn't working. Fight club provides them with raw emotion, and they take this to be happiness. As Fight Club spirals out of control and into Project Mayhem, we see the consequences of the path the protagonst took to escape the *evils* of society. Is the path he took the only possible path? no. And that's another complaint many have. Norton's character didn't have to do what he did, go through everything he went through, and thus could have saved many people a lot of pain. But my answer is that he DID have to do what he did. He even said himself that he did not know how to change the live he was leading, he only knew that he was sick of it, as so many people are (which is why so many people joined him in his cause). What he did wasn't ncessairily RIGHT, but the question you should ask yourself is this. Is what he did, and what he became ultimately, better than the life he would have led if he would've remained in his little cubicle? The answr may surprse you. i think the main idea this movie tries to instill in you is that you should not blindly follow.The movie attacks corporate America, sayng that people are *wasting* their lives away in cublicles. It attacks the media, and their attempts (quite often successful) to make us conform. After looking at a Calvin Klein ad of a muscular man in underwear, Pitt as Tyler Durden says, ""Self improvement is masturbation. Self destruction, might be the answer."" whether or not you see this as true,is up to you and you alone. I'm not even going to state my opinion, because it doesnt matter. what matters is that you see this movie, which is unbelivable. And don't let this review make you think that you'll be bored out of you mind. i just tried to delve deeper into what the movie is trying to say. It is extremely entertaining, David Fincher has yet again done a tremendous job, and David Uhls brought the book to the screen splendidly, retaining much of the comedy that lightens an otherwise rather dark movie. Ed Norton, and Brad Pitt both give amazing performances, as does Helena Bonham Carter. The DVD itself comes packed extremely well, complete with a pamphlet entitled ""how to start a fight"" that has many of hollywood's opinions on the movie, and the story of how it came to be made. In short, you should defintely watch this movie *at least* once, no matter who you are. ...Very Highly Recommended"	5.0	thought provoking	2002-07-13	0	0	0

I loved &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;the Game&quot; so I knew i'd at least like the movie, but I could never have predicted how much. It is perfect in every sence of the word.  Every aspect of the film (Acting, Directing, Style, Story) is Faultless.  Brad and Edward go together like Mr and Mrs Brady, The editing and  Cinematography are mind-blowing. It is perfection.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AR8Y6VPVUHCSB	"Brad Torgersen ""Full-time nerd, part-time sol..."	Saw this movie last month.  Everyone ranted and raved about this movie (which I avoided seeing for a long time) and while I admit it has great acting and directing, and is very stylish, I was left holding an empty bag at the end of the film.  I won't spoil the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but I will say I thought the wrap-up did nothing for me.Maybe I'm from the wrong generation?  But I was 24 in 1999 and I doubt even then I could have gotten into the &quot;message&quot; that this movie seems to deliver.  On the one hand, the message seems to be that we ought to abandon the conventional and live our lives as if every day will be our last.  Sort of a &quot;go for the gusto&quot; premise.  On the other hand the message seems to be that your modern young American male is condemned to a life utterly devoid of thumos, hence his only way to attain bona fide manhood is through senseless brutality?  I dunno, but speaking as a new father, husband of ten years, an Army Reservist, full-time employee, full time student, et al, there are more than enough &quot;dragons&quot; in this world to slay without having to engage in any of the nasty business portrayed in the film.The world is ripe with challenge, and any young male with half a brain ought to be able to find a hundred different things to engage himself in that will not only prove positively productive, but also extremely &quot;manly&quot; in every sense of the term.  Pitt's character whines that his generation has no great wars to fight?  Well, 9/11 knocked on our door, and it seems we have a doozy of a war on our hands now.  Pitt declares that you cannot plumb the true depth of your manhood without fighting?  In an age when young males are neck-deep in senseless slaughter, I would argue that unless the fighting is actually for something important (e.g. the real War that is on right at this very moment) the senseless barbarity of the 'fight club' is the furthest thing from manly virtue.Really, that's what I'm left with after watching this film.  Twist ending aside, what point was there to the 'fight club' anyway?  Yes, the film does seem to be something of a rant against our consumerist American culture, but we must remind ourselves that previous generations of young men worked hard and died hard so that we in this age could know comfort, safety, immense material well being, and few real hardships.  If this comfy life is a 'bad' thing that we men supposedly chaffe against, then it is news to me.  And for any young man out there who is looking for challenges and contests beyond the ordinary, I would refer him to his local Army, Navy, Marine, or Air Force recruiter.  The Service has a bottomless list of opportunities for young men to prove themselves, often in the manliest and most noble way possible, and it's all just a phone call away.Okay, enough with the commercial.  I just shook my head at the end of this movie and thought to myself, what was the point??	3.0	Well-acted, well-directed, but what does it mean?	2004-02-11	18	4	14

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1D365GSP8AMJT	Brandon Schowengerdt	Fight Club is one of those rare movies that confronts controversial issues and questions society. Do we really need to be consumers to fill the void? Throughout the movie Edward Norton tries to find the activity that makes him feel truly alive. He goes through consumerism, support groups, bare knuckle fighting, and project mayhem before realizing he needs none of them. The darkness of the film and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers makes for an unforgettable movie experience.	5.0	Will Stand The Test Of Time	2000-11-01	3	1	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2HZKMNX03RGPP	"Breck A. Sparks ""ehzr"""	Don't listen to what people tell you about this movie. You must watch and form your own opinion about it without any prior knowledge. And yes, it helps to watch it at least twice. There are many things you catch the second time around that were not there the first time you saw it. The political message it sends is one fitting of the times, and may make you think twice about what you are doing with your life.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton each give one of their best performances as the main characters. Pitt is, I believe, one of the best actors to play a crazy person (see also: 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia). And Edward Norton is perhaps the best actor of his generation, although he doesn't seem to get credit for his work. The plot is very engaging, as long as you're not offended by anti-materialistic propaganda (which Brad Pitt spews virtually non-stop). In short, this movie is one that should be on everyone's 'must see' list. As an added bonus, there's lots of extra features on the DVD as well. It would be worth your time to watch the whole movie with the commentary on.Here, I leave you with this thought: the relationship between Calvin and Hobbes (yes, the cartoon characters) is much the same as between Edward Norton's character and Tyler Durden.	5.0	Watch it twice	2001-09-25	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1M0ZINKQI046Q	Brent Burgee	Consisting of a handful of great actors, an incredible audio experience (thanks to the Dust Brothers) and visual effects which, in my opinion, rival The Matrix, Fight Club has captured the very essence of a non-normal  person in a non-normal world. Edward Norton brings to his character a depth  that, I don't think has been matched in a long time. Brad Pitt's character  portrays the ideal alter-ego of Norton's, and their on-scene chemistry is  immense. This movie's complexities will keep you from realizing the truth  until the very end. The title may lend itself to a false impression of the  movie's content, however. Granted there is fighting in the movie, but the  theme carried out is not based on aggressiveness or brutality, instead on  true self-realization in today's world. As the story unravels, you will  find yourself questioning an elusive reality built around a self-created  destruction plot. You gotta see it...	5.0	Fight Club - What's not to Like?	2000-06-20	4	3	1

However, if these films  were among the first DVD's you purchased, then I definately recommend  checking this movie out! Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are equally  spectacular, punching their way through an intricately weaved storyline  that's packed with gritty texture and breathtaking visuals.  Definitely a  testament to the enormous talent of director David Fincher.The  unconventional structure is a bit difficult to follow, so don't be  surprised if you find yourself watching it a second time.Oh, and if you  haven't seen David Fincher's previous film &quot;The Game&quot;, do  yourself a favor and check that one out first.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A20IVL127LEW6S	Brian Brems	I had wanted to see it when it was released in the theatres, but I never got around to it.  When it came out on video, I rented it, not knowing what  to expect.  But then by the end of the veiwing, I was amazed.  This was the  most inventive, and definitely the best film of 1999.  The plot was  amazing, focusing on these young men, with no place in society who fight  back, first by rebelling against themselves, going to an underground boxing  club, called Fight Club, created by the mysterious Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt)  and his friend(Edward Norton), who is never really named.  The narraration  of the film by Edward Norton is an excellent twist to the movie, and the  plot takes many turns, but the plot flows beautifully.  The creation of  Tyler's destruction path, code named Project Mayhem, is what is focused on  towards the end of the film.  The countless catchphrases and catchy lines  that are delivered by Brad Pitt are priceless.  The &quot;Recycle your  Pets&quot; bumper sticker gives me a laugh every time.  Also, the work of  Helena Bonham Carter in the film is not to be overlooked.  She plays the  junkie named Marla, who wanders into the narrarator's life, and won't  leave.  Then, she becomes attached to Tyler.  The concluding twenty minutes  of the movie is breathtaking, and the ending is spectacular.  The perks of  Edward Norton's character really bring him to life as it would seem if he  was a real person, because people really do have these little perks that  make them who they are.  The writing is stellar, adapted from the book  Fight Club, by Chuck Palahniuk, especially for a first time screenwriter.  The directing of David Fincher, always reliable, stands out here as his  best work to date.  This dethrones Seven as his best movie.  And Brad Pitt  is excellent as Tyler Durden, Edward Norton's best friend and enemy at the  same time.  If only Brad Pitt would stick with Fincher, he would have a  flawless career.	5.0	Fight Club	2000-09-06	10	7	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1STJE8KFRWK3S	Brian Glass	I was out of the country when this film was released and as a result I missed all the controversy surrounding it. As I listened to the commentary from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and David Fincher, I had a hard time imagining where the source of all the commotion came from. It is definitely a violent film but no more violent than a Halloween or Friday the 13th film. The difference between those films and a Rocky movie and this film is that the violence here is more realistic and brutal, anyone who has ever seen an actual street fight would identify more with this film. It doesn't feel as choreographed and phony. But at the same time these guys beat the crap out of each other and then hug and shake hands when it's over.As for the the film itself I thought it was interesting and entertaining. I didn't see it as a movie of a generation though. It was a movie where the people involved read more into it than is there. It was a very enjoyable movie as long as all of the outside garbage that comes with it can be tuned out. There's a lot of interesting camera work and unobtrusive computer graphics. The story is interesting and the screenplay is funny and dark. The lighting is dark also, which is my big complaint. I saw the film through my DVD player on a hotel t.v. I wasn't able to adjust the color on the set and in several scenes I had trouble seeing. In the commentary the two actors mention the director's habit of underlighting scenes.I was totally surprised by the twist and thought it was very well done and satisfying. The ending was a little unbelievable but not totally out of place with the tone of the movie, after all the whole thing is a little far fetched to begin with. The ending was a little weak though compared with the rest of the film.The DVD is full of interesting features and goodies. As usual the commentary track is a good idea in concept but doesn't live up to the potential. You occasionally learn something interesting but for the most part it's a case of everyone talking over one another. I haven't listened to all commentaries yet however, I'm hoping the screenwriter and director only tracks are a little more interesting. It's good to see Brad Pitt and Edward Norton criticizing Rosie O'Donnel.This is a good value and a good movie, I don't think it is as important as Edward Norton or some critics seem to think it is but it wasn't the signal of the end society either. It was just a pretty good film.	4.0	It's Just A Movie!	2001-07-08	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	APP5MBH2BSX6I	"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2"""	"If you have ever felt anesthetized by modern life, bored with the world of 9 to 5 and sitcoms on the way to yawning yourself to sleep, or pondered if you could have ever become the stereotyped ""loner who becomes a serial killer"" if your life had turned out differently, ""Fight Club"" has some surprising things to say to you.This film was very badly promoted upon its 1999 release, showing only its title aspect, wherein young men meet in private to pummel one another into oblivion.  The surprise as a first-time viewer, years later, is that this is only the middle third of the story, a turning point for an anchorless character who apparently has no family or friends and isn't fond of his job, almost literally sleepwalking his way through a life devoted to filling his empty world with marginally interesting stuff and looking for something that might make him feel alive.The insomniac narrator of the film falls into a rather different circle of friends when his condo is blown to smithereens and he is forced to downgrade his lifestyle considerably.  His introduction to Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) further changes his life path, as our young automobile corporation risk assessment expert begins to reject his superficial, lonely life.  If we didn't grasp the obvious antimaterialistic tone of the script, we surely get it now, as it is literally pounded into our faces repeatedly.The dialogue during this first two-thirds of the film, prior to and including most of the story involving the actual club, is absolutely brilliant, crackling with wit, insight, and great one-liners.  ""We're a generation raised by women,"" Pitt says at one point, in reference to the male-only club.  ""I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""  And when Pitt tells his new friend he should get married, he says, ""I can't get married.  I'm a 30-year-old boy.""At some point this becomes a modern punk version of ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Durden and his club becoming a gang devoted to mayhem on a national scale, taking their anger and frustration to the streets, raising their aim from personal self-destruction to that of dragging the whole world down to their level.  The club becomes a rancid cult of personality, Durden's backward spirituality permeating those around him until they become, ironically, as faceless and drone-like as the corporate workers they pretend to care about ""freeing"" from their lives of 9 to 5 and sitcoms.But the plot twist at about the two-thirds spot of the film, while I never saw it coming, was a cheap device in my mind that completely ruined the film's earnest message for me.  An attempt to raise the bar of its own story, which was fine on its own, this twist (far be it from me to reveal anything here) came off as nothing more than an unwelcome intruder and unnecessary complication that only caused me to lose interest in what had been an unusually original, thought-provoking, brutal (in both the good and bad senses of that word) experience.It basically goes downhill from there, apparently trying very hard to sell the idea that said plot twist is a real part of the story and not just another manipulation on the part of one main character.  By this time, as a viewer, I was totally lost to the story, as the film became something else entirely, spiraling down to an inexplicable ending that only leaves one saying, ""Huh?""I will certainly give ""Fight Club"" credit for its originality.  And again, it is brilliant in the extreme for its first two-thirds.  Certainly not recommended for anyone under 18, nor for the squeamish of any age, ""Fight Club"" is worth seeing for its clever camera tricks and editing, for its social commentary, and mostly for the remarkable prose of the words put into the actors' mouths by screenwriter Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk.But the final 45 minutes or so really ruins what could have been a gripping classic piece of punk cinema, rather than the severely flawed underground cult favorite it has become.  Still, if the so-called ""brilliant plot twist"" were removed and the ending had been untwisted and come about a half-hour sooner, this would clearly be a five-star winner.Kinda like having a great steak dinner with burnt toast for dessert......."	3.0	Two-thirds of a brilliant film	2004-09-20	10	8	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A112BDFYMILEKW	Brian J Bunnell	I had heard a lot of Hype about this movie from my 17 year old brother, so I watched along when he and his friends rented it to watch it for the 8th time.  I watched in horror as they laughed their heads off and marvelled at  the &quot;cool&quot; parts, which happened to be the parts that contained  the most disturbing advances in the plot.This movie has such an odd  message.  It seemed to promote anarchy, trancendentalism, going against  mainstream, but one only has to look at where that kind of living got the  characters to in the end.  You can't live like that.  It doesn't work!  Everything ends up blowing up.  I can't figure out if the message of the  movie was to live life to the fullest and get disconnected from boring  society (as many reviewers here said), or if it was a warning against it.  It didn't make much sense to me.The amazing twist at the end didn't make  a whole lot of sense either.  It didn't really work.  It was too over the  top, and it didn't seem necesary to the movie.So the question is, what  kind of mesage was recieved by the audience?  Were we supposed to agree  with Tyler Derdon's philosophy, as it semed in the beginning?  Or should we  have recognized from the beginning that it would lead to desperate  consequences?  I fear that the cult following of this movie could become  much like the cult in the movie.  I witnessed something very close to that  with a pretty good cross-section of today's teenagers (my brother's  friends).  I fear what will come out of this movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3V691P9BIEFOV	Brian Miller	&#34;The first rule of Fight club&#34; may be &#34;we don't talk about Fight Club&#34;, yet as far as the movie goes I am going to have to break the rule. Fight club is simply awesome; Norton and Pit shine as the personification of the duality of man. Tyler Durden (Brad Pit) is the ultimate bad ass, in your face, anarchy loving, yet charismatic miscreant we have all come to worship as the &#34;most intelligent guy in the room&#34;. He knows what he wants and he is more than willing to take it. or manipulate others into doing so for him.Norton plays a self pitying loner that buries himself in materialism to escape the all too depressing monotony of his life as an product recall actuary. Durden is his perfect doppelganger, he is the self image of what Norton's character wants to be, yet can not bring himself to become. Enter, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter); a person not unlike Norton, falling ever deeper down the hum drum lul of modern life stepping ever closer to the abyss of depression and eventual suicide.Singer becomes like a mirror image of Norton's character, the self he he abuses, but secretly loves. The relationship between Singer and Durden becomes a reflection of Norton's character's own life, trying to make a living in a world that world that views him instrumentality alone; to be used and thrown away if broken.Fight Club starts as a place for Norton to let go; to vent all of the rage and frustration he is to afraid to vent in the waiting world. Yet, escapism (as it often does) turns to bleak realities when he is faced with the ultimate consequences and the death of his friend Bob Paulson (Meat Loaf)  is killed. Norton then realizes that the revolution he has started has become something unrecognizable to him. What had started as a movement of empowerment had turned into a movement of complete anarchy.Faced with this reality, Norton must face himself or loose himself forever. He confronts his doppelganger, and realizes that that image of himself is false, and that Durden is not who he wants to be at all. He realizes that humanity is much more than an instrument for the fortune of other, and that he, himself and not Durden, should be the master of his own fate. This epiphany is realized through the sacrifice of all false ideas of who he wants to be. Norton learns to love himself, and by extension the mirror image of himself Marla, and even as the material world crumbles he is able to be at piece with himself and the love he has found.	5.0	Classic....	2014-01-23	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A300LQSHYXA34O	Brian Reed	Fight Club is a movie that deserves far more credit than it received at original theatrical release.  It is an addicting story that adds to itself as it goes.  It is a movie about the consequences of coasting through life and the meaning that can be gained through experience.  In this film the  unnamed protagonist gets his only meaning for life through a world that is  special and unique to himself.  As he goes through his life, he meets two  very interesting characters, Tyler and Marla.  These two change and add to  his life in the most profound ways.  The clincher at the end of this film  ties these three together beautifully.  The narrator in this film provides  the absolute paragon of existenialism.  You can feel the chemistry in the  interaction between Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.  The background score supplied by the Dust Brothers adds the perfect final  touch to this movie experience.  Fight Club is a movie that should be  viewed with an open mind.  It is a wonderful film that will make you think  and reexamine your life.	5.0	One of the Great Movies of this Generation	2000-04-23	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3S8H5I0A9M2YP	"Brian T. Hayes ""ravenAMP"""	"A great movie, running up only up against the movie, American Beauty, Fight Club is a much more dark and slightly less realistic story that gets across the same message as American Beauty:  ""Life isn't so bad.""  Or at least . . . that's the least complicated way that I can put it.  It's actually much more in depth than that simple statement, but any movie that can actually CONVINCE you of that statement, is amazing.  Alot more can be read into the movie,  I simply choose not too, I feel that that leads to too much obsession.  HOWEVER, if you're looking for a movie that will not only make you think, BUT make your head hurt from thinking alot! go right ahead!  It's a great movie and it gets across an amazing message that is both simple and complex, happy viewing!"	5.0	My Second Favorite Movie	2003-01-03	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A14LIZKKA7WYT9	brigsbmc@cs.com	It is a rare occurrence when one finds a movie that can captivate a viewer and suddenly and without warning turn everything around to the point where the person says,  &quot;Wait a MINUTE!&quot;  David Fincher's masterful and exciting film FIGHT CLUB does more than simply entertain.  It blows the mind!  Edward Norton plays the un-named narrator and average-guy insomniac who becomes obsessed with self-help groups,  though nothing is seriously wrong with him.  When he meets another &quot;faker&quot; as he calls himself,  he becomes mixed up with Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter),  a chain smoker with suicidal tendencies.  Norton flies around the country assessing car damages for his job,  and on a particular flight he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt).  Tyler is the epitome of stylish,  cool,  and without a doubt the one man who can do anything.  Norton's apartment mysteriouly explodes,  and Durden allows Norton to stay with him.  Together,  they discover a certain animal pleasure in fighting.  They form an underground FIGHT CLUB where men meet and simply fight each other.  Soon however,  this organization will become much more than just a club.  Edward Norton gives a phenomenal and mesmerizing performance and establishes himself as one of the best young actors of our generation.  Brad Pitt is simply amazing as Durden, playing a role that only a gifted actor could accomplish.  Helena Bonham Carter gives a surprisingly powerful performance as Marla and gives the character tons of dimension.  Also great is the supporting performace by Meatloaf,  an ex-bodybuilder with testicular cancer.  David Fincher has directed a fast-paced,  humorous,  and spectacular film whose most incredible and surprising twist near the end will knock you off your seat!  I cannot tell you what that is however.  It is something you must find out on your own.	5.0	A Groundbreaking Film! Brilliant Performances!	2001-03-19	1	1	0

The idea of the movie was to make everyone credit go to zero which would created total  chaos.  In the novel, Tyler just wanted to have control over eveything.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2NXXE67I49YTQ	Brittany Wallace	When I originally saw this movie in the theatre I have to say that I  literally had to recover from it before leaving.  I had only gone to see it  because my friend had to review it and I was half dreading it because it  looked like another violent plotless movie.  I don't think I could have  been more far from the truth. Yes, it is violent, but life is violent, and  the violence has a purpose in Fight Club.  It was not simply the plot and  the societal issues the movie portrayed that kept my interest but the  little details that added so much to the movie as a whole-the flashes of  people and places that add to the sense of the surreal life the insomniac  main character is living. What I have found is that most people either  absolutely love or absolutely hate Fight Club.  There is no in between.  For me this is one of the few recent movies that wasn't either pointless  and boring or mere entertainment without a plot	5.0	You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake	2000-09-17	3	3	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A180YVA86PS9KX	Brixton Hokkiado	This whole movie has such an incredible look to it, very stylistic. I haven't seen any other movies that David Fincher has directed, but judging from this I'd have to say that he's awesome. The movie has some differences than the book, nothing too big. A lot of the dialogue is almost directly from the book. There are a few tracks of commentary, including Chuck Palahniuk and the main stars and those are interesting to listen to. Some of the behind-the-scenes features are amusing and I'm so glad that make-up features, costume sketches and multi angles are included.I'm a big fan of the movie so I guess I'm a bit biased, but I do think that the actors are amazing, and the plot is just so wonderfully twisted that I can't see how someone couldn't enjoy this movie.

After a flight home, he meets Tyler Durden. And that's where it begins baby! You hear about this movie all the time and now, I suggest you buy it already. The ending is so intense and confusing you'll find out this movie is really not about fighting. It's much more than that. Best movie of the 90's and probably ever (that's right). Brad Pitt's performance is so memorable that it shows you he is underrated as an actor. You know, since his good looks where the main focus on him.

If you have seen Fight Club, you got that.Ed Norton plays the narrator, a nameless character who's dissappointed by his professional life, his love life, and the world he lives in. A character who could be any one of us. Enter Tyler Durden. Tyler is a man who scoffs at rules, society, and social norms. Tyler is a man who is dangerously smart, and even more dangerously charming.When a series of events bring the two together, things begin to happen.Men once tested their valor and courage in battle, but of late we've been taught that fighting is wrong, to avoid confrontation.But Tyler encourages a generation of disenchanted men to embrace their aggression, to channel it, and to make use of it.Only problem is, Tyler has big plans for society, and there's little to stop him.Learn the frightening ease with which soap can be made deadly. Learn the art of self-destruction.Most of all, get some aspirin for the twist ending if you're watching this for the first time.	5.0	I Am Jack's Sense of Fullfilment.	2003-06-14	0	0	0

Yes, Brad Pitt is a really good bad guy. Yes, The music is great. Yes, the apocalyptic regime known as ""Project Mayhem"" is led by an anarchistic genius.The point of this movie is that we as a society have grown so accustomed to being a part of the big picture that we forget to be individuals. Yeah, yeah; I am too analytical; whatever!""Generation X"" followed the ""ME Generation"" and was followed by the ""Why Generation"". I am a member of Gen-X and I know that Gen-X was and is lost in mediocrity. This film will ring true always because of one simple fact; most people are sheep. Even the people who join the fight clubs and ""Project Mayhem"" are following someone else's lead. Don't you see it. Don't you understand the glaring, screaming point of this film - that most of us are just cogs in a big machine; but we can break away.I love this movie. I love the action. I love the dialogue, the acting, the direction, the editing, the music... But what I really love is the underlying truth that is layered throughout the film and brought to the surface without any pomp and circumstance. We are all desperate for something more, something to be a part of, something that will make us feel (pain, hate, love, anger, rage, emotions of every scale).This is a great film in every way, and Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter deserved, at the very least Oscar nods, but the film was too controversial, to gratuitously violent and destructive. The supporting cast, including a then unknown Jared Leto, Meatloaf (yeah, the singer) who shines, and several other familiar faces, was phenomenal. As a hollywood blockbuster, this film had it all.But, more importantly it had something deeper. You can disagree with me if you are not the ""artsy-fartsy"" type (like me), but the truth remains the same, this film had a point, made the point and took no prisoners along the way.So, live a little, and watch this movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3HTX1NOTTWERP	Busy Body	"Fight Club. Wow, what more can I say? It has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my whole life for so many amazing reasons. It is a brilliantly-acted, superbly-portrayed, beautifully captured, complex masterpiece that was easily the film of 1999. Forget the Matrix and Star Wars for a minute and watch this. You'll soon see that special effects aren't everything and that all you need is a mind-blowing script like the one on display here to make a seismic impact. The film is riddled with dark humor and sharp quotes, violent action and emotional turmoil all of which result in the demise of one man's descent into madness as the approaching millennium beckons. Upon its release the film made a big impact by word-of-mouth, but was harshly snubbed by many award show judges. In the past five years, however, it has gone on to become an uncalculated masterpiece of the highest order that not only appeals to a wide audience, but teaches a strict lesson about the fabrication and consumer-obsessed society that we live in.Edward Norton plays Jack, a man on the verge of being the biggest loser in the world. With no friends or family and stuck in a dead-end job, he turns to victim support groups. The man suffers terrible insomnia and feeds off the depression that the other group members pour forth. His apartment later explodes, forcing him to turn to a man whom he first meets on a plane...The man is of course Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and in all his cocky arrogance and fast-paced way of life makes a big impression on Jack. Tyler is the complete embodiment of the guy who is bad, but we love him because of it. He steals fat from liposuction clinics which he makes into soap, before selling it back to the rich and fat ladies it once came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and splices single frames of pornography into family movies. He has one main motivation in life: to disrupt social ethics and the way in which we live our lives. The people with the typical SUV, the 2.4 children and the idyllic lifestyle that everyone wants.The two man are complete opposites - day and night, as it were. Jack moves in with Tyler when his place is destroyed, and soon finds his life completely changing. When Jack gets talked into a fight with Tyler, he is amazed by how raw and primal he feels from inside. And the rest is history. ""Fight Club"" is formed, a secret underground society where men meet, one-on-one prepared to go head to head bare-knuckles style. The first rule of Fight Club is: ""You do not talk about Fight Club."" The second rule is the same. You get the picture.Helena Bonham Carter is really fantastic as Marla, who is another fake visiting social victim groups when she meets Jack. She drives him crazy, and the rest of the plot is pretty much too hard for me to explain. I've only seen this film twice, bt I still have a hard time explaining what lies beneath it. The genius at work, director David Fincher, has created an intricate and glowing masterpiece that unfortunately gained a reputation as a guy-film because of the violence. It's anything but, and I encourage anyone who enjoys films such as American Beauty to watch it - not for the violence, but for the lesson you'll undoubtedly learn from society's fabrication.You can't really watch this film without seeing how beautifully-filmed it is. Filled with dark and brooding colours and tones of blues and blacks, we get a perfect view of the society in which Tyler and Jack inhabit. Most of the scenes take place at night and the run-down city just reflects the storyline completely. There's also the eye-candy on offer: I don't want to sound clich&eacute;, but Brad Pitt is just so beautiful in this film! There isn't a hotter man alive on the face of the Earth, and this factor alone makes it worth watching a million times, especially the scenes where he's in the bathtub, bedroom, dressing gown, etc. Yum yum!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Fight Club was criticised because of its violence, but for me I can't really see what a fuss people were making of it. Yeah, it deserved its rating and it's not suitable for children, but I truly believe that there's nothing stomach-churning in this film that would make the faint-hearted squeamish! The film makes an impact right from the start and Jack's smart narration is a part of this completely. I haven't revealed the twist that this movie contains, but it's really smart and very well-done. Without knowning what this twist is, you might think that this is just another movie, but you'd be wrong. View it for what it is: a sharp and bright look at society and the ways in which we are told to live."	5.0	Brad Pitt Sizzles In His Greatest Film Role To Date!	2004-05-21	7	5	2

Beats me.  I'm here to tell you about what you really need to know:  is the DVD worth buying?  How does it sound?  How does it look?  What's the bonus stuff like?  Well I tell you, I own over 70 DVD's already, and Fight Club in my opinion is among the best all-around DVD.  Read on to find out why.Aside from the movie (which in this case is great), I look at other key factors in DVD's: the sound, the picture quality, and the extra features.  This baby has it all.  Clean and clear picture transfer that you should expect in any DVD.  This one is among the best.  And the extras?  Tons and tons!  Not only is there a great quantity of material (an entire second disc devoted to it), but it's great QUALITY bonus material as well.  Presentation is excellent.  Some DVD's simply give you a special type of experience becuase of the style and presentation used, and this is one of them.  Now let me get to the best part-  The sound.  I'm a sound freak, and I appreciate great sound.  If you have a good sound setup with 5.1 surround, you'll love Fight Club.  They did a great job on the mixing board with this one.  All in all, this is how ALL DVD's should be made.  Only a few other DVD's are even in the same league (T2 Ultimate Edition and Gladiator just to name a couple).

Even though I could not stop laughing throughout the majority of this film it would be extremely insulting to classify this piece of art as a comedy when it defies all possible labels. As a matter of fact the evil of labels is the thesis ""Fight Culb"" basically expresses; ""You are not your job, or how much money you have in the bank."" This film identifies itself with not only the anti-establisment element but more essentially as an anti-consumer advocate.Besides the insightful themes the viewer will also be delighted with the superb performances of both Norton and Pitt.

ANZIULEWICZ ""Chuck Anziulewicz"""	"For a long time I tended to steer away from this DVD when I would see it on the shelf of the video store, and I'm not quite sure why. It may have had something to do with how the film was marketed: It looked like it was about a bunch of guys beating the living crap out of each other in an effort to vent their post-modern frustrations, with some other plot line involving terrorism thrown in.Of course, ""Fight Club"" is much, MUCH more than that. Yet to say much more than that would be to, ahem, violate Rule #1 of Fight Club, which is: ""You DON'T talk about Fight Club."" But now that I've decided to take the plunge and watch this film, I've been talking about ""Fight Club"" a whole LOT.Here's a film that is stylish, smart, often preposterous, and makes me want to pay a lot closer attention to the career of director David Fincher, because he's a guy with some true artistic vision. Here's a film that, after you've finished watching, makes you say to yourself, ""Gee, now I'll have to watch it all over again!"" Here's a film that is equal parts psychological study and anarchist's wet dream. Sensitive moviegoers ought to be warned, though: ""Fight Club"" is not for the faint of heart: It is a very violent and provocative adult film. It also has some of the most hysterical OFF-screen sex scenes I've ever heard! If you've been putting off seeing this film, put it off no longer.I'm subtracting one star, only because in our post-9/11 world, some of the subject matter seems to lose its adolescent fantasy charm."	4.0	RULE #1: You DON'T talk about Fight Club.	2004-08-18	3	1	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AKV2BGUT50B1X	Carl Robinson	"When the famous American Explorer team of Lewis and Clark went up the Missouri River to explore the Louisiana Purchase, part of their job was to inform the Indian Tribes that they were now under the jurisdiction of the United States and these tribes should cease to make war on each other.  The old chiefs, diplomatic and calm as most older men are agreed, but often replied that tribal leadership was based on valor in war. Without war, they reasoned how would they select new leaders?Fight Club explores this theme.  Men are often at their best when they are in conflict, and for a great many men, the modern world is one of cubicles, shopping malls, and feminine nagging.Enter the Fight Club's un-named Narrator (Edward Norton).  He works in a dead-end, morally bankrupt, and emasculating job, his natural masculine aggression is channeled into an empty consumerism.  In this mode, his moral yearnings are satisfied by ""fair trade"" marketing gimmicks so enjoyed by the upwardly mobile.  This spiritual rut leads to insomnia.The vague, soul-less wandering of the Narrator is emphasized by the location of the movie-although not named it is Wilmington, Delaware.  More often than not, Wilmington is the final destination of all one's credit card payments.  Wilmington is a city where dollars flow to glittering corporate banking headquarters skyscrapers surrounded by a dull rust belt state on the Atlantic Coast.  A drive through central Delaware on US 13 is to take a tour of abandoned houses and crumbling infrastructure.  Delaware also lacks the moral force of Puritan New England and the noble, romantic dash of Dixie.In an effort to combat his sleeplessness, he starts attending support groups.  After visiting Remaining Men Together, a group for men who've lost their testicles to cancer, he has a breakthrough and he is able to sleep and keep in his rut.  What stops him is when he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a wildcat of a woman who is likewise unfulfilled in a primal way.  His insomnia returns.On a business trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and the pair eventually move in together to an abandoned Urban Prairie type of house and create a club where men can fight and thereby re-claim their manhood.  The club grows into a spiritual movement centered around wreaking the soul-less corporate, consumerism that they find so oppressive.  The climax of the movie is a mind-bending plot twist with a denouement that reconciles the narrator's relationship with both Tyler Durden and Marla Singer.Through the movie there is a dark sexual expression that is of the un-reproductive varieties which add to the barren feel of the culture being raged against.  There are several references to dildos and homosexual tension is woven throughout the relationship between Tyler Durden and the Narrator.  Indeed, the story is brought to climax, the narrator supposes, by sexual jealousies.This movie has inspired a great many men to re-evaluate their comfortable existence and there are blogs and internet postings that bemoan the fact that you can't hunt deer in the shadow of the abandoned Sears Tower.  These men in many ways miss the point.  The United States has been at war for more than a decade, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with fighting.  There are also many immoral causes that the corporate/Beltway Political elites carry out that can be brought to account.  In this regard the movie should be seen as an inspiring call to arms rather than mere complaining."	5.0	Fight Club-The Cris de Coeur of Modern American Men	2013-03-20	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A35Q0JTY1S4E54	Carol Amos	I followed this movie obsessively for two years until its release date.  Since I watched Se7en I pictured Fincher to have an absolutely incredible career and as soon as I heard about Fight Club I went out and read the book  and waited forever for the movie to come out.I saw the movie the first  showing and was truly dissapointed.  I did watch it three times because I  was desperate to find all the promise it had but it isn't there.  Yes, it  is very original and definitely has it's moments but it is totally slick  and glossed over.  I was worried it was going to be toned down and would  lose a lot of its power but I didn't think David Fincher would do that.  Well, he did.The violence is not toned down too much.  I know a lot of  people think this movie is ugly because it has raw violence.  Most movie  present a lot of violence as looking sophisticated when in reality it  generally looks very clumsy and ugly.  The characters and themes of this  film are extremely toned down.  Marla was totally miscast.  In Rogert  Ebert's review, he described Marla as a &quot;hellcat.&quot;  Well, she  isn't supposed to be firey she is supposed to be patheticly miserable and  mopey.  In the book she - along with the other characters - burn themselves  with cigarettes and call themselves &quot;human buttwipe.&quot;  The  omission of these actions create a huge, huge void in the characters and  the ideals and representations of the film.  Another example of this is the  lye scene which was just horribly filmed.  Brad Pitt (who, along with Meat  Loaf were the best cast people in the film) says his lines flatly not only  in this scene but in several scenes as though he is afraid to be truly  honest.  In the book, both characters cry and the narrator pees his pants  because the pain of the burning lye is so extreme.  But of course that  wouldn't be in the movie either because it would be too honest and too  realistic.There are many other things but just one I have to mention  is the ending which is absolutely PATHETIC!  I sat through the entire  credits all three times I watched it cause I kept thinking that it must be  a joke and the real ending would come on after the credits.  It is  definitely the most pathetic ending I have ever seen.  It does not fit the  film and is absolutely ridiculous.  It is so AWFUL I could just barf.I  will say that some parts of this movie are excellent but the entire film  had the potential to be unbelievably amazing.  The casting hurt it quite a  bit, too.  The main ones are Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.  Although Norton is very talented the fact that his style is so cerebral is  crippling and kind of phony.  And Bonham Carter simply couldn't convey the  true misery and throbbing decay of thinking death is the only way to stop  hurting.Fight Club deals with a lot of issues that are very painful to  realize.  When issues such as these are presented honestly they are more  uncomfortable than entertaining and Fight Club went for entertainment.  This movie could have been absolutely unbelievable if they all would have  had the guts to be honest.	2.0	slick and glossed over version of the book	2000-06-14	21	14	7
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2S9IG3Q8GF23B	Carol A. Wolf	"You have probably heard of Fight Club, the 1999 film that is regarded has a cult hit and one of the most quoted and re-enacted movies of contemporary times. Not only is it a popular film, but it is also an amazing one. Edward Norton plays a depressed ""The Narrator"" (who is never named throughout the whole entire film) looking to get away from his daily routine and insomnia.The Narrator is played to perfection by Edward Norton. He brings the character to life, and playing some one depressed, that is a hard job. Brad Pitt is amazing and could be his best role. When you watch Helena Bonham Carter you'll see why she always play roles like these; she's perfect. The cinematography is dark and run down, just what you would expect from David Fincher. Most of the sets will stay with, like the apartment, the house in which Tyler and The Narrator stay in, and the bar that Fight Club goes on in. The writing is voracious and almost hard to swallow, which is how it was made. The story focuses on agression and civilization and how it should be torn down. The twist at the end of the story is famous, and the plot is smart and instantaneous, keeping viewers hooked.It falls nothing short of it's reputation. David Fincher has exceeded all, and so has the cast."	5.0	Fight Club Review	2011-04-19	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	I hate fight movies generally unless they are exceptionally well done.  However, this isn't really a fight movie.  It's a movie about fighting with  yourself and the different faces you show to other people.  Both Pitt and  Norton are very good here as well.  They even have the same girlfriend for  awhile, played by Helena Bonham-Carter, who is quite effective in that  role. When I really sat up and began paying attention to this movie was  when Norton went to see a doctor about the acute insomnia he had early in  the movie.  He would go for days without sleep even though he was working a  corporate job.  When the doctor told him the way to get well was to start  attending support groups for diseases he didn't have, I knew that this  movie was really trying something different.  It only gets better from  there as Norton does start attending every support meeting in the city for  every malady known to man.	5.0	This is NOT a movie about fighting others!	2000-06-02	2	1	1

Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter shine....Norton is a character we can all relate to, the grind of work, the seeming boredom and pointlessness of modern  existence..Carter's performance blew me away. The film nearly descends into  boring vigilanism at one point but turns around with a killer ending. The  actual fighting was strangely hypnotic and not boring like I thought it  would be.

I had heard from a friend that this was not just an action movie, so I wanted to check it out for myself.  I am very glad I did.  This movie was one of those that  I didn't want to see in the theater for fear of being thought of as a  blood-thirsty primate.  Sure, the film had some gore scenes that make you  cringe at times, but those scenes are needed to set the right mood for the  story.  I don't think the ending was a &quot;cop-out&quot; either.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1WBXVLOPXZCJJ	Cassie Dobb	I recommend this film to everyone, but the easily offended. The inner trials of a modern man who is no longer going to stand for dealing with the daily grind. The main character, played by Edward Norton, is a weak insomniac working at an office building like that of so many in society today. Trying to find himself, his apartment burns down and he has nothing. He goes to support groups for which he doesn't even have a problem. Mainly because he can cry openly and because &quot;it's amazing how much people are willing to listen to you if they think you're dieing&quot;. When a like minded woman, Marla Singer played by Bonham Carter, starts going to his support groups too he finds his inner self within his imageinary friend and personality disorder named Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. With Tyler he starts Fight Club, (A secret fighting club fro men only). The main project of Fight Club is called Project Mayhem. This film shows plenty of hidden meaning through symbolisim, and although rather it portrays the way that many of struggling, working, nobodies, would deep down like to be. There is also a very unexpected suprise ending!	5.0	Excellent!!!!	2001-05-18	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3VIOCJZ22JZXT	C. B Collins Jr.	What is the role of a man in modern society? What happens when a man searching for some relevance loses his way and goes down the wrong path, and I mean the really wrong path? What emotions will society allow a man to express and under what conditions? If man can't show external signs of emotional pain, what leads him to crave physical pain?  Where are the valid models of masculinity and manhood in our stereotypical consumerism society? Why do men struggle for independence while simultaneously longing to join the pack? How do men redirect or repress anger so they can function in society?  How does modern man cope with the loss of the aggressive, primitive, warrior masculine archetype that haunts our genes? All of these issues are explored in Fight Club.  Despite the violence, this satire and social commentary is highly entertaining.Ed Norton is superb as a young man trying to make sense of his world by maintaining a 9 to 5 job, traveling for work to non-descript towns, restaurants, and hotels, buying a condo and furnishing the condo in a manner that shows he knows what is hip. He grows increasingly hostile to his supervisor and his job. Numb to this world and finding that he has no real meaning in life or outlet for his emotions or feelings of connection, he begins joining 12 step programs and disease/survivor support groups.He joins the testicular cancer support group where men mourn the loss of their testicles and cry in each other's arms. Thus, in a prescribed time and place and condition, men may cry. They can cry over the loss of their manhood, their virility, and their fertility.  But these men are mocked in the film for they choose to cry instead of howling. They show emotional pain rather than crave physical pain as the release of their internal pain.Our narrator meets a young odd woman who craves human connection by attending endless 12 step and support group meetings, just like the narrator. Helen Bonham-Carter plays this role extremely well. So well does she take on this character that this may be one of her strongest performances on film. Wouldn't you think that two young people who crave human contact and genuine emotion so much that they attend endless meetings would find each other? Of course they can't for they don't even know what ails them. They even arrange to attend alternating meetings so that they don't run into each other. Why? Because they may experience genuine emotion should they open themselves to each other.Then Tyler Durden comes into the scene. He is the narrator's image of masculinity; roughly handsome, arrogant, brash, sarcastic quick wit, fights, doesn't really work because he thinks he can outwit the system, can take a beating, has wild sex, and is firmly grounded in an atheistic bleak existential personal philosophy drenched with nihilism. We have seen this character before in the novels of Paul Bowles and Cormack McCarthy. This archetype never ceases to amuse.So many themes emerge in this fast paced film. Tyler begins to introduce our narrator to the fight club, an outlet for their aggression and inner pain. For in beating the hell out of each other men release their aggressive impulses and the genuine physical pain is far more real and preferable than any inner existential pain.  The fight club is a gift for these men.How does a healthy society deal with these impulses? Organized sports and game hunting come to mind. These young men also provide the raw materials for military war machines. But for those men that don't fit into the role of hunter, soldier, or jock; the draw to the fight club is understandable. But once in the fight club, how does this process morph into anarchy and terrorism?  Why do rebellious young men need to be beat and mastered by a leader? How do they come to believe that submission to the power of a hierarchy is a sign of manhood and allow their aggressive urges to be maintained and directed?In the scene where the narrator's hand is burned by lye, we hear Freud's theory of God as a father projection. In casual conversation the narrator and Tyler discuss wishing they could fist fight Hemmingway, Gandhi, and Lincoln.  After a car wreck, Tyler says they had a 'near life experience'. Such odds and ends are woven throughout the film.In the end, this is sometimes a hard film to watch, but underneath the satire and violence is nested essential existential questions. We may have answered many of the questions for ourselves and can sleep at night, but as a society we certainly have not answered the questions.	4.0	Dark social commentary	2008-05-11	4	4	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3P8CU9874SRK5	C. christine	"This movie is based on author Chuck Palahniuk book. The movie could not be made exactly true to the book because it would never work BUT it still stays as true as it possibly can. Although the movie is called Fight Club it's not really about fighting. It's about anyone who has broken from the mold of society and was no longer a sheep. If you ever felt like a slave to society and realized how messed up some of the practices humans involved themselves in every day or ever felt like rebeling against it, then you will love this movie. It's witty, brilliant, and amusing. The actors and actresses are amazing and play their characters perfectly. This is by far one of my favorite movies.Of course if you are just some yuppie or someone perfectly fine with how society is, you will hate this movie and not understand it at all.Some great quotes..""Its not until you lose everything that you are free to do anything.""""On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.""""Listen up, maggots.

Fight Club has carved such an integral niche amongst the great psychological masterpieces ever put on the screen.  Unjustly labeling this feature a ""boxing movie"" is insulting.There is a great deal of fighting going on in this story though.  Not merely physical altercations. It suggests that lots of people are unknowingly on the brink of self-destruction and are in need of some sort of outlet.  It also points out the absurdity of the American lifestyle.With all the intricate layers, this is a movie you can watch repeatedly and always pick up something new.  It really has developed a cult following."	5.0	A morgue for lifeless thoughts	2007-02-10	5	5	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	"In a way, ""Fight Club"" is the rough, often brutal, and intensely masculine counter part to ""American Beauty"".  Both films examine contemporary, American, middle class society and both argue that its raison d'tre is  predicated on a false set of values. In ""American Beauty"" many of the  characters mire themselves in worthless distractions and intense denial in  order to achieve happiness within the limitations of middle class society.  ""Fight Club"" asks why we should work at jobs we hate to buy stuff that we  don't need and then offers a defiant answer. We shouldn't. Instead, we  should define our self-interest in terms of our collective primal  requirements.For men, this boils down to violence, competition, and  proving themselves physically. The violence, however repugnant it may seem,  takes place in an intensely ritualized format that offers something to all  of its participants. Anyone who thinks that this is hokey and unrealistic  should go to a boxing gym or martial arts training hall. Most of the  participants in such places are not psychotic Neanderthals, but sensitive,  well-behaved yuppies of both genders. Many of the fight scenes in ""Fight  Club"" reminded me of these places not because of the violence but because  of the competition and camaraderie one finds there.""Fight Club"" argues that people have reached  the apogee of this trade off-that they have given up too much freedom to  obtain a diluted and highly regulated form of happiness. The logical  conclusion of  ""Fight Club"" is that people will only be able to lead an  honest and fulfilling life when the instruments of late mature capitalism  are destroyed. Thus the film ends with the bloodied, wounded protagonist  and his girl friend watching the destruction of leading banks and credit  card companies and the dawn of a new era.Understandably, some people  object to the overly masculine nature of the film and its apparent  exclusion of women. My own understanding is that the film focuses on men's  response to contemporary society but is not meant to deny the role of women  in any fashion. It has received accolades from a leading feminist, Susan  Faludi (author of ""Back Lash"") which hopefully confirms this point. If  violence bothers you then definitely do not watch this film. But violence  aside, it is a film of ideas that addresses what society offers us today  and how we can respond to it."	5.0	A violent but intelligent social critique	2000-08-29	3	3	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2PBV1899CX3TE	"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!"""	"From the opening sequence of Fight Club, you know you are in for a wild ride. It takes you right inside a brain, synapses firing, fear response triggered. Really cool music. You know it is CGI, but it looks like you are right inside the old grey matter. It looks like they spent a lot of money, and they did. The opening sequence was budgeted separately from the rest of the film. If they liked what they saw, then they would spring for the sequence the way that director David Fincher wanted it. They came, they saw, they liked, they sprang.Fight Club, the film, is the story of a book by Chuck Palahniuk that would seem an unlikely source for a film. It wasn't as if he wrote it with the idea of selling the film rights, but certain people with rare vision could see it had potential. What were the sources of the ideas for the book?Author Chuck Palahniuk first came up with the idea for Fight Club after being attacked on a camping trip when he had the temerity to complain to some unhappy campers about their noisy radio. When he returned to work he found that nobody would acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such banal things as ""How was your weekend?"" Palahniuk concluded that people reacted this way because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to get involved, or were afraid of someone who spent their weekends getting into fist fights. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.He chose the name Tyler Durden after the character of Toby Tyler in Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with a Circus (1960), a book that was also made into a Disney movie, and a man called Durden with whom Palahniuk worked, who was fired for sexual harassment. Marla Singer was named after a girl who used to bully Palahniuk's sister in school.Much of the specific content of the novel (such as splicing single frames of pornography into family films, attending support groups for the terminally ill, erasing video tapes, etc.) came from stories told him by friends, and from things his friends actually did. Whilst writing the novel, Palahniuk also interviewed numerous young white males in white-collar jobs, discovering that ""the longing for fathers was a theme I heard a lot about. The resentment of lifestyle standards imposed by advertising was another."" So, in a nut shell, the themes of Fight Club are the longing for a father figure, and anti-consumerism.With the cult status of Fight Club, has the film itself become just another consumer product?----------------Narrator: When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything, the IBM Stellar Sphere, the Microsoft Galaxy, Planet Starbucks.===========Director David Fincher said in an interview in UK film magazine Empire, that there is a Starbucks coffee cup visible in every shot in the movie. Starbucks didn't mind this rampant product placement, but drew the line at a scene where a 'corporate coffee bar' was destroyed along with some corporate art as part of Project Mayhem. Starbucks pulled their name from the scene and the gold globe sculpture crashes into a shop named Gratifico Coffee.----------Tyler Durden: If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?Narrator: Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.========Chuck Palahniuk told the producers from the very start that, although he fully supported the adaptation, he wasn't interested in writing the screenplay himself. Initially, producer Laura Ziskin considered hiring Buck Henry to adapt the novel, due to the many thematic similarities between Fight Club and The Graduate (1967). I don't really see the similarities. However, Jim Uhls was chosen as the writer instead of Buck Henry. Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky), Andrew Kevin Walker, director David Fincher and actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton also did uncredited work on the screenplay. Pitt and Norton improvised some dialogue, and added other little touches. At one point, when the Narrator, played by Norton, knocks on the door to complain that Tyler and Marla are making too much noise Pitt answers wearing a yellow rubber glove, and asks him if he wants to join them. The studio wanted to cut this, but it got big laughs at test screenings. Brad Pitt also provided much of his own wardrobe.--------Narrator: Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. Tyler's gone.======Fox 2000 Pictures executive Raymond Bongiovanni, who died shortly before the project was green-lit, first discovered the book whilst still in galleys. Prior to his death, Bongiovanni worked tirelessly to get the project off the ground, and in his obituary, it said that his last wish was that the novel be made into a film. It was Raymond Bongiovanni who sent it to Laura Ziskin, President of Production at Fox 2000 Pictures. She felt it was a tremendous piece of literature, but not necessarily a great movie. The book was sent to a studio reader to evaluate its potential as a possible film, and the report sent back to Ziskin dissed the novel, saying it could never be made into a film, that it was ""exceedingly disturbing"", ""volatile and dangerous"", and would ""make audiences squirm"". Somehow, the bad report made certain people all the more determined to do the film, convinced that they had a hold of some really provocative material.-------------The movie's line ""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club"" was #27 of ""The 100 Greatest Movie Lines"" by Premiere in 2007.==========This film was made prior to the events of September 11, 2001, and one wonders if it could have even been made afterwards. One event that did occur after filming that dramatically changed the way test audiences reacted was the Columbine School shootings. The scene where the narrator threatens his boss got laughs at test screenings, but afterwards, was not so funny. Though the film did gather quite a cult following, I don't think that it inspired anyone to do anything--to copy cat Tyler Durden. No one started any Fight Clubs that I know of, unless they followed the first and second rules of Fight Club and didn't talk about it. No Project Mayhems were inspired by Fight Club to my knowledge.-----------Tyler Durden: We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact.========Edward Norton was an inspired casting choice. He had gained a lot of weight to play  skin head in American History X, but he lost it for Fight Club to play the more cerebral narrator. The novel Fight Club is largely an interior monologue taking place inside the narrator's head, and voice over can sometimes not go over so well in a film, where you want to show rather than tell. Here though, it worked perfectly, due to Norton's dry delivery.---------Narrator: I am Jack's cold sweat.========Brad Pitt was also an inspired casting choice as Tyler Durden. As I've said, he provided his own costumes from his personal wardrobe. The clothes that Tyler Durden wears are flashy, tacky--perfect for someone who would answer the door wearing a yellow rubber glove. He really understands Tyler Durden and delivers with gusto. I think that Fight Club is some of his best work. He was kind of out there in 12 Monkeys, but that movie wasn't firing on all pistons like Fight Club. His 12 Monkeys was kind of a gallant attempt that failed. Snatch? Give me a break. He approached Fight Club level as the killer Early Grayce in Kalifornia, but Tyler is such a rich and complex character that it leaves all of his other roles in the dust.--------Tyler Durden: I want you to hit me as hard as you can.======Helena Bonham Carter makes a great Marla Singer. At times you almost wonder if she is an imaginary character, a figment of the narrator's fervent imagination.------------Narrator: Marla's philosophy of life is that she might die at any moment. The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.==========Helena Bonham Carter is a very interesting actress who deserves her parts, even if she does sometimes sleep with the director to get a part (she is married to Tim Burton who cast her as The Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland). She was perfect as Marla Singer.-------------------Marla Singer: There are things about you that I like. You're smart, you're funny, you're... spectacular in bed... But you're intolerable! You have very serious emotional problems. Deep seated problems for which you should seek professional help.Narrator: I know, and I'm sorry...Marla Singer: Yeah, you're sorry, I'm sorry, everybody's sorry, but... I can't do this anymore. I can't. And I won't. I'm gone.=================Meat Loaf and Jared Leto were my favorites among the rest of the cast. They are both also very talented musically, but have a lot of stage presence in films. Leto was Angelface, the blonde space monkey who gets pulverized by the narrator in a Fight Club bout, his pretty face nearly destroyed. Meatloaf was Bob, whose reaction to testicular cancer chemo therapy was to grow enormous breasts.-------------Repeated phrase: His name is Robert Paulsen.============On the Friday that the film was released theatrically in the U.S., Rosie O'Donnell appeared on her TV show and said that she'd seen the film and had been unable to sleep ever since. She then proceeded to give away the twist ending of the film and urged all of her viewers to avoid the movie like the plague. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and David Fincher discuss this incident on their DVD commentary track, with Pitt calling O'Donnell's actions ""unforgivable"". I remember when Rosie was on The View and she was ecstatic that Britney Spears had finally broken up with K. Fed. She celebrated with confetti and streamers, as if she thought that Britney was now going to forsake all men and join her team. As Britney's behavior grew increasingly erratic, this seemed more and more ill advised. When K. Fed was later awarded custody of their children, we all breathed a sigh of relief. I even took Donald Trump's side in their stupid feud, and even more astonishingly, also sided with Hasslebeck! When Rosie was kicked off The View and replaced with Whoopie, I celebrated with a little confetti and streamers of my own. Oh, Rosie, dear, just kidding, but sometimes you can be so nutty. How is that crush on Tom Cruise going?----------------Narrator: How embarrassing... a house full of condiments and no food.==============The Bottom Line is that Fight Club was ""exceedingly disturbing"", ""volatile and dangerous"", and would ""make audiences squirm"". And it is funny. It is also a masterpiece of film making, and even the author, Chuck Palahniuk, thinks that the film version actually improved on the novel. The director, David Fincher, really took the somewhat fragmented ideas in the text and fashioned out of the shards a bold cinematic vision. The cast, mainly Norton, Pitt, and Bonham Carter, backed him to the hilt, and the result is sublime. The film ended up costing about 67 million, and may not have earned back nearly that amount, but in terms of artistic value, it was worth every penny.------------Narrator: It's called a changeover.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A34JGR3LMV1I64	ceffalo	"This film is both underrated and overrated.  It's underrated because I don't think major critics have always given this one a great recommendation, as it deserves such.  I've discovered that, in most cases, if Brad Pitt is in a film then it is probably a good movie.  This one is in many ways.  However, I must also say that it is fully overrated in that those who really champion this film give it a lot more credit than it actually deserves, probably because of how ""cool"" the story goes with them.There are quite a few fight scenes and they are genuinely authentic fighting scenes.  As such, I don't think someone under 18 years of age should watch this movie.The actual content of the film, however, could not be more well developed.  If you've seen 12 Monkeys then I must tell you that some of the idea in this film is very similar to that one, and while I don't think this movie is as intelligent as that, it is indeed a well designed idea altogether.One thing is certain.  If you have no idea what this film is about I can tell you that figuring out what is actually going on is not very easy.  A truly detached movie watcher can probably figure it out and yet still be fully entertained by it.  If you get sunk into the movie, though, you will be well into it before you understand what's happening, and the epiphany delivered is absolutely the tops.  A genuine work of art.Don't be deceived by the title to this film.  It's a far deeper idea than it would appear on the surface, and it's far more rewarding than most films could ever be.It's a five star film.

So maybe I can change a few minds with this review...?WEll, this movie starts off looking nothing like a thinking movie, if you base your opinion solely on the titel and a lot of the trailer info that they gave. But as soon as you start watching it, you realize how much thinking the cast and crew did in it, and how much thinking you need to do to pick up on everything. And trust me, no single viewing will reveal everything! Also, this movie is borderline psychotic. And you feel THAT, too. By the end of this movie I was beginning to feel just as insane as our hero (played by Edward Norton). And the ending. Well, let's just say that the ending... Well, not to be stereotypical, but you have to watch it for yourself. And watch it you will. But remember, &quot;The first rule of Fight Club is never talk about Fight Club&quot;.	5.0	Really a thinking movie (Simply Incredible!)	2000-10-01	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ASCECH3KOZ3P	C. Gardner	"""Fight Club"" is a great film that not only satirizes self-help movement, but takes on the myth of our ""alienation"" that spawned it. Apart from the direction, acting, and technical achievement of the film, all of which are first-rate, the most fascinating thing about this work is the convoluted & self-referential story which plays out between the Narrator (Edward Norton), his world, the film, and our reality as viewers (it's a better and far more interesting illustration of paradox than ""Adaptation"", and a textbook example of the concept of irony).The Narrator's story opens with a person named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) about to kill him. The Narrator ""backs up"" and tries to tell the audience how this came about. He began attending 12-step and support groups to feel something--anything--in his numb existence...Thus he thought he could care, creating an illusory world where he ""has a heart"" but yet at the same time can feel superior to these unfortunate people. His fantasy is interrupted by the entrance of another ""tourist"" with the same agenda--Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She challenges his little fantasy. He gets angry and retreats back into his insomniac nights, endless television, and Ikea catalogs.Then he meets Tyler, a pseudo-Niezschean malcontent soap-salesman who's fed up with modern existence. Their alienation and loneliness leads these two men to create--well, let's just call it a men's self-help group which Tyler claims gets them back to basics. The Narrator falls for this all the way. His consciousness is split--he knows there's truth to what Tyler is selling him, but also knows that he's taking part in promulgating a tired old lie: the myth that their primal selves has been narcotized by office life & materialism & consumerism. Their solution to this myth--the Fight Club--burgeons across the nation, sprouting ""unauthorized"" fight clubs. Tyler takes control like a fascist leader, manipulating the sheep created by the very society he despises. The Narrator knows that Tyler in fact needs this consumerist society, to be the iconoclast he is...Tyler replies by creating something called Operation Mayhem, a terrorist operation which will prove to the Narrator that Tyler means to destroy this society at its source: the credit institutions which make it possible for people to cover their essential nothingness by buying endless material goods. Tyler tries to break him out of his denial to make him go ""all the way."" Then a twist happens...A strange twist which renders everything seen so far doubly ironic. I don't want to give it away, but it should inspire lots of conversation about the concept of the self, the modern cliches of ""man's alienation"" and redemption from materialism.What a great & classic film. Look for the subliminal images of Tyler before the Narrator meets him, which Fincher spliced into the film."	4.0	The New and Ironic Walter Mitty	2003-02-26	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2S4A8N8BDRG1L	Chalupa Jones	When i first saw this movie, i was inspired by the scenes of the vultures torturing the young monkeys. The fact that honey mustard was used for their baptism was somewhat freightening, but the movie redeems itself when Brad Pitt (also known as Mr. Stromboli) inherits two million pounds of green roses.An interesting oak tree once spoke to me. He held my hand. Gently. Ever so gently. And he told me that everything would be okay. Maybe it was his courage that led me to bring him into bed with me. That was painful. But his gentle caress took me to deep oceans of heavenly chocolate. The morning after was awkward. I made him scrambled eggs with turkey bacon, but he did not have a mouth. So i polished his leaves instead. Or maybe it was that he was actually a woman at heart. A purple woman.	5.0	A Special Monkey	2007-08-24	10	3	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1D36RZWTZM19O	"Cheshire ""Seriously, it's all opinion. Don't ..."	i am amazed and disappointed after seeing this movie. my first thought after watching this movie was &quot;Son of Clockwork Orange&quot;.  or maybe grandson, since 'Son' probably was a yuppie. every time we have a generation grow up we get angry young male boredom, ennui, frustration and existential depression, especially if they are smart and abused as children.  the kind of rage this movie is about is not only examined and described (emotionally, sociologically), but is quite a, if twisted, mind-blowing fantasy (i'd say a mostly male fantasy)for some of us realizing that sunday school is a lie. not everyone, mind you, but a sizeable small percentage feel angry when they realize good thoughts may be meaningless. if your abilities to distinguish art from reality are solid, rent this movie. for the plot details, see below my review.  better reviewers than me already described the plot.while the emotional intensity of the movie is very very high, you don't want to think about the plot changes too much about 2/3rds through the movie. some movies go down to oblivion, i hope this one doesn't. it truly is close to great, but misses. its a nightmare of a show that nails down a point of view with a bloody sledgehammer.  i recommend keeping this out of the hands of any emotionally disturbed, but otherwise, an excellent choice to experience a type of anger vicariously, but safely from your living room.  the ending is a bit of a cheap shot (figuratively and literally), and cheesy, and indicates a failure of courage by the studio.  or perhaps, they ran out of ideas. the entire movie is such an extreme morality story, maybe a real ending that fits this dark comedy couldn't be done for public consumption. and some of the comedy belongs to a different, more silly, movie.  the bits about the military male lemming groupie characters sent the movie's general atmosphere and the frightening, if a little like hearing one note for almost two hours, moral into retreat, finally.  the suggestion that the rage was induced in boys who were raised by mothers only (ack!), and then who were further messed up by the strain of trying to meet white collar standards of America, but found themselves failing to measure up, sent the plot completely off the rails as the groupies spread into a military fashion and hazing show and bombings and arson, even subverting police detectives who shared the vision.  the message became, our civilization is creating disgusted male sissies who were too influenced by women, and who will do anything to feel real (masculine) again. that masculinity, it seems, is restored by masochism. it would have worked better if they had stuck to being a psychological character study, rather than becoming a male 13 year old's idea of creating honor.  still, a very interesting movie.because the movie had intensity and a few great ideas (&quot;Are you looking at me?&quot; redux), and was fast paced and exciting, with good acting, i gave it three stars.  but you really need to just watch it and don't think.  the plot goes funny (odd) in the end.	3.0	brilliant,  depraved and shocking, but stumbles	2000-11-27	7	2	5

It has probably  been put in this basket because of the questions it asks of many of our  societal values. Whatever the case it is a very enjoyable movie to watch  but you have probably made that decision already.Is the DVD worth buying  ? DEFINITLEY. The movie lends itself to multiple viewings (I believe it  gets better after the first viewing) and DVD is the perfect medium for this  -  Great quality visuals and a very interesting soundtrack that makes good  use of a surround sound setup. (also good in 2CH stereo)The extras are  also very interesting. The commentary tracks are all worth listening to,  offering an insight into the thematic choices made (Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed  Norton, Helena BC track, Screenwriter/author track, Fincher solo track),  the special effects(Track 4, Fincher solo) and just some funny stories from  the set.(All tracks)The second disc of extras will keep you busy as  well. It offers a number of insights into how special effects were used to  dramatic effect. Multi-angle is used here but I didn't find this aspect as  useful. I just watched the clips through twice, once on each angle. Also  included are some removed scenes with comparisons and explanations on why  they were not there.I would have liked a longer documentary on the  second disc but I'm getting picky now.Fight Club on DVD is topped off by  the BEST packaging for a DVD that I have ever seen. Very attractive and  also functional.If you liked the movie you have to own this DVD.	5.0	A film that deserves this special treatment	2000-06-20	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3NRYTL8ZWL6BQ	cholman	"Although David Fincher's Fight Club, is acclaimed by many critics as an excellent film who's ideas and revolutionary filmmaking may shape the way that movies of the future are made, many people do not like Fight Club.  Violence undoubtedly turned some people off to the movie, however many people who do not like Fight Club, do not dislike the film because of its violence, but rather because these people have an inability to comprehend and/or identify key components of the plot and its underlying themes.Fight Club has every element that defines a classic movie.  The complex satirical plot is well developed although; it does require an open-minded audience.  The plot is enhanced drastically by a witty and comical dialect.  In order to be an epic film, acting performances must be impeccable, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both delivered all-star performances and every supporting actor or actress was cast perfectly to fit their parts.  Innovative visual effects were used throughout the film, to enhance the already energetic movie.  Scenes like the one where Edward Norton's character describes the accesorizing of his apartment are unlike any display of effects of the past.  Even the sound was befitting of the film.  The soundtrack does not consist of a lot of big name acts; it merely includes tracks that would go well with certain scenes.  Above anything else it is the motifs, the ideas being presented, and the way in which they are being presented that makes the film the masterpiece that it is.One of the ideas that Tyler Durden tries to convey to Edward Norton's character throughout the film is the idea that as he puts it, ""It's only after we've lost everything that we are free to do anything.""  Tyler tries to show him that life would be much more valuable if people stopped worrying about the material things that truly don't matter.  Like when he holds a gun to Raymond, the store clerk's head, and tells him that he is going to die.  Raymond really thinks that he is going to be shot.  Then when Tyler tells him that he must get back on the track of being a veterinarian, which Raymond had always dreamed of but given up on, because it was ""too much school"", or else he would be killed. Tyler is able to show Edward Norton's character that Raymond's life will be better.  Every breath that he takes will be sweeter than most people can ever imagine.  At this moment in time Raymond won't be thinking about what kind of car he drives or what type of stereo he owns, he will be glad that he is getting a second chance and will live his life to the fullest.Fight Club has every aspect of a great movie, yet many people do not like this wonderful film.  Fight Club uses beat-em-up and often brutal satire to portray intense ideas, and some viewers may have trouble understanding these ideas.  Fight Club is not for the faint of heart, but rather an audience who is willing to open their mind to the experience of not only watching a great film, but also questioning their own lifestyle."	5.0	Pure In-your-face Brilliant Satire	2001-05-02	3	2	1

If you think this movie is good, find an adult and have them explain to you why this is complete and utter bovine excrement.I've had the misfortune to see much of this movie twice and it just gets worse. Bad writing, bad acting, lack of substance and a complete dissasociation from reality make this a stinker for the ages.My theory is that Brad Pitt didn't want Seven to be known as his worst movie so he did Fight Club.	1.0	"If you think this movie is ""deep"", you aren't"	2005-03-20	64	20	44

Admittedly it had some interesting concepts and was well acted but how it came together bothered me. It probably works much better in its book format. Though there are some scenes, like the scar-ing scene which work very well to have me on edge. But on the whole i couldn't rate this any better. 2.5 would be my prefered rating. It lacks pacing in many places and in many places you lack a reason to want to continue on through the film. I saw it because of the hype and was let down, but don't be fooled.Its worth a glance if you have the time or its on TV but not for buying if you haven't seen it yet.On the whole, Wholely unsatisfying.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1HDKL3YGMWWK6	Chris Kreft	Jack is employed by a major car manufacturer to evaluate whether recall of their vehicles is necessary. A fairly normal job, you'd think. But Jack is not normal. Far from it. Jack is a chronic insomniac. In his own words: 'Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy.' (Just one of the many brilliant quotes from this movie). To cure his insomnia, Jack joins support groups - for anything. Be it testicular cancer patients who've lost their privates or leukoma patients who just want to be laid one more time before they die, Jack goes to them all. And strangely, finds that this gives him blessed sleep at night. That is, until Marlo shows up - a ... who fakes disease to join these groups. Jack is back to being an insomniac again until he meets Tyler, a soap salesman, who blows up Jack's apartment (but you'll only figure that out later). The two of them begin 'Fight Club' - a club where middle/low class people come to...fight each other. Might sound stupid, but eventually the two of them build a network that spans the entire USA. The movie has a surprise at the end, which I won't spoil. It's one of those movies which you can watch a thousand times and still not grasp the meaning of everything. But it's got a great story line, plenty of great quotes and two great actors (Brad Pitt & Edward Norton).

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AQ1YFEZN3CPRD	Chris 'Powerhous' Duffield	I watched this at the cinema, and one misfortunate idiot two rows infront of my took it upon himself to leave 40 mintues into the film. No. This film isn't about fighting! Although you'll have to 'endure' a lot especially at the beginning. It is ONE film that conveys so many different and complex  ideas that it left me thinking! Its about  men's primal instincts, and  fight for self respect, and for spiritual freedom. Its about the longing we  feel to escape from the materialism of the world, about anarchy and the  price it brings. How we can never escape comformity, even when seeking  anarchy. I was puzzled by some aspects of the film that didn't make sense.  But i passed those off as silly parts of the film, and as it was a film, I  let the unbelieveable bits go. But suddenly, at the end, it all came  together and made sense!  Above all, the twist at the end knocked me  sideways, and even left me questioning my own sanity. The strangest of  things can happen even to the most normal people.	5.0	Wow	2000-02-05	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AAOMG1YP0VNP9	Chris 'raging bill' Burton	Many films based on books, whether they are good or not, do not usually capture the brilliance of the book. This film exceeds it. What's more, unlike a lot of films (Jurassic Park for example) the film version follows the book quite closely. It would be easy to pass off Fight Club as another violent male aggression film like Die Hard, but this is so much  more. It explores philosophies on life and has a deep and intricate plot.If you like dark grim violent films, then you cannot go wrong with this. But this isn't mindless or even gratuitous. It has a superb storyline (which I won't ruin) but the jist of it is exploring both sides to someone's personality. The film is also very well scripted, with extra bits that the book didn't have. It changes here and there, and sometimes scenes have been twisted. But this is a true and justifiable interpretation of the novel.Another great thing about this is the acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are all supurb. Carter prooves that being attractive doesn't mean you are automatically an airhead..., and although Pitt is the sort of bloke that other blokes love to hate (why are you punishing me God?!) the truth is that he is a very good acter, not just some guy with a cute ass who has wormed his way into your sister's heart. Lastly, there is Edward Norton. Pitt has the famous name which is perhaps why he is portrayed as the lead character (its kind of a cross between him and Norton really) but Norton is the narrater and he plays his part best in my opinion. But all three of them are fantastic.The only pitfall is that the conclusion is not very well explained as it was in the book, but this does leave the viewer asking questions which is a good thing.All in all this has everything - a great storyline plus great acting, directing and soundtrack to drive it through. Truly one of the best films I've ever seen.	5.0	One of best films ever made. No, really	2002-03-27	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A343N9H4ZZNSV6	Christian McCrea	Well, the other reviewers have covered the film quite well, but I want to discuss the DVD's features, and how they add to the film.First of all, let me tell you about where I come from when I give this movie/DVD 5 stars.  I have a strong bias for this film ... it *is* my favorite .. and it is  because its my favorite that I think I would be the toughest critic of the  DVD.The video transfer is superb...the audio is superb (THX)...the  presentation is superb. The standout feature of the DVD is....the features!  TV spots, deleted scenes, storyboards, bios, animated menus, alternate  angles for some vignettes...its all here. My highlight is choosing the  audio and font (yes...font) for alternate versions of the intro  sequence.The presentation material (booklet) has positive and negative  reviews, in keeping with the attitude of the film...and looks  amazing.This is the DVD release for 2000 so far. It eats the Matrix for  breakfast. If you like the movie even a little bit, then you must  experience this - a true collector's edition.Perhaps the one thing I  would have liked would be the script included on the DVD...but, hey...I  have that already.	5.0	Fight Club - DVD Specific	2000-05-30	19	14	5

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3NLH4A3XP4WA5	Christopher Graff	"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton star in this modern age morbid tale of discontent directed by David Fincher.  ""Fight Club"" is an orginization that collects all the anger and discontentment of society into one large street fighting gang.  Pitt (Tyler Durgin) is a sleezy projectionist/waiter that entrances Norton who is a low scale desk jockey working for some car company into joining his masquerade in the streets.  The two become enthralled by their creation and soon fight club becomes a weekly ritual, and then, a daily one.  Fight clubs begin to spring up across the country, and soon Durgin is a celebrity within the underworld.  An uncanny relationship with a doped up drug adict teen aged girl tear the bonds between Norton in Pitt.  The movie ends in a strange, apocalyptic and not very satisfying manner."	3.0	Morbid, interesting..awkward ending	2002-03-28	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A10QEVG4BJON61	Christopher Horne	This is one of those rare films that keeps getting better every time you watch. Smart, subversive, funny, and just plain brilliantly crafted, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the 1990s. Based on a novel by Chuck  Palahniuk, this movie tells the story of an exhausted and strung-out  Gen-Xer played by Edward Norton who &quot;befriends&quot; Tyler Durden,  played by Brad Pitt, and creates Fight Club together to rebel against the  consumerist society that they feel powerless against. All hell breaks loose  when Tyler feels that things should be taken to the next level and Edward  Norton's character finds himself again caught up in a world he believes he  doesn't have any control over. There's a sublime twist at the end, and it  took me several viewings to catch all the subtle nuances that hinted  throughout the movie that things are not as they seem. Both Edward Norton  and Brad Pitt do a fantastic job in conveying a sense of hopelessness and  nihilism and their violent reactions against society. Forget about the  asinine controversy surrounding the film, because this is a film to watch,  think about, and then watch again.If that weren't enough, the DVD itself  is jam-packed with outtakes, still gallerys, commentary, behind-the-scenes,  production notes, and a slew of goodies on two discs. Let's not forget the  great packaging design, which makes this DVD one to keep and cherish for  years to come. If only all DVDs came this way! Now, all I have to do is get  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt to sign this thing. . .	5.0	Not just a great DVD, but a collector's item!	2000-06-27	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AEWLPLE3R5GVS	"Christopher Norwood ""cnorwoodrn"""	Fight Club is the best movie I've ever seen, but I didn't know that the first time I watched it.  I knew that I liked it, but I wasn't sure whether I should feel a little guilty about that or not.  At first viewing, it seemed that it was a little offensive and brutal.  As I watched it a few more times, however, I came to realize that it is in fact a brilliant dark comedy.  While this movie has gotten a lot of bad publicity about its violence and all, it you pay attention you actually notice that rarely is violence glorified, and is usually made fun of in some way or shown to be silly and excessive.  In fact, anyone who says that it is filled with &quot;gory sensationalized meaningless violence&quot; has either never watched the movie or is incapable of seeing past the most obvious, superficial aspects of the film.  While the movie appears to be about the struggle of &quot;real men&quot; against the emasculating forces of modern society (most namely the scourge of Scandinavian furniture), it is actually about the struggle within one particular man (&quot;Jack&quot;) to discover himself.  It is witty, original, and facinating.  The more you watch it, the more you see and understand of both the plot and the underlying theme and purpose.  Oh yeah, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are flawless as well.That's the movie review.  Now on the the DVD.While the movie itself is fantastic, the DVD itself is even better.  It is chocked full of special features, the best of which being the commentary track including David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.  I could spend lots of time detailing all of my favorite features, but I can far more easily just say that they're all very cool.  This fantastic movie and the peerless DVD make for a must buy.	5.0	Soap Is Cool!	2001-12-27	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3CM1CDUSWYDIO	Christopher Schmitz	"In 1999, a decade into the bookish Men's Movement, its concerns have finally been committed to celluloid.  ""Fight Club's"" Tyler Durden represents the cocky virile manhood missing in the pale fluorescence of modern man's office life in a service economy.Brad Pitt's Tyler chainsmokes, wears red leather, dresses garishly, behaves transgressively, and begins a paramilitary movement to overthrow the glaze the American corporate world has placed in the eyes of its drone workers.We begin, however, with Ed Norton's emasculated Jack, an insurance appraiser whose unchanneled emotion has made him a sag-eyed insomniac.  Physically healthy, Jack discovers illness support groups as a means to vent his sadness and frustration.  It's there that he meets sassy basketcase Marla Singer (Helena Bonhma Carter) whom he is too much of a eunuch to seduce.  The first half is the film is sharp black humor as Jack and Marla begin their bizarre courtship.Slowly Jack's macho alter ego Tyler begins eclipsing his gentle cooperative persona to the point where, under Tyler's influence, he burns his well-appointed IKEA-packed urban condo and moves to the seedy edge of town near a malodorous paper mill.  Tyler and Jack, in buddy movie fashion, are first depicted as like-minded friends, both on the run from capitalistic values and their commodifying effect on human beings as well as a male-bashing Ritalin-crazed post-feminist world.  In their large dilapidated shabby-chic home, they create a male precinct where the traditional masculine values of freedom, mischief, rebellion, and vitality can thrive.In a touching scene, Tyler and Jack discuss the absence of fathers, hinting that this missing piece of their upbringing is behind their vague but tender homoeroticism.  In their spare time, the duo form FIGHT CLUB, a group of disaffected men who meet in the basements of bars for bare knuckles boxing sessions which those involved find cathartic and invigorating.In the Bible Christ says:  ""I came not to bring peace but a sword.""  Tyler Durden can be seen as a Christ figure.  As a 30something, he's the right age.  He gathers an enthused discipleship.  He preaches of a spiritual war against materialism and docility.  Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, we get The Sermon in the Basement.  Tyler takes on the powers that be in his society, much as Christ did, with an army of misfits and outsiders, and he proves he is willing to die for his cause.""Fight Club"" flies in the face of political correctness every chance it gets and reminds us how sex and aggression animate our lives.  The scene in which Tyler gives Jack a searing chemical burn on the back of his hand is the film's shuddering climax.  Jack tries to disappear into New Age fantasy as Tyler urges him to stay with the pain.  This is Jack's hazing into manhood, recalling the male rites of passage of primitive tribes.  It reflects Christian mythos as well, since the scar from Jack's burn resembles one of Christ's stigmata.  Jack and Tyler then proceed to give this scar to all new Fight Club members.When Fight Club morphs into ""Operation Mayhem,"" Tyler's vandalistic direct attack on civilization, Jack becomes skittish and winds up out of the information loop of an organization he helped to create.  He and Tyler clash, which yields a shocking revelation about them I won't spoil here.""Fight Club"" and ""American Beauty"" (both 1999) rail against the domesticated demise of American frontier manhood.  Their central characters are willing to pay a high price for freedom.  These characters' failures and disconnections lead to a kind of endearing macho campiness, and many will be lead to sympathize with their ""male malaise.""""Fight Club"" is like a gun aimed at the idealized androgyny and co-ed conversion of the last 40 years.  What men need, it seems to claim, is ""guy-space"" and ""guy-time,"" male bonding and man-making ritual.  The movie suggests that only after this confidence and swagger is achieved can a man be a fit companion for a woman, meeting her considerable sexual and emotional power with a brand of power all his own.Well acted by Pitt, Norton, and Carter; ably directed with great technical flourish by David Fincher; poetically written by novelist Chuck Palahniuk and screenwriter Jim Uhls, ""Fight Club"" is a biting satire, a malcontented masterpiece that forecasts a redefinition of manhood which is somehow both revolutionary and reactionary.  After Americans are past the long period of political centrism that began in the late 1980s and persists tothis day, look for ""Fight Club"" to be regarded as a crystal ball."	5.0	The Men's Movement on Celluloid	2003-06-02	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	APEE242AK8G8G	Christopher Stenner	There's more to this movie than what is on the surface, which I feel many Hollywood reviewers simply missed, or didn't understand.  On the outside, this movie is full of sex and violence and cussing and all the things we teach our kids to stay away from until they're.. well, at least 40.  Yet, this movie brings to life, on the underside, the trials and tribulations that the 20-something males of this world, and this country in particular, face from day to day.Don't be fooled into believe this is a movie showing Brad Pitt and Edward Norton standing in a ring throwing punches at one another.  Agreed, fighting does have a play in the movie, but the title of the movie doesn't do the movie any justice.Quite simply, I find this to be an absolutely amazing movie and I loved every second of it.  The moment I finished watching the rented VHS I jumped on here and ordered it immediately, and I've never been sorry for doing so.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Based on a book by Chuck Pahlinier(or something, didn't check spelling), Fight Club is basically a movie that has a central plot but also tries to tell the audience a little something about life, a lesson or moral if you will. There are certain moments in the film you may not understand or it's too pretentious but you'll just keep watching, even if you hate the thing.The Narrator(his name is not Jack or Rupert; Jack was from a book of health definitions e.g ""I am Jack's medulla oblongata"" and it isn't Rupert as that was one of his fake names) lives a very meaningless life. He works in a job he hates to buy new sofas and furniture that ""defines him as a person"". He also has a really bad case of insomnia. He finds support groups with a certain theme like cancer groups or any other kind of disease group and people dealing with it. He ends up find a weird peace where he's able to cry and actually even sleep.Until she walks in. Marla is also a ""tourist"" who just goes to the groups for entertainment and free coffee. His life goes back to normal with the insomnia until his condo blows up. Well good thing he met Tyler Durden, a soap maker and worked on film reels splicing porn shots into children's films for only a few frames.  Together they start Fight Club, where men can go and get out their aggression with life by beating the **** out of each other. Only Marla has a relationship with Tyler and the Narrator starts something that he can't stop or control.To be honest, I kind of hate preachers or self help gurus that tell you to take charge of your life and seize the day etc cause most of us don't want to ""take charge"", our lives while difficult at times, are what we make of it and we wouldn't have it any other way. The film almost takes a anarchistic view of things by telling you you're not your job, quit it if you want, meet new people and basically live life. Only thing is our job we hate ends up paying for the roof over our heads, the food in our guts, the clothes we wear and our children's toys and clothes and other assorted stuff. As much as we hate consumerism and the idea that buying more useless stuff is good, part of our lives can't function without it, which the film doesn't address as much.It's also quite interesting looking at Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler. He is capable of doing some good films, he just sometimes picks the wrong ones. In this film he kind of plays that friend you always despised in high school that grew up to be a smartass: he has answers for the questions you never ask and comes off as a know-it-all. He's quite pompous and a bit pretentious but it works. Edward Norton gives also a good performance as almost mouse-like and slightly awkward(I still find it funny that to ""threaten the cops"", he uses the term 'lead salad'.) Helena Bonham Carter(who recently had a child with Batman director Tim Burton FYI) is quite a standout as that weird girl who chain smokes, has weird morbid thoughts and has that bad girl image down.And it's about time David Fincher starting working with effects because they're quite good. They don't overwhelm the story(I'm looking at you George Lucas) but merely enhance it.The film is quite good to watch although half the time you might not make sense of it all or criticize certain things. It's not for everyone, true. I guess if Tyler Durden were to write a review on a film based on changing your life, he'd say ""why watch the film? Just go outside and change your life yourself?"". It sounds nice but most of us will just watch our good movie."	5.0	"You'll probablylove what you see but won't ""get it"""	2005-03-14	3	1	2

It might also attract  you in an appalling and guilty sort of way. The Fight Club illustrates  society's ugliness through the odd behavior of Edward Norton's nameless and  insomniac character and his mysterious friend Tyler (played by Brad Pitt,  of course). The violence in the film is gruesome, there's no doubt about  that. But the film has a way to illustrate the decay of society in a  clearer -- and perhaps more disturbing -- way. I cannot be specific about  the plot -- that would defeat the viewer's purpose and expectations. I  really enjoyed Norton's narration; his voice has irony and darkness, which  is very appropriate for the film. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler is  excellent. I also enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf's supporting  roles. I wish I had read the novel this film is based on. It looks as  though it would have been quite an interesting read. Nevertheless, the film  will shock you into consciousness. But this film isn't for everyone.

What's more is that this dvd is chock full of special features that will take hours to get through.  You must buy this, this warrents the purchase of a dvd player in itself.	5.0	Great Movie	2000-11-12	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3C4OFD6CMRN10	"Colin Nickell ""Movie Guru"""	Edward Norton and Brad Pitt take you by the shirt and hurtle you into a incredible thrill ride that will excite you from your head to toes. Director David Fincher (Seven, Panic Room) streched the rules a little bit farther. Using his incredible cinematrography skills to really bring the film alive, David Fincher also uses very talented actors to make 'Fight Club' a work of art.Although the DVD only has commentary and no other special features, the movie makes it great without it. The 'Two Disc Edition' would probably be a better buy for all of you 'Fight Club' fanatics.Fight Club is about a anxious insomniac who despretely is looking for a release that will help him go to sleep soundly. He finally finds a release within cancer groups. He begins to sleep again, but when his apartment blows up he must seek help in a slippery soap salesman named Tyler Durden. Tyler and Him then build underground boxing clubs called fight club. But when Tyler starts to take fight club a little to far our hero needs to decide which side is he on. Society or Tylers.The film is a graphic depiction of many things, male aggression, clever humor. Clever Humor, is a big thing in this movie. Watch carefully for certain things that are pointed it out, if you don't catch them the first time (which is highly likely) watch it again, and again.	5.0	I am Jack's Incredible DVD	2004-08-09	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2DKL1RI8OA03D	Colmenero	In my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.  Director David Fincher (Se7en) returns with Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter in this dark drama about an insomniac (Norton) who meets an eccentric psychopath (Pitt) who convinces him to give up everything and live for the moment.  Terrific casting, acting, the whole nine yards.  The Blu-Ray includes the hard to find deleted scenes, commentaries from the author, director, screenwriter Pitt, carter and Norton.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A11GJUNWXP7Q5W	cool hand	"Fight Club's main objective is to teach a lesson on human nature. The vehicle used in portraying human nature is the domesticating, materializing, dehumanizing, corporate world of late 20th century America  and one man's violent struggle against it. In Freudian terms, the  protagonist (Norton) is forced by his homogenized corporate &quot;ant  hill&quot; existence to suppress his &quot;id&quot; fueled &quot;ego&quot;  of primal male aggression to the point of dementia. In Norton's(who is also  the narrator) Freudian dementia he creates an alter ego by the name of  Tyler Durden (Pitt). Norton's alter ego allows for his suppressed  aggression to pour out in bare-knuckled and disfiguring confrontations with  other sympathics from all walks of life. The lesson on human nature comes  in the end when Norton awakes from his dementia to realize that what he has  created in retaliation to the effects of corporate America has become just  as inhumane as the cause. This irony leaves the intelligent viewer asking,  &quot;So what is the answer?"" Fight Club retorts that human nature is  confused, imperfect, powerful, self-defeating, overly idealistic, and far  from reaching understanding of itself. If can't handle the reality that his  film offers than you're too comfortable and should try to find your  inner-Durden."	5.0	The only answer Fight Club offers=that of Human Nature	2000-04-19	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AHEKI4FJRH1Q6	Corey	Never have I seen a movie so thought provoking, so intelligent, so dakr, or so funny. How did this movie get made, and by a huge studio like 20th  Century Fox? I have no idea. You're either going to love, or hate it. I  find however that 99.9 percent of the people who hate this movie feel it  was over their heads. It's not the type of flick you can watch, and keep  tracking of while you're flipping between football, or 'Taxi Cab  Confessions' on HBO. It requires your full attention. And it's not going to  spoon feed you all the answers. So take a cue from the film's narrator, and  take responsibility for your decisions, your actions, and your questions. A  movie that can be interpreted on so many different levels, it's chic, it's  stylish, and it has the balls to laugh at things some movies wouldn't even  touch. Testicular Cancer, Terrorism, underground boxing clubs, and  castration are just a few items this movie pokes fun at. A brilliant  satire, with quotable dialogue, fun and interesting characters, and a plot  that'll leave you thinking for days. Simply put, 'Fight Club' is the best  movie I've ever seen.

You know who you are.)I was sadly disappointed.The usually magnificent Edward Norton is wasted here. Helena Bonham Carter shows range in a role that is the antithesis of her earlier career, and also that she can handle an American accent. Brad Pitt is merely a showpiece to spout pseudophilosophies based on freedom through testosterone flow.In fact, the whole movie is like that, and near the end, it completely loses control of itself. The ""discovery"" at the end was not earth-shattering or particularly surprising, given the clues throughout. It seemed to me simply a contrivance, trying to be something that changes your outlook on the film a la Keyser Soze in The Usual Suspects.Unfortunately, by that time, I was already bored.And unlike my friends, I was not impressed by the revelation of ""cigarette burns,"" (spots in the upper right corner of a film that tell the projectionist when to change reels) as I had worked in A/V in college and knew about them already. They spoke of these as if they were some deeply guarded secret instead of a way for a person to do the job more efficiently.Nor was I entertained by the subliminal porn inserted into the children's film. Making a little girl cry is not my idea of humor.That said, the special effects used in the fight sequences were definitely gruesome enough to get the point. And David Fincher, as a director, knows where to put a camera to get the best angle on a scene.But life-changing? Not on your life."	3.0	"""Don't Believe the Hype."""	2002-02-22	21	7	14

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1G4AVFKPF2MW4	"Crimson King ""Futile"""	Now, I think Fight Club is a great movie. I'm all for everyone having their own opinions, but personally I think it's great. Here's my addressal of some of the arguments for why this movie isn't good.People seem to think that the movie is morally degraded by portraying violence as a good thing. Well? Nobody's effectively said why it's bad. It has a very cathartic quality to it, and besides which everyone who participated in violence towards other was willing and chose to. Far be it from anyone to say they can't do what they want, if they're consenting, right? Otherwise I don't see why violence = bad, other than our base instinct which shouldn't decide morality.Terrorism? Do you realize what terrorism is?Terrorismn : the calculated use of violence (or threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in natureNow, as far as I can remember, nobody in the movie dies except for Robert Paulsen. And that was by the police. Everything else was done to empty buildings, causing no harm to any people other than to empty buildings as an attack against consumerism. Hardly terrorism if nobody dies, really.And the most oft-repeated but most puzzling. Fascism? Do you even know what Fascism is, you kids with your high-school History credit trying to seem intellectual? Well. Effective use of the media to control people? If by destroying media you mean effectively using it than... Maybe? The corporatism and laissez-faire economic policies of Fascism are completely opposed by the message in the movie. And the authority portrayed by Project Mayhem is the goal itself, with the leader eventually kidnapped and is held accountable when he questions the project. Nationalism? Not at all. You'd hardly tell that the movie knew what a country was. Racism? Not at all, there were black members prominent.Funny how all these people question the movie as being shallow and repetitive in its message, when most mainstream films/books hardly have any message, let alone question so effectively. And yet these people offer no idea what a good or deep message would be.	5.0	Cliched quote from the movie as title	2006-02-28	10	5	5

I was NOT disappointed.A man finds himself living in a horrible, run-down old  house with a close, eprsonal stranger.  His life is falling apart.  An  insomniac, he's found the perfect support group: Fight Club.  At the heart  of this &quot;support group&quot; is pure smooth-brained violence: fist  fights.The film gets bloody at several points.  This is a side effect of  the plot and could possibly be wholly ignored without consequence.  Ultimately the film is strong social commentary; to wear a tie... or to  return to a primal state.  I can say very little without giving away too  much.  This is a film best seen unprepared, and I can strongly recommend it  to anyone.	5.0	A Love-Hate Relationship	2000-06-26	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2VB13MDBBC62M	"""cwlova"""	Fight Club is about a man, known only as the Narrator, (Edward Norton) who hates his boring life and has to find alternative ways to deal with his misery.  One of the ways he copes is by becoming a tourist, but not in a traditional sense.  This kind of tourist is someone who attends support groups even though he/she doesn't have any disease or affliction.  He goes to support group meetings because he likes the coffee, the folded chairs, the crying, the sharing of feelings.  He likes feeling special for once.  The whole premise of this type of &quot;tourism&quot; has black humor value, but the film's handling of these scenes (especially the deadly unfunny topic of cancer) is more dumb than funny or really black for that matter.While at a support group, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist.  She looks like a heroin addict, wears the blackest make up one can wear without looking Goth, and dresses in clothes that were &quot;once owned by the victim of a sex crime.&quot;  Marla hates life like the Narrator, but copes with it by becoming suicidal and self- destructive, unlike the Narrator who becomes violent- a pretty clear statement about male and female aggression.  While women take it out on themselves, men take it out on each other.  But that's pretty much all one can say to describe Marla.  She has no ambition, no motivation, and she doesn't really do anything.  Marla is truly a nothing character, despite Helena Bonham Carter's fascinating performance.  Her purpose is solely to gratuitously have sex and round out the edges of the plot.After his apartment mysteriously burns down, the Narrator decides to call a soap salesman he met on a plane named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He finds that Tyler is everything that he wants to be but can't.  Tyler is muscular and good looking in a rugged way as opposed to Edward Norton's sniveling dweeb.  Tyler works at his own pace; the Narrator sees himself as a white-collar slave.  Tyler lives in a dilapidated house, an utter contrast to the Narrator's former IKEA shrine.  Tyler is everything anti-consumerism, anti- greed, anti-conformity.  After their first meeting, Tyler says something to the Narrator thatsurprises him.  &quot;Hit me&quot; he says.  The two then get into a fight, find the experience exhilarating, and start a literal &quot;fight club&quot; in the basement of Tyler's dilapidated house.  Soon, scores of men across the unnamed city they live in start showing up to beat each other up.The basic message I got from this film is that when men feel they aren't allowed to work out their aggressions, they become violent and insane.  The target in this film is consumerism and conformity in the work place, which threaten a man's masculinity.  Consumerism, according to Tyler, is the artificial hunter-gatherer sense of worth, and thus picks apart the biological foundation which gives worth to the male mind.  To compensate for this confusion and subsequent loss of masculinity, these men need to beat each other up and get beaten up to feel the rugged pain that they've been denied their lives.A question I found myself repeatedly asking was, could someone actually &quot;enjoy&quot; breaking their nose, punching their teeth out, and getting stitches?  The purpose is to show the EXTREMES of male frustration, but it would have been better had David Fincher had actually made the violence glamorous.  As it stands, the violence is graphic enough to be unwatchable, but also too unrealistic to take seriously (no one can kick and punch someone in the jaw repeatedly without breaking it in some way).  Or maybe, just maybe, Fincher didn't have to show the violence at all.  How brilliant would a movie with the main theme of violence be if it didn't have a lot of actual violence in it?  Also if violence and mayhem is a common goal among men, how come most war veterans find themselves in trauma and shock at the evils of their own violence?  And why don't these men enroll inthe army if they enjoy pointless violence so much?  Though any movie that generates heavy discussion, is, by default, interesting, most of the questions Fight Club conjures are provoked about the basis of why the movie was made to explore these themes, not about the actual content itself.  Thus it doesn't constitute as sufficient ambiguity.Finally, the twist ending.  Although surprising and cool, not that much of interest happens before then.  However, the twist is so cool in fact, that I was almost tempted to forget how much I didn't enjoy the movie up to that point.  Consider it a great ending to a sorely misguided movie.	4.0	Highly flawed	2001-12-16	9	5	4

The camera work was innovative, and the story centers around a nameless narrator (Ed Norton) who has trouble sleeping and is generally wallowing in  a mindless, pointless consumerist existence. He tries group therapy, which  helps for awhile, until he runs into Tyler (Brad Pitt), and with him,  discovers that beating up and being beaten up restores meaning to his life.  It snowballs from there. I don't want to spoil anything.The screenwriter  may have cobbled together some of Hakim Bey's works on &quot;Poetic  Terrorism&quot; and &quot;Ontological Anarchism&quot; for this one, coupled  with either fascist and/or Bolshevik organizational methods (Fight Club  itself, and the later Operation: Mayhem). Maybe a fusion of them all,  coupled with some conspiracy theory touches here and there.There are a  lot of fun effects throughout this movie, and Brad Pitt and Ed Norton do a  great job, as does Helena Bonham Carter. The comments on the consumer  culture are the most valuable in this one, and it's clear who the writer  thinks the real enemy is - it's not so much about men rediscovering lost  libidos as it is attacking corporate America itself. After the riots in  Seattle and elsewhere, it seems oddly prescient.It's a long movie (139  minutes), so bring plenty of popcorn. I don't know if the message of the  movie will stay with you long after watching it, but for a Hollywood flick,  it's not bad.	4.0	Punchy	2000-05-06	2	0	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	This is proabably close to my favorite film I've ever seen.  It's just spendidly done and very well crafted, you just lose yourself in the film from open to close.  It also gets credit for being one of the only films (next to 'mystic river') that follows the novel so well.  I hate watching films that distract from the message of the novel by changing the story line so drastically they should have given it a different name ('Less Than Zero' was one of the worst).  I have to say that if you've never read the novel, you should read it ASAP.  I find that you can find more morality or at least more of a morale to the story when reading printed page versus watching the screen since we tend to get so wrapped up in the glitter and gloss (not much glitter in this film) that we get distracted from the real reason the story was written.  Our story revolves around a nameless narator (played BRILLIANTLY by Norton, another slam dunk for him here), an insomniac who, in order to find peace of mind, spends his time bounceing from group therapy meetings, sharing his fake stories and crying, he does a lot of crying, and all that release makes him, well, sleep...all until he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is oddly stunning in this film, mixing well her 'come-hither' good looks with her 'go-away' attitude...she is repulsivly-beautiful if that is possible.  You see Marla, dispite her charm (if you call it that) is just another roadblock in our narators road to peace.  You see, knowing that there is another 'poser' in the same sessions as him, he just can't cry with her watching him and so he can't get that release and without that release he can't sleep and so our narator ends up back where he started...all until he meets Tyler (Pitt, who by the way does AMAZING here...I have to say that although I am always ragging on his 'lack of acting ability' to my wife, referring to him as a B-Grade actor, I still have to admit that he has talant, I just feel that he, like Leo alike, are widely overlooked because of their 'pretty-boy' stereotypes)...anyways...Tyler opens a door for our narator to release the stress that robs him of inner peace, and when his apartment is torched to the ground he has no where to go but to Tyler.  Everything is fine and dandy until Marla rears her attractive head and soon all hell brakes loose in a rollercoaster of a film that will leave you dazzled.  The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club.  The second rule of Fiht Club is you don't talk about Fight Club...The third and most important rule is that you MUST WATCH Fight Club to understand the NEED for Fight Club...EXCELENT MOVIE	5.0	The most amazing CULT film of our time	2005-08-23	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3EN783XSQ7SAZ	"Dana Hurleigh ""femvamp001"""	Ok for all you who didn't like this movie.  I completly understand why.  Its the kind of movie that plays with your head and makes you think and makes you feel.  The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite get it.  I liked it, but I didn't get it.  The second time I began to see the subtle intericusies and ironic twists about the movie that I missed the first time around.I've seen this move about a dozen times, (every time it comes on tv.)  its a clever movie that has reached cult level status and it deserves it to.  But be warned.  THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.  Its violent.  Its antagonistic.  And it is down right political in an anarchist sort of way.But if you give it half a chance and watch carefully, you will watch a good movie that makes you think about where America is heading.	4.0	Not everyone will understand this movie	2005-03-21	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ISOGXDWC99G6	Dana Keish	I didn't see this movie at the theatre because of the way it was being marketed...which appeared to me as nothing more than a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other!Once I finally saw the movie, I realized that  this doesn't even begin to explain the plot.  A truly terrific movie with  enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Edward Norton does a  wonderful job of portaying a &quot;lost soul&quot; out of place in today's  society.  Brad Pitt is wonderful in a performance that could have been so  easily over the top.This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a  long time.  It gets away from your standard cliched movies which seem to  simply rehash plots older than movies themselves (for example...Gone in 60  Seconds...I don't think this movie had one original line or thought).  Even  if you think you know what Fight Club is about, you don't.  I think the  studios did a poor job marketing this film.  It should appeal to anyone who  truly enjoys something different.	5.0	Not Just for the Guys	2000-06-19	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3OB5LC44PB2G5	DaN	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. it is very high on &quot;the list.&quot;  Acting: Superb. I haven't seen this type of acting by two young people, that people don't like because they thing they're cocky, in all my life. Brad Pitt gives such a convincing performance as the do-anything leader of Fight Club, and Edward norton's character. Now Edward Norton, man, can you picture a better insomniac than him? I thought not. The acting is down right convincing and is helped by the unbelievable screenplay.Plot: An insomniac is fed up with life and doesn't know how to live it. He try's social groups but they make it worse. Then he meets Tyler Durden and the fun begins to rip into your chest like you've never experienced. THey stard Fight Club, a way to get the pressures of life off your back. Then they take it a step further and, well, I shouldn't say more because of the ending. The ending will blow away your mind! It will not make sense at first but then you can see it.With all this said, when I first saw this movie I was a little dissapointed. It was not what I expected. Then I saw it a second time and I was motionless. The hidden secrets in this movie are what caught me in. They are the reason that this movie is beyond your minds capacity. If you think you missed out on something, you did. So just watch it again and you will find it. It has so many interesting and provocative points on life, women, men, society, leaders, brothers, government, movies, homosexuality (this might take some time to figure out), heterosexuality, puberty in your 30's, and the list is endless. If you thought that those are some odd points, wait till you see the movie.This film is dark and always in your face. It doesn't escape from you. it is almost as if you become Edward Norton's character. You begin to feel him and feel his emotions. A note to everyone: Go see this movie with an open mind. Then you will allow yourself to see the modern classic titles Fight Club.I have always been pulled in by dark, controversial, disturbing, funny, and odd images. This movie has all of that in one. One may disagree with me on all of this becuase they missed the message that it was giving out. I can't say the message becuase it will give away the story. Another point is that this plot has so many stories hidden within the obvious that you will HAVE to see it again.You should love this movie's forceful views on society. It shows this through hidden views. Ancient Greek Mythology must be read with the concept that one thing means another and that one thing is hiding behind another. This is what Fight Club is. It is a hidden masterpiece that will never cease to entertain the viewer.	5.0	One of the Most originally hidden Movies	2000-09-30	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2	"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru"""	I have heard many people calling this a great movie, and several people calling it a terrible move.  My own opinion:  It is an overlong movie.  There is about 20 minutes, where the fascist movement is growing where I  got up, &amp; without hitting pause on the video, nuked a bag of popcorn.  I figure the director put those twenty minutes in there for that  purpose--to encourage popcorn sales.  That seems horrible to say in a movie  that sings the praises of anarchy, but it is quite possibly the truth.  Otherwise Mr. Fincher could have used his talent as a music video director  to create a funny montage sequence in place of that moment of cinematic  redundancy. I asked my roommate if I had missed anything &amp; she told me  &quot;absolutely nothing.&quot;  What we have in this movie is another  variation on Quentin Tarantino's style.  Not a bad one.  There have  certainly been worse.  But variations on this theme have been done before  to greater effect in A Clockwork Orange and I felt stronger shock in the  finale of the also similarly themed Brazil.  Now the question for me  remains.  Do I buy a DVD which promises unsurpassed extras for a movie that  I found mediocre &amp; a little dull?  Will the extras make an average  movie worth including in my personal library?  Probably not.	3.0	Tarantino Chic	2000-05-30	20	3	17

Well,  &quot;fc&quot; is as good, you bet! It's hilariously funny and thought  provoking. The acting is great and the direction is fantastic. Fincher kept  it close to the novel by Chuck Palahniuk which I do also highly recommend.  All in all it's one of the best films I have ever seen.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1M9ZB9B6N5VHY	Daniel Hirshleifer	Fight Club is one of my favorite films, and certainly one of the best films of 1999. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD, and soaked in every nuance of it. But it's pointless for me to sing its praises, for people either like it or they don't. Whether or not I like it won't change their mind. However, I felt compelled to write this review because of  another review I read by flickjunkie. Reactionary reviews like that remind  me that there is one aspect about this film that seems to overshadow  everything else about it: it's misunderstood. Most people think one of two  things about Fight Club. 1) It's a brawl film, a guy's movie, something  that a bunch of brainless lugs would like. And, 2) It's a fascist film that  wants everyone to destroy civilization as we know it. The truth: it is  neither. The film is a warning. It's saying that we're being numbed by  society. That in itself is dangerous, and true. However, the true warning  is not about how we are being numbed. The warning is about how some people  are drawn to incresingly violent solutions to their numbness. It's a  warning that fascism is actually very seductive when you are young, yet  becoming mature is seeing that more constructive, and less destructive  methods are what is necessary to move society forward into a more  meaningful place. This movie is condeming everything that the critics are  saying it is preaching. I really wish that people would take the time to  really understand a film before they react violently against it. And  remember, use soap.	5.0	Brilliant, often misunderstood, film	2000-06-19	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3GRANSGMYPX00	"Danielle Kuehnel ""A Trendy Twentysomething"""	I had been avoiding this film for ages, for reasons unknown to myself, or those who had recommended it. All of a sudden, quite recently, 'Fight Club' became rather annoyingly ubiquitous, by chance, and I saw the film everywhere, and everyone was all of a sudden telling me how I needed to see it.I finally saw it, and I am so very glad that I did.I can't give away too much for those who haven't had the pleasure, but it's the story of the sprouting of an underground terrorist group, in the form of secret meetings of 'Fight Clubs' around the country. The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight CLub is to not talk about Fight Club... But when more and more people become acquainted with the group, Norton's 'unnamed' character becomes more and more suspicious of 'friend' Tyler.The Fight Clubs intensify, and eventually evolve into soap selling, explosive creating, doers of mayhem working together to defeat capitalism and the unnecessaries of life. Ironically, their common quest for difference drives the army to becoming more and more the same.The film's ending was unquestioningly impressive. Although one could argue it's cliche-ness, I found it rather inobtrusive, and unpredictable, giving the film very satisfying closure.Overall, I found the performances by Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter to be incredibly sublime, and the cinematography to have a real gritty feel to it. 'Fight Club' is unquestionably a five-star film in my book!	5.0	So much better than I anticipated	2004-09-27	2	2	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ	"Daniel S. ""Daniel"""	One of the most often repeated critiques made about director David Fincher's FIGHT CLUB is that the movie presents the apology of the violence  and, among other ideas, defends the theory that today general aggressivity  can only be controlled by letting people expressing verbally and physically  this violence. In a way, we could become a new generation of Romans  watching without guilt hyper-brutal movies in the same way than the ancient  Romans were applauding the gladiators. Well, I admit that maybe some  limited persons can feel an intense pleasure while watching the fights of  FIGHT CLUB and what ? If only these scenes could prevent real incidents by  offering to some of us the possibility to let our adrenaline flow freely,  why not !But FIGHT CLUB deserves a lot more than sterile discussions  about this peculiar aspect of the movie. Firstly, director David FINCHER,  along with his art director, has created a unique artistic vision of Edward  Norton's sick point of view. From the beginning of the movie, the story is  told from Norton's point of view which slowly deforms the reality and  presents to the audience a world filled with the obsessions of the  insomniac employee. Fincher, with a few arty effects and very good  monologs, is able to create very quickly uneasiness and tension.With the  apparition of Brad Pitt, the movie, little by little, gives up his critical  and social dimension and becomes the repertoire of our most hidden fears or  desires. When the Fight Club is replaced by the Mayhem Project, you are  thrown into the world that director Don Siegel had so well described in  INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, a world where paranoia is the only  rule.A DVD for your library.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A10BN1MS4KAK8C	"Danny J. ""BillyJoelNtrDame"""	Fight Club is one of the most beloved movies of all time.  As of the writing of this, it currently sits at #23 on IMDb's fan-voted greatest movies list.  Its Keyser Soze ending is even more famous than than the actual Keyser Soze ending. (If that last sentence means nothing to you, consider yourself priviliged to still have such a great cinematic discovery in front of you, and go rent The Usual Suspects).I do not contest that Fight Club is great.  It's unflinching in its portrayal of inner chaos manifested as brutal violence.  It weaves a tapestry of cinema that simultaneously constructs two realities.  It's a movie truly deserving of second viewing just so you can observe how intricately constructed the film is, particularly in ways you might not have noticed the full way through.And yet, I walk away from a second viewing a little underwhelmed and with a few questions.Why did it have to be so violent?  Shock value does not make for good repeated viewings.  That's why There's Something About Mary is one of the best comedies of all time only the first time you see it, but not so much after that.  Perhaps the violence has some thought behind it and is there for thematic purposes?  I can see how an argument would be made that the physical violence is a carefully constructed metaphor to the inner violence that takes place within Edward Norton's character.But the movie is so gruesome that it's sometimes unpleasant to watch.  I've made it through some supposedly hard-to-stomach scenes like the opening of Saving Private Ryan with nary a flinch, but I had to close my eyes or leave the room for a few scenes watching Fight Club again.And the argument that the violence is symbolic doesn't sway me much, either, for a couple of reasons.  First, even if some element of a movie serves a higher thematic purpose, it shouldn't be painful to watch.  The scene when Edward Norton repeatedly smashes in that one guy's face could as well be Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, and I still wouldn't think too much of it.  I don't want to see bloody, fractured remnants of a face no matter what.Next, I've decided that Fight Club does not work too well as a movie with any moral or underlying purpose.  It's pure plot-driven entertainment.  As a thoughtful movie, it is a poseur, continually touching on philosophical issues without delving too deep.  Just as it starts to get close to being penetrative and insightful, it takes a left turn and beats in a dozen different thoughts that contribute little, until all that's left is a mere bloody pulp of a thoughtful movie.Every time I tried to get more out of the movie than just white-knuckle action and clever plot twists, I came away disappointed.  But nearly every time I allowed myself to just get absorbed into the masterful stylistic experience, I had a blast.  To credit the careful construction of the movie as anything less than masterful would be an unfair insult to it.  Hollow though it is, Fight Club is still a great movie.	4.0	Brutal... but sort of hollow	2008-07-08	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3PF2NF7LX3CAB	"Dan Seitz ""cinnatusc"""	If you love the film, fine, I'm glad for you.  I happen to have read the book and think the film A) doesn't understand the book's point and B) has a rebellious posture but never does anything remotely rebellious.  I know this film has a lot of vociferious defenders, but, frankly, I could care less.  This movie is one of the worst literary adaptations on the planet.Let's start with the actual book itself.  What you have to understand is that the book, despite being only 200 pages, is extremely elaborate; everything, literally everything, any character says or does ties back to something else as you progress.  So if you're adapting the story, you can't just drop parts of the novel and shove new things in.  It won't work.  Which is exactly what David Fincher and Jim Uhls do.Fincher and Uhls just didn't understand the book.  While Fincher goes off on his usual &quot;lookit me, I'm an auteur because I make everything grimy and dark&quot; kick, Uhls, a first-time screenwriter, adapts things to Fincher's over-the-top, idiotic sensibility.  What really bugs me was the COMPLETE rejection of Palahniuk's use of duality; he mocks both materialism and a rejection of materialism so complete you reject yourself in the novel.  Here, Fincher endorses the latter as a good thing.Here's what REALLY gets me; Fincher obviously thinks he's pushing the envelope here, but not once, NOT ONCE, are we confronted with anything we haven't seen before.  He never does more than poke at the surface of disgusting and/or bizarre and says  &quot;See, I'm a rebel!&quot;  He completely lacks the courage to include some of the more intense scenes in the book, instead replacing them with cheap laughs at easy targets.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1NQF8UIYTYTG7	Dark Trippers	Fincher's Fight Club opens in a mysterious semi-darkness, both comforting and disquieting, autistic and boundless, vaguely familiar. But it is only when we are expelled from this strangely biomorphic womb-like place we realise that we have been within the deep recesses of our protagonist's  mind. In a shaky pullback we emerge from Jack's mouth that has the barrel  of a gun jammed inside it.Jack is a loner, a man going nowhere fast, an  angst-ridden emasculated wage-slave with terrible insomnia. He seeks  solace, rather bizarrely, in victim support groups, feeding off the misery  of others Sleep comes to him at last and he becomes addicted to the  self-help ethos. That is, until he is exposed by another fake attendee,  Marla. Without the group empathy and misery-fix to soothe his troubles,  Jack hurtles deeper into depression, culminating in his apartment  exploding. In his deep dark night of the soul he turns to Tyler  Durden.Tyler Durden is the embodiment of pure id: an existential  nihilist, a sociopath with terrorist inclinations, inhabiting a dilapidated  decaying brownstone on the edge of existence. He scavenges human fat from  liposuction clinics to make into soap to sell back to the rich ladies it  came from; urinates in the soup of the restaurant in which he works; and,  moonlighting as a projectionist, he splices single frames of pornography  into family movies. The disruption of the social ethic is his prime  motivation.When the two men get into a fight, Jack is amazed how  exhilarated he is by the raw, unfettered violence. Consequently, the Fight  Club is formed, a secret society of like-minded males prepared to go  one-on-one with bare-knuckles. But, &quot;the first rule of Fight Club is  that you don't talk about Fight Club&quot;, and with the movie it's true  too: here I depart from plot details. But let me say this: Fight Club is  not a fighting picture (Van Damme fans be warned) and it is as far removed  from the escapist blockbuster that people expected as it is possible to get  (hence its box office failure). But, quite simply, Fight Club is, without  doubt, one of the most subversive pieces of cinema, ever. And. With a  denouement twist that is, unlike The Sixth Sense, impossible to  guess.Based on a controversial novel by Chuck Palanhiuk, Fight Club is a  relentlessly dark, tortuous journey of one man's self-discovery. Hoisted up  to greatness by Fincher's incredible vision and by career best performances  from both Norton and Pitt, it is one of those rare films that is quite  unlike anything that has preceded it. It is intelligent, funny,  ultra-violent, touching, repulsive, in equal measures: and, an  excruciatingly accurate study of maleness and virility to boot (which,  critics take heed, doesn't automatically make the film misogynist [in the  same way the human soap factor doesn't make it anti-Semitic]).Throw  aside your expectations, Fight Club is a modern masterpiece of the dark  fantastic.	5.0	Who is Tyler Durden?	2000-05-29	49	40	9
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AK7M0OGWW8ZDP	daryl vasquez	First off, let me just say for the record that I can understand why some people would not like this movie. I can't relate to this but I can understand it. This film presents very frightning ideas to the American  culture. And that idea is freedom in its purist form. Don't buy into all  these little groups harping on the violence (only one person dies in fight  club, how many people died in Dogma? I never heard anyone complain about  that) or that this is a male movie about how men have been broken down by  women blah, blah, blah....Because the film has male charecters as its  central focus it predictably falls under the blade of the feminst groups.  Yet if this had starred female charecters (remember the flack Thelma &amp;  Louise got?) then the reaction would have been the reverse. This film is  not about male/female but us as a whole and what we have allowed ourselves  to become. Shallow consumers who buy things we don't need and occupy  ourselves with useless issues. Think of all the amasing things we could  achinve if we re-focused our energy away from shopping at the Gap and  conentrated on say, health care issue, or cancer research. This presents  another dilema in our culture where we glom issues on one or the other  instead of on us as a collective. Americans have become a society where we  work to buy. To make ourselves feel better and more justified for working  hours in jobs that we hate or just go through the motions of, we spend that  hard earned $ and fill the holes in our lives with useless junk as proof  that we exist. Not so much to impress others but to impress ourselves. The  hollow numb moments are easier to deal with if we own a nice expensive car  to look at. Get over it. The car you just spent $50K on is still going in  the same direction as the $5k car. To work, to 7-11 and back home. The  expensive italian leather couch your setting on? Well, you're just setting  on it like any other Lazy-boy and watching the same mindless TV. We are not  what we own. Like American Beauty, this film puts the viewer under the  magnifying glass and turns the discomfort onto us through the charecters.  We have all felt and thought the same things these people have. But the  difference, and this is the real frightning aspect, is that in reality we  are too afraid to change. It's sad that only fictional charecters can be  brave enough to trancend. Change hurts. Change is fear and unkown. We have  no great wars in our generation. We have no great depression. Our war is  with ourselves......our great depression is our lives.....	5.0	but 5 stars is not enough....and why?	2000-01-06	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A398702URXQX1N	Dave Dixon	Although the actual &quot;fight club&quot; itself is a kick start to the premise of the film, it is not the basis of Fincher's finest as many people have misinterpreted. So for the people who haven't seen it on this basis,  this is what it is really about: The fighting that I believe it refers to  is the fight against corperate and social control. It is a story that  provides a way to combat the people that provide the comforts that we don't  need. The fact that it is told through the eyes of a mentally unstable  character is almost irrelevant although it is an integral part of the tale.  As the un-named Norton slowly turns into what can be be described as a  &quot;freedom fighter&quot; along with the psychotic Tyler Durden, we  relate to - and understand - all the acts of vandalism they carry out.  Suberbly shot, edited and performed, this is a text that film students will  be studying in the near future as I'm sure it will eventually achieve  classic status.	5.0	It is, infact, nothing to do with underground boxing	2000-05-04	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	"An anonymous worker in an automobile company (Edward Norton), thoroughly stricken by ennui over his faceless consumer identity, rebels against society when he falls under the influence of the charismatic and subversive Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Soon, the two are forming ""fight clubs,"" where men beat each other senseless, and spearheading an anarchistic guerilla group.This film has a great first act and shows signs of becoming a first-rate indictment of our commercial culture (never mind the irony that it comes in the form of a big Hollywood movie).  Unfortunately, it derails about the time that Tyler Durden comes on stage.  From this point, it becomes progressively sillier, and what strikes many appreciative viewers as a primal cry of rage against conformity seems to me more like a temper tantrum with powerful explosives.  It fails to deliver a coherent message, but the high caliber of the cast and the skill of director David Fincher keep things watchable."	3.0	Don't sign me up for the fan club	2008-10-25	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	David Fincher definitely has guts. Not since 'Death Wish' have I seen a movie that celebrates it's brutality so much. But no matter. What 'Fight Club' lacks in compassion it more then makes up for in humor and style. Fincher's direction is near-perfect, shadowy and smooth-flowing camera work highlights every scene. It is a film director's dream come true. The story is a bit strange, to say the least. It's the story of two men: Edward Norton, an insomniac so disillusioned and removed from life that he has to attend support-group meeting in order to feel anything at all. And Brad Pitt, a seemingly unhinged, yet extremely charismatic soap salesman with ego and machismo to burn. The two men meet after Norton's highrise apartment... uh... explodes. They are perfect counterparts, one out of touch with his own manhood, the other a man who wallows in it. They start up an underground boxing club called 'fight club' where men come and beat each other up, apparently to release their frustration and get back in touch with what makes them men in the first place (which I guess is brutality or stupidity, I can't decide which). Everything is going fine until a woman named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, sexy and snake-like) makes her way into their lives, sparking a bizarre chain of events that leads to terrorism and chaos. The story, from a book by Chuck Palahniuk, is twisted and convoluted, never really making sense until the end where we receive a final plot twist that is so pointless it's revolutionary. But the fine points of the plot never really matter. The only thing that matters is what we're watching on the screen before us at the time. Like a train wreck, the film is dark and repulsive, but we can't turn our eyes away. The bloody fist-fights come to startlingly vivid life on DVD, each thud of a fist hitting skin rockets through us. We squirm and we shudder, but we're fascinated. The movie might not be full of meaning but it is nonetheless remarkable. The performances are all top-notch, especially Meat Loaf in a supporting role as Bob who, due to treatments for testicular cancer, has grown rather large breasts.  The twisted sense of humor of writer Jim Uhls and the fluid, breathtaking direction of David Fincher makes this film more like a rollercoaster then an endurence test. You're retching but laughing all the while. The DVD is AMAZING!!! Four commentary tracks from the cast and director, dozens of behind-the-scenes featurettes, trailers, photo galleries, deleted scene... literally days worth of extras are packed onto the two discs.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AZM09BO1FD418	David G. Stokes	I don't know whether it was the great directing or the psycologically twisted tale that made this such a cool movie. One way or another, this is a bloody-good show. The main character, Tyler Durden (Ed Norton/Brad Pitt) is a deeply disturbed individual suffering from; insomnia, ego states, and schizophrenia. The plot/story line shifts several times throughout this movie, keeping it interesting. There are a lot of cool lines and funny situations (eg. the liposuction clinic). The book was good, the movie was better. I had to watch the movie 'Panic Room' the other day, since it was also directed by David Fincher. Panic Room was okay--Fight Club was phenomenol. ... I'm going to have to find out what other movies Fincher has directed. All of Chuck Palahniuks books are like this--but different. It would be great if more of them were made into movies. This movie is filled with adult situations and not meant for children. This is also one of those movies you can't get out of your head. One of my favorite movies, I've seen it a hundred times.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15KSLJGRG03ME	David  Margis	1999 was the best year for movies in a long time.  We had 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', 'Being John Malkovich', and the best of them all, 'Fight Club'.  'Fight Club' is 'Rebel Without a Cause' for the 90s.  It's a warning, as 'Rebel' was, about the coming dangers in our increasingly mass-produced, commercial society.  It's brutal, hard, violent, and excrutiatingly enjoyable to watch.  Norton and Pitt make a great team, bouncing dialogue off each other as the situation progresses from depressing to outright absurd and dangerous.  The cinematography is dark and moody with odd flashes of neon creating a mood that still has gone from my mind.  The sets, subtle computer animation, and brilliant editing combine to create a masterfully produced picture.Unfortunately, it appears as though a majority of the public will not get the inherent warning.  Some will view it as a cool tribute to violence, and others as a vulgar celebration of male aggression.  Either way, it has gotten notice.The DVD includes some rather interesting extras.  I especially enjoyed the special effects documentaries.And another thing, as fitting to the great movies of 99, 'Fight Club' has an ending that is so bizarre, so random, that I found it wholely inspiring as well as unnerving.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2KG8WLR1AKO12	"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator"""	The late director, Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; is a better movie than &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  This fact,  though, should not deter one from viewing this film that includes the  incredibly talented actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.  These two  artistic masters alone mandate that a serious person take a chance on this  challenging and very disturbing story.Francis Fukuyama's book &quot;The  End of History&quot; came to mind while viewing this dark satirical film.  Fukuyama argued a few years ago that perhaps our society will evolve to the  point where we have essentially accomplished all that can be hoped for in  satisfying our essential needs.  This satiation of all our everyday basic  wants and desires could leave us bored and existentially empty. Do homo  sapien males especially have an innate urge to risk their lives?  What if  there are no wars to be legitimately fought?  Is it possible that the male  gender will always feel an incumbent need to seek an alternative option to  express the violent side of their nature?  Edward Norton portrays a white  collar yuppie about 30 who doesn't have much of a life.  He buys  unnecessary consumer goods merely to give himself something to do and add  to his sense of security. Norton's character earns a living cynically  investigating when it might be better for his employer to pay off on an  individual accident claim instead of ordering a far more expensive  automobile recall.  I usually dislike movies with a strong anti-Capitalist  message.  This is the economic system which has greatly improved the lives  of many throughout the world.  Nonetheless, I put aside this rational  prejudice to see if the director, David Fincher, could offer some insights  into the mind set of those self absorbed males inclined towards violence  merely to alleviate the boredom of their meaningless lives.  My investment  in Fincher was amply rewarded.The Italian Fascist, Benito Mussolini, had  a deep intense hatred for logical thinking and the values of democratic  civilization.  Mussolini argued that violence for its own sake has  redeeming and cathartic value.  True manliness demanded a cold indifference  towards human suffering and a callous disregard for the rights of others  outside one's immediate social group.  &quot;Fight Club&quot; never  directly refers to Mussolini, but Fincher's vision provides us with a  window into the soul's of those attracted to a lifestyle rightfully  perceived as commonly alien and disgusting.  Fincher refuses to romanticize  the converts to the &quot;Fight Club&quot; therapeutic culture. We do not  in anyway envy or wish to emulate these sick and pathetic creatures.  On  the contrary, we are left at the end of the film hoping that such angry and  frustrated males exist primarily only in fiction.  Alas, unfortunately  &quot;Fight Club&quot; mirrors at least a bit of what occasionally occurs  in the real world.  I strongly urge the reader to immediately obtain the  1990 non-fiction book, &quot;Among the Thugs: The Experience, and The  Seduction, of Crowd Violence&quot; by English writer, Bill Buford.  This  superb study of British hooligans who relish beating up innocent people at  soccer games complements &quot;Fight Club.&quot; Buford's book deals with  males who embrace the &quot;Fight Club&quot; morality as their very own.  We can only pray that this film does not prove to be prophetic for the  increasingly affluent and &quot;End of History&quot; American society  beginning the 21st Century.	4.0	&quot;Fight Club&quot; and Francis Fukuyama's &quot;End of History&quot;	2000-09-03	77	40	37

I missed this when it first came out largely due to the panning of critics. Shame on me. I saw it on cable about halfway through so all the surprises weren't so surprising. Finally I rented it and saw it all...twice. I disagree that the Fight Club turns into a facist group as they don't really have a political ideology worked out. If anything they're more Nihilistic than anything, particulary anarchist.They're are some wonderful ideas in the film, ie, when Pitt tells Norton that soap was created by the ashes of heroes. There's more but that's all I'll say on that.The real lesson of this film is the dangers of young men without positive male role models in their lives growing up in a consumer culture - Yes, you need fathers! The film argues that manhood is learned and not intrinsic and that without these role models, young men will follow anybody who seems to know what they are talking about. The danger is that they may follow the wrong person. This we already know ie Gangs, Army. It's just well presented here.On another note, I'm currently reading the book. It's equally great. The lack of description only adds to it. I also got the soundtrack. It's great.Fight Club is destined to become a cult classic like Taxi Driver. Ask about, you'll find it doesn't take long for a group of guys to start talking about fight club, thereby breaking the first two rules.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1AEDW75371P5M	Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com)	This DVD package is not to be missed.  Besides the tremendous &quot;Fight Club&quot; feature presented in all its glorious widescreen perfection (this movie really suffers artistically when cut to the small screen) and pristine CD quality stereo sound (the sound is so important to the effectiveness of the film that this is also a must), you get almost more extras than you know what to do with.  First, the commentary tracks are superb and offer insights into many aspects of the film ranging from its meaning to its construction.  The commentary with David Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter is especially enjoyable and makes you feel as if you are in the room watching with them.  At some points it feels as if Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue is injected which leads me to believe that her comments were recorded seperately and that detracts from the comradarie a little bit, but it is still well worth listening to.  The track with David Fincher is very interesting as well especially if you consider, as I do, this man to be among the best directors working today.  He goes into detail about the trials of converting his vision into reality and it is a wonderful insight into the craft of filmaking.  The track with Chuck Palahnuik is very good as well, he seems just tickled to see the movie and is delighted with how well his concept came across on the big screen.  He gives background, through interesting anecdotes, as to where his ideas came from and these stories themselves sound as if they would make a great movie.  Other features include deleted scenes that are well worth looking at, a short documentary about the making of the movie, conceptual stills, storyboards, location scouting, all with multiple commentaries.  This package has everything you could ever want, do not hesitate to get it.	5.0	An Excellent DVD for an Excellent Movie	2001-06-21	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A35RLO0D7DWL50	"""demonofthefall55"""	"From birth, we're always told that violence is wrong and fighting is not the way to solve problems. This film is one that examines violence not as a means of solving problems, but as a means of verifying your own existence. This movie dares to portray violence not as a completely horrible and ugly part of life, but as something that in some strange way has a sort of purity to it. Not that this movie says it's a good idea to go out and punch someone in the face, but it definitely does challenge you to think about a few things.The film's story follows Jack (not his real name, but see the movie and you'll understand), an empty materialist insomniac who feels very depressed by his life in general. He works for an auto insurance company and spends most of his time and money building the perfect 21st century apartment, complete with all the essentials; IKEA furniture, a home exer-bike, a personal home office unit, and plates with little bubbles inside them, not to mention a wardrobe that was ""almost complete and getting very respectable"". Jack is a typical slave to the consumer culture of America and is a generally soulless and shallow individual with nothing real to live for. He finds some slight satisfaction through attennding meetings for people with diseases, such as tuberculosis, blood and brain parasites, and testicular cancer. Jack finds that going to these meetings allows him to cry, giving him an emotional release for all of his sadness, rage, self loathing, desperation, and whatever other feelings lurk deep inside him; the feelings that he can't purge by ordering furniture. These support groups become his new life, and for a time he finds happiness with them. That is, until another ""faker"", Marla Singer, starts going to Jack's beloved support groups as well. Jack finds that when there's anoter faker present, he is unable to cry, and he is thus robbed of his salvation. Admist all this, things just get worse for Jack as his apartment fills with gas while he is away on business and explodes.After getting over the initial shock of having all his property ripped from him, Jack decides to call Tyler Durden, a man who he had met only several hours before, and who was for a short time Jack's ""single serve friend"". Tyler agrees to meet Jack for a drink, and the 2 of them engage in the first of many philosophical discussions throuoghout the movie, the basis of this one being whether or not Jack is better off without the apartment. After leaving the bar, Jack asks if he can stay with Tyler. Tyler agrees, but with one condition; he wants to fight Jack. Jack is stunned by this request, but agrees and proceeds to punch Tyler directly in the ear. The 2 continue fighting, and eventually involve others who gather around them. Jack finds the same release he found through crying by fighting, and is very taken by his new found interest. This is the beginning of Fight Club, an organization for men wishing to regain their masculinity by beating each other senseless.Speaking from a strictly cinematic standpoint, this is a truly remarkable film. The directing, the writing, and the acting are all top notch. Norton is absolutely incredible as Jack and shows that he will most likely go on to be remembered as one of the greatest actors in the history of film. His expressiveness is amazing and he brings the character to life like no one else could have. Pitt is also great as Durden and brings a mesmerizing presence to the screen. Watching Tyler rant about the demasculinization (I hope that's a real word) of men in modern society is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter is also impressive as Marla, the only female character in the movie. She was a great choice for the character. Fincher's direction is also phenomenal. The camera work is great and the dark lighting sets a very fitting mood for the movie. The dialogue is clever, original, insightful, and anything and everything else good dialogue should be.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's creativity is outstanding and the performances are magnificient, plus it never gets boring and the plot twists are great. This is a movie that dares to view violence, masculinity, consumerism, and self realization from an entirely different perspective. I reccommend this movie very highly to anyone who appreciates originality and creativity in cinema."	5.0	Superb. An original and daring peice of cinematic excellence	2003-06-28	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ANGCVJN6WLN2O	"Dennis Bey ""DB"""	"UPDATED REVIEW 16/01/2013One of the best movies ever made:  An exercise in ""visual philosophy"", using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental imaginary and machinations based plotline.  Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (""Jack) from his stupor.  This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate.  His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism.  He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success.  The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy.  He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart -support groups.  Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path.  Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us.  His Id/super ego is Tyler Durden.  He shows him how to escape from fear.  That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality.  Then there comes the Fight Club.  ""Fight club wasn't about winning or losing.  It wasn't about words.""  Says Jack.  It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add.  Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes.  Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that ""evolved"" men despise, but is rooted in our DNA.  Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture.  Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy.  Searching for a relationship is a big stretch.  Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this.I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential.  The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation.  This masterpiece exercises and puts forth ""visual philosophy"", displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment exercises or Koans.  There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes.  This dude is on his own.  He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death,  and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club.Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line.  Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear.  If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast.  Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life.Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem.  But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn.  Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining.Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start.  The movie is a love story.  His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets at the start.  He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego.  Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler.A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thouth processes are.  From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center.  As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey in a very human experience, a tale about our war.  As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed/consumerism epidemic, ""our war is a spiritual war"".  Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war.  It never stops being an action film.The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of  the few congruent lines thrown in your  lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light.  Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot: fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further.  All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego.The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap.This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation.It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.Bravo!!"	5.0	YOU ARE NOT THE MOVIES YOU BUY!!!	2006-06-28	16	14	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ABN5K7K1TM1QA	Dennis Littrell	Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence.  His message seems to be that we are not really alive unless we are involved in something extreme.Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure cog with insomnia who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc.  The idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to relax enough to get some sleep.But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton--ha, ha) hanging out at some of the meetings.  Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that really in itself ought to excite Norton's deadened neurons.  (I know she excited mine.)  But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy sessions does is remind him that he isn't really suffering like the others, and once again he has insomnia.Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi-god, something Norton's character lacks.  They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in.  As the fight club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black.  By the way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the participants couldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.But never mind.  There's a lot more to this movie than phony fight scenes.  The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny!  Somehow an aura of humor adheres to Fincher's street mayhem, rock-the-house sex, and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities.  Not only that but the acting by the principals and Meat Loaf's massively-breasted Bob Paulson is excellent.  Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set by Pitt's brazen pathology.  The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension.  You will not be bored.Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature.  We are animals who have domesticated ourselves.  A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is difficult to watch at times.  Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that.  The scene at the back alley of a liposuction clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is particularly grossitating.  When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted, but first, please send the kiddies to bed.	4.0	Shocking the burghers; energizing the proles	2004-09-29	4	1	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1MD3Y6FNW2X9K	"""devilzclawz69"""	In today's world of film and moviemaking, it is uncommon to see a movie apart from the 7 basic genre's: Action, Sappy &quot;Feel Good&quot; movies, Romantic Comedy, Teen Comedy, Family Film, Drama (which all seem to follow the same general path), and of course the ever-popular Horror Film wave that comes along every few years. Rarely does a film with such depth and wonder come along. Rarely does a film truly make you THINK these days (i.e. ACTIVE VIEWING). And when a film DOES make the audience think more than they normally would have to while watching a movie...it is rare that such a film would be widley accpeted by the masses.Yet Fight Club has accomplished all this and so much more. With absolutley incredible cinemotography this movie has taught me that it IS possible for modern film to be ART rather than something to keep us occupied. There is not a single aspect of this movie which I would critisize. The use of cinematogrpahy, costumes, symbolism, the acting, the direction, the dialogue, the screenplay, and just about everything about this movie truly reaches maximum potential.The movie follows Edward Norton through his most unusual journey to enlightenment and freedom. An insomniac, Norton searches for ways to ease his psychological unrest. He finds comfort in support groups but is quickly driven from this comfort by a new comer, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Norton's chance meeting with the charismatic and wacky Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) leads him to a different sort of comfort. Tyler teaches Norton of the evils of society, consumerism etc... and encourages him to free himself of this consumer world. &quot;It is only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything&quot;. Together they start &quot;fight club&quot;, a &quot;club&quot; with 8, not very confining rules, that hosts an underground society of men who explore their masculinity by fighting eachother and by doing so, achieve freedom within themselves. However Tyler and Fight Club take a strange turn and Norton has to either continue on the path to enlightenment with Tyler or stop him before he carries out his plans of destroying the corporate world. Full of hundreds if not thousands of carefully placed hints, add ins, subtle jokes, subliminal &quot;messages&quot; (I find something new about the movie everytime I watch it. And trust me, I've watched it hundreds of times), and a fantastically well done twist at the end (which makes you want to go back and watch the movie again and again until you've discovered all the aspects that now seem to make so much more sense in light of the end twist), Fight Club gives us a dark, disturbing, satirical, and often hilarious view of the society we live in.The spectacular performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonhem Cater show how incredible these actors can really be and have resulted in my undying respect for them (a respect that, before this movie, was highly underdeveloped or non-exsistant)and smaller roles played by actors such as Jared Leto (&quot;Angel Face&quot;), Eion Bailey (Ricky aka &quot;Space Monkey&quot;), and Meatloaf (Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Paulson) contribute to the darkness, the satire, and the comedy of the film. Clearly an all around wonderful film, one that will go down in history and that will not be forgotten.This DVD version of the film just makes it all the better. It gives spectacular insight into the making of the film, the message of the film, and much more. I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonhem Carter, and David Fincher. I highly recommend this DVD edition. I also recommend the book &quot;Fight Club&quot; by Chuck Phalahniuk.	5.0	A classic and a landmark in modern filmmaking	2002-07-30	1	1	0

And what appears to be real in the chaotic world of Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is anything but, which makes FIGHT CLUB so much fun to watch.  Norton's character is being duped, even though Norton's character is convinced he's on some bizarre road to enlightenment--the vehicle being a ""fight club"" where anarchy rules the day.  And the catalyst to said enlightenment is Norton's unique friend Tyler (Brad Pitt is terrific), who of course is the unnamed protagonist's alter-ego (the articulate and ingenious invisible friend we all have).As the fight club reaches iconic underground status, as the anarchy becomes even more unsettling and bizarre, as the two main characters prattle about in an abandoned, dilapidated, disgusting house, I find myself keenly intent, looking for answers to more questions than I can count.  FIGHT CLUB is clever, grotesque, insightful, often funny, yet as it builds towards its inevitable over-the-top ending it starts to get so silly it gets in its own way.  Helena Bonham Carter as a gothic nonconformist girlfriend fits right in, and even Meat Loaf swings a pudgy arm in metaphorical tribute to this delightfully quirky film.--D.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AJDWUMO2AIUB	D. Miller	"It's difficult to know what to say about this film without turning my review into a spoiler, so my words will have to be chosen carefully.  We'd had a lot of ""surprise"" films that came out around the same time as Fight Club, so this film fit right in.  A ""surprise"" film defined: just when you think you know what's going on...SURPRISE you don't!Director David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) does another psychological number on us with this one. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was great...the angles alone made for an entertaining film to watch. And the story only made it better.Edward Norton (Rounders, Primal Fear) gives a captivating performance as a basic white-collar worker who is tired of his 9 to 5, Ikea-furnished existence. His life takes a turn for the better (or is it for the worst?) when he meets Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden, an energetic soap-maker. Tyler seems to have the answers to everything and shows him a whole world that he never knew existed...a world where other men take out their anger over their own lives in a secret boxing ring. The boxing ring (known as ""Fight Club"" to its members) is only the jumping off point for a whole string of other events, which Norton gets dragged into. The story is mostly narrated by Norton which is useful in giving us a little more background than we might have had otherwise, and it works well. The only time the narration becomes somewhat distracting was when Norton speaks directly at the camera rather than just being a voice-over. There was only one time that this occurred and seemed rather inconsistent with the rest of the film.Pitt also performed well, and was enjoyable in this role when he was being something of a visionary as well as when he was just downright devious.Helena Bonham Carter (A Room With A View, Howard's End) plays Marla Singer, a girl with some serious issues (drug related and otherwise) who becomes involved with Durden and ends up hanging around more than she is wanted. Carter does an excellent job in this role and definitely seems to have shed any traces of her previous period work.Another surprise in this film was Meat Loaf in the part of Bob, a guy with testicular cancer that you end up really feeling for thanks to Meat Loaf's performance. You can't help but want to hug him.As for the violence, there is a lot. But the film has so much more to it that you can't help but be fascinated anyway. Those who care to look past the violence will find much to mull over. You may find yourself cringing at times, but ultimately unable to turn away. And you may even catch yourself wanting to see it again once you know the ending to try and use your foreknowledge to see what clues you may have missed along the way.Fight Club turned out to be a great way to kill a couple of hours...but it is not a veg-out movie by far.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1XX5797TIZT5Q	D. Mok	Rolling Stone's Peter Travers lavished so much praise on this film (four  mentions in his year-end best-of list) that it was with a considerable  amount of sarcasm that I put this tape on.  Happily, the film actually  holds up to the accolades.Though it starts off as yet another  post-modern MTV kind of irreverent thrill-ride, Fight Club soon  distinguishes itself, at first by its performances.  Edward Norton's  low-key conviction scores again; he is the highly able center of this film,  the human core amidst all the dazzling filmmaking, expressionistic  lighting, and strange scenarios.  Helena Bonham Carter also distinguishes  herself, playing to perfection the same kind of nutball she played in  Getting It Right, and by the time Brad Pitt enters the picture, I was  hooked.  Director David Fincher remains one of those directors who could  use the limited Pitt effectively, and Pitt is great in this film -- using  his impressive physicality to the max, staying within his range, and  working like a charm.The film's one fault is overlength.  Nearing its  second hour the film's gross-out humour and sociological and psychological  irreverence start to wear thin, deteriorating into a kind of extended  imitation of a previous Pitt vehicle, 12 Monkeys.  Thankfully, Fincher  concocts another visually impressive, visceral ending to bring life back  into the film, and Norton in the final reel is a delight as he struggles  with his identity crisis.A producer last year made the comment that with  Being John Malkovich, Fight Club and Run Lola Run (perhaps throwing in that  less technically accomplished but still pioneering dark horse, The Blair  Witch Project), filmmaking has entered a new stage.  Having seen two of the  three and discovered that both hold up technically as well as narratively  and dramatically, I'm looking forward to Being John Malkovich.	5.0	Funny and brutal; walloping kinetic power.	2000-05-26	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30AGM4ARFLGFH	"Doc Doom ""Vic"""	"Thankfully, I'd bought the double-disc edition before it went out of production. I'm not sure if the giddy fan boy in me could have gone without seeing how they made Edward Norton see a penguin on that second disc.The movie itself is a triumph, a nice little send-up of the corporate world in which we live. The Narrator (henceforth referred to as ""Jack"") lives a comfortable life: a good job with a ""major"" car company, a large apartment, plenty of cash, IKEA furniture ... oh, but wait. Jack can't sleep. For some reason or another, he suffers from insomnia.After finding solace in support groups and having that taken away from him, he meets an interest person named Tyler Durden who, after a hilarious incidence, opens his home, and his philosophies, to Jack.Tyler is the anti-yes-man. He hates everything about modern life, how everyone feel the need to fill their lives with garbage, how they're all led to believe they'll become millionaires and rock stars. It sickens him. In a world in which men have been stripped of their primal maleness, Tyler invites them into a world where they can give into their darker sides and fight it out with each other. Of course, Tyler has much deeper plans than that...Without wanting to give away much more of the plot, you will enjoy this movie if: you've ever looked at something you ""have to"" like with utter contempt and disbelief, if you've ever felt within you a need for something higher than modernized life, or just plain hate suits. Sometimes, granted, Tyler's teachings seem a little shaky, but this IS a movie (and an excellent book), not a guidebook. The movie is trying to make a point, not force you to bend to its will; that's what society does.As films go, this is probably in my top 10, definitely in my top 25 films of all time. Fincher does an amazing job directing, using CGI in inventive, sparing ways. Brad Pitt continued with his success on ""Se7en"" and pulls off a great Tyler. Ed Norton plays the perfect begrudged IKEA-boy. Helena Bonham Carter .... to be honest, I hated, despises her character the first time I saw this, but I find her more likable with each watching. The real surprise of this movie was Meat Loaf, who play sensitive bodybuilder Bob ... and almost outshines the two stars.As for special features, this is a pretty darn nice collection. Mostly short documentaries on how they did some of the special effects (the penguin, the plane, Jack's catalogue apartment, the ... two special effects shots for the ending) which are interesting. The fashion designs are ... pictures of clothes. Never very interesting except to see what Tyler could've been wearing (and he wore some crazy stuff in the film). The deleted scenes actually add a bit to the movie (Tyler quitting smoking in one of them (!)).The real gem of the second disc, at least, is the Publicity Gallery.The commercials and trailers are nothing too special, but the Public Service announcements are sidesplitting. Sadly, there are only two, but one features Ed and the other Brad telling the audience normal theatre going  procedure (where the exits are, turn of cell phones) and then end with each saying something odd... I doubt I'll be allowed to repeat Tylers's, but Jack says, out of the blue ""Remember: NO ONE has the right to touch you in your bathing suit area!""This is the one DVD collection in which the special features are equal to the film. The single-disc edition contains everything on the first disc, which is pretty much the commentary. Still, I think hunting down the double disc edition is well worth the $30 you may have to shell out to get it. I mean, what else are you going to spend it on? A duvet?"	5.0	Naturally, written after the fact...	2003-03-24	6	5	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2NWMKTGGROUM8	"""doctor_smith"""	"""Fight Clubs"" evokes passionate responses; it bewilders some, digusts others, and awes many, particularly young males. If it impresses with the chances it takes in narrative form and cinematic bravado, it also proves problematic, cohering only on a peripheral level and ending its tale with a rather forced resolution that doesn't quite pull the thematic elements together. Fincher is, without a doubt, a talented director with a visual style all of his own; he produced ""Fight Club"" with a sparkling clear, but gloomy, photography that highlights its exisentialist ideas. But the telling is too forceful and heavy-handed, relaying its meaning and themes with blinders on. But by far the biggest drawback is that ""Fight Club"" is not as smart as it thinks it is. Its philosophy is ultimately too simplistic to be convincing.Among relatively new directors, Fincher is at the head of his class; his style is sophisticated enough to be taken seriously, and he generally handles his films with impressive skill. It's a treat to see, for example, how well he combines CGI techniques with traditional camerawork in this film.  But his direction is far from perfect.  While it's not a fault of the film by any means, my other problem with ""Fight Club"" is the mythic status it has attained among specific segments of the movie-going public. It's a film that is prone to over-intellectualizing and hyberbole, and since its release it has been a victim of both. By the way, if you do like this film, you will be happy with the DVD; the picture and sound quality is top notch."	3.0	Fincher's Marginal Tale of Anarchy	2003-01-08	5	4	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2K4ZZ1TBVGN9Y	Dominique Alexandar	"FIGHT CLUB reviewAt first, I thought Jack was a ""psuedo-schitzophrenic"", wanting to escape the monotony of living a mundane, obsessive-compulsive, structured life of self-constrictive perfection, through living, vicariously, inside and through the mind of Tyler Durden, thus gaining an, adverse, connective reality.  Little did I know, Tyler and Marla Singer (Jack's sub-conscious, consciously, created girlfriend) were Devil's Advocates of choice and balance.Jack and Tyler use the word, ""clever"" in a conversational irony, at first meeting, that is a thought provoking glimpse to the audience, which hints the nemesis in the movie's content, and the trigger of unleashing Jack's suppressed emotional entrapment.This movie is a compelling array of ""mind games"", confusion, mischief, mayhem and twisted ironies that split seconds of comprehensive understanding, thus one moment of distraction will inhibit the viewer from gaining a full perspective.Edward Norton (Jack), (who also plays one of the lead characters in ""Primal Fear"", along with Richard Gere, which I had to mention), gives a chilling and engaging performance as an insomniac protagonist and is also Narrator of ""Fight Club"", along with, actors, Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) and Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer), who enhance a thickening plot of  Sado-masochistic overviews of The Fight Within...Dominique Alexandar"	5.0	Fight Club	2012-10-12	0	0	0

It was smart, well intended, yadda yadda yadda - but it also just seemed so &quot;obvious&quot; at times that I couldn't jump on that masterpiece band wagon.  Then I saw Fight Club - a love it or hate it film for sure, but I was blown away.  To me it conveyed a very similar message with more creativity, more mystery and more raw energy than American Beauty could even imagine.  I'm no Brad Pitt fan, but he was fine here.  Norton - who lately is taking some missteps - was excellent and HBC was brilliantly freaky and vulnerable at the same time.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ARH9IQEMFKR6M	Doug Vaughn	Fight Club has to be one of the best films I have seen in years. A complex, well acted, beautifully flimed drama about one man's descent into madness, it is alive with dark humor, violent action, emotional turmoil,  skillful plotting and really insightful commentary on social life and  society at century's end.Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are exceptional. As  different as night and day, it isn't possible to compare their  performances, but since they exist in the film as foils for one another's  characters they create together a wonderful balance - an edgy give and take  that is at the heart of the film's exciting dynamic. Helena Bonham Carter,  free for once of the aristocratic pretensions of her usual film characters,  can't begin to measure up. She doesn't have the heat on screen that Norton  and Pitt bring to their parts. Meat Loaf, in a surprisingly touching  characterization, brings more to the screen - in every sense - than Carter  does.It isn't fair to try and elaborate on the plot because the twists  and ambiguities are a large part of the fun - and of the darker purpose of  the film. But it is worthwhile to point out what the film is not; it is not  a typical &quot;guy&quot; film. It uses the boy-centered, testosterone  fueled theme of the 'fight club', a club that exists strictly for the  purpose of providing guys an opportunity to fight, to make a valid critical  statement about urban societ today - men feel isolated, adrift, untested,  worthless and tame. Fight club gives its members confidence, provides a  chance for them to express their anger and aggression, creates contact and  bonding, fills the emptiness and gives them purpose. Watching the fight  club go from an informal gathering for a few to a rule based movement  spreading like wildfire across the country is almost surreal.There is  lots of savage humor in this film. Many of Pitt's lines and a lot of  Norton's voice-over narration are both memorable and funny. But this is  definitly not a comedy and not for the faint of heart. If you've got the  stomach for it, this is one great entertainment and a fine serious film at  the same time. I highly recommend it.	5.0	A savage, subversive, insightful entertainment	2000-05-24	37	29	8
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AO7B95BKB1FVV	DragonHonor	Frankly, I had thought it was just an action movie. I couldn't have been more wrong.Edward Norton is the unnamed protagonist, an insomniac whose job in the daily grind of the office is driving him nuts. The only thing he cares about is his furniture, and the only way he can find solace is through support groups--for problems he doesn't have. But when Marla begins to frequent all the same support groups, he knows she's a faker too, and it disrupts his peace of mind. Fortunately, help is on the way.He encounters Tyler Durden, a confident, reckless soap salesman who grasps the protagonist's problem while sitting next to him on the plane. Material things are the problem, of course. And when the protagonist's apartment blows up (gas leak, ya know), he finds himself embracing nihilism and abandoning his support groups.He and Tyler start Fight Club to relieve the stress of life in the consumer world, but it escalates without the protagonist's knowledge into a terrorist organization that spreads across the country. The Fight Club members joined to escape conformity, but it follows them, and they become nameless soldiers in a war against society. The protagonist is morally opposed to the terrorism, yet unable to halt it. Tyler seems untouchable, surrounded by his aura of confidence and an army of fanatics.Personally, I liked the twist, but it wasn't a surprise for me--someone revealed the twist before I saw the movie. The twist made one or two things make less sense, but didn't change the overall philosophy examined by the movie. The twist just made the movie more interesting psychologically, and the action afterwards was great, very intense.Overall, an excellent movie. Some very humorous bits, some great camera tricks, and some great action, plus psychological thrills and an interesting philosophy.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after two dozen viewings; its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk-smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.	5.0	Infinitely Quotable, Ruthlessly Unpredictable, Genuinely Unforgettable	2011-05-13	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A323TBXI570W3W	Dr. TV	When I went to see Fight Club while it was playing in theaters, I expected a movie that was a little odd, that would have some good fight scenes, and would be embelished by a good soundtrack.  What I got was one of the  strangest films I've ever seen, with a perfectly dark world of  no-holds-barred violence, all set to a perfectly dark, ambient soundtrack  by the Dust Brothers.  From the first few moments of the movie, I was  hooked.Ed Norton fit perfectly into the role of the disaffected yuppy  and Brad Pitt was absolutely amazing as the outspoken and maniacal Tyler  Durden.  The interaction between the two was perfect.  Rarely have I seen  an on screen duo with the chemistry that these two portrayed.The plot to  this film was responsible for making it such a masterpiece.  What would  normally seem ridiculous was made perfectly believable by the end of the  movie.  Things that would normally seem corny or over-the-top seemed  logical, and, at times unavoidable offshoots of the original concept of a  &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  &quot;Fight Club&quot; could easliy have become  overly dark were not for the occasional humor (albeit cynical, morbid, and  even disturbing humor) that was present throughout the film.  Tyler's  wisecracking and satirical outlook, Marla's apathy, and Ed Norton's  character's boy scout from hell morality (running off to save the world in  just his housecoat and boxers) contrasted perfectly.I also have to  mention the cinematography.  From the first scene it was evident that the  director knew how to make this film work.  The boldness of the  cinematography is what makes it so perfect.  It has a cold,  straight-forward approach that is reminiscent of the film's plot.Fight  Club is a haunting masterpiece, a warning against our own material  obsession and our primal pursuit of freedom.  It forces us to accept this  &quot;duality&quot; in our nature, and vividly depicts the eternal  ultimatum of denying or listening to our inner voice and the chilling  results of either choice.	5.0	The Best Movie of the Year	2000-06-27	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ZT3DIS3GGE25	Duncan C. White	The film is a malicious and ugly descent into self-justifiable darkness.The film gently escorts the viewer along with the premise that the average life is awful so lets start fight clubs and hit each other. Fairly harmless premise and if it ended there it would be acceptable, however the fights have several motives: 1. they're used to desensitize the viewer to aggressive violence for whats to come later and 2. the harmless fight clubs have the same form and structure as the terroristic Project Mayhem, so the film tries to convince the viewer that if Fight Clubs are good, terroristic Project Mayhem is good.They bring you on board with the fights and reinforce the view that 'regular' life is so awful you cant make anything of it so just give up on it. A horribly cynical and destructive view of life. Once they have your thinking on this inevitable track, they then push you along to making terrorism an extension of Fight Club(i.e. cool). Strangely enough the film rails against society endlessly through the film yet the target of Project Mayhem are credit card companies. If society is so unredeemable how would blowing up credit card companies and resetting debt to 0 accomplish anything at all? The film doesnt even make sense in its own perverted world view.Once Project Mayhem becomes revealed the film becomes more and more hazy on what exactly is going on. Obviously its some sort of internal struggle, some say its a visual depiction of mind control, some say MPD. The film didnt have the guts to explain itself so we'll never know for sure.All I do know is that anyone suggesting someone give up on life and actively destroy society because its not perfect(which is exactly what this film suggests) is wrong. We've seen what happens when a whole nation takes on this self-destructive mindset, it happened in Communist Russia and Communist China to diabolical results.	1.0	Gleefully malicious and unnecessarily obscured plot	2004-09-09	55	16	39

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1HISWDTFQHVE9	DVD Talk	The Movie:  Fight Club is the story of the every man - Jack, who like most of us clocks in every day to a job, defines himself by what he owns, and simply does not sleep well. Jack finds solitude in myriad of support groups, everything from Men with Testicular Cancer, Sycle Sell Anemia  Support Groups, and of course both Blood and Brain Parasite Support Groups.  Jack doesn't have the ailments associated with each group, but he isn't  exactly well either. Through a series of events Jack meets Tyler Durden and  through Tyler he finds Fight Club, a much different kind of support group.  I would say more, but as you will find out.... &quot;The First Rule of  Fight Club is- You Do Not Talk about Fight Club&quot;.Fight Club is an  in your face adrenaline filled movie, which isn't afraid to laugh at itself  and at us. It's part action film, part satire, part comedy. A strange and  unique blend that really works.  If you haven't seen Fight Club, be  prepared, it's a movie that definitely has to grow on you. The first time I  saw this film in the theaters I had a mixed reaction to it. Then I read the  book by Chuck Palahniuk, and began to find myself really liking the story.  By my third enthusiastic viewing on DVD I realized that Fight Club is one  of those movies that truly improves with time and repeat viewing.The  Picture: On DVD Fight Club looks great. Fight Club is presented in its  theatrical aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and is enhanced for Wide Screen TV's.  Having seen Fight Club in the theaters I was particularly impressed with  the films transfer on to DVD. Fight Club is a very dark film with a lot of  deep dark tones. The transfer to DVD masterfully reproduces these dark  tones in a very clear and clean way while still maintaining the gritty feel  of the movie.The Sound: Fight Club features truly fantastic 5.l Dolby  Digital audio track which is used very well by both the movies sound  effects and the excellent score by the Dust Brothers. A nice feature (if  you have the equipment to support it) is the main Dolby Digital 5.1 audio  track is THX EX enhanced - Which basically means it has an additional rear  center channel. Fight Club is THX certified, I wish more of the the THX  certified movies looked and sounded this good.The Extras: Fight Club is  so packed to the gills with special features, I found myself spending as  much time watching the special features as I did the movie. The best  special features are the 4 audio commentary tracks on the DVD. It was quite  a task listening to ALL 4 commentary tracks, and I'd recommend spacing them  out a bit. The two tracks I liked the best were the main Commentary track  with David Fincher and the second track with David Fincher, Brad Pitt,  Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. There are so many layers to this  film and these two tracks really flesh out many of the subtleties and  meaning which make Fight Club such an amazing movie. I was less enthralled  by the track with Chuck Palanhiuk and Jim Uhls which sounded like buddies  watching a football game, and when I got to the crew's audio track I was  simply burned out.The Second Disc in this 2 disc set is devoted entirely  to extras. Be warned, this DVD has so many features and so many options  it's almost impossible to get through. While I admired the uniqueness of  the way the Making of Fight Club Features were presented (with multiple  camera angles and audio tracks), I found the experience of watching them to  be disjointed. I was so overwhelmed by option and selections that it really  didn't end up being an enjoyable experience. I think the Making of Fight  Club Features are a great example of DVD technology being over used and  getting in the way of the enjoyment of the material. I would have much  rather seen a more compiled making of documentary over the fragments  presented on this DVD.When Fight Club was announced I got the impression  that there would be many more Outtakes and Deleted Scenes. There are only 7  fairly short deleted scenes, most of which compare the deleted scene with  the scene that ended up in the movie. With so much room on the second DVD I  would have liked to see more Outtakes and Bloopers (like on the Criterion  release of Armageddon).If you are a fan of trailers and promos, you'll  be in heaven with Fight Club. I don't think I've ever seen such an  extensive collection of promotional materials including: Teasers, Trailers,  TV Spots, Internet Ads, PSA, Posters, Lobby Cards and even the Film's Press  Kit. Of special note are the Fight Club Internet Ads which are extremely  entertaining as well as 2 PSA's which are just hilarious. Conclusion: Fight  Club is a really exceptional DVD due mostly to the superb film and sound  transfer. It is packed with special features, but quantity in this case  doesn't necessarily mean quality. I spent a great deal of time with Fight  Club, much more than almost any other DVD that I own, but not all of that  time was quality time. Especially on the second DVD, I found myself  spending a lot of time just flipping around trying to figure out what I was  watching. If Fox had released Fight Club with the great picture and sound  and only 2 of the commentary tracks, a solid making of documentary and the  deleted scenes, on one DVD, it would have been enough, the rest is bonus.Review Reprinted from DVD Talk.	5.0	Fight Club	2000-05-19	8	6	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A14M31P3OH1IHE	Dylan	I don't quite see why words such as 'fascist' are being thrown around with this movie, when the message it so obviosuly states is quite anti-fascist, and pro-thinking, pro-ethics, pro-independence. The world given to us in 'Fight Club', Tyler's world, is one, at least to me, of hope: When we are free of our comforts, when we are free of the sofas, and the televisions, even our money, when the only thing left to value is ourselves and the other living creatures around us, only then can we truly know emotion and feel for those 'closest' to us. I deeply connected with its anti-Capitalist message, in that money sucks away true emotion. We, in America, are so bent on making more than everybody else and dying with as many toys as we can buy that we neglect that people and life and the world we live in are the only things, really, which matter in the long run. And this movie is an effective prophet of that concept - I know tons of people who have nearly abandoned all their reliance on material possessions after seeing this film. David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Jim Uhls, Chuck Palahniuk, Helena Bonham Carter, and everyone else attatched to this film are the Siddharthas and Don Juans of modern society.This movie, and the book(which is absolutely brilliant and flawless), have completely changed my life, and opened my eyes to the underlying meaning beneanth the things in my existence. As Norton paraphrases on the Director's Commentary, this film teaches us the rules to independence: Kill your god, Kill your family, and Kill your teacher. What does this mean? Watch this movie, open yourself, and let go.It's not until we've lost everything that we are free to do anything.	5.0	utterly brilliant	2000-12-25	1	0	1

If you said yes then you are either a LIAR or you like to expand your mind...Whether you did or not, this movie is one of the best.This comedy is pitch black and brought to you by Director David Fincher as an adaptation of a novel by now famed writer Chuck Palahniuk.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt give a most incredible performance made sharp by the script and sweet visual effects.Sick and tired of corporate American greed, Norton's character seeks comfort in a few weird places.  He eventually meets Pitt's character on a plane ride home.  Circumstance puts them together soon after and the Fight Club emerges.  The end result is bringing down the system and that is a metaphor for what Norton's character goes through till the end.  Add Helena Carter's character, Marla Singer, recently in the Sweeney Todd remake, and you have the dark necessary to truly make this movie work."	5.0	Sometimes I see people that aren't there	2008-12-02	3	1	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A163TRB4VW62TS	ehh	The film starts out with plenty of excellent ideas, but by the time it's half-way over, they are all abandoned in favor of sheer brutality.  Norton is excellent as usual, but Pitt's wacko acting style really only worked in Terry Gilliam's '12 Monkeys.'  Visually it's impressive, but otherwise it's just plain empty.  Fincher is definitely not a great director; it seems very hard for him to create a balance of visuals and story.  It's about 90% visual, 10% actual film, so it comes off as VERY prentious and plodding.  If a movie that has a balance between brilliant cinematogaphy and story is what you want, watch any Ridley Scott or Francis Ford Copolla film.

Life's too short for that, so I ignored it.When my son returned from winter camp, he kept insisting that we rent the movie. Knowing that he hangs with creative, rebellious &amp; inciteful people, I got a copy.I couldn't watch it once--I had to watch it a second time. The movie challenges socially constructed ideas of masculinity in several ways. It mocks them. It presents alternatives. It runs one idea to its apocalyptic conclusion.This is a disturbing movie, but well worth the time to watch ... and be careful, you, too, may feel compelled to watch it a second time. But remember, it's just a movie, as the characters keep reminding us.If you watch this on DVD, make certain that the disk is clean before starting.

This is an amazingly kinetic experience, and credit must be spread generously:  Stars Norton (as the burned-out office drone) and Pitt (as a swaggering post-modern James Dean) are both excellent; director Fincher unloads all kinds of stunning visual set-pieces that only seldom seem gratuitous; Jim Uhls' rich, clever, and very quotable script plays its cards perfectly.  Not really an ode to mindless nihilism, it is more thoughtful and sophisticated than the fight-the-power diatribe some people make it out to be; if this movie celebrates rebellion, then it also shows its pitfalls as well.  I even thought it was uplifting in its own way.  And the ending (set to the strains of the Pixies' &quot;Where Is My Mind?&quot;) is a classic.	5.0	Amazing	2001-01-14	1	1	0

Fight Club is a wake up call from the false consciousness  society lulls us into and reminds the male viewer of the reality of human  existance.  Fight Club is a buddy picture, a brutal display of male bonding  and unity that ultimately snowballs into an all out rebellion against the  mediocrity of meaningless middle management careers and worthless  single-serve relationships.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3EP2O1NK36X1U	Emmanuel	"It's easy to dismiss ""Fight Club"" as either a brilliant masterwork or a testoserone pumped, self indulgent, piece of trash. I'm sorta taking the middle ground. This movie deals with what I call easy philosophical ideas. What is reality? Are we in realization of it? What is free will? Do we have it? (I don't think we do) What is maleness, femaleness, happiness, value of human life and a whole bunch of other stuff is thrown into the mish mash. And it delves into easy societal issues about consumerism, cults and/or mass mentality, male agressiveness. The movie never really says much about any of these topics except to merely mention them and to take one of them and turn it into a plot icon for the movie's ending so we can go, ""Wow that was cool"". The movie takes these topics and puts layers of testosterone imbued cynicism, brutal violence, generous helpings of post Tarantino filmmaking and a grungy Marilyn Manson/Rob Zombie music video aura atop. This film is painfully and cynically gung ho. There's alot of style here but no real intelligence to back it up. This is the kind of film a fresh outta high school, angry, alienated, anarchist, raised by Limp ""Biscuit"" teen would make who wears Ernesto Che Guevara tees because Rage Against the Machine does, yet not knowing a smidgn of who he is, what he did or what he stands for. (Not that I know much anyway) Sigh. On the flip side the film is very witty and has a strangely liberating ending...albeit terrifying. This movie would have been great if played out as a straight action movie and not try be intelligent or give off the impression of intelligence. I'm giving the film 2 stars because it's showcases the talented directoral efforts of Fincher who is an excellent visual composer. His talents could be used more efficiently in other material, and has been. ""Seven"" is a far superior and thrilling film."	2.0	Suffers from post Tarantino syndrome.	2001-07-19	12	8	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ZIEHIY2VWKPN	"""erake"""	I loved this movie! From the opening credits right down to the supplementary footage included in the DVD, I was entranced. David Fincher  really does stay true to the spirit of the book - with the exception of the  ending (READ THE BOOK). The DVD has deleted scenes, director commentary on  just about everything, and tons of information on how the special effects  were created.Also, Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance  opposite Helena Bonham Carter opposite Brad Pitt in this somewhat violent  ride through the life and times of Tyler Durden.I didn't see this movie  in the theater due to the poor ratings and rumors of it's misogynist  portrayals of women, but how can you expect some ancient closed-minded  critic to understand this movie?I don't want to give away too much, but  lets just say that nothing is what it seems. Nothing.Sure, this movie's  not for everyone, but would you rather watch one of those post-menopausal,  coming of age, mid-life crisis movies? If so, go rent Steel Magnolias. If  you want a scathing attack on consumerism and a look at the perils of  conformity, then you need look no further.	5.0	A thrilling existential ride	2000-08-10	2	2	0

The violence that was displayed in the movie was definately neccessary to the movie's overall premise. Edward Norton does an absolutely excellent job  portraying our narrator (&quot;Jack&quot;).  His internal conflict at his  life is obvious as we pan through his condo - with price tags on everything  visible.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is his single-serving friend who brings  this conflict to light.  The movie progresses &amp; I won't spoil the plot  as others have done - other than to say - I just loved this movie.  Helena  Bonham Carter plays the trashy Marla wonderfully.  She finally takes a  break form all of those period flicks!The DVD itself - I give it 5  stars.  It has got so many extras on the supplemental disc - I still  haven't gone through them all.  I am definately looking forward to  finishing it though!Your money WILL NOT BE WASTED on this DVD.  I am so  glad I bought it.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3GPFHWJ1SSIHE	Eric B. Norris	The main Amazon review of &quot;Fight Club&quot; says it's about moral decay.  Yeah, and I'm U Tant.  Fight Club has nothing to do with societal problems or moral decay.  Fight Club doesn't even have anything to do with fighting.  Fight Club is about the interior landscape of the human soul and the struggle to become.But please, please, see Fight Club for yourself and you decide.  I liked Fight Club when I saw it in the theater, but the main plot twist frankly took most of my attention.  It wasn't until I started watching this DVD that I actually got Fight Club. I've now seen Fight Club more than 10 times, and I'm still picking up things I hadn't connected before.There is so much to this movie I can't begin to even talk about it.  With each viewing it seems more impossible that any major studio would even touch this movie!  Instead, let me say that this DVD edition is the DVD I measure all others against.  It is superb.  There are piles of extras, including multiple documentaries on the making of the movie.  There are also different commentary tracks.  The main commentary track, with Norton, Pitt, Carter, and Filcher, is the most interesting, and the one I'd suggest you listen to after watching the movie a few times.  You may find as I did that it helps you pick up even more the next time you watch the movie with the commentary off.  Also, Fight Club is a movie made for viewing on DVD.  You can study certain scenes frame by frame.  I'd tell you why you'd want to do this, but as you'll soon find out the first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club.I honestly think people will be watching this movie in a thousand years, if there are still people left on this Earth.  If you love movies, you must see Fight Club.	5.0	A stunning movie with nearly infinite depth	2001-10-10	5	2	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1	"Eric E. Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'"""	"This is one of my favourite BDs in my collection. Even the intro menu is set for ludicrous speed. Packed with tons of special features, easy interactivity from pop-up menus, four crazy commentary tracks, the ""I am Jack's Search Index"" (which is all levels of handy if you want to see or hear a specific bit of info without having to dig around for it), public safety announcements (worth the cost of the BD alone); we also get a few exclusive behind the scenes featurettes.The story is subtle, complex, and comes crashing by like a runaway train. Then, the train crashes. And you can't look away even if your life depended on it. Fight Club suggests that we don't need all the things we allow to hold us in the material world. Fight Club dares you think outside you own little world and asks ""what would you be willing to do for the greater good of mankind?""The protagonist isn't even given a name, which actually serves to endear him to our open arms, feeling sorry for a poor man who can't sleep and is without a single iota of fun or meaningfulness. He meets a guy, and together they go on a totally psychotic self-discovery trip. And as they go, they gain groupies. What happens... is not expected.Every one from the camera man to the cast is simply incredible; there is no way possible for me to overstate anything about this film. Some people make negative remarks siting the violence as unnecessary. But man (as in humans) has nothing but a history of violence in one way or another. Don't go into this movie with preconceptions or judgments before hand. Once the credits roll, take an hour or so to think about everything that is said and done throughout the film. At the end of the day, this movie is about truth in self-discovery. So take it all in, breath it in, and ask yourself ""do I conform or do I act on my own?""It's kinda like an introspective documentary, seasoned with blood sweat and tears, wrapped with banality, and with side orders of dark humour and fist-fightings with plenty to go around.I am Jack's Reviewer.

It will take you and a journey into the darkest reaches of the  human psyche that you may scare yourself when you realize how much you are  enjoying this movie.Fight Club is the story of pure disturbing genius.  The protagonist, Ed Norton and co-star Brad Pitt embark on a journey of the  most primal or emotions, rage.  They provide the outlet for society's rage  in Fight Club.This movie is so much more than just the story of some  guys who get together and beat eachother up.  As it progresses, a whirlwind  of emotions begin to batter at Norton.  By the time it is over, you will  not know what happened.  Watch it again.  Things will start to become  clear.  With an ending rivalling that of the Sixth Sense, Fight Club did  not recieve the attention it deserved.  I'd say that it is destined to  achieve cult status, with myself strongly in tow.	5.0	Disturbing Genius	2000-07-04	8	7	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A12AG1OXXG1ZNO	Eric J. Pray	David Fincher's Fight Club didn't exactly make a big name for itself upon its initial release last year(its box office gross was a mere 36 million dollars), but as nearly every Hollywood Exec. knows, video changes  everything. It saddens me a little to think that this film was so easily  overlooked by the people who now rush to rent, buy, and review it,  but(pardon the cliche)better late than never. Fight Club is a brutal and  dirty film(no, not in a sexual sense, but in its grainy stock and the  unhygenic characters who love nothing more than to befoul any corporatized  or mainstream institution)that lends the viewer a feeling of empathy for  the struggling men of Fight Club and their search for individuality in a  society more concerned with brand names and fashion labels.  I couldn't  help but laugh when Tyler and The Narrator(Yes, I know what you're  thinking, but let's not spoil the end for those who haven't seen the film  or read the book)lured a large number of diarrheic pigeons to a rooftop  near a BMW dealership with bird feed, or when an unnamed character placed a  &quot;new and improved&quot; version of an airline's safety and evacuation  guidelines in all of the plane's seatbacks.  I think most of us smile at  things like this because we all realize just how dumb &quot;yes men&quot;  think we are and its nice to see them squirm once in awhile.  Who hasn't,  at one time or another, wanted to shake the people around them and wake  them up to some sad truth.  It's a fact: Corporations think we're stupid.  Tyler knows this.  And it pisses him off. Fincher does an excellent job of  keeping to the heart of the book and each actor, not a single exception,  does an incredible job of fleshing out their character's dramatic and  humorous potential. This is one of the truly good films of the Nineties.  I  have yet to meet a person, man or woman, who thinks differently. Run ,if  need be, to your local video store. Better yet, just buy it.  You'll be  glad you did.	5.0	The Men Of Paper Street	2000-06-07	5	4	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3UEGH3G3JQGS3	ERIC LOPEZ	Fight Club is one of the few films in recent memory that attempts to honestly analyze and deconstruct our infatuation with media generated ideals. Whether it's the Ikea furniture Norton's character surrounds  himself with or his desperate attempts to assimilate the Brad Pitt persona,  Fincher spends much of the movie showing just how little we really think of  ourselves.The much talked about violence acts as a catharsis, an escape  from the pervasive ennui that envelopes their lives. Ironically, by  subjecting the viewer to the many fight sequences throughout the film, we  realize that the violence really does have a purpose. The point is that the  characters have become so obsessed with trying to live up to preconceived  ideals perpetrated by the media and coupled with the  &quot;effeminization&quot; of the male sex (the film's concept, not  mine)their only means of escape is the primal ritual of bashing one's face  in. Some of these ideas have been addressed before, yet never have I seen  them treated in such a beautifally brutal and kinetic way. Highly  recommended.	4.0	Misinterpreted	2000-03-09	6	5	1

I mean this movie is not in the same genre of greats such as the Godfather, Star Wars and things such as that.  But in the movie genre that this film was set in,  it was a very thought out movie.  The plot was very good with a lot of detail and build up.  The acting was phenomenal.  Brad Pitt's character was a very conplex yet abnoxious and driving character, then with Edward Norton, his character was very tentative and oblivious to everything.  Brad Pitt portrayed the exact opposite of what Edward Norton's character was.  This movie is definitely not for the people who want just the general shoot em up and love stuff.  This is a a thinker movie.  I dont care who you are,  if anybody says they knew the end was coming the first time they saw it, they are full of ....	5.0	Fight Club	2001-10-17	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A33KTYI1PWE2Q7	Eric Raines	Fight Club is a one of a kind movie to my knowledge.  It's a highly entertaining film if you don't mind violence and a bit of blood and brutality.The characters in this film offer a great window into the  depths of a world where morality is lacking and you are respected more by  what you can do in a fight than anything else.Edward Norton delivers  another outstanding performance in another off-kilter film. Brad Pitt's  best performance since &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; as he portrays another  character that will have you hooked. Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of  the freakish girlfriend will have you laughing and staring wide eyed;  appalled at the antics of one who is more concerned with dying than  living.Meat Loaf was a great addition to this movie.  His small role as  &quot;Bob&quot; adds a great bit of comic relief and understanding to the  film.This movie is heavily violent and should not be taken lightly.  You  won't fully appreciate it until you get to the shocking ending, but this  one is worth more than one viewing!	5.0	Decent movie that can't be fully appreciated until it's over	2000-06-14	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1CHM200OEN65X	"Eric Wilson ""novelist"""	Just when I thought it was impossible for a movie to capture the nuances of a well-crafted novel, David Fincher comes along and proves me wrong.  Fincher, the director, shows again his ability to mold a movie like clay,  to shape it into whatever style is necessary to convey its dark, moral  shape.  The cast backs him up with intensity and bravado.&quot;Fight  Club,&quot; as implied by the title, is not for the faint-of-heart, for the  self-appointed morality squads, or for those interested in mere  entertainment...This movie wants to say something--and, in case you're hard  of hearing, it'll even yell out its sermonettes at times.  No, not every  lesson hits home.  Some fly off the mark, and some get lost behind the  violent foreground--but others hit you like a bullet between the  eyes.Jack begins as an insomniac, &quot;not really asleep, and not  really awake.&quot;  As he finds himself addicted to the close-knit feeling  of support groups, he becomes an emotional junkie, attending meeting after  meeting with bogus ailments--anything for his next hug, his next  &quot;fix.&quot;  These scenes, though humorous at times, touch on deep  felt longings and feelings in us all. But when Jack realizes that another  person, Marla Singer, is also using the groups for her own devices, his  ecstasy is shattered.  His own shallowness, reflected through her, becomes  a thorn in his side.Jack begins losing sleep again...Until he meets  Tyler Durden.  Soon, the two inseparable partners commit themselves to an  anti-social life, pursuing answers and meaning in a world ruled by  capitalistic emptiness.  &quot;The things you own... own you!&quot; Tyler  declares.  And the two set out to be free men by casting aside most things  society holds dear.Their intentions and their courage to cast aside  convention in the pursuit of a better way left me simultaneously stunned  and cheering and repulsed.  As the film churns inexorably toward its  violent and surprising conclusion, I, like Jack, found myself awakening  from this bad dream, hoping there was time and means to redeem the chaos  unleashed.But it wasn't to be.Like the young men in the classic  novel, &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; the men of Fight Club spiral downward  into their own moral mire, resulting in death and destruction.  Unlike  &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; there are no rescuers on the horizon this  time around.  The results of their soul-searching-gone-mad prove explosive  and unstoppable.In the end, Jack and Tyler's questions and  frustrations go unanswered, and we are left with the dark realization that  these questions cannot be ignored.  Their search short-circuits almost  before it begins; the paths they travel lead to emptiness.But are  answers out there?  I believe there are...&quot;Fight Club&quot; stands up  and demands that we keep searching.	5.0	Lord of the Guys	2000-06-12	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3O55KI6ZMQ4DW	"Erik Blood ""shizzam"""	Many of the people I know who didn't enjoy this movie simply didn't get it.  Some were threatened by the attitude towards consumerism.  Others found the violence too much, or even worse, over done.  But no one came out  of that theatre with something they'd expected or something they could  forget about.  Those who went in for an action flick were forced to watch a  literate, existential, art film with violence that they couldn't get  excited about because it had meaning.  Those who wanted to see Brad Pitt  saw Brad Pitt and paid little mind to the brilliant story brought to us by  one of the finest new American authors, Chuck Palaniuk.  And the rest were  offended by the negative attitude toward their favorite coffee chains,  clothing stores, and/or furniture outlet.  I say good.Some wonderful  things about this movie, not giving anything away, are that the characters  that are fighting the above mentioned institutions are also willing  participants in making them as successful as they are, and the body count  is as low as a big budget Hollywood film has been in years.  Don't believe  me?  Check it out.As a film, it stands out as one of the most creative  and beautifully shot movies this year.  David Fincher, not being bound by  convention, made one of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever with  Fight Club.This film will speak to everyone.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A33PECEQITGHIQ	Erisu Kimu	"This is bold, bruising humor alright! At first, I didn't really know what the VHS box was talking about in its description of Jack being a ticking-time bomb insomniac until I finished watching the movie. It's a bit complex to explain anything about this movie since it's one of those psychological comedies. The movie stars Edward Norton (one of my current favorite actors) and Brad Pitt as well as Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto and Meat Loaf. The flick starts off with Edward Norton who plays simply the ""narrator"" but hinted with the notification of Jack as he sits on a chair with a gun in his mouth pointed by Brad Pitt who plays Tyler Durden. You are then taken moments and perhaps days before what had led up to the circumstances. Jack is an insomniac who is looking to decorate his condo with new furniture and home designs to maybe reshape his depression. He starts attending sessions for those who need the same help as him but ends up sprawling back into depression and insomnia when a fake cancer victim steps into the picture. Eventually things get out of hand for Jack and things aren't as they seem and you find out that he's actually ""insane"" lol with serious emotional problems. You'll have to watch this flick to understand what I'm saying. Jack and Tyler Durden are the same person but in different perspectives. Tyler is who Jack wants to be like and everything that Jack wants to be is Tyler Durden. Anyway, FIGHT CLUB is basically a club for males to release their anger and emotions as they channel primal male aggression beating each other senseless until one of them gives up or gets knocked out. The therapy shockingly works for Jack and the whole system is topped with rules. Through many zany moments, you will find yourself trapped in a maze of questions but everything will reveal itself slowly as the film proceeds to the mind-blowing climax. The bottomline is that this movie delivers no remorse with pure style. Booming with a soundtrack by the Dust Brothers and a concept so worth picking the title up for. Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give terrific performances. My favorite scene has got to be when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss.Rent this movie TODAY!!"	5.0	One of the best movies I own!	2003-06-21	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2F5PAC9I5SCG6	Ernest Jagger	When I first heard about this film I really wasn't interested. I thought the film was about an underground fight club. But it was more than that. This film is without a doubt one of the most stylistic and smart films I have seen, and is definetly Edward Norton's best film. Norton, who narrates the film has a dead-end job and an unfulfilling life. As he see's it, his life is one of a drab-consumer-oriented-yuppy trying to keep up with the american dream: such as acquiring as many material possessions as possible through his unrelenting purchase of consumer goods. This will make him happy right? Wrong, it only makes him despise himself and others like him all the more. There is an anti-consumerism message being played out here in Norton's pysche. And thus, an insomniac is born.Enter Norton's alter-ego Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who gives an equally impressive acting performace. I must admit, the film took me totally by surprise. As for the violence in the film, it is only a means to an end in telling the story. The fight club itself is not the main idea behind the film, only a vehicle for advancing the film. It's the mental breakdown of Norton, and his split personalities that I found totally original in the film, and how this is brought to a conclusion that floored me. The ending of the film is one of the best I have ever seen--and especially with the music of the Pixies blaring away as the building's are collapsing. A great film, and highly recommended.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1VWS0LNBVPJZ	"E. Torices ""E-Dub"""	Fight Club is regarded by some as one of the greatest films of Norton & Pitt's careers. Many of us have been impatiently awaiting for the high definition release. Now that I finally own it; here are my impressions:First, the packaging is by far one of the most beautiful...yes, I said beautiful, slip covers I have ever seen. It's really neat because it also flips open to reveal more art. The menu has a nice gag placed by David Fincher. Rest assured, you do not have a defective disc, rather a nice gag thrown in there. The picture quality is noticeably far superior than the DVD version without losing it's gritty look and feel. The sound is also very impressive and far superior than the DVD version. I highly recommend upgrading to this version if you own the DVD; if you don't, then by all means, this would make an ideal first entry into the movie.	5.0	Finally, An HD version of one of the greatest films...	2009-11-21	1	0	1

Ed Norton and Brad Pitt have such a chemistry, it's amazing. Two incredible actors together in one of the most twisted, yet awesome story lines. This is one of those movies that you either love, or you hate. Many times throughout this movie you don't know what's going on.

I first saw it on pay-per-view a few years ago, and found it so interesting that I watched it three times that day. I've never done that before, and haven't since.I like the fact that the movie has so many layers. Its &quot;in your face&quot; but its also subtle.  I'm watching it again and after about the 8th time, I still see details and nuances that I've missed before - but not because I haven't noticed them in a &quot;oh gee, look at that&quot; kind of way. I missed them because they were intentionally MADE hard to see. Difficult to understand? Not really, more in the way of &quot;I've never seen that in a movie before so it can't be happening now&quot; kind of way. Except in this movie, it IS being shown that way.Lots and lots of scenes,  situations, and dialog are just plain unexpected. Off the wall, yes. But also (I hate to use this word because it sounds so &quot;film-class 101&quot;) profound. Yes, this movie has profound moments.If you've become addicted to this movie like I have, you have your own favorite moments in the movie, and these define you and your character at times.I like the way contrasting views on so many topics are expressed by the &quot;dual starring personalities&quot;. The twist of just who these people Really are, well that remains there in the background, tweaking your brain cells. Tweaking MY brain cells, anyway.If another movie supplants this one as my favorite, I'll return to this forum and alter my story, but otherwise, I'm sticking to it.	5.0	a study in contrasts	2004-05-29	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A33TY0UEC0SYB3	Exodus	Edward Norton and Brad Pitt combine to make one spectacular half of a movie.  However, toward the end, David Fincher's movie becomes a blur.  This movie based on Chuck Palahnuik's &quot;Fight Club&quot; demonstrates the decay of society in present times by focusing on a depressed man searching for meaning in his life.  Jack and Tyler Durden are superb characters that everyone can relate to in one respect or another.  Yet, the latter half of the title begins to fall apart.  If Fincher stuck to the novel's ending, Fight Club would have made much more sense.The new additions to the DVD shows exactly what a DVD should offer.  New commentary, deleted scenes, and other features are given in the supplemental disc, and they are all great.  If you appreciated Fight Club and what it had to offer, despite the unfortunate ending, this DVD is a must-have.	5.0	Social Decay at Its Best	2000-12-29	1	1	0

He was at a  meeting so while bleeding I watched this D.V.D.(DEGRADATION, VIOLENCE AND  DEATH).  As I watched I think that the film was mostly about men getting  chummy. Now normally I like to see women getting chummy by this was good  because of the grotesque violence the enaraptured the violence thus  realeasing the pus of the society within.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1X4P6CN08U57A	FicktionPhotography	The movie that put Chuck Palahniuk on the map in literature and forced Edward Norton up into the spotlight.  Brad Pitt was, by far, already spotlighted by the late 90s, but Edward Norton had yet to have a role that really put him into America's consciousness.  This movie did it all.  Based off of Chuck's book by the same title, Fight Club is a masterful blend of action, thrill, psychology, romance, comedy, and critique on American consumerism and what it does to those of us that can't seem to break our norms.The narrator, only referred to lightly as Jack, has a problem with insomnia, works at a terrible job, and peppers his life with useless material goods.  All of that comes crashing down when he meets Tyler, played by Brad Pitt.  A suave, cool cat that seems to have an answer for everything, Tyler ushers Jack into a whirlwind of mayhem that all starts with the creation of soap and ends with explosives.  Tyler upsets the established order of life, lives as a minimalist, yet dreams large enough to think about changing the world even though he is, for all intents and purposes, a nobody.  He is about living life and not squandering it, about making a sub-culture of dreams out of the mindless drones of America, and striking fear into an order run by bureaucrats who are more concerned about their money than about the livelihood of the most important thing in life: life itself.A fantastic movie for all who just want to wake up and smell the nitroglycerin.

So it's better to die young, when there's still time left to recover and live again.""That pretty much captures the theme of Fight Club, a film about a man with insomnia who sleepwalks through his empty life and well-furnished condo until he meets a stranger who tries to empty his life of fear and regret and fill it with purpose.Sounds serious. But it's also pretty funny in parts.I didn't see this movie when it first came out, as I thought it  would be an empty-headed violent testosterone-driven film.

If you think this is some best of the best street fighter type movie, you're wrong. There are actually only a few fight scenes in the entire movie, although they do get pretty brutal. This is really more a film about the human condition, and mind. What makes us tick. Why we do what we do, and the absurdity of it all. The cultist sheepish mentality in which we live our lives.Ed Norton's narrative in this movie is truly hypnotic, as are the visuals. It's a well written, well acted, beautifully filmed thought provoking movie. I totally disagree with the movies leftist and violent anti-establishment message, but I throughly enjoyed the movie nonetheless. There are a lot of thought provoking comments and moments in the movie that might just make you rethink certain elements and behaviors in your own life.It's an interesting look at how we perceive ourselves, how we cope, what we value, and what we disregard. All of the characters in this movie are heavily flawed people.The plot jumps around a bit and some of the story elements of the movie are a bit tough to swallow including the major plot twist of the movie. Overall, This is a very unique movie, and well worth seeing. I always notice ""cigarette burns"" at the theaters now.The irony of this review and all the other others here, is that Tyler, one the main characters in the movie, would probably ridicule me for writing this review and you for wasting your time reading it. Honestly is anybody reading this review not seen the movie? People may read reviews about equipment and electronics before purchasing, but I seriously doubt most people come here to read a review of a DVD before buying. And more to the point, what you do you care what I think? Your life is ending one minute at a time and you are wasting it reading my review. Watch the movie and decide for yourself. Or don't."	4.0	We work jobs we hate, so we can buy stuff we don't need	2009-07-22	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2YERZIIW4HRSB	"""flamefire"""	Fight Club&quot; an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the &quot;Choose life,&quot; anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of  &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme  -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of  risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton)  is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his  job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his  IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing  with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape  from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham  Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his  routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic  soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy  lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two  men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first,  it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a  bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and  satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are  desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting  wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and  pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it  becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just  organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark,  pessimistic worldview of &quot;Seven&quot; and married it with the clever  plot twists and turns of &quot;The Game&quot; and assembled his strongest  effort to date. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a $50+ million studio film that  remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message --  right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes &quot;Fight  Club&quot; a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate  message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in  interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its  structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an  incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place  like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead  stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that  completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything  together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is  the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the  A+B+C formula? &quot;Fight Club&quot; openly rejects this tired, clearly  outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze  frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only  reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been  greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the  project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only  choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with &quot;Kalifornia&quot; and  &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;, Pitt grunges himself down and disappears  completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many  of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess  that'll surely have the &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; fans running for  the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the  simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the  flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek  yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the  last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly  our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry  observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They  are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world  which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the  notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what &quot;Fight  Club&quot; tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it  challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a  materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, &quot;win.&quot; I  think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate  monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we  really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation  through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that  makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; a dangerously brilliant film that entertains  as well as enlightens.	5.0	Entertaining &amp; Enlightening	2000-05-18	36	29	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2KW2KWKABNYNO	"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We..."	"Oh the movie males of the 1999/2000. Neo from The Matrix, Lester Burnham from American Beauty, Peter Gibbons from Office Space, The Narrator from Fight Club, Patrick Bateman of American Psycho. All of these men have the same thing in common. At the start of their respective movies, they're living in their own personal hell and are facing crises that must be remedied. Neo finds the Matrix, Lester finds beauty in the world, Peter steals from his company, while The Narrator & Patrick turn to more primal methods of coping. Sometimes the cause from these crises is due to consumerism, but it is often brought on by familiarity, which of course breeds contempt.Fight Club & American Psycho are the perfect companions for each other however, as they both contain all the above themes, and both deal with primal remedies that deal with madness and insanity in a world that inevitably breeds madness and insanity. American Psycho deals with the 80s, and how the Yuppie culture essentially created a bunch of consumerist clones. Fight Club deals with the late 90s/00s and how society has essentially made us into a bunch of wimps due to our lack of societal hardships to rise against. Where American Psycho leaves off, Fight Club takes and runs with. For the purposes of this review however, we shall analyse Fight Club.The Narrator is caught in a world of familiarity. He travels and gets to see America, but it's all the same to him. He works for a terrible and probably selfish company, and when he's in an office environment, it's soul-sucking. As a result, he can't sleep, and his lack of sleep is a reflection of his life's familiarity, and this familiarity starts breeding contempt, so he starts attending support groups so he can let his emotions through tears. And for a year, this actually work, and it probably would have kept working too if it hadn't been for Marla. Truly, Marla Singer set into motion the events of the rest of the movie because without her, The Narrator is perfectly content to cry his frustrations and emotions away. But since she is a distraction, his life is messed up again, so he takes the philosophical route. In the moment, right after the line ""If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?,"" Tyler Durden appears. Bingo. The Narrator has just found the ultimate form of societal rebellion.You see, The Narrator/Tyler Durden sees society as a bunch of wimpy zombies. Rendered numb by society. Wondering around because they don't know what else to do. They take the easy path because it's the only path they've ever been on. The rebellion starts out small at first, with fighting. Then it turns into guerilla terrorism. But then, it all goes to hell. At some point, something went wrong. ""His Name is Robert Paulson."" Those are the words that send a wake-up call to The Narrator. Something has gone horribly wrong. He's been working for a way to free society from being zombies, yet he's created an ultimate army of zombies. The first rule of Fight Club is to never talk about Fight Club, yet everywhere he goes, everybody knows about Fight Club. Tyler Durden is just a name. A figment of an imagination. A shadowy figure that was born and resides only in legend. Thus, as The Narrator stands holding hands with Marla, watching the improbable financial collapse of America, there's no redemption except for death. He's gone on a journey to escape his own personal hell only to create another one, even more personal than the last, even worse because it's of his own doing. He can kill Tyler Durden, but Tyler Durden still lives on in all that's been created. There's no way to dissolve Project Mayhem. There's no way to stop the financial collapse. There's no way to live with himself. This is the cautionary tale of Fight Club. The tale of a man so numb, he took punches just to feel something, and wanted the rest of the world to be free. But with freedom comes a price, and a price that defeats the freedom in first place.The story is well-put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put-together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought-provoking, Fight Club is a quasi-modern masterpiece."	5.0	I Am Jack's In-Depth & Glorious Review of Fight Club	2010-09-12	3	3	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	"`Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate  imbalance with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far  side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and  charismatic.  Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and  parasitic girl friend.`Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious  elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single  imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.  We have elements of gang  behavior, cultism, anarchy, terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the  name of iconoclasm.  Exciting, seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool  and hip!So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to  everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and  technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at  social satire, while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against  consumerism as the theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume  your film.At what point does a film cross the line between art and  depravity?  `Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the  question.  If art is a reflection of a society's culture and values, then  when I look at this film I have to be frightened at what is staring back at  me.  When I reflect on some of the most popular films of the last five  years, I can't help but notice the accelerating celebration of random and  impulsive violence, depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  `Fight Club'  has pushed the envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say  nadir) in the portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal  dissolution.It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to  attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  `Fight Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of  such cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always  seems to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live  ""naturally"" (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is  you whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those  who extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously  promote and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem  are much less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air  conditioned comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at  Columbine High School.I like dark movies as much or more than the next  guy, but this film simply goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with  criticizing the establishment.  Constructive criticism is the only way to  bring about progressive change.  But this film is merely vulgar cynicism  that suggests that mayhem is preferable to imperfect culture.  That is  grossly irresponsible.So I am placed in the paradoxical position of  admiring this film while I must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand  in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.  But as a human being  concerned with the greater good of the species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the name of entertainment?  Are we so  myopic as to demand entertainment at any cost?  I guess we will see when  someone raises the ante and the next shock treatment comes to a theater  near you."	5.0	Brutal and raw	2000-06-10	49	24	25

I've watched it many times because its such an incredible journey into the lives of some very interesting people.  I think you have to just sit there, keep your mind open to really get the full effect of this movie.  Once you do, it stays with you long after its over.  I remember the film ending and just sitting for a second thinking &quot;Wow, that was incredible.&quot;The characters are all brilliantly acted.  The story is one that will become a classic.  Its the story of a seemingly ordinary young man who hooks up with the enigmatic Tyler Durden.  Together they start the fight club, a club full of guys who beat the crud out of each other.  Helena Bonham Carter is great in this film because she plays a rather strange and deranged young woman so well.  All three of the actors makes this film so great.  I think Ed Norton is one of the best new actors to hit the screen in years.  His portrayal of this mad character was superb.  It really makes you see another side of life and it makes you see civilization in a way that few films do.  Its violent but done in a way that is just incredible.Some reviewer said watching it was like an acid trip and I agree. Its a weird, ultra-violent world that just might lurk under the surface of any city we live in.  Its madness, chaos and a wild trip into a frightening subculture.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3OY68WXYQ4GOF	"""franksoprano"""	Misunderstood by many critics and despised by a good portion of the viewing public upon it's initial release, David Fincher's film of Chuck Palahniuk's novel &quot;Fight Club,&quot; remains of one of the best films of the 90's and one of the hippest, most subersive movies in recent memory.Brilliantly acted and directed (Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham-Carter are masterful), &quot;Fight Club&quot; could be the ulmtimate male-fantasy movie.What man with any intelligence and creativity doesn't have an alter ego somewhere who's better looking, more intelligent and tougher than he? And, most importantly, irresistable to women...&quot;Fight Club&quot; take this concept to an extreme level and emerges as one of the funniest black comedies in decades.What remains amazing to me is the idea that someone (in this case,David Fincher) read the novel and actually said to themselves &quot;hey this would make a great movie&quot;This 2 disc DVD edition does &quot;Fight Club&quot; justice, containing commentaries by Pitt, Norton, Carter and Fincher, extended and deleted scenes, storyboards and a host of publicity material.&quot;Fight Club,&quot; by any reasonable standards is a great film and hats off to Fox Home Video for giving its fans a DVD that's worthy of the material.	5.0	&quot;I Am Jack's Sensational DVD Package!&quot;	2001-08-05	5	4	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1VGC8GCN8PI1	"Franky ""Franky"""	This is definitely the most amazing movie I have ever seen, period. Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt put on great performances. I don't think I need to give a quick summary- plenty of others have done so already. The movie basically takes on what the results might be of our corporate society, and looks at a sort of anarchist club. The movie poses a lot of questions, and certainly is one of the most thought-provoking and gripping films I have seen in a long time. I didn't find the violence excessive at all, honestly. There was plenty, but I've seen a lot worse. Some people seem to think that this movie takes on rich white guys that are depressed- but I think it has little to do with race- more to do with the faceless corporate drones that are grown and produced in our society, and the problems with the mass conformity spawned by this. The movie does not glorify fighting or anything else- the fighting was a way for the men to feel alive, just feel after being numbed by corporate america. I think that many people did not wuite understand the message of the movie- rather, they picked on the themes of fighting and masculinity, while not understanding their purposes in the movie. Fight Club is a fantastic film, worth many viewings.	5.0	Stunning...	2002-07-04	0	0	0

This movie is meant to be a social satire, supposed to make us think about our society. What we own owns us, not the other way around. Corporate America controls our lives. These are true messages, ones that I couldn't agree more with. The problem is, you can't degrade corporate America when you ARE corporate America. The great message in this film loses it's genuity when the movie is so hypocritical. 21st Century Fox produced this movie to make money, which is everything that this movie opposed.

If you liked the film though you should absolutely pick up the two disk dvd.Many films released these days are just rushed to dvd and do so little to take advantage of everything that a dvd can do.  Not so with Fight Club.  Not only do you get a large selection of truly interesting commentaries by the stars, David Fincher, Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the novel Fight Club), and others on the first disk, you also get an entire second disk full of features.  You pay a little more for this second disk but believe me, it is worth every penny.  It contains music videos, internet and tv spots from the advertising campaign for Fight Club (nearly all of which I missed the first time around and some of which are downright hilarious), the presskit (also hilarious), a long interview with Edward Norton, deleted scenes, explanations of the subtle and efffective special effects, and more!  With the commentaries and all the other extra features there is at least another dozen fresh hours of entertainment and insight into the film.The bottom line is this: If you liked the film, Fight Club, then the dvd will be a crown jewel in your collection.	5.0	Sets the standards for dvds	2002-07-26	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ANWX7804VMEQB	Garber Jackal	From the opening sequence traveling through the inner workings of Edward Norton's neural system it's clear that director David Fincher wants to assault your senses with 'Fight Club'. He throws in everything including a few kitchen sinks so that by the end of his film you'll want to take the ride again. He doesn't care that some aspects don't quite make that much sense or that the main character Tyler Durden has a viewpoint that some would call fasscist. He wants you to think about 'Fight Club'...but not until the last (and very vivid) frame is over.Edward Norton plays Jack - a depressed business man stuck in a nine to five job and hating every second of his miserable existance. So much so that he cannot sleep a wink. He stumbles into the world of support groups (namely testicular cancer) and begins to feel better about himself; he is finally able to sleep. That is until a chain-smoking, pill-popper Marla comes in with the same plan of crashing support groups. His lie reflects his lie. After meeting an eccentric soap salesman by the name of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) the two decide to unleash their aggrevation with the world by beating each other up - and loving it.From the opening scene Fight Club is full of ideas and principles and logic. Half-way through many of those ideas have either meshed together to form something greater or collided with a bang/thud - and still formed something more substantial. By the end of the film we're in chaos. The ideas still make sense but we're so immersed in the story of Jack and Tyler that we can't stop and think about all this logic. This is not a bad thing. In fact, it's a great thing.By the second half of the film you are no longer allowed to have a breath of fresh air. There are no moments of release where you will think that one character is going to be okay. David Fincher hands over the controls to Tyler Durden and we strap ourselves in.Fight Club is brilliant and the critics never gave it the respect it deserved. Not only is the film full of ideas, but it's extremely well acted by the entire cast, offers some breathtaking imagery (much of which is CGI but rarely noticeable), and startling and frank scenes of violence and uncontrolled mayhem. In many films that would be a detractor; Fight Club goes overboard with every element but at the same time manages to pull it off perfectly. Kudos to David Fincher for assaulting us - nobody could have done it so well.	5.0	If this is your first time at Fight Club...	2005-08-26	4	3	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3M5O6UHXO9IBU	Gary	Fun [stuff] about a man whose job is so immoral, he goes insane. Overlong, it lurches unevenly from Tex Avery slapstick to glib superficiality to the inspired, often in one scene. At it's best it resonates the observational rapping of best stand up comedy and it's brilliant sense of humour makes one forgive it's missed opportunities. Anyone recalling the abandoned six army of Germany at Stalingrad will find the absurdity, cruelty and farce of Fascism portrayed here as on the money. However, far from being a contemporary tract, it cheekily re-packages punk for those who missed it the first time while making oldsters nostalgic for their pogo-ing past. The central conceit of the film slyly changing the jobless 'no future' ethos of 77 to the 'no future' because we've got a job whingeing of 99. There's chutzpah for you, but it's still the same old, same old. The dyed spiked hair and anarchist posturings of Tyler Durden recalling you-know-who of the Sex Pistols. Also, the pantheist vision of a weed infested superhighway with people growing vegetables coupled with a socialist manifesto of returning to economic parity recalls the accusation of the time that punks were in fact the new hippies. It's questionable whether any victim of recent downsizing in the go-slow-bust technologies industries will relate to the protaganist's security of tenure and perks anyway, it's something of a chimera on Palahniuk's part. He has gone on to write further preposterous novels to mixed reviews and some disillusionment over his one trick pony-ism. That's probably why Fight Club, although superlative and engaging because it is hard to catogorise, doesn't stand up to too many repeat viewings. It suffers the same affliction as punk, that is, beyond the initial expression of frustration and anger there isn't a lot to say. Americans can only sing the one song, but they'll play it in hell, and seldom with the panache here.	4.0	An audience picture, not suited to DVD	2001-07-24	4	1	3

This is a true 21st. century masterpiece, not only because of the shockingly realistic violence, but  also because of it's philosophy etc. It actually features many of the best  sides of my favorite movies; the society critization of &quot;Falling  Down&quot;, the violent descriptions of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, the  psychologic elements of &quot;The Shining&quot; of &quot;One Fllew Over The  Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, the negative effects of power from &quot;Citizen  Kane&quot; and the stunningly brilliant humor of the Coen bros. movies.  This is a true masterpiece, wich should be rated as one of the most  important social movies to date. Plus; the soundtrack is excellent, Edward  Norton and Helena Bonham Carter are especially impressive, and the  photography is high quality.

I was deeply irritated that it wasn't at LEAST nominated for best picture and that Edward Norton wasn't nominated for Best Actor. Fight Club deserved to beat out American Beauty (which was  also great, don't get me wrong...) in both those catagories.  The  cinematography and effects are also very well done and contrary to popular  opinion (those who haven't seen the movie) the movie is NOT at all bloody  or terribly violent though there are 3 or 4 fights that last about a minute  if not less...

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15LIHVIEGAOUQ	Gavin Peach	During the last year there have been 2 films that have really caught my eye 'American Beauty ' and 'Fight Club'. The film was misunderstood by many who could not understand that the violence wasn't there to entertain, but  there to show the dark side of society.  But for me the fantastic shots,  complex storyline, satire and humour make it a classic. Although it is not  identical the film reminds me of a updated 90s version of 'A Clockwork  Orange' ,which shows how society is destroying itself. This is a must buy  item, and I seriously reccommend it to any open minded people who haven't  seen it already.	5.0	Absolutely Brilliant	2000-03-14	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A342AZPTC0QE57	Gaz	First glance... surely it's a dumb Brad Pitt movie, lots of action, lots of Brad... surely.No. Once I was convinced to watch it, I was pleased to see Edward Norton was involved. I remember watching Primal Fear and hating it, but Edward Norton's performance was awe-inspiring. Here he is doing it again.I'll break the film down. The visuals. A good to look at film, with tons of speedy direction from David Fincher (the guy who brought us Seven... for which we should be very thankful) with lots of cutting and some hefty decent special effects. The story. A work of genius, what begins as a simple little action thing develops into themes of terrorism, hatred of society and ultimately insanity. It really is a smart film, with tons of decent dialogue and a truly knock-you-off-your-feet ending, which you will have the hardest time guessing.But the best thing about the film is the two lead performances. Edwards Norton's paranoid, exhausted narration is fantastic to listen to, and it's wonderful to have a film centre around such a neurotic guy. Brad Pitt is fabulous as Tyler, literally a personification of rebellion and freedom.It's a work of genius, a visual treat, and a mind-bender if you're not paying attention... so do yourself a favour and listen to what's going on. It'll be worth it.	5.0	Don't judge quickly	2002-09-29	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AGMI06Z7JDCL6	GeneH	"There is a lot of ""tongue in cheek"" in Fight Club.  Is it a commentary, a love story, a cry for help or just pulling your leg?  All three?There are many dialectical strains in fight club; feminism versus Green anti-consumerism, passive ""metrosexuality"" versus troglodyte violence, an almost Luddite repudiation of modern life versus the use of Mind Control strategies to build a ""movement"". Plus a very confused view of self improvement.Moderation, self awareness, goal seeking, focus, and adopting healthy male models of behavior?  Breaking free of malignant anti-male feminism while embracing the good of the feminist movement that emphasizes that women are not property?  No.In a sense you laugh along, in another you wonder who they're really making fun of here.Ironies abound as well, a Doctor who refuses to prescribe sleep medication and instead prescribes ""exercise and valerian root"", to black humor about automobile accidents to the female antagonist's dissolution that seems to parallel the main character's search for himself.  Not to mention what Tyler does to the Clam Chowder or what he splices into family movies.One should not take this movie too seriously.  There are self help groups which endorse Fight Club, both the movie and book, as a sort of totem for masculinity.  Fight Club lampoons such groups too.As for the acting; pretty good.  Brad Pitt is having fun.  Ed Norton is having fun.  Meat Loaf is probably having fun but not as much as fun as in ""Rocky Horror Picture show"".  The cinematography is wonderful, as is the sense of gritty dispair.The soundtrack is quite good too.Fight Club is a fine movie, just don't take it too seriously.Gene"	5.0	Don't take it too seriously	2006-07-03	9	7	2

Well, let me start with: &quot;I have never read the book.&quot; That having been said, this movie is one of the my favorite movies ever, and it's a pity that it wasn't given a better reception by critics and fans alike when it came out.From a strictly filmmaking point of view, Fight Club uses a variety of interesting storytelling tehcniques that help build the story, and carry the unreality of what we're seeing. The ending makes you want to go back and see it again, just to figure out what you missed, and yes, it does all fit together when you watch again, in fact it fits in so well, you're amazed you didn't see the ending coming.As for the DVD itself, it's impeccable. The video transfer is damn near perfect.. if you think you see blotches on the screen every once in a while, look again.. trust me! :) The colors are a bit dark, but is done intentionally, and helps keep the mood. The sound is unreal.. you don't just listen to it, you immerse yourself in it, letting it surround you. Great use of all 5.1 channels.This DVD would be worth the price just for the movie itself... but, it's packed to the gills with extras features! Damn near information overload here... 4 seperate commentary tracks, deleted scenes, domestic, internationl and Internet trailers, hidden spoof catalogue, storyboards..the list goes on and on.People tend to either love Fight Club or hate it... but most everyone I know says it was a movie to think about, and that alone is reason enough to check it out. It is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in many years.	5.0	The most underrated movie ever made?	2001-06-06	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1FS9R0JXHLHEG	George Annessa	A real twisted, thought provoking, psychiatric thriller yet I cannot help being entertained by this movie. Both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton play their parts beautifully along with a comical, interesting script and some rather interesting facts and ideas.In every sense, 'Fight Club' excels. It's visually stunning, the cast is superb, the screenplay, directing, Fincher's fingertip touch of adapting the book, the novel itself; it's all a masterpiece and a brilliant observation of todays society and the struggles of defining yourself as a man. Fight club works in every way; as a clever, entertaining movie - as an important forum of discussion - as a remarkable music video etc etc.The first time I saw it, I felt weird, unsure of the movie's quality. It took me a few times to fully realize the meaning of this film, and when I did, I immediately bought it on DVD. Fight Club makes you think, and above all, makes you direct your thinking in ways you haven't previously thought.With a mind blowing conclusion, this film cannot get any better, but remember - you do not talk about Fight Club!	5.0	Free In All The Ways You Are Not...	2004-05-20	1	1	0

After watching this film many times over since my purchase, I can see why it caught on like it did.  For me, the combination of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt together in a film is amazing.  Both very solid actors that have proven they can hold their own, and carry others if needed.  Both played their own strong characters in this movie, as well as playing off one another with great timing and poise.The movie itself, is also amazing.  The ""Fight Club"" itself, is not what it seems, and at times you may realize this, but you'll never truly know until the end!  The directing is also as good as it gets.  One can tell a lot of caution was placed in constructing the story and how to go about telling it.I like this movie a lot, and as I mentioned, I do regret not seeing it sooner.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1B1I9A3U4MK1Z	George Conkwright	This movie is a Buddhist message.&quot;It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything.&quot;&quot;The things you own end up owning you.&quot;These messages dominate the movie.Forget about the point of a degrading society. This movie is about an individual letting go - including letting go of a society's standards. Letting go of what you think are your needs. This includes anything that you think is important - because it isn't. Believing in FREEDOM is supporting that which you hate as well as that which you love.When one can extend this message completely throughout his life - where no circumstance is inherently different from any other - then he is enlightened.To all the buddhists out there (I am not one) I caution you at seeking enlightenment. For a living, I create artificial intelligence simulations. My progressing understanding of what I may be and the way my awareness works has brought me increasing levels of depression. If there are those that think I have yet to learn, I caution them the same.Fight Club stands alone - in my mind the best movie ever made - (The Matrix, Star Wars and The Godfather were up there).  Much of this is due to its message but its presentation is first rate.Don't see it twice - see it 100 times. It is remarkably consistent, rich and if you give it a chance will change what you are.I've quit my job a long time ago - but I still go to that job.	5.0	best message ever in a movie	2001-04-20	1	0	1

The idea of two actors playing different sides of the hero's character hits you and  then the actors voice says &quot;This moment is called the turnover, when  the audience got the idea and they don't have any clue of what is going to  happen&quot;. even if you try, you can't get deep into all the nuances in  the first view, and you must see the movie again to get it right. In my  opinion the shock level reminds &quot;The sixth sense&quot;, but here it is  much more complicated, and better developed after the shock.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A17JB33WWOX2B0	G.M	Is this the best film ever made? Well, probobaly not, but it's definetely one of them.I saw this film a few years ago on a friends wide screen T.V. The mood was right. We were all alone for the whole night (The first time a bunch of us had had a sleepover without the unnessacery disadvantage of parents) and although it was a Sunday our minds were at ease since it was a holiday the next day and no school would follow. I swear by this film, the two hours and fifteen minutes before it began, I was to some extent a different person.I'm sure that it had lessons that were just around the corner for me anyway, but this just happened to be the way that I discovered them. (I was only 14).This film is not for stupid people. Although I'm sure that there is a hint of vanity in that comment I still mean every bit of it. If your into brand names and conformity then this film will do one of two things. Insult you beyond your wildest dreams to the extent were you will stop watching it and go around telling everyone what a crappy film it is (that makes you a stupid person) or it will open your eyes and make you think differently about life and opportunities all together.Don't get me wrong, It is possible that the film just won't do it for you. You may say it's stating the obvious, the point that it's trying to make is too vague and is not put across properly with a bunch of guys beating on each other night after night. And thats perfectly fine. If you didnt like it then you didnt like it. Just don't start telling people that it's crap when you know full well that it's not.Anyway, maybe I'm going a little over over the top with the whole life changing experience thing, but if you havent seen it then there's only one way to find out whether I am or not.I saw it for the twentieth time recently (Sad I know but that is during a period of over three years) and I'm still noticing new things. For example when Tyler checks his teeth after throwing Jack through the rearview mirror, that represents how thoughts such as vanity are slowly creeping back into him. No matter how far you go you will always come back to your old roots eventually. (There that's for all you people who say that it portrays nothing but that we should all give up on life and call it a day.)Like in so many of these reviews I'm beginning to ramble, so I'll finish by saying that if you havent seen it yet then do yourself a favour and get hold of it.And if it doesn't get you within the first five minutes, then you might as well turn it off.	5.0	Losing all hope was freedom!	2004-03-16	3	2	1

The society in which we live is very materialistic and we areraised believing that material possessions are essential to our survival and ourhappiness. Fight Club shows us the life of a man that lived exactly to this guideline for a perfect life and was unhappy and unable to feel anything as a result.He tried going to groups but that didn't last. His ended up with a new form oftherapy that he and his ""friend ""created. Fight Clubs became the escape ofthose who were lost in the desolate lives they were living. This was carriedeven farther developing into a terrorist organization bent on ""setting peoplefree."" There is a major plot twist u have to see to believe.Although there is a lot of violence in Fight Club, the message is that of nonviolence. We are shown the extreme of living a materialistic life and we areshown the extreme of living the anarchist life.  It is clear that despite thephilosophy that ""Tyler"" has taught the narrator, he quickly becomes a fascistleader running a terrorist organization. We are shown the destructiveness ofboth extremes. The message that the movie the author and the director aretrying to get across is not to follow leaders of any kind. Don't be a ""spacemonkey."" The narrator attempts to undo what Tyler had done. He figures outthat Tyler was wrong too, as was society and that he was going to have totake responsibility for what he had done. In order to be happy he would haveto live on his own and go his own direction.Although there are profound messages in Fight Club, it is clear that we arenot supposed to take it too seriously. There is an element of humor that isundeniable. From Bob, to the narrator beating himselfsenseless, we are brought from the grotesque violence to the hilariousnessof situations. Tyler the projectionist splicing single frames of porn into familyfilms, the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry, and saying things like""sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.""

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15XNT79BMHKXN	"googleit ""movie buff"""	First let me say that the opening few minutes of this movie blew me away - the opening credit sequence alone is almost reason enough to rent this movie.  And David Fincher definitely creates some of the most striking visual images you'll see on film. (But, as he proved in Alien 3, visual style alone doesn't make a good movie).  I especially liked when Norton was walking through the Ikea catalog that was his apartment.  Norton, Bonham-Carter, and especially Pitt give powerful perfomances.However, I found that this film amounted to less than the sum of its parts.  Get past all the violence, and the anti-consumer philosophy, and this movie is basically a satirical comedy about a depressed guy who's losing it.  And it's not very funny or entertaining.  None of the &quot;philosophical&quot; stuff in this movie is anything new, nor is it especially profound.  The idea of a programmed, white-collar drone who walks half-asleep through life has been addressed hundreds of times before, all the way back to &quot;Metropolis&quot; (or hell, even &quot;Joe vs. the Volcano&quot;).The messages are clear and not really very thought-provoking:  consumerism, advertising, and big business bad.  The comforts of modern society prevent us from feeling truly alive.  We become owned by the things we own.  Man has been turned into a self-help parody of himself by all the so-called &quot;men's movements&quot; that only aim to make man a more feminine version of himself.  Is any of this stuff really that deep or thought-provoking?  Have any of us not thought about this stuff until &quot;The Fight Club&quot;?The bottom line is that this movie is trying to be more than it is - had it focused on being simply a dark comedy, maybe it would have worked.  Instead, it tries so hard to be hip and subversive that it simply doesn't end up being very entertaining. Maybe this movie will appeal to angry young people who are fed up with &quot;the system&quot;.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A328S9RN3U5M68	Grady Harp	FIGHT CLUB is one of the most disturbing contemporary social summations ever drawn. Sort of a LORD OF THE FLIES for the 21st Century. It is with a sense of acknowledged regret to agree that the film is a wakeup call. This  is brilliant movie making and if you find the story, the acting, the  concept, the message just this side of nausea, then watch this DVD again  and again until you are able to accept the fact that this may by  apocalyptic.  Yes, it is over the top, but at times that is the only way to  get our numbed brains to come to attention.  This is a dark film,  incredibly well made and acted and photographed and directed.  Maybe now  that you can see it in the privacy of your home you'll feel more  comfoartable coming to grips with where we as a society could easily  go...if films like this didn't make us stop and think. And just when you  think you've fully explored the ugliness of the male psyche, run the last  minutes in stop frame motion and see the subliminal shots Fincher has  included that lambast our phobia of showing full frontal male nudity.  Terrific technique!	5.0	Where we are........unfortunately	2000-07-01	7	5	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A37975WRAR9MMB	"Gregg F ""im1wiley1"""	When this movie was in the theaters, I wrote it off as a stupid, testosterone-driven buddy movie. I figured at the end, Pitt and Norton would square off in a trite, Hollywood ending.After I finally rented it (and then immediately purchased it), I realized how badly I had misjudged this movie.First off--yes, it is violent in spots. But even if that stuff bothers you, I urge you to see it anyway. Without divulging too much of the plot, Fight Club is really more psychological than anything else. You actually need to see it more than once to appreciate the dialogue, the philosophies of the characters, and just how amazing and innovative some of the visual effects are.Just to give you a little insight--The plot, minus its twists, is pretty straight forward: A Yuppie whose name is never spoken in the film(Norton) meets a rebel named Tyler Durden (Pitt) who uses fighting as a means of self-exploration. Tyler is opposed to how soft society has become, and rejects material possessions in search of something more.Along the way, you'll be treated to some great one-liners, some twisted yet well-thought out philosophies, and some great acting by both Norton and Pitt.Everyone I've leant the DVD tells me this is the most bizarre film they've ever seen, and they loved every minute of it. I think you'll feel the same.	5.0	Not what you'd expect...much, much better!	2002-03-28	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3EHOL97NLH9W8	Greg Gray	This film may be many things...But it certainly isn't as violent as people like to make out, however it's a film that you're not likely to forget in hurry either.For anyone who appriecates the style of an independent  movie with a mainstream budget and cast, then this is right up your street.  One of the most entertaining things about Fight Club is the intelligent  well thought-out plot schematic although the basic story is fairly simple  to follow there are many questions that the plot opposes to the audience  and choices you have to decide between. Such as Black Comedy or Anarcistic  Art?, Dangerous or Enteraining?For me, Fight Club is not a truly  dangerous film, it doesen't seem to set any kind of harmful influencial  tone (whereas Natural Born Killers does and has done), this movie is  something very original and very refreshing. With unforgetable charaters  (Helena Bonham Carter gives a spectacular performance, that's slightly out  of her routine acting kitch), cruel but very funny situtions and grim set  pieces. Not to metion the wonderful camera rigs and innovative direction  from underated four-film wonder David Fincher.I strongly recommend that  you buy this without hesitation, it's a throughly  new take on 'Independent  movie making from Hollywood'.Congratulations Mr Fincher (You've done it  again)	5.0	NOT THAT VIOLENT, REALLY!	2000-02-24	18	14	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A34Q6R6MH75MZ9	Greg	Is David Fincher our generation's Hitchcock?  Time will tell, but with a triple crown of Se7en, The Game and now The Fight Club, he's making the case.  And he is, at least and certainly in terms of sheer audacity and  breathtaking filmmaking.  Fincher is a great supporter of new technology  and certainly the lavish care devoted to this DVD (packaging, sound/video  quality, extras galore) is fabulous, and even without all of this added,  great stuff, it's a film you'll return to again and again.  In the spirit  of Tyler Durden, though, why does Amazon have these stupid &quot;Was this  review helpful to you or not&quot; buttons?  (Read:  gee, I disagree with  this reviewer, therefore this review is not helpful).  What is this, the  vote for high school queen and king?  Do I care?

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A34ITGHFYKIRG2	Greg McClain	Fight Club is one of those rare movies you know that was not made at the right time to be a big hit at the box office. Society tells us we are not suppose to behave let alone enjoy the behavior of Brad Pitt or Edward Norton. The two start a underground fight club which turns into a bizare terrorist group aiming to blow up major credit card and credit reporting agencies. By meeting their mission everyone in sociey would then start all over at zero and we would all be equal - AGAIN! Who wouldn't suport and cheer for that? However, as the plot unfolds you are quick to notice Pitt is only a fantasy person of Norton's thought process. Bizare -yes. Different -thank goodness yes. Recommendation - you have to see this movie. If you ever wanted to be taken on a roller coaster ride of fantasy mixed in with maybe some hidden wishes this is your movie.	5.0	START TO FINISH PUNCH FILLED THRILLER	2001-08-13	3	0	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3HACSQO6Y6YOX	Greg Seupaul	This is entertainment at its finest: brilliant script, incredible performances, expert cinematography and skilful direction. Edward Norton is completely believable as your ordinary everyman who longs for something more than his cookie-cutter life. Brad Pitt delivers his usual strong performance, full of swagger and bravado, as the man who can (and will) change everything. This movie is not so much about fighting (though of course there's quite a bit of that) as it is about escapism, being someone you aren't or have always wanted to be. And believe me, in this film it's true - talk about a surprise ending! You won't see it coming, trust me. And DVD is truly the best way to appreciate this film. The four audio commentaries provide depth and detail - I recommend listening to the one featuring the director (David Fincher) and the principal actors (Norton, Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter). It's hilarious and makes you appreciate a lot of the subtleties of the film (and why Edward Norton dislikes those new VW Beetles). Disc 2 adds deleted scenes and alternate takes (with immediate comparison to the actual takes and notes explaining the choice), promotional materials (theatrical trailers, TV spots, even the mock PSAs done by Norton and Pitt), and some amazing &quot;making of&quot; footage with multiple-angle options. This one is a great addition to any DVD collection. PS: look out for a cameo by Live lead singer Ed Kowalczyk in one of the restaurant scenes, and try to spot the two subliminal images of Tyler Durden (Pitt's character) which are early clues to the surprise at the end.	5.0	A great film made greater on DVD	2001-03-19	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2UYAFQ40U2PHS	"Grigory's Girl ""GR"""	"I saw this in the theater, and I thought it was brilliant.  I got it right away.  I didn't like the last third of the film (the ""twist"" didn't really work for me), but the first 2/3rds of the film is amongst the best filmmaking I saw during the 90's (not a great decade for films).  Most critics were shocked by this film, saying it was inciting violence.  Roger Ebert, who has given thumbs up to such crap as Speed 2, Die Hard 3, and Con Air, and almost gave thumbs up to Gigli, disliked this film intensely, calling this a ""fascist"" film, which it totally isn't.  This is a film about the hollow lives of men during the ""booming"" 1990's, except this film really looks at them with a sharp wit and real, hilarious satire.  This is great satire, dripping with sarcasm and real irony, not the Gen X ""irony"" that permeated the decade.  The film also came out in 1999, the best year for films in that decade.  Pitt and Norton are superb in their roles, and Fincher's direction is very self assured.  Fincher is one of the more interesting and talented directors working today.  While he's not perfect (Panic Room and The Game were disappointing), Seven and Fight Club are masterpieces.  Harry Knowles was one of the few film critics to really get this film, saying ""it forces you to have dangerous thoughts, confront them as you would any problem before you and expects you as a reasonable human being to come out with the right answers"".  The film is not a simplistic, nihilisitic, punk type of film that says ""go out and destroy stuff"".  There is real brains behind this film (and its source material, the brilliant novel by Chuck Palahniuk), and there is depth here that was missing in the 1990's.  In many ways, the film exposes the slacker, BS Gen X aesthetic and shows how hollow that lifestyle is.  While it isn't perfect, the film's negatives are small compared to the huge positives it has.  Fight Club is a film awaiting true rediscovery..."	5.0	I'm gonna talk about Fight Club...	2007-04-24	8	6	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1MJS1YRKNMU04	Grrgoyl	When I saw Fight Club in the theater, I hated it. Although the movie started very promisingly, I felt the violence and machismo was gratuitous and nauseating, and the end made very little sense. When it came out to rent, though, something made me give it a second chance, and I watched the DVD. Simply based on the first half-hour of Fincher's commentary (all I had time for before it was due back) I bought it, and now it is my new favorite movie!The four commentaries are simply amazing, peeling back the layers of the movie like a big onion, revealing hundreds of beautiful little touches that are easily missed in a casual viewing. The solo Fincher track is engaging in its own right, but when you add Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter it really provides a well-rounded view of the relationship of the characters. The extras (on their own separate disc) are equally fascinating, covering special effects and CGI that appear so seamless I didn't even realize they WERE special effects. Even the packaging of the disc is entertaining, with the inclusion of mostly negative reviews of the film (not a very orthodox marketing ploy, yet very in keeping with the spirit of the film.)This disc is a must-have for any fans of the film, and even non-fans should rent it and get a whole new perspective on the movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A18WGT0CT1HXA1	"Guide_2_Strategy ""XLX2"""	Judging from the majority of reviews posted on this site, 'Fight Club' is a wickedly subversive piece of art that deserves to be canonized. According to their ridiculously linear perspective, it represents a cinematic blueprint that both established and emerging directors should aspire to.  Ahh, the sheer depth and plethora of Fincher's thematic exploration, the  philosophical implications of the script, the erudite dialogue that  provides the viewer with relevant insights into the nature of the operation  of modern day society and the psychological effects it has on the average  individual. However, if I'm rendered completely unable to dish out sarcasm  at an exponential rate by some mysterious twist of fate, the true nature of  this film will be revealed when said tendency ceases to exist. 'F.C' is  essentially a diluted collection of academic notions that have been around  for quite an extensive period of time. Marx who?  ...Okay, many films have been dealing with  significant themes such as modern day alienation, emotional 'vapidness' as  a consequence of unregulated capitalism, the on going search for identity  and purpose in life etc but `Fight Club' only SUPERFICIALLY deals with  these profoundly significant issues. Instead of focussing on a couple and  proceeding to `flesh to them out', Fincher and co unwisely decided to  baffle the average viewer by throwing heaps of ideas at them in the hope  the subject/s will leave the cinema pondering a few. The result is an  interesting, moderately audacious film that is challenging to a certain  extent, by virtue of its deceptively complex, not to mention slightly  incoherent, finale. Now while many of you ...  will no doubt  feel compelled to reach the conclusion that I `missed the point' or `didn't  get it', to you I present the following challenge: ... [can] you explain to me  how EVERY scene between Tyler and Norton supports the film's ending or is  simply a characterization device...?  Unless you possess a  method of elucidation that will forever remain elusive to the large  proportion of us simple folk, your arguments will be easy to undermine. The  movie is designed to perplex the viewer and many of the scenes leading up  to the big twist aren't necessary and therefore add reinforcement to my  opinion that the film's vision is skewed. You could argue `but they are  entertaining'. Sure but if this is the case, please don't try and pass this  film off as being an example of `profoundly intelligent film making'. For  the purpose of `clarifying' my intentions of this review, this is directed  at those who either take this movie relatively seriously or alternatively,  believe it's a cutting edge social satire. Recommendations: Social satire  with depth(BRAZIL), pertinent analysis of the modern human condition and  the search for a happier mode of existence (THE IDIOTS).Post scriptum:  'F.C' is a great film IMO.  However, most of the other reviewers have  already pointed out its merits so it would be redundant of me to add more  of the same.	4.0	Skewed vision of cultural emptiness..........	2000-06-17	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1QAMGOX6DWZGW	Guinevere Evans	"I've recently had to reogranize my movies into two sections: those I watched before ""Fight Club"" and those I watched after. To explain the profound effect the film has had on me would be herculean, but I will do my best. The movie's stinging social commentary and dark humor left me bemused, shocked, and waxing philisophical. For the story of ""Fight Club"" is not as simple as the title would imply. It is not a meaningless movie of underdogs and champions, nor is it a blood bath. It is a brilliant, blunt, and beautiful re-examination of all we've come to believe. Clearly, it is not a film to be watched for kicks on a Friday night; it should be saved for when one is in a serious mood. The story is captivating, thought-provoking, and--at times--hillarious. It does not give us a cookie-cutter moral, but rather, leaves the viewer to draw his own conclusions. With raw, believable, and unforgetable characters perfectly portrayed by actors including Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, ""Fight Club"" will shake you, shock you, and provide you with hope and a new look on life."	5.0	Fight Club	2006-03-19	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A26ZBMZ31KEBC0	guy montag	Do you remember what it was like long ago in the schoolyard when the writhing mob circled round you and the other kid...the fever that gripped you so strongly you wanted to roar and throw up all at once?  Some of us  flew into it and found a liberating maddening purity for brief moments.  Others cowered with lingering doubt and frustration haunting us afterward.  This movie takes me right back there on the schoolyard dirt...but  there is no other kid; there's just this idea coming at me with its fists  raised and there's nothing to do but face it or cower and resent.  This isn't about people fighting each other; Its about people fighting  themselves, which is beautifully portrayed by the schism of the narrator's  personality.  Norton's nameless narrator only becomes real at the end of  the film after fighting all the things that aren't real in his life,  including, ultimately, his own raging nihilism.  Seeing this film is like  getting in a fight.  The film challenges your mind to stand up and throw  down with some very disturbing ideas.  Take a moment to remember that  bloody, sweaty, dirt-yard of youth and the person that was born of it.  Now...go, experience this film and get ready to fight.	4.0	dirt and blood	2000-04-11	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A25FDX17O3QKLT	Hallstatt Prince	"Fight Club is one of the best movies made in the past five years if not the best.It is funny how when one's world view changes so does the perceptions of a work of art. And make no mistake this is a work of art. - high art.So I write this review in three parts, pre 9-11 (when I first saw it), immediately post 9-11 and my present reflections on the movies message.Fight Club was based on the short first novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Although the movie and the book are somewhat different some of the best lines in the movie come from the book. I think if you like the movie you will like the book and if you like the book you will like the movie.The movie met with mixed reviews, highly mixed reviews, and I am afraid not enough people (especially the right people) saw the movie. For that reason I will try not to give away too much about the relationship between the two main characters ""Jack"" and Tyler Durden.Parts of the film are violent but the  violence is not gratuitous. It is a movie for people who like to think and be challenged and entertained.This was a movie that was made with love as David Fincher has filled it with all sorts of visual details. The music by The Dust Brothers is exceptional and the lyric of the last song of the movie is very much in line with Buddhist teaching.The movie is part meditation, part social commentary, part action movie , part comedy (a strange mixture of the varieties of black and light comfortably coexisting,) part love story and from my perspective  a very hopeful film. I see the movie as being great art that is open to numerous interpretations. In a way it is somewhat of a cinematographic Rorschach test.The movie begins with the introduction of a character who is sometimes referred to as ""Jack"" (played by Edward Norton). Jack is clean cut buttoned down insomniac who works a boring job while accumulating trendy possessions (Fincher's special effects of bringing the Ikea catalogue to life is one of the things that brings a clever visual humor to this edgy comedy). Jack's insomnia is driving him over the brink while he continues to travel across the country from one city to another as a recall coordinator investigating (sometimes horrific) car accidents. After trying to obtain sedatives from a doctor the wisecracking physician instead recommends that Jack visit a cancer support group to understand what real pain is all about. This is our first inkling that ""Jack"" is on a spiritual journey. Jack not only gets comfort from participating in the support group (even though he is as healthy as a proverbial horse) he becomes addicted to support groups. In one he learns how to let loose and cry at another he participates in guided meditation. However his support groups are invaded by another healthy poser, Marla Singer (a role played to the hilt by Helena Bonham Carter). Marla's problems are slightly different from Jack's. She is a bored unemployed nihilist. The banter between Jack and Marla is priceless.On one of Jack's business trips he happens to meet Tyler Durden. Tyler is cool: he talks cool, he dresses cool and is probably everything poor clean cut Jack wished he was. They exchange business cards. But after returning from this particular flight Jack finds out that his condominium and all of his possession have been destroyed by fire. Not having anywhere else to turn he calls Tyler. They go out to a bar  and have a few drinks where Tyler begins to explain his offbeat and anarchistic philosophy of life. After leaving the bar at the request of Tyler they engage in a fight that both finds cathartic. Jack having no where else to go returns with Tyler to his dilapidated home. Together they form something called Fight Club an organization where individuals gather for bare knuckle brawls to not only take out their frustrations but reclaim a sense of being alive.A triangle forms between Jack, Tyler and Marlabut it is as much of a philosophical triangle as it is a love triangle.However Tyler's plans do not stop there, he has a larger vision of changing the world.Rather than Tyler coming across as a megalomanic he seems to symbolize the power of one individual in possession of a unique idea with the will to carry it out.---------Immediately after 9-11 this movie was hard to look at. Although in Fight Club through all of the mayhem, violence and vandalism only one person is killed in the movie but it also featured scenes of mass destruction. But I was not able to dismiss the movie after the events of 9-11 - it caused me to reflect more on the movie. Real art does this.What was the difference from the crazed terrorists that attacked America on 9-11 and Tyler Durden and his army of misfits who caused mass destruction that in the last frames of the movie looked eerily familiar to the attack on the WTC? Well for one thing I saw the destruction of physical structures as being symbolic for a fighting back of individuals who suffered a violence of the soulfrom the banality of modern culture. Further in this imaginary world of Fight Club things were destroyed but no one (except one of the Fight Club members) gets hurt. Finally it was the story of an entire generation of Americans rising up against hypocrisy - a far cry from a group of foreign invaders killing thousands of Americans and forcing their will on us. Still the scene of collapsing skyscrapers in NYCunfortunately takes on a whole new meaning in this post 9-11 world.--------Fight Club ReduxWhen you have a movie where grown men are beating the pulp  out of each other and sky scrapers collapse but  no one gets seriously hurt the violence cannot be taken seriously. So I see the violence being more of a symbol. Rather that Tyler being a Fascist like the vicious Islamo-terorrists that attacked us on 9-11 he is as American as apple pie. He is a man who against the odds helps to lead his generation out of the banality of their lives and restore the American dream. Tyler is a visionary and an idealist. He is not  a fascist who wants to imprison but an everyman who desires to liberate. In the end it is a hopeful movie.--------The movie is rated R and I agree with that rating if it is applied the way it is stated - no one under 17 unless accompanied by an adult. Ideally what is meant by that rating is that the said adult is  more than just a warm body that is over 21. The movie is violent but violence is not the point of the movie. So I guess I recommend the movie to thinking adolescents, adolescents accompanied by adults that possess a conscious and are able to communicate with a minor and of course adults themselves that are not psychopaths.  If you can't differentiate between reality and a movie don't see this movie.When I was a kid my friends and I were Three Stooges fans and we couldn't figure out why when you poked someone in the eye you wouldn't get that plunck of a violin string sound effect. If you still can't figure that out don't watch this movie. I am not sure if many will take this advice seriously in these days when children can graphically dismember the very real looking image of a human being in a video game. It's not for kids.A movie well worth seeing and owning.One more note.One of the nice things about owning the CD is being able to slow down the movie to see the subliminal frames placed in the film. Subliminal messages in movies is just another of the complex twists in this hilariously intelligent movie. The collector's edition has an additional disc and is well worth the few extra dollars."	5.0	The First Rule of Fight Club is that you Don't Talk About...	2005-04-27	12	9	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3B08DCVOC1BDI	"""halo1000"""	(you'll get the title after you see the movie) OK, first off, Fight Club isn't really about the fighting. That's not the focus of the movie. What it's really about is two guys who devise a plan to f**k up the system - support groups, gigantic corporations, purchasing things we don't need, celebrity status, etc.  Basically, the narrator (Edward Norton, whose character's name isn't given) is an insomniac with a fix for Swedish furniture. He's a businessman who's frequent traveling drives him insane. He goes to support groups for cancer, AIDS, etc. despite the fact that he has no disease. He then meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman. When the narrator's condo is blown up, he goes to live with Tyler, who basically has a grunge against current society, and the fight club spins out of control from there, and eventually evolves into something called Project Mayhem...The DVD's great. It's ironic, that, despite the subject of the movie, the second disc has just about every piece of promotional material that you could ever want or care to see. My favorites are of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton giving public service announcements. The first disc, in addition to the movie, has four commentary tracks, the most interesting being the one between Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter (it also explains why they had to beat up a Volkswagen Beetle...). There's some interesting deleted and alternate scenes, including one line Marla says that was quickly cut out, but after one viewing, you won't be surprised that these were cut out. There's also some stuff about how they made that house that you'll want to see afterwards.	5.0	I am Jack's movie review	2001-01-07	16	14	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A20NIXSDYYERFY	Hamid Thomson	I was looking to buy the film, having seen it many times before, and was stunned by the release date, 1999.  Although the film's prescience is perhaps better attributed to Chuck Palahniuk, it is still remarkable for the insights it provides into the psychology of the terrorists we face today. While the obvious parallel is to antiglobalization hooligans, the film more acutely explains the attractiveness of the bankrupt nihilism of Al Queda and similar groups.  The rage that fuels Fight Club is a product not of disenfranchisement but of disaffection.  So too the brain trust of Al Queda are not the downtrodden but rather aimless thrill seekers unable to find their place in a modern world consumed with consumption.  Even the jarring schizophrenic split that seems almost gratuitous on first viewing of the film makes sense, seems true, given the real world fight club of Sept 11 wherein men ostensibly of the modern world, educated and capable of productive lives, resort to acts of suicidal mass murder. Despite its brilliant psychological insights, I must leave off one star for its failure to provide a more tangible resolution.  Or perhaps George Bush is right, and the only way to bridge the divide is by means of the barrel of a gun.	4.0	How we wound up here	2003-07-03	8	1	7
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AYF76HQ10BL2J	Hamster Army	"Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, is an excellent adaption of his book. There are so many themes, feelings and human sensitivities touched upon it can be a bit overwhelming at first, making it a good film to watch more than once.The violence during the fight scenes were brutal at times and fairly disturbing. But it almost seemed necessary in order to immerse a person into the emotional state it put the character's in. Yet I can see where some of the younger, macho crowd might think it's ""cool, dude"" and associate the film's title with the fight scenes alone, making it worth their while...unfortunately.Ultimately Fight Club grows on you and creates sympathy for the characters in the film, moving you to cheer them on inside. Pitt and Norton were great choices for the cast leads.It's an interesting and thought provoking story, something you don't see much in film today honestly. It questions our values, family structures, religions, and touches our inner-demons.Death is a major part of the story, dealing with it, accepting it, and of course the waiters, clerks, cubicle slaves, security guards, beat cops and other servants of the rich find some meaning in life, something to look forward to and be proud of, outside of their dull, redundant, consuming, sitcom-watching lives, in a most bizarre fashion.The film has a little of everything; comedy, tragedy, drama, and suspense. If you are going to watch a film made in the last 3 years, watch Fight Club, highly recommended. There's simply too much to talk about in a simple review here, and most of it has been said already, but I wanted to give the film, and the story, it's props."	5.0	Provocative, thoughtful and compelling film	2002-02-20	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2YM2NM7YZA24Q	Haseeb	"This movie was recommended to me after it was released in the theators.  After watching the previews for it in the theators, I didn't think much of it, assuming that it was simply another piece of trash that hollywood puts out every year.  Little did I know that I would wind up ordering the video tape and thinking about the profound messages that it sent.  I think virtually everyone can relate to the main chracter regardless of income and social status.  The main theme of the film is that life is a constant struggle to discover who you really are.I think other reviewers have written quite enough on the film so I'll cut my review short.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1B350OHYHQTGX	Hassaan Abdeen	The director David Fincher has been very successful with his great two movies prior &quot;Fight Club&quot;, which are &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. He's known to go to extremes and manage to keep the suspense and thrill combined with a good story all through the movie. But this time he broke into a deep barrier and failed!First, the story of Fight Club doesn't make any sense or logic. And this was the same issue with his earlier two movies but back then he managed to pull the movie together with an amazing shocking ending. But here with Fight Club, I was hoping that the ending would make this movie makes sense but instead it was an insult to the viewers!Second, the twist of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in the last quarter of the movie... can't be swallowed easily because all through the movie (if you watch it back) nothing indicates that this can be valid!Third, the bodies of those club fighters were all skinny with little body modification. I haven't seen one person with real big body!!!Fourth, what is it to enjoy in this film? It is not entertaining, not logical, no suspense... etc.This movie can not be accepted with all audiences, it is either love it or H A T E it nothing in between! And I hate it!!!	1.0	You either love it or H A T E it!	2001-05-03	40	9	31

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AFS4RQ16EAKJ7	"""hetnor"""	Fight Club is a great movie!  A lot of people say that it is too violent and doesn't say anything!  Fight Club isn't that violent.  It only explores how people are feeling today.  Fight Club shows you excactly how a lot of  people feel.  Trapped in this impression that we have to buy that or have  this.  Also that people are way too stressed and one of the only ways to  release this is to actually hit somebody.  It is also very well acted  by Norton, Pitt, and Carter.  Norton delivers once again with a wonderful  portrayal of the nameless narrator.. Pitt is very good as the crazy Tyler.  It is defiantly a must see!	5.0	Great!	2000-04-30	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AL8IDHJPCE00K	H	Fight Club....so fresh when it came out, and still so. Man, the action, the comedy, the drama.....and so so so so well put together. Ed Norton has a very controlled, boringly normal, compulsively square life. Then he joins a fight club, and Brad Pitt (smokin hot in this movie...it had to be said) steps into his life. I don't want to give away any twists or turns, but I will just say that while a little violent, the movie is amazing to watch. It's so well acted, and adventerous, and like nothing else you'll see.	5.0	This movie kicks....	2007-06-16	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A38KB16DRKI8QW	High Duke	It was dissapointment all the mixed reviews this film got on its release. I think it was a victim of its own marketing actually. A lot of goombahs expected a movie about guys scrapping it out Van Damme style and then were disspointed that it was actually about screwing with people's perceptions of power and glory rather than power and glory itself. Ed Norton is perfect as a suit and tie guy who just gets sick of his mindless consumerism. He meets Tyler, played to perfection by Brad Pitt, who inspires him to take his life into his own hands and they begin exorcizing their own demons through cathartic underground fight clubs. Soon, they spawn a revolution...from there the movie begings its mind-play with the viewer. Freedom, loyalty, courage, anarchy, obsessiveness...all are explored here in their most extreme forms. I must say that Pitt was perfectly cast as the ego to Norton's id. Who doesn't wish they had the perfect appeal that Pitt embodies? You'll see what I mean after watching the flick. And be prepared to view it again and again. An underrated gem whose cult only grows bigger as the years go on.	5.0	One day it will be recognized as the classic that it is.	2003-10-01	10	8	2

There's no promise land for you to be safe.If your approach is merely superficial, even if you are a trivial person in the sense that Mircea Eliade defined like the absence of internal tension psiquis, then you better not assume the proposal.But if you really are sincerely and above all free of all kind of ancestral prejuices, welcome.This a very clever journey far beyond some life aspects you avoid talking in a conference, for instance, not even a social meeting. This films walks minute to minute on the knife's edge.It's deeply disturbing. It bothers you, it inquires you, it challenges without a minute of rest.What are the final reading this film proposes?It depends on you. Do you like William Blake? Then welcome to the fight club.Nietszche stated once that smart thought: Do you want to clim? Then don't fera the vertigo.That's what the film deals. A journey without restrictions. A movie just for free men.Brad Pitt shows once more his actoral gifts , and so well Norton and that nature's force this monumental and versatile actrass Helen Bonham Carter. No other actress in all the world was so adequate like her for that demanding role.David Fincher advanced far beyond his first attempt when he gave us Seven, and in a less better build script as The game with the amazing Sean Penn.Fincher is a weird director that has decided walk by unknown territories. Istvan Szabo , David Lynch , Taylor Hackford, Alvaro de la Iglesia, Cohen brothers, Kaurismaki brothers, Lars von Triers and Francis Ozon at this moment are the only directors who seem to have the force and the talent for following these dark passages.Watch this film with people able to make an intelligent discussion after.And remeber just once more, you must kill your inner dragons, because no one will make for you.

Of course one does wish more of it could be genuinely informative, but that doesn't stop the movie as a whole from being a beautiful work of art.  It's informed by Noir &amp; [eastern] philosophy, &amp; presents itself wonderfully with its own great new vision.  The voiceover allows for communication with the audience &amp; the internal poetry of the movie that otherwise would be awkward or impossible.  The way plot &amp; subplot explain themselves in first &amp; subsequent viewings is impeccable, offering so many different levels of madness.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1E11HKN4IRY09	Hogarth Hughes	This movie and its DVD rocks.  The film underwent pre-release bashing because of what money groveling, humorless, I wouldn't know art if it was hanging on a wall in front of me people expect from a Hollywood production these days.  Well, Fight Club is probably one of the best movies of all time.  It contains such a deliciously warped cleverness most mistake it for anything but what it really is; a dark comedy.  The performances are excellent from all cast members.  The direction absolutely perfect, the writing... every damn thing about Fight Club is right on the money.  The best thing about this film is the soul it has, for as much violent content as is shown the themes expressed are that of living and enjoying life.  What's cooler than that?  Not much I've seen in too many movies in the past couple of years.  The DVD is super-terific with cool packaging, tons of extras and state of the art sound/picture quality.  A great product all around, perfect for Jack's DVD collection.	5.0	Masterpiece Theater	2002-05-20	1	0	1

MEATLOAF is so REALLY, REALLY GOOD. The WRITING (script) and STORY is DELICIOUSLY COMPLEX and CLEVER. There is alot of VIOLENCE and alot of HUMOR. This movie is probably not for everyone (read the other reviews).The SPECIAL FEATURES are a must to WATCH. They are very INTERESTING and GREATLY ENHANCE the film.If you liked EDWARD NORTON in this movie. I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing him in PRIMAL FEAR with RICHARD GERE (who is very good). It is NORTON'S FIRST  movie and it IMMEDIATELY made him a STAR and won him an ACADEMY AWARD (1st movie!!). In PRIMAL FEAR (get the dvd with special features), he plays a character you will not soon forget!!! LIKE FIGHT CLUB--YIKES.	4.0	CAN'T SAY I LOVED IT, BUT I REALLY LIKED IT ALOT.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1KLNYFROE90OV	Howard Tuttleman... howardtuttleman@howardtut...	"My friend Lyle reccomended this movie to me one day during a conversation about big corporations like Starrbucks, and mass consumerism or something. He figured that this movie would somehow make me think more about that type of thing. So when it came down to it at the video store I had ""The Fight Club"" in one hand and ""Bad Boys 2"" in the other. I REALLY wanted to see Bad Boys 2 again, but as not to hurt Lyle's feelings I opted for ""The Fight Club"".Now judging by the name I figured it was something I could really sink my teeth into, considering how much I LOVE action in movies. Boy, was I only half right.It started out with confusing talking parts and didn't seem to go anywhere or make any sense. But man, when they made their Fight Club I suddenly tuned right in! He was like ""Punch me as hard as you can"" BAM! Right in the ear! Then they got more fighters and it was an all out brawl! As you can probably tell, these fight scenes were by far my favorite parts in the movie. However, there were far too many boring talking parts that were WAY over your average viewers head (even mine).So there I was, completely inspired to go out and make some action of my own, so I tried to start my own fight club, which I now kind of regret. I asked Lyle to be the honorary second member which he politely declined, so I called him a chicken, and where I come from that is NOT something you take lightly. But he ignored me anyways. I decided to make Morris my first member to fight. We just started out wrestling on the grass after I told him the rules, but I quickly stopped the fight when he tried to bite me, and it's just not fair to punch at a dog. I couldn't really blame him because dogs aren't that smart. I got frustrated so I took a direct cue from the movie and blasted our paperboy with the hose so he would fight me, but he ended up falling off his bike which somehow hurt his foot of all things. I decided it wouldn't have been a fair fight anyways. Anyways, my mom came out and started yelling at me. I told her I wasnt' allowed to talk about Fight Club, and she got really angry. When she finally went inside the house, I fought the mailbox. Then I went out back and fought her tomato garden. That was pretty much the end of the Fight Club because I got grounded shortly after this.Anyways, if I were you I would only get this DVD to fast forward to all the great fighting, skip all of the long talking parts, and all parts with the girl because they will bore you to death. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Tom Arnold is also in the movie, but he has a really big deformed chest. Whatever.In conclusion I guess I can't say I'm too proud to have tried to organize a fight club back then. I'm a couple years older now, and I guess I don't really want to fight people for real anymore. The people that make these movies may not realize it, but it can really get people like us worked up if they are trying to tell us that being in a violence gang is the way to live your life. Now, when my mom or dad or anyone else makes me mad, my new non-violent solution is to simply play my harmonica at them until my face turns red. It may sound silly, but it works and nobody gets hurt, AND it was reccommended to me by my doctor, who specializes in anger manegment.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A10KKIJ3TE8Y8Y	"""iamthethinman"""	Although this review is a little dated, since Entertainment Weekly has already named it the best DVD made, I must support that statement simply for the overall aesthetic value and staying true to the manic and subversive identity of the film.A misleading warning message that you can't pause begins the ride that takes you to a fitting menu format that matches the movie's style.  The movie itself is one of the best ever and the extras help bring it to legendary levels.  Deleted scenes and why they were deleted.  Actually, a ton of explainations that would impress anyone who thought about making movies.  More commentaries than your average DVD, the people involved in this movie are knowledgeable about the business and process involved with making this film and all seem to have enjoyed the experience.  The one with the stars talking is as entertaining as most things on TV.  And the internet promos &amp; PSAs &amp; behind the scenes &amp; text &amp; drawings make it a full volume of ready info on the movie.  Even the case it comes in fits the feel of the movie.  Plus, the makers are realistic - touching on the fact that many critics abhorred the violence in it when it was less violent than many 1 hour cop dramas.The movie itself is a plus for any home entertainment junkie.  With the film's subliminal Tyler sightings to frantic editing style to random imagery and blurred realities to dynamic bone breaking sound and viseral score - this is what makes you proud to see a movie on DVD.  It's a DVD that's made by people who love this movie and appreciate that you love it too.  And if you don't, they explain to you why they, and a huge cult following, think it's one of the best productions ever.This film is something all should watch.  Much is lost by people thinking superficially but the underlying conscience of the movie just makes sense.  Every scene, moment, line makes sense.  And once you see that this movie is about fighting - but not beating men down with fists, you get the understand that this is a deeply psychological film.  A thinker's film with a modern flow.  Man against the world.Look for the happy face.  And get this DVD - a must have.  Thanks.	5.0	The Best Movie DVD Overall	2001-05-24	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1KLBWSB9YZ6SX	Ian D.	Every once in a while, a movie comes along that smacks you right in the face - a film that shakes to the cores some of the basic assumptions by which we lead our lives. Fight Club is one such movie. David Fincher's brilliant adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel packs more philosophical punch than practically any big-budget Hollywood film around, and yet still manages to entertain on a superficial level thanks to brilliant performances by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham-Carter.Without going into any details about the movie and its message, I can say with certainty that Fight Club will strike a chord with many people (admittedly most of them male). Further, this movie is replete with memorable quotations, and would be worth purchasing for that reason alone. I remain awed by the sheer number of 21st century aphorisms contained in this movie's dialogue.Be forewarned, however, that not everyone will enjoy this movie. Some viewers will feel repulsed by the action, and some will either dislike the film's message or miss it entirely. However, if you want your movies to challenge you, then you mustn't miss Fight Club.	5.0	Ready to think?	2000-11-22	3	3	0

I did for Fight Club. 2 times in the theatre, every time it's on TV and finally I bought the Collector's Edition DVD, which I've watched twice so far.The movie is an intelligent view of what we have become as consumers. The fighting is a symbol for the anger that we have to deal with and keep inside every day. If someone told you that this movie sucks because it's about a bunch of people who are angry so they decided to create an underground fight club, ignore him/her.I won't spoil anything, but if you're the kind of person who is amazed by how people accept obvious ""insincerity"" and are happy with it, then this movie is for you. If you think it's stupid to spend your money on designer underwear then this is also a movie for you.If this movie was created in 2007 or 2008, I'm sure that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) would've been asking: Why is Paris Hilton famous?, Why would anyone waste time watching TMZ and eventually create a new breed of parasites that sticks to the ""celebrities"" and intrude their personal lives in order to satisfy the curiosity of the... mmmm.. I really don't know what to call anyone who's giving that much of attention to actors and singers whom according to the logic, they are here to entertain us, but somehow something happened and they've became the most important figures in the society and we are supposed to follow them as role models!

Disc one is the movie in all it's glory, with several commentaries that are very worth listening too. I truly enjoy the banter that goes on between Pitt and Fincher, similar to the commentary in &quot;Se7en&quot; (another stellar DVD...). The second disc is a varitable candy store for fans of this movie. As a girl, I was told that I was going to hate this movie, or like it just because of Brad Pitt shirtless (but in all honesty I am much more a Norton fan!), but I have proved them wrong. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a movie for a lost generation. The cast is stellar, the filming is dark and moody- perfect for the film, and the script translates the idea of the book to the screne admirably. The book, on that thought, is also really wonderful. Though the movie differs from the book slightly, if you enjoy one you'll undoubtably enjoy the other.

When I realized what was really going on I couldn't believe it and I had to watch the movie over again from my new perspective which made things all the more funny!  Some of the material was a bit graphic but very realistic and kept me believing that the fights were real and that what was happening could really happen and may actually be happening as well.  I loved Brad Pitts role in this movie and think that his character was chosen very nicely.  I also loved the character that Meatloaf played.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3E1IB4CGSA9IF	Ironandivory	An amazing story of the human subconscious in its yearning to break free from confinements of how one identifies self.  So much to where the mind creates alternative egos or realities.  This is a true example of existential struggles against all that we are force fed to be and the failures of never learning to let go of the material.  Violent in its stages of resolution, the rebirth he experiences is best understood by the abrupt transition from his apartment to the abandoned house.  The concept behind the spacemonkeys is like an exaggeration of our own selves as we exist each day.  Brilliant film, brilliant book.	5.0	Tyler Durden is my hero.	2013-06-13	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AYG5FJNB2MIZ7	"""iwasntlazyinmay"""	The first time I saw this movie was in my senior year of high school.  I'm a little bit older and wiser and after watching it over 100 times, I still find little intricate details that make the movie one of the best of all time.We are introduced to a so-called &quot;Fight Club&quot; with an overworked, underplayed insomniac, played by Edward Norton, and his spontaneous, hot, free living friend, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt.  They meet under crazy circumstances, on a plane where Tyler describes why people's faces are so calm on the flight safety cards, and they end on insane ones as well.  I can easily say that the movie does not have one bit of happy-go-lucky kind of scenes.  Even the music in the background, provided by the Dust Brothers, brings the darkness to this movie and the backdrop of the ultimate &quot;Fight Club.&quot;So what's in store when watching the movie?  Nothing but blank stares and confused minds.  Believe me, its confusing the first time.  However, that is the essence of &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  It keeps you watching more and more to understand what the hell David Fincher wanted to bring out from the movie and its characters.  The plots twists and turns are only the beginning to this insomniac's dream turned into a nightmare and how he escapes that reality is the best part of the film.Maybe you'll leave the TV with a bored mind or one that will start a Fight Club of your own.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15YLKRP7ESNWP	"Jack H. ""Roll Tide"""	The quintessential flick for anarchists, angry guys, or cult film lovers.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt team up to create an extraordinary film.  It is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for the extremely sensitive.The Narrator, Ed Norton, suffers from insomnia and finds his solution going to various support groups until he meets Marla Singer, Helena Bonham Carter, who upsets the balance that The Narrator has achieved.  Enter Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt, who solves The Narrator's housing, sleeping, pretty much all of his problems.  Once realizing what he's gotten himself into The Narrator has an entertaining journey of discovery which leads to the establishment of a new life.Fight Club is both entertainment and social commentary.  When Pitt's character Durden criticizes so many things taken for granted or thought of as necessities in modern society one has to wonder how far off the mark he really is.  The Spartan existence of Durden almost seems attractive when he explains how frivolous materialism has made humanity.If nothing else you will have an altered view the food industry.  And a distinct wonder of what you really can accomplish.All told this is a great film, with a fascinating if bizarre story.  The cast is perfect in brining the dysfunction of the world to the forefront of your mind.	5.0	Can I Get This In Cornflower Blue?	2009-01-02	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A11AG0PJ2YNSAV	Jackie Alphonse	There's a lot that can be said of Fight Club, first that it is not a movie for people who are perfectly content with society, or who frequently shop at IKEA or love their Starbucks.Fight Club is one of the few movies I've ever viewed that basically takes a look at our society, and tells you not only what is wrong and missing, but how to fix it.It's dark in a way that would make humanists cringe, and it's automatically going to make anyone in love with the modern world furious.It throws materialism in your face, taunts you with your own petty desires, and shows you the root of humanity, what it is to be human. It's not meant to be just a film, but a guide book to getting back to something that has nothing to do with what car you drive or how much money you have in your bank account.The message of Fight Club is, simply this: you are a willing slave.Then it asks: Do you want to change it?The problem with Fight Club is that it is hitting every single taboo of American society square in the face. This is precisely the reason there are many people who loathe it. It picks at every weakness unrelentingly, until the world as we know it is left permanently scarred and bleeding.Most people aren't even going to understand it, let alone appreciate it for what it is. It's satire against the people who believe that they cannot be laughed at or shown as weak.Hands down, my favorite movie of all time.	5.0	More than just a movie	2008-09-16	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R	Jackson Brown	Seven, The Game, Panic Room and Fight Club are each David Fincher's films. Fight Club and Seven stand out the most, The Game was fantastic, and Panic Room was certainly suspenseful. Fight Club was such a great role for Edward Norton. There was not a single scene that he was in where he didn't just draw me into his character completely. Brad Pitt's role was just plain fun, and Helena Bonham Carter was mysterious. Fight Club was an unforgettable film with unforgettable elements. This is certainly not something that kids should see, for its R rating reflects strong graphic brutal violence, language and some sexuality including prolonged sequences where moaning is heard throughout a house. As a whole, Fight Club is one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen and I strongly recommend it, especially for fans of anyone in the cast or of David Fincher.	5.0	Another David Fincher Masterpiece	2003-07-03	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ANI00381ZIMEW	Jacob G Corbin	"For a long time after seeing it, I found it difficult to put together a coherent opinion of FIGHT CLUB.  It so completely defied my every expectation that the collision between my preconceptions and what was actually there was catastrophic.  I could only blubber: ""gol-dang, that there moving picture shore was sumthin'.""Edward Norton, who's been a favorite of mine ever since the classic AMERICAN HISTORY X, stars as the nameless ""Narrator"" of the film, which is based - for the most part, faithfully - on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk.  His character is an anonymous Gen-X office drone who works as a recall coordinator for a major car manufacturer.  ""Which car manufacturer?"" asks a woman sitting next to him on a plane.  ""A *major* car manufacturer,"" he reassures her.  This generic-ness is deliberate: many important characters go unnamed or misnamed, and the city most of the film takes place in is, like the city in SEVEN, completely unrecognizable.  But like the city in SEVEN, the environs play a crucial role in setting the tone - where every building in SEVEN was weathered, rain-soaked, and Gothic, Fight Club's burg is full of giant glass-and-steel towers, yuppified apartment complexes, light, and motion.  With a few plot-crucial exceptions, nothing looks more than ten years old; it's a town without a past.Norton, our hero, suffers from severe insomnia.  His job is wearing him thin and he's trying to find solace in Ikea catalogs.  (One memorable shot shows his empty apartment gradually being filled with designer furniture, complete with catalog-style photography and text descriptions.)  His doctor flippantly advises him to check out the testicular cancer survivors' support group - ""now those are some guys with real problems.""  Norton goes, and in short order finds his head being clung to the overdeveloped chest of a sobbing, massively overweight survivor named Bob (played by Meat Loaf, woohoo!).  Then Norton opens up about his own, totally fraudulent, pain.  The experience proves so cathartic that the narrator's insomnia is temporarily cured.  Addicted to the experience, he begins to attend more groups (using a different name at each one)...which works fine, until he discovers Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) another voyeur like himself.  (He's clued in by her appearance at the testicular cancer group.) Knowing that there's another faker ruins it for him, and his insomnia returns with a vengeance.Then, one night on a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the charismatic owner and sole employee of the Paper Street Soap Company.  Tyler, who offers trenchant criticisms of capitalism and corporate society, seems like a charming flake, until the narrator gets home to find his apartment a blasted ruin.  Needing a place to stay, he calls Tyler, and the two of them begin to form a special bond, culminating in a bloody fistfight outside a local bar.  Exhilarated by the atavistic thrill of hand-to-hand combat, the two men agree to meet each week for another bout.  Pretty soon other patrons start getting in on the action; after a month, they found Fight Club, an organization dedicated to liberating men from their day-to-day drudgery by allowing them a chance to beat the snot out of one another.As Fight Club grows, Tyler becomes more and more messianic, organizing increasingly bold raids on what he sees as the symbols of an oppressive modern existence: running magnets over the tapes at Blockbuster, blowing up computers, and stealing human fat from a liposuction clinic to make bars of soap to sell to classy department stores.  At first the newly liberated narrator follows Tyler enthusiastically, but his doubts increase as Fight Club expands exponentially, becoming a nationwide underground movement trying to undermine every aspect of society.  New inductees are stripped of their identities and given shaved heads, black muscle shirts, and jackboots.  The fascistic overtones of this revolution, and his mounting jealousy of Tyler's marathon sex bouts with Marla, pushes Norton's character further and further to the periphery of his own creation, until he decides he wants to cut Tyler back down to size.FIGHT CLUB has a new and unique energy to it, galvanized by Fincher's energetic photography and the throbbing music of the Dust Brothers.  But what I really loved about this movie is the way it turns the tables on the Tyler Durdens and Gen-X whiners of this world.  While being brutally honest, and funny, about the bleak realities of corporate life, this criticism is balmy and mild compared to the savaging the movie gives to self-appointed malcontents.  Instead of liberating its members, the Fight Club simply offers a different kind of slavery, one that doesn't end with the five o'clock bell - ""conformity in nonconformity.""  But this message is still delivered with wonderful, wonderful humor.  In its own way, FIGHT CLUB was the best comedy of 1999.Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD set a star because of Fox's unfathomable decision to release this stripped-down version.  The original FIGHT CLUB DVD set was a groundbreaking accomplishment that set the stage for any number of memorable, high-quality releases later on.  But not only has Fox chosen to undermine that standard, they've made the original nigh-impossible to obtain.  It's a terrible shame, and one that I hope will eventually be rectified."	4.0	A classic undermined by a sub-par DVD release	2003-03-03	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1JV3OZZVLHW85	Jaime Rafael Vazquez	"When I saw this movie for the first time on televison I was saddend that I didn't catch it in theaters when it was out.  It's an intelligent movie and it's not just about a bunch of guys wailing on each other just for the sake of fighting.  It's got a great director, great cast, great acting and a great storyline.  As soon as the dvd hit the shelves I went out and got my copy.  The plot of this movie is easy to understand (for most people) but hard to put into only 1000 words and I know my review will not do the film justice but I will try my best.Edward Nortons character ""Jack"" works for a major car company writing up reports about car accidents (that might have been caused by the manufacturer he works for) so his boss's can decide if a recall is needed on the automobile.  If the recall is more expensive then paying off the soon-to-be victims families, they don't do one.  He lives a dull, mundane life (like many of us) at his 9 to 5 cubicle and middle class apartment.He suffers from insomnia and asks his doctor for anything that well help him, claiming he is in pain.  The doctor suggest that if Jack wants to see people in pain he should go to a support group for men dealing with testicular cancer.  Jack goes to the meetings pretending he's sick and in them finds freedom and starts to cry, for him losing all hope was freedom.  Now that Jack can cry, Jack can sleep.  He goes to his testicular cancer mettings and on the way he drops by tuberculosis meetings, blood parasite meetings, sickle cell, lymphoma, bowel cancer, and so on and so forth.  This is his vacation, this is his addiction.Then one day at his testicular cancer meeting he sees Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), and she ruins it for him.  He's seen her at his other meetings knowing that she suffers from nothing, (same as him) and he can't cry if there is another faker around.  He can't cry so there fore he can't sleep, so he confronts her.  They tell one another they'll expose each other as frauds and then decide to split up the meetings.On one of Jacks flights back from an accident he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He and Tyler talk about work, the exit procedure on the plane and how to make napalm from gasoline and orange juice concentrate (is it possible, I doubt it).  Tyler makes and sells soap for a living and gives Jack his business card.  Jack and Tyler part ways, then when Jack gets back to his apartment he notices something different about it, its been blown up.  He doesn't know why but he calls Tyler.They meet at a bar and after a few pitchers of beer Jack apprehensivly asks Tyler if he could stay with him.  Tyler says yes on one condition, he wants Jack to hit him as hard as he can.  This is were we get to know more about Tyler Durden.  As Tyler and Jack fight, they also bond.  Jack moves in with Tyler and they live together in a dilapidated house in the warehouse district of town.  Every weekend they go to the parking lot of the bar and they fight while on-lookers either join in or watch.  And that's how Fight Club is born.They move the club to the basement of the bar and that's were they have their weekly fights.  The group gets bigger every week as more people join.  Tyler gives his weekly sermon about our life and our jobs.  How we were thought to believe growing up that one day we would be rich and famous and happy.  How were a generation of men raised by women.  That ""our fathers were our models for god, if our fathers bailed what does that tell you about god? You have to consider the possibility that god does not like you, he never wanted you, in all probability he hates you"".Fight Club gets bigger and Tyler gets an army.  Tyler is nihilistic and he sends his army to run some errands, from blowing up computer stores to destroying corperate art and coffe chaines to bashing in the new VW Bug.  He is also sleeping with Marla after saving her from commiting suicide.  Jack hates Marla so he's not to happy about that.Tyler has changed Fight Club to Project: Mayhem.  There mission is basicly to destroy corperate america.  Jack had been left out of Project: Mayhem but by the time he finds out about their plans, Tyler has disppeared.  Jack travles around the country looking for Tyler knowing were to go only by the ticket stubs he left behind.  Tylers been busy creating Fight Clubs around the country.  When Jack finally catchs up with him, he is shocked to find out the truth behind everthing.Now there were a few things I left out like Bob (played by Meatloaf) or who blew up Jacks place but you'll find out about all that when you see the movie.  I suggest if your not to religous or don't mind violence then go out and get the 2-disc dvd.  The movie is no more or less violent then ""Rocky"", ""Braveheart"", ""The Matrix"" or any other movie with violence in it out there.  The 2-disc has more features and commentaries from almost everyone involved including the writer of the book Chuck Palahniuk.And for those who said the ending reminded them about what happened in NYC, you have to remember that this movie was made in 1999, two years before.  They tried to make the vans under the buildings into .... rent-a-car vans to remind people of what happened to the TWC in '92 but the people at .....wouldn't give the ok.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3IXJXO3FGWPOT	Jake Arky	Fight Club is the best movie that is out there right now. Not only is it so keen on its timing, but everything that is involved with it is superb. Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world right now and he plays his part brilliantly. Brad Pitt is funny and gives life to his character. Helena Bonham Carter is great as the eccentric womam who just doesn't care.  Another aspect of this to be examined is that Fight Club was directed by the best director in show business, David Fincher. He is a genius and this movie only hightens that status. Every &quot;frame&quot; of Fight Club is interesting to look at. The DVD is truely great for its picture quality and the sound depth of the movie. In the end (and I won't spoil that for you) Fight Club is a smart, brilliant, funny, and suprisingly moving black comedy that only a few will be able to recognize the intensity of this movie on a higher level.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A35G061W5UE8YW	"J. Alessandro ""juststained"""	David Fincher, hands down is one of my favorite Directors working in film. Seven,The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and even Alien 3(The script sucked, wasnt his fault)are examples of how a Great Director can make or break a Film. Finchers style fits Palahniuk's visions perfectly from Novel to Film. Im not going to rehash the plot here but pick this one up if you havent already. In fact grab anything by Fincher, he rarely dissapoints you, even if the material he is working with is sub-par. Fight Club isnt though and he parades us through Edward Norton's world of insomniac laden malcontent, a  lifestyle of the 90's male stereotype. &quot;We are a generation of Men raised by women.&quot; Tyler tells us, raised in a era of Divorce and materialism.Youre not your f*&amp;(n khaki's!

Exceptional 2.40:1 picture quality, awesome Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and a wealth of extra features to satisfy even the most demanding movie buff.The stand out feature on this DVD is definitely the multiple audio commentary tracks. These tracks are highly entertaining and informative, especially the track from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt (listen for the classic 'streets will be safer' line from Norton). I just finished reading the 'Fight Club' novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and listened to the commentary track he does with screenwriter Jim Uhls, another winner.The commentary tracks only scratch the surface of the extras here, but for me are the most worthwhile - meaning that if you can only get the single-disc edition, it's still good value. Still, I can't stress enough how excellent the 2-disc set is, the deluxe packaging is brilliant and the content exhaustive. Fans of 'Fight Club' will not regret this purchase.	5.0	Fight Club - a Super Heavyweight DVD set	2004-09-27	1	1	0

All of the changes they made were for the better (how many times does that happen!). I keep trying to tell me friends to see this movie, and almost always they say something like, &quot;my wife/girlfriend doesn't want to see it&quot;. I understand that based on the previews in the theatres, but I think this is sort of like not seeing &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; because it is a &quot;chick movie&quot;. This is a really good movie despite what you might think it is about.Okay, so what is it about. Uh, well, male angst-- but not the way you might think. It isn't about beating each other up as much as showing what's beneath the kahki and polo-shirt costumes and the Ikea cocoons of urban life.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1GBMGSDDG7BFL	James Crouch	I've often heard Fight Club referred to as &quot;The first movie of the new millenium.&quot; When I first heard this, I didn't know quite what to think, but as time went on, I understood it perfectly. Fight Club sets a new standard for ambitious and dark modern filmmaking. Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, a man caught in the mind-numbing grind of everday life. He has become entrenched in a rut of mindless routine, and can do nothing to free himself. He develops extreme insomnia, and can only cure it by going to all sorts of support groups under false pretenses. Previously, he found meaning in the pursuit of material goods, particularly expensive designer furniture. After his apartment is utterly destroyed, he experiences an extreme crisis of faith. It is then that he calls upon Tyler Durden (Played brilliantly by Brad Pitt), a slippery (no pun intended) soap salesman that he met by chance on an airplane flight earlier in the evening that his apartment was destroyed. Tyler is everything our protagonist is not. He makes a living by rebelling against the system, with absolutely no fear for the consequences of his actions. He makes his soap from human fat cells discarded by liposuction clinics, and then sells it back to the very same people at a very high price. Tyler's sole purpose is to be a crick in society's neck. He splices pornographic images into children's films, as well as spicing up the soup at various country clubs. Helena Bohnam-Carter plays trashy Marla Singer,who invades our protagonists world by going to the same support groups that he does, under the same conditions. After their meeting Tyler and Norton's character find that enjoy fighting for the sheer fun of it. They create a Fight Club, which grows in size every day. Eventually Fight Clubs spring up all over the country. They begin to do more than fighting, as Tyler's power grows ever stronger. The group becomes somewhat of a terrorist unit, defacing buildings and artwork rather than killing people. As this continues, Tyler gains an almost god-like reputation, as the chaos spins further and further out of control.  Fight Club is truly one of the most creative (as well as shocking) motion picture experiences ever created. It paints a bleak picture of modern existence, but does it so creatively that you can't help but like what you see. Edward Norton, who is definitely one of my favorite actors, has never been one to shy away from bold and contraversial roles, and this movie is no exception. Brad Pitt plays the brash and cocky Tyler Durden to perfection, and really helps to enhance the overall feeling of the movie. This movie explores human existence, as well as the human mind, on an entirely new level. This movie is a perfect statement for the so called &quot;lost generation&quot; of people that comprise Generation X. This movie forces you to examine your views on life, and if nothing else is a powerful statement of cutting-edge modern filmmaking. Fight Club is rife with action, suspense, and a wonderfully sardonic sense of humor. Fight Club demands the viewer's full attention from beginning to end, and leaves them spellbound, to sit back and think about what they just saw. Fight Club is not for the weak of heart, it is for those who want a movie that will completely blow them away. This movie is also good for multiple viewings, as each one will reveal more subtle nuances that make the film that much better.  The bottom line is this: Fight Club is truly a statement to a new generation of people, a movie that simply blows you away. If you are willing to explore new realms of modern filmmaking, then give Fight Club a try. You will not be disappointed. This movie sets the standard for an entirely new genre of film.	5.0	Stunning!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A776IRO2N3RFB	"James J. Hastings ""jIMPERFECT"""	Without trying to get philosophical about the movie or trying to best other reviews here, I just want to say what might appeal to people who haven't or don't want to see this movie.  It was unfairly judged when it was released -- even by the respectable reviewer, Roger Ebert. Forget what you hear about the violence and gore and the menagerie of masochistic machismo, FIGHT CLUB is  really about a man (my age) who because of his insomnia and addiction to consumerism, has slowly lost his grip on reality. The violence is just a PART of his new life (and is truly minimal when you count the minutes of it in this 2-hour visual masterpiece). If you keep your mind open, you'll realize this movie isn't trying to condone violence, because in the end, Tyler Durden is not seen as the answer.David Fincher has made his second best film here, next to SE7EN. And he's made it better than the novel. The DVD is perhaps the best one out there right now (even GLADIATOR) that fully capitalizes on the technology. Hours and hours of extras! Seriously, give this movie the chance it deserves if you haven't seen it. Ignore the bad things people said.	5.0	The most unfairly judged film of our time.	2000-12-28	16	13	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A37AKE4DAOB9FY	James L	This movie is perhaps the most twisted, mentally confusing movie since either Seven (another Brad Pitt mess-with-your-mind movie) or Clockwork Orange. Watch it just once, you miss more than half of the things going on in it.  I saw it twice in the theatres, and then bought the DVD the day it was available.Every time you watch it, you see something new, or get a new insite. Edward Nortan plays one of the most convincing &quot;screwed-up&quot; characters in recent memory.  Brad Pitt....  well, I had lost hope for him after Seven, but he turns in a character performance worthy of being compared to Hannible Lector. A stretch? Not really.As with Seven, do NOT watch this movie on a full stomach, or by yourself...  that is, unlsee you're into that sort of thing. :)	4.0	This one gets inside your head....	2001-06-25	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AGP0LMEHFQITC	"James Lucas Chatfield ""Religion: musician"""	"A lot of people didn't ""get"" Fight Club when they first saw it.  I suggested they watch it again.  Most of the people ""got it"" the second time, and they realized why they didn't ""get it"" the first time:  they were trying too hard.There are a lot of layers to this movie, to be sure, and if you watch it several times, you'll probably still find new things to appreciate about it the next time.  If you just didn't like it, well...  I don't know what to tell you.I'm not gonna give too much away here.  If you've seen it, you know this is a movie ripe with spoiler possibilities.  If you haven't, suffice it to say it's one man's take on society, personal identity, individuality, the catharsis of self-destruction...  and for those of you who didn't quite ""get it"":  this is not an action movie...  or a drama...  or a psychological puzzle.  This movie is a comedy.  A thick, sludgy, DAAAARRRRRK comedy... but if you're into that sorta thing, it's absolutely hilarious and brilliant.  Ed Norton plays the films single, 30-year-old career man, who's dull, structured lifestyle has bored him into a severe case of insomnia.  He finds relief in the emotional outbursts that he participates in by attending group therapy for illnesses and afflictions he doesn't actually have.  When another ""faker"", a quirkily depressing Helena Bonham Carter, throws him off his groove, his insomnia returns, but now he is strangely obsessed with her.  Enter Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, a cynical, anti-conformist soap-salesman with a penchant for anarchic practical jokes at his many part-time jobs.  Norton and Pitt become roommates, and soon start Fight Club, a new support group where men meet, beat the crap out of each other, and find that hitting rock bottom gives you a whole new perspective on life.  Where it all goes from there is a mind-bending and hilariously twisted journey.As for the Blu-Ray edition I can only say ""GET IT"".  It's cheap, it looks and sounds amazing compared to DVD editions.  Not a whole lot of ""new"" extras, but it's worth it for the tech-upgrade (and the amusing new menus)."	5.0	Love it or hate it, one of the most important films ever	2009-09-17	0	0	0

The disk software is also as unusual and entertaining as the movie itself.I've seen FC on DVD, cable, Netflix and bluray is the best there is.  The color and contrasts are beyond peer as exceedingly rich: the grime and dirty look of project mayhem's headquarters, clothing, faces, are most strikingly clear and heavily detailed and 'pop' out to you.  The DTS sound track provides the best separation and dynamic range than anything broadcast or streaming delivers as of this writing.  Because of the story line, this movie is rarely played on cable, except as on-demand or Netflix, for $8 disc and this quality, it can't be beat.	5.0	fight club is best on bluray	2014-05-21	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A34CVPZ30BA4GD	James Robert Dator	In 1999 we were all spoilt with some of the best films Hollywood had to offer. Amongst this soup of fantastic film came a movie so odd, deranged and fantastic that it found immediate success.'Fight Club' was the brainchild of David Fincher in his quest to make one of his favourite novels into a film. The result was fantastic; the film exceeded all expectations. It turned out to be a novel that was hard to put in a category. Too realistic to  be an action film, too crazy to be a drama, too dark to be a 'happy-go-lucky' comedy. So where does that leave the viewer???A postmodern, black comedy dealing with the masculine need to fight and the power of one man to break through all sense of responcibility and live vicariously through an alter ego, namely 'Tyler Durden'The film is an utter mind bend from the get go, in which the audience is treated to a montage, and trip though Jack's brain where we finally end on the barrel of a gun. There are few that can boast they saw the ending coming. I won't say if you havent seen it go and see it.The performances are great Edward Norton is shining as ever and Brad Pitt is fantastic as Tyler Durden. Their perfomances make 'Fight Club' a great film, that could have been a sub-par film if not dealt with by actors of such a high callibre.Well....how to conclude??? JUST SEE FIGHT CLUB!!!! See it again if you have, and see it for the first time and become hooked.Unfortunately for me by writing this review I broke the first 2 rules of fight club.....I TALKED ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!!!!	4.0	In 'Fight Club' genre = all	2002-02-18	1	0	1

This is not so, yes there is a fight club in the film as the title implies, but the film is much more than that.  It raises questions about how we as a people judge ourselves in society.  The film talks about how we are just a bunch of self-centered consumers who judge ourselves by the contents of our wallets.  If you can get past a little blood and gore and actually look into the film you will see a must have for any DVD collection.	5.0	Not just about some stupid fight club	2001-12-31	9	6	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3DG908D5YGY93	Jared gumpert	Wow... the reviews for this film certainly do swing from one extreem to another.  Fight Club came out during my freshman year in college, and i never planned on seeing it, untill a Girl that i know, told me i had to see it.  I figured it was because of Brad Pit that she enjoyed it so much.  I walked out of the theatre in what you could call a state of shock.  This movie took me places that I never thought possible. It was more twisted than my own personal daydreams...  this movie rocked.  So when it came out on DVD, i bought it immeadiatly, and must have watched it 20-30 times in a row.  Now, i know im not the brightest person out there, but im not slow either... I learned, watched or understood something new every time i watched it. and i still do.  I would call this movie my anthem, the anthem for a 19 year old boy, who has just moved out into the world for himself, and trying to define himself.  In a world of possessions, i think i learned the most valuable lesson that can be taught, from a movie called Fight Club.  happines is not your clothes, toys, cars or amount of zeros in your bank account, happiness comes from your life, and what you make of it.  Watch the movie, think about it, and Watch it again.  it will make you think.	5.0	What is left to say?	2002-08-01	2	2	0

From the credits onward I  knew that this movie was going to be a rollercoaster ride from start to  finish. I went to the cinema three times to see it and every time I was  begging for more. I can't wait to see the extra's the DVD has to offer.Edward Norton has established himself as &quot;The Man&quot; for the new  millenium I expect a lot more from him in the next few years. I thought he  couldn't top his role in American History X but maybe I will be proved  wrong. This movie is one you could watch 1000 times and never be tired of  it. With an intricate plot and superb special effects Fight Club is the  film that sums up the last millenium.Don't miss out on it because of  what the reviews said in the cinema. It's not just a group of malcontents  beating each other up it's a social comment on modern life.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A18RLW3GEY88OH	"Jason Gruss ""jgruss42"""	Most of my friends loved the movie.  My father and my father-in-law both just called it 'wierd', my mother called it 'too violent'.  Still, the movie is able to work really well on several levels:First, the movie examines the character of the Narator and the schism of his personality.  Norton and Pitt are phenomenal.  Both are raising their acting stock with this film.  Generally the movie works well as a 'character piece'.Second, the movie has some great action, humor and gore.  This is a great movie for college-guys.  It may inspire folks to do bad things (that doesn't appear to be the goal of the movie), but great none the less.  The fights are well done, the general mayhem and sexuality are in line with this style of film.Finally, this is a pretty decent social commentary type of picture.  The ideology of the film: conformity v. anarchy is classic, but the movie definately brings some new thoughts to the table.Overall, the movie said a lot of fun, interesting, funny and scary things without confusing its message or its plot.  The characters were interesting.  The movie was great to look at, as well.  One criticism I've heard and agreed with the lack of development of Helena Bohnam Carter's character.  While I agree, the mystery of her character is somewhat essential to the plot.	5.0	Not for everyone	2005-01-17	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A8KDNHIYJ9339	Jason	The first time I saw FIGHT CLUB I was kinda like, &quot;Was this not the stupidest movie ever?&quot; But the second viewing you understand it better, and that makes the story go smoother. I think, (as weprobably all did), that FIGHT CLUB was going to be non-stop action, great acting, and maybe little, (if any) storyline. But boy was I wrong! Once you get the plot, it seems like the action scenes are more enjoyable and the film don't seem to drag on.The story is about a insomiac, (Edward Norton), who is looking for relief. So he joins this cancer club, where everyone comes together to tell their stories to one another. This &quot;brutal honesty&quot; as Norton puts it, help him release all his feelings, and can rest. Then he meets a soap salesman, named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. But once he gets back from his business trip, he finds that someone has committed arson, and his condo is ruined by a fire. This is when Tyler comes in the picture. As they start to fight, (not because of any problems, they just want to beat the hell out of each other!), they realize more and more, that other men want to fight as well. Thus begins FIGHT CLUB. With performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bohnam-Carter, (which are Oscar caliber, or they atleast deserved a nomination), FIGHT CLUB is a brilliant film, with a really superb DVD.DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)* Closed-captioned, THX* Commentary by director David Fincher* Commentary by Brad Pitt* Commentary by Composers* Commentary by Helena Bonham Carter* Commentary by Edward Norton* Production notes* Theatrical trailer(s)* Five Deleted Scenes and Outtakes* Still Galleries: Set Design Stills, Costume Stills, Original sketches, Oil paintings, Storyboards, Publicity stills, Lobby cards &amp; Production Stills* 17 behind-the-scenes vignettes* Making-Of Fight Club* THX Optimode* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)* Number of discs: 2	5.0	Superb!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3F5EBY0NEVL6Z	Jason L Freund	I didn't know what to expect when I first saw the movie in the theatre.  But after the amazing opening credits (both music and visuals) which pan out from electrons bouncing around inside Norton's confused brain, out through a bead of sweat on his head, where his narration begins to explain why the camera ends the pan along the barrel of a gun, I knew it was going to be quite a ride.  The next couple of minutes don't let up either: as the narration continues, the camera pans through a skyscraper, through concrete and steel to show a scene of a bomb ticking away in a van in an empty parking lot.  Then up to an appartment: panning across photo-realistic computer-generated appliances, super close up, to show another bomb planted behind a refrigerator...But you don't have to be a pyro to love the movie.  Forget the awesome music throughout the film and the creative opening; the movie excels all the way through.  Acting-wise, Pitt was inarguably perfect: born to play Durden.  He was once quoted complimenting Chuck Palahniuk for writing the best part he's played.  Oscar winner, Ed Norton doesn't hold back either.  The complementary roles not only play well to the movie's theme, but provide for a surprising twist at the end.The plot and theme stay fresh by working at different levels.  On the surface, it's a movie about a club where men, realizing their repression by society, go to release testoserone by beating each other up.  One layer deeper, it's about the proletariate rising up against the ruling class.  Ultimately, however, I think the message is about a savior, who in his dream life, destroys the society he helped create.  The onion makes the movie appeal to a broad range of admittedly male audiences, but a very well-threaded twisted love triangle helps round out the appeal to other demos as well.I held off buying a DVD player until my pre-ordered FC-DVD was shipped.  But it was worth the wait.  It comes with everything you could ever want on a 2 disc set including cuts, interviews, a full &quot;Making of&quot; feature, and trailers.  But my favorite part are the alternate intros with different versions of the opening theme.  &quot;Stealing Fat&quot;, by the Dust Brothers is incredible.-Jason	5.0	The best reason to buy a DVD player	2001-07-11	3	1	2

I don't think that is a good thing.&#34; As a parent of a young man, I have watched my son struggle to develop his strengths and his passions. At 22, he is still struggling to find that mysterious balance that is required for a boy to become a man. When he was 13, I watched him struggle to know if it is better to pee standing up or sitting down. I knew I had to do something. I told him he could watch this movie with me if he promised not to tell his mother. A son will always make that deal with his father, by the way. The difficulty of raising a son or being a son in the modern world is displayed brilliantly. The alter ego creation seems to be a sensible solution. I'm sending a copy to a single mom friend who has two sons with hard questions for her about what life is for and why I am alive.Fight Club shows the struggle. For all of you who think that this is some kind of pornographic tripe, you haven't yet hit the wall where the simple black and white answers stop working for you (or for your son).

You can relate to the Ed Norton character and also see who you want to be in the Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) character. The supporting cast really helps in adding to this cinematic classic as well.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2C5LA07JCDWTN	"J. Brittman ""The Bottom Line"""	First off, this movie hands down has the one of the best endings, I have  ever seen.  Norton is incredible (as always), and Pitt's Tyler Durden is  lovably psychotic.  But, the real star here is Fincher who has directed his  best movie since Seven.  The soundtrack is great, the direction is  spellbinding (look close for the subliminal flashes of human genitals), and  the plot twist is one you will never guess.  This movie is about a half  hour too long, but nevertheless buy it.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2G0IACKMUHH5F	"J. B. Smith ""smithjb23"""	This is a very good movie, but if you can't stomach violence and look past it to the deeper meaning of the film, then don't watch it.  The movie is very well cast and very well directed.  The story is entertaining and fast moving.But this movie should make you think.  It has a strict anti-materialism message to it that makes it rather intriguing (whether or not you agree).  How many of us men in our late twentys - early thirtys have spent considerable time searching for the larger meaning of our lives?  We have had soft lives with no great challenges and this movie really chronicals a group of men searching for a primal challenge and searching for an opportunity to be primative.  It encourages people to break away from who they are (or who they have become) and turn into who they want to be.  I will say that the creation of a &quot;cult-army&quot; of mislead souls was, to me, the most disturbing aspect of the movie - much more so than the violence.This is a great movie - it should have won best picture if the Academy had any guts - but it is violent and disturbing for both the violence and other reasons and shouldn't be watched by people who don't want what they know to be real to be confronted.	5.0	Disturbing but great	2001-12-21	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AISKF2I1CC5BY	"J. Capuano ""Joe Capuano (Avid Writer)"""	"Okay, now most of you who are reading this review already know how good of a movie Fight Club is.  Most of you know that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances that will have you applauding.  Most of you know that the production values are up there with the best of them.  Most of you know that the script is brilliant, mostly because it is adapted from the best novel of all time.  And most of you know that David Fincher is a genius.  So I'll skip all that and get right to the big story here: Fight Club is being presented on D-VHS.For those of you unfamiliar with D-VHS, here's a quick fill-in.  The ""D"" stands for ""digital"" (obviously).  With a D-VHS player, you can record HDTV broadcast in its full 1080i scan lines without sacrificing quality.  And now that movies are finally coming out to own on the format, we can see them in high definition.  But how much better is it than the DVD?  Well, it's certainly good enough to take a look at.First, the video.  Anyone who bought the Fight Club DVD knows that it has excellent video and looks just down-right awesome.  The image here is even better.  Compared to the 480 scan lines on the DVD (progressive or interlaced depending on your player's output), the 1080i here helps the transfer enough to just squeak past the DVD.  One thing you'll notice right away is how the colors are perfect.  Black level is dead-on and colors never bleed or smear.  The DVD had some edge enhancement that wasn't too noticeable, but was there, nonetheless.  It ain't here on the D-VHS.  The image is so life-like and free from error that it looks like film.  If you consider yourself a videofile, you needn't look further for one of the most impressive video performances available for the consumer.Now, the audio.  Considered by many to be top demo material, the DVD edition of Fight Club had a staggering Dolby Digital EX mix.  Mayhem surrounded you wherever you were.  The surround back channel added to the three-dementionallity of the film.  It stood up to the best and held its own (even against powerhouses like Star Wars and Gladiator).  The Dolby mix here again just barely squeaks by the DVD release, and while it's not an official 6.1 mix, it decodes perfectly into the surround back, so those of you with 6.1 receivers needn't worry about that.  The only thing I'm really surprised with is the fact that no D-VHS titles have DTS tracks yet, especially considering there's nothing on the tape but the movie, a 5.1, and a 2.0 track.  They could have easily fit it in.  Oh, well.  Maybe in the future....So is D-VHS really worth it?  Well, at least with Fight Club it is.  With an absolutely perfect video presentation and a hard-hitting Dolby 5.1 mix, this is perfect for those just now getting into D-VHS and want to see if it's worth the investment.  Surpassing even the excellent DVD, I don't see why anyone with a D-VHS player would want to pass this up.Movie Grade: 5 stars (out of 5)Video Grade: 5 starsAudio Grade: 5 stars"	5.0	The newest format tackles a personal favorite.	2002-12-20	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1BHK6FFUZNKSN	J. DEATS	This movie is good on many levels, the story is great (adapted from a truely fantastic novel), the translation to film was very carefully crafted and it's artistic translation perhaps delivers the message to those who need it most.&quot;The things that you own end up owning you&quot;The film leaves you with a distrubed not well feeling, you may not be able to pinpoint why this is at first, then you begin to think about it and start to realize the moral of the story and the the truth hiding underneath (again on so many levels). From things like &quot;Do you know you could defend yourself if need be? and can you imagine the liberation that must come from having that assurance?&quot; To &quot;Our society is driven my the accumulation of things, and we will do whatever we must to obtain those things and live out the lifestyles hollywood dictates that we must&quot;. Then it goes on to show the dangers of the other extreem way of thinking (this is in fact the basis for most of the story). Possibly too much for some to grasp.&quot;You are not a unique a beautiful butterfly&quot;The movie is crafted well, it's brilliant and nothing less than a piece of art. A very in-your-face generationX style movie that may not be consumable for everyone.

Sorry I couldn't give this five stars: I thought at the beginning, which was quick and intelligent, it was going to continue the high quality.  But brother, did this need some editing. It was forty minutes too long. The  homoerotic team fight club stuff is the slow part, believe it or not. It  just DRAGS and DRAGS. It comes complete with clubhouse.  The choreographer  from the GAP commercials could have helped with the actual fighting.. I  mean...pump it up, guys, if you're gonna do it right, or cut it, please.  The acting is superlative, however. Edward Norton is one of our truly great  younger actors and Brad Pitt is amazing, for Brad Pitt.  I had no idea he  had a brain, even, until I saw this.  He is really good.  They are both  perfectly cast, and Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as the desperate soul  who hooks up, lost as well, with Norton and Pitt in this intriguing study  of what happens when modern society cannot nurture us, instead forcing a  response from some of us that might be deemed over the edge in every way.  When you're dead inside, perhaps you need to get your outsides beaten up to  feel anything... and perhaps it's better to feel anything--even pain, than  to be dead.best wishes,Jean	4.0	When You're Dead Inside	2000-04-26	11	4	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1DDY0BIL7LI4Y	Jeffery Braithwaite	The film that is &quot;Fight Club&quot; carries itself from the start to the final climax.  Based on the excellent novel by Chuck P., &quot;Fight Club&quot; eximplifies the teachings of Tyler Durden(Pitt)towards his  predecessors and most importantly, the nameless protagonist played  brilliantly by Edward Norton.  The fact that this film touches on fighting  as a source of redefining the male self and one's personal masculinity is  just the tip of the iceberg.  This film goes deep into the soul and  questions the very thought of who you are and why you are here.  Do you  have a choice in anything?  Maybe.  I won't tell. David Fincher's work as a  director keeps snowballing as one of the top in the business right now.  Money doesn't define the director, the film does.  Fincher captures the  very essence that the novelist brought to the reader of the book.  The  darkness, realness, and bloodiness that the savoring novel did and found  with twists and turns throughout.  The players, Pitt, Norton, and  Bonham-Carter took the characters to the level that was needed as well as  the supporting roles which are all essential in the plot's form.  Backed  with the awe inspiring soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, the feel of the  film and sound swept the viewer in and didn't let go until the point was  made and visualized consciously.  This film got a lot of slack from  critical minds alike but I don't think they got the main point.  The  violence is hard at times to stomach, but the viewer has to look deeper and  find the message that this film ultimately portrays.  One of the best  films of 1999, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one tough cinematic pleasure.	5.0	Fight Club packs a Mean Punch	2000-04-23	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AE3ZYSYOZNXTK	"""jeffgeorgefan"""	This Movie would normily get 5 Stars from me if i wasn't in a picky mood right now. When i first saw previews for this movie i thought it was going to me another Action flick with lots of fighting and very little plot.  Boy  was i wrong!  Fight Club starts out as a dark comedy and ends as a  thrilling drama, which along the way takes you through a wonderful begining  and a supriseing climax.The beginging of this movie is so  inventive(right now at 3:37am im at a lack for better words.) Ed Nortin  plays a insomniac who is possesed by all his desinger furniture.  He soon  visits a testicular cancer support group in order to relelive some of his  insomniac pain.  He soon becomes addicted and attends several other support  groups on a weekly basis in order to sleep.  Soon another pretender shows  up at his testicular cancer support group, a woman named Marla.  From here  Fight Club takes you on a journey of throwing off the yolk of the opression  while creating an equal life for all men and women.Now we get to the  good stuff....the DVD extras.  This by far is the best packeged DVD i have  seen to this day.  With many commentary selections, the trailers and  halarious PSA's from Brad Pitt and Ed Norten.  I own 3 other DVD's,  American Pie, Being John Malkovich, and Pulp Fiction.  This by far is the  best package with more trailers, commentary, outakes, web spots,  commericals and fun things than all my other DVD's combind.This is one  of my favorite movies of all time, right up there with Rudy and Pulp  Fiction, but why only 4 stars you ask?  Well partly because the DVD is  Hypoctial when looking at it in context with the movie.  The DVD is very  appealing, a strange cover with a funny picture of Brad Pitt holding a bar  of soap with the caption &quot;Tyler says use soap&quot;.  This is a very  Capitalistic venture by a very anti-capitalistic movie. So that takes away  1/2 of a star.  Second of all the middle of the movie tends to hold some  inchereant dribble at times which is only salvaged by wonderful  performances by Brad Pitt and Ed Norten.  So away with a  half a Star  there.  Still overall the movie is wonderful, if you only buy one DVD this  year make it Fight Club since it is a great movie and has tons of extras.	4.0	Wonderful DVD setup	2000-07-15	2	0	2

Do you spend more than 30 minutes getting ready in the morning?  Do you think about your next purchase on a daily basis?  If you said yes to any of these questions, and have yet to see this movie, then you must watch Fight Club.Possibly the best movie I have seen over the last 10 years (a very difficult statement to make), Fight Club is a dark satire about a man who is not happy with is life, and does not even know it.  Sound familiar, I'm sure it does.Brilliantly directed, photographed, and with amazing performances and charachters (Norton, Pitt and Carter at the top of their games), Fight Club has it all for you movie buffs out there.  Oh and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers also perfectly fits the movies dark tone.  Be warned, this movie does not make you feel warm and fuzzy inside like a Shrek flick.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A62QGCRMIF6S2	Jeff Storms	When Fight Club was first advertised in the theaters and on TV, people saw the ads for a typical, brainless movie about guys who like to beat the bejesus out of each other. What many of the viewers expected, however, was completely different from the results they received. Fight Club, sadly, was a victim of false advertising. In this case, the movie advertised was much different and the actual film was much, much better than it appeared to be.Fight Club is the story of our nameless narrator (played to perfection by Edward Norton). He has been having trouble sleeping and doesn't know why. He starts going to several self-help groups every night and soon discovers his bliss. Then, one day, Marla Singer came along. She, like our humble narrator, goes to these groups with no true diseases or disorders, just a fear of life. Norton begins to lose sleep yet again.Enter Tyler Durden. Our Narrator meets Tyler on a plane trip home, where he soon discovers that Tyler is something special. Durden shows our narrator how truly exciting life can be, and the two soon develop a great friendship. They both share the views on life as a prison for their minds, and together they form a secret society where men take out the aggressions of everyday life on each other.To say anymore would ruin the magic of the movie, so I will leave the plot summary as it is. As for the DVD, Fight Club is one of the most comprehensive DVDs on the market. With four, yes four, feature length commentaries, this is a truly extraordinary package. On disc two, there is a mind-boggling list of features, the most interesting being the behind the scenes footage of Fincher and crew at work. Also of interest are the deleted scenes, and while there may not be a large selection of them, they are quite plentiful. Perhaps one of the most visually entertaining parts of the special features is the exploration of the title sequence. To me, this is one of the shining points of Fincher's DVDs.All in all, Fight Club is a must for DVD enthusiasts and fans of bleak-society films. If you are expecting a brainless action vehicle, you're in for a major surprise. For people who want a taught, thought-provoking film, this one's for you.Also recommended: Seven (Se7en), A Clockwork Orange,  The Game, &amp; 12 Monkeys	5.0	Into the eyes of madness...	2001-04-08	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3ORYPV49QEEAL	"Jennifer ""jeanvieve7"""	As you may have heard, Fight Club did not win the hearts of all those movie critics that we so look up to. However, I believe the opinion of the public is more applicable to the home viewer.This is a great movie!  Edward Norton as always is marvelous. He plays a slightly neurotic  insomniac trying to find the meaning in his life. He is addicted to the  home shopping network and tries to buy his happiness by filling his home  with everything he could possibly want. But it's not until he starts going  to various support groups for illnesses he doesn't have, that he begins to  feel he has a meaning to his life. Until one day he meets Tyler Durgen  (Brad Pitt) and everything changes. Remember that line: &quot; I want you  to hit me as hard as you can.&quot; From here on it is a roller coaster  ride exploring what men will really do to find their sense of self,  especially if they do not care what others may think, or what consequences  may come about. Ed's character soon gets in way over his head and by this  time, there's no turning back...This film also has an ambitious visual  style. Everything from Norton walking through a catalogue,(prices and all)  to some weird dream sequences. Oh!, and don't forget to look for the  &quot;hidden&quot; Brad Pitts. In several shots if you see a quick flash of  orange, or think something flashed on the screen, rewind, pause a few  seconds before, and then go frame by frame. You will see Brad Pitt's  character pop on the screen for a single frame in several spots in the  movie.Ok, if you have decided to watch this movie, be prepared to do a  lot of thinking once it's over. On the social commentary, and what it says  about us as people. And then of course there's that shocker ending, that  will make you rethink the entire movie..........	4.0	&quot;No matter what critics say,... Worth watching! &quot;	2000-06-17	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1WBUVQ0I8XWS4	Jeremy Giles	I'll admit that after watching 'Fight Club' I felt disturbed. Deeply disturbed in fact. I felt like my brain had just engaged in its own  personal fight club and had emerged in a battered state. Does this mean  that 'Fight Club' is a good movie? Not necessarily, although it does  feature some fine acting and a great soundtrack.Taking a very obvious  cue from A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club aims to reshape our conventional  views on modern day, capitalist society. While it is successful in showing  how dull and lifeless society has become, the end results are mostly of a  superficial nature. Seeing two men pummel each other relentlessly is indeed  disturbing, as is the movie's cinematography, which includes many stop  action sequences and extreme close-ups of faces beaten beyond recognition.  However, like a bad acid trip, the questions spawned here are mostly  shallow and repetitive, questions such as 'Why do we live in such a  consumer-based society that cares only for appearances and glosses over our  basic animalistic nature?' However, thought-provoking this might be, it's  been asked before and more effectively as well. A Clockwork Orange was more  selective and discreet in trying to shock the viewer and in fact, most of  the violence and depravity was left to the viewer's imagination. Fight  Club, on the other hand, follows the distinctly American trend of leaving  nothing to the imagination, lest the audience miss the point director David  Fincher is trying to make. Pandering to the lowest common denominator is a  far too common occurrence in today's Hollywood, whether it's manipulative  melodrama such as Magnolia or the not-so-subtle religious commentary of  Dogma.  Kubrick's masterpiece and more contemporary pieces such as Mike  Leigh's Naked offer far more thought-provoking commentaries on the human  condition, with the viewer holding as much responsibility as the director  for figuring out what the problem is and how to solve it.What does  separate Fight Club from the rest of the Hollywood scrap heap is an opening  30 minute sequence involving different therapy groups (hilarious and moving  at the same time) and some exemplary acting. Edward Norton plays the part  of the business drone at the perfect pitch and pace, allowing his hidden  mean streak to slowly but surely emerge to the surface. As for Brad Pitt,  well he manages the near-impossible task of making us forget about his Joe  Black alter-ego. Hopefully, there will be no more Legends of the Fall or  Seven Years in Tibet for us to suffer through. However, both the riveting  opening act and the strength of the acting are soon lost in an orgy of  violence that quickly distills any point that Fincher is trying to make.  Also, it has become a bit passe to see movies where the inevitable 'twist'  at the end calls into question our assumptions about what has transpired  and how reliable the narrator may or may not be. Ever since Kaiser Soze  came out of the closet, scores of films have been scrambling to repeat the  formula with increasingly diminishing returns.In this day of absurdly  high movie ticket prices, Fight Club certainly has enough 'bang for the  buck' to satisfy most viewers. Yet few people will leave this movie feeling  any more enlightened than they did prior to watching it.  Most will return  to their 9-to-5s and leave the fighting for the weekend.	2.0	Overrated and overhyped	2000-08-01	48	20	28
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3MBTHRMOV5DX1	Jeremy	"Fight Club: A Knockout SatireThe first rule of Fight Club is ""You do not talk about Fight Club"". For a film that depicts its characters breaking all the rules, we will ignore this statute and delve into a world where punching someone in the face is considered a favor and nothing is as it seems. Released in 1999 by director by David Fincher, Fight Club is a film adaptation by the novel of the same name, written by Chuck Palahniuk. Having read this novel, it is not very often I get to say, the movie is much better than the book, due primarily to the superb acting and interesting cinematic techniques, which completely, yet pleasantly, surprised me. With a heavyweight class including Edward Norton (American History X, 25th Hour), Brad Pitt (Se7en, Inglorious Basterds) and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech, Big Fish), Fight Club is sure to deliver a lethal unexpected right hook sure to knock you on your ass.The film focuses on two men, an uptight insomniac yuppie (Norton) trying to hit rock bottom in life and a carefree soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), who attempts to make Norton's character reevaluate his values and priorities. Through a new form a therapy that includes viscously brawling with strangers, the values of our society are addressed. Eventually this testosterone-fueled violent therapy evolves into something truly sinister yet celebrated amongst this underground men's club. This whole plot is tied together by the relationship between the two main characters, their opposing views on a unique woman in their life, Marla (Bonham Carter), and the disintegration of a once-promising life.If you think that this movie is simply another senseless violent movie like Fighting or any other teen angst movie where the main star has to fight a bully for a better life, I urge you to think again. Unique cinematographic techniques and at times a nonlinear story line, part of the original Palahniuk novel, it leaves the viewer somewhat disoriented and detached from reality, which ties in perfectly with the feelings of the characters. Addressing the state of the United States, and most industrialized nations, in its consumerist state, far past the necessary components of life, the film makes the viewer ask themselves what they truly need in life instead of ""What sort of dining set defines me as a person?"" The film satirizes the world of consumers and culminates with a big bang, fittingly set to the song ""Where is My Mind"" by the Pixies, sure to leave viewers awestruck. This idea of consumerism taking over is something that most, if not all, of us can relate to.I would not recommend this movie to anyone with self-esteem issues, which repeatedly informs the Fight Club participants, as well as the viewer that ""they are not a special unique snowflake"". That, paired with images of Brad Pitt fighting shirtless is enough to make any self-respecting person's positive self-regard waver. Also if anyone is a fan of Martha Stewart steer clear because let's just say Tyler Durden does not think too highly of her, and lets the viewer know this in a scene with some very colorful language. The film is rated R, because of scenes like this, for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. There is possibly no better way to summarize the film more quickly than the rating of ""violent anti social behavior."" The film is filled with ultra-violent realistic fight scenes; though they are very bloody at times, they serve a purpose and propel the story forward, instead of other films in similar categories where the idea of the film is simply violence for violence's sake. This film is something much more than that.For those who have never been in a fight, those who do not want to die without any scars or anyone who has recently developed insomnia based upon an unfulfilled lifestyle dedicated to collecting various consumer goods, I truly recommend this film. A fast paced film that hits you and hits you nonstop and does not quit until the end when you are forced to tap out, question your beliefs and values and, experience premature enlightenment, Fight Club is a truly remarkable and unique film. The film can change your entire idea about the life you lead. It makes you question yourself and more specifically who, if given the option, you would fight. Gandhi, Lincoln, William Shatner; in the world of Fight Club everyone is a potential opponent and nothing is out of bounds, so long as there are no shoes and no shirts."	5.0	A Knockout Satire	2011-04-26	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2H5R1W4XW7PX4	Jeremy	"I will be the first to admit that I had doubts about Fight Club.  When the movie was first promoted for its debut in theatres, the advertisements, I believe, gave a misrepresentative impression of the film's actual content.  I thought, like many others, that Fight Club was going to be another lackluster production filled with all the clich&eacute;s you would expect to see in a Van Damme-esque action misadventure.  It took some goading but I finally decided to give this movie a chance, and I would highly suggest that anyone who has not should do the same.For anyone who is tired of the prefabricated plot lines that dominate today's movie industry, you know the ones for teeny-boppers and the sequels to movies unfit for original production, Fight Club is a refreshing alternative.  The star-studded cast, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, provide the perfect chemistry for this deceptively brilliant critique of the modern man.  David Fincher, who also collaborated with Pitt in the movie Seven, captures the essence Chuck Palahniuk's novel with beautiful cinematography.The junior executive, played by Norton, is struggling to swallow his mundane existence.  He suffers from a variety of ailments, from depression to insomnia.  Norton's character, the narrator, whose name is never revealed during the film, an example of the subtle nuances that make this production so appealing, lacks a sense of identity, as is expressed in the following quote: ""I'd look through the catalog and think, what kind of furniture defines me as a man?""  Palahniuk, very cleverly, illustrates how disillusioned and materialistic society has become.  Tyler's occupation of a soap salesman is yet another example.  He sells his luxurious soap, made from lye and the pilfered fat from liposuction clinics, back to the very clients who supplied the materials.Underneath the comedy, the drama, and, at times, the brutal violence, lays an exceptional social satire.  Norton's character and his partner in crime Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, revolt against the twenty-first century image of man.  A prime example of Palanhiuk's contempt for the feminization of man occurs when the two board a bus.  They see a Calvin Klein advertisement of a perfectly groomed young adult male devoid of imperfections and body hair.  Tyler asks, ""Is that what a man looks like?""  They both laugh and express their sympathy for people following the path of superficial self-improvement.The film broaches some rather controversial social issues, which separate it from most conservative contemporary pieces.  Many women, mothers especially, were offended by the line, ""We're a generation of men raised by women; I'm wondering if another woman in my life is really what I need?""  I thought that was a goal films; they are supposed to be about eliciting emotion.This film's cast and director combined to produce a film that will not be soon forgotten.  From the horror of the Norton and Leto fight scene to the compassion and sorrow of support group scenes, Fight Club takes you on an eye-opening voyage through the mind of a man gone mad from banality.  If you have not watched Fight Club yet and are tired of the same regurgitated garbage, check it out next time you have a chance."	5.0	A perfect 10!	2003-11-16	30	25	5

It's known as Project Mayhem, and the first rule is you don't ask questions. But before all of that, there's Jack and his insomnia. An unreliable narrator (Edward Norton) who can't sleep and works a meaningless job. Jack attends many support groups to find meaning in life, but to no avail.Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soapmaker who lives in a delapidated house in a toxic waste part of town. Things get very interesting when Jack is suddenly pulled away from his meaningless existence (thanks to a blown-up condo and a new support group: Fight Club). Jack and Tyler find freedom and salvation in violence and Fight Club spreads like wild fire. But, there are rules.The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club.

Propelled by amazing visuals, a riveting  soundtrack and an undeniably haunting underlying philosophy, &quot;Fight  Club&quot; will forever remian at the top of my favorites list.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3FOMYQWUP8MPE	"J.F. Quackenbush ""jason_quackenbush"""	First of all, I'd like to say that I wish more DVD's were like this. The commentary tracks are all great, the sound is great, the video transfer is beautiful, and the extras are great. The packaging is even cool. I hope that more DVD producers are paying attention to the accolades the fight club package is getting so that we will see more of it's quality in the future.As for the film itself, it is certainly one of my favorites. I'd even disagree with the earlier reviewer who called A Clockwork Orange a better movie. While the Kubrick movie is brilliant in and of itself, the story is not of the same quality as Fight Club. Which is understandable, as I feel Chuck Palahniuk is a superior author to Anthony Burgess. The Fight Club story works on so many levels that you get a bit delerious at times.  People seem to want to attach messages to the film, &quot;It's Anti-Consumerist&quot; &quot;It's a send up of the men's movement&quot; &quot;It's A satire of the Support Group culture&quot; &quot;It's anti capitalist&quot;. All of these things are true, and none of them are. Most of those aspects of the film are mere invitations to look more closely. When you do, and after you have peeled back the layers after a few repeat viewings (repeat viewings are essential to gain full enjoyment from this one, you don't just want to watch it again, you have to. It's another thing that makes it a great buy.) yoiu begin to see what the movie is actually about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, as the process of discovery was the most enjoyable aspect of the film for me, but do please watch this one a few times with no preconceived notions, and I'm sure you'll see what I mean.	5.0	People tend to miss the point here.	2001-05-03	5	3	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2SJ7L8QB52WDW	jgcrackerass	This has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it in theaters my senior year of high-school. I won't bother reviewing the movie itself becasue at this point, that would be a waste of everyone's time. I have been avoiding buying movies on Blu-Ray that I already own on DVD (I have over 500 DVD's, so that's avoiding a lot of movies) simply because that would be a financial nightmare and totally unjustifiable in most cases. The playstation 3 Blu-Ray player upconverts regular DVD's to make them look pretty nice on the 1080p tv so I haven't really felt the need for a better picture on most of my movies. Another annoying factor is the special editions of many of my DVD's have way more bonus features than the new Blu-Rays have, which is lame. The 10th Anniversary edition of Fight Club on Blu-Ray is awesome. It totally negates the need to hang on to my old Special Edition DVD and it looks fantastic. For anyone who says they can't tell the difference between this and DVD they are either blind or don't have the right equipment to view at full potential. I am very pleased with this Blu-Ray edition and for [...] bucks here on Amazon, I can't complain about buying another version of the same movie. It is loaded with special features, and is truly a new experience in watching this great movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AAW2M69L9X39F	J. Harripaul	This is my favorite movie. When I first saw the advertisements for this movie, I figured it was a stupid boxing movie (not to mention that I think Brad Pitt is way over-rated) so I didn't go to see it at the cinema. A couple of years later, I was up late at night and had nothing to do, so I watched it on HBO(or one of those similar channels). I'd forgotten the ads so I had no expectations. I just watched it unfold, seemingly leading nowhere in the first half hour. I've never enjoyed a non-adrenaline movie as much as I did this one. Edward Norton's performance is wonderful. The scene called &quot;Jack's Smirking Revenge&quot; on the dvd, is by itself worthy of an Oscar. Norton is believable in every second of the movie. The story is also brilliant. I read the book a while later and loved it, although I think I would be less pleased with the movie if I'd read the book first. Then I read Chuck Palahniuk's other novels. The man is a genius. Survivor, my absolute favorite novel of all time, is satire at its best. Oh yeah, the quality of the dvd is very good too.	5.0	The Best Movie I've Ever Seen	2004-04-24	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2GVJ83F092MIS	J. Hayes	"Fight Club is a movie I wish I had seen earlier. I honestly don't even remember trailers during its theatrical release. But watching it for the first time I expected a violence-packed movie, nothing special. But this movie packs some deep and at times disturbing philosophy that will make you think about things. At the end of the movie it was instantly my favorite movie of all time. A lot of people share my opinion of Fight Club and some don't, finding it too extreme and disturbing to enjoy(and that opinion is okay too).Edward Norton's unnamed character is a man living with everything he could want in life. He has the right dining sets that define him as a person, the right furniture that looks clever in his perfect little apartment. He goes to work and does his job well because is expected to. One day this man's lifestyle obsession leads to his ultimate realization that none of these things define him as a person and none bring him satisfaction in life. The 9-5 office job, his near-perfect wardrobe and his clever yin-yang designed coffee table become too much for him to bear. Insomnia takes its toll and to cope Norton begins attending support groups for people who really know what pain is. All is well until he meets Marlene Singer, another person who is faking her way through the support groups to cope with her own miserable life. Norton cannot deal with this so again he spirals back into insomnia. In comes Tyler Durden, a man that is everything Norton's character is not, and an alter-ego created to deal with the things that are unbearable for him. Tyler Durden says ""All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I f*** like you wanna f***, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.I will say this. If you dont know already Norton's character and Tyler Durden are the same person. I know I just gave it away but the awesome twist in the end where that fact is revealed is not the important idea in this movie, rather what is important is how and why it occured. Tyler was there to deal with everything in Norton's life that he could not deal with on his own. His way of doing this was first off starting the fight club. Here, men were not who they were in the outside world. Most were working class men getting by with life in the way advertising tells you life should be spent. Advertising has you working a job you hate to get things you dont need and these things were not essential to man's survival. But in Fight Club you were a man not concerned with the outside world and the image that world labeled you with. Fight Club grew and it became a much larger idea, Project Mayhem. It is here that ""Unnamed"" begins to lose his own grip on reality and see things go too far when Tyler has essentailly built an army to terrorize the part of society that tells you to look like this and tells you to act like that.Fight Club as I have stated is not everyones favorite movie and that is okay. You may disagree with its message and find its violence repulsive, but in my opinion it is a fascinating look into the human mind. Society really does shape us into people we should be to do things we don't always enjoy doing and people deal with it different ways(by accepting or rejecting the so-called lifestyle obsession). This is how one fictitious character dealt with it all. You can have many opinions on this film, but see it first and make your own opinion. It is a well-directed movie and features great acting performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. If this is one of your favorite movies then I suggest the 2 disc version if you can find it."	5.0	Fights will go on as long as they have to...	2004-11-25	6	4	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A258O0KFLNZBSC	Jigen	First off the DVD is cram-packed with so much it should make any collector grab it. About the film itself, this has shown me that Hollywood can occasionally let out a masterpiece when it stops thinking about demographics and being 'politically correct' (or modern censorship). This film is gorgeously shot and lighted, the production values are stellar. I am always impressed with directors who use film as a visual art rather than just sticking a camera on actors. The dilapidated world of Fight Club is both repulsive and attractive, mirroring the moral decay of our world today. The cast is well-chosen, extremely subtle and natural. The script is magnificent, light and thoughtful. It brings across its ideas in a funny way and avoids dwelling and preaching. It explores many of the same themes and issues that were brought up in American Beauty, but in a far more risky manner. From the trailer  I had no idea this film is a comedy, a very funny film (my idea of a comedy is a strong story with some really funny moments, NOT a string of punch-lines and gags and schlock like you get from awful Adam Sandler, etc.) with some serious ideas. The world of yuppies living their vacuous lives, pursuing the almighty dollar and bragging about their boring SUVs (come on, they're just pickup trucks!) and stock portfolios is one I've long been tired of. Whatever happened to being human? To experiencing genuine feelings? To reaching out and connecting with others? This film asks those questions and cautions us by showing how someone leaping out of the shallow yuppy life might easily swing too far the other way. Yes there is a degree of violence but, as Edward Norton mentions in the commentary, it is not senseless video-game violence like you find in inferior juvenile films like The Matrix, etc. The violence in this film shows us just how far one man might travel in his life to find some sort of meaning that has been buried under the media's messages of 'buy and spend', 'look and act like everyone else by following these ads', etc. After the film I remembered the humor and the ideas, not the violence. If you are open-minded, tired of the usual Hollywood rubbish, view films as more than soulless entertainment, enjoy being your own person, like thinking and exposing yourself to ideas, then I can strongly recommend this to you. If you are close-minded, a yuppy, someone who moved to the suburbs because you don't feel comfortable around different people, actually like the new VW bug, think that money tells a person's worth, got married because everyone else did, follow fashion from ads rather than developing your own style, then watch this and try to learn that life is more than a string of possessions, trends and friends who accept you because you look like they do. If the money-obsessed lawyers who run Hollywood really want to make money, they should concentrate on making more films like this:  Edgy, thoughtful, cautionary, funny and made with real quality and care.	5.0	A great black comedy	2000-09-25	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2YD1EHWNSJI7Z	Jill Traynor	Fight Club is one of those rare films I have seen that, even though the environment of the story is borderline hellish, I would love to be encompassed in. It's the story of one everyday joe (A nameless Edward  Norton) and his stale, stagnant, lackluster life which is slowly spiralling  out of control. He suffers from insomnia, which he finds relief from by  going to self-help groups and twelve step programs. His new lifestyle is  destroyed by the entrance of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter in all her strung  out, gothic-esque glory) who is also faking her way through the  meetings...even testicular cancer support groups.On a random business  trip, Norton meets the straightforward, dynamic, and psychotic Tyler Durden  (Brad Pitt, looking like an utter thrift store reject) who immediately  changes his life. In order to release their own repressed hostilities,  Norton and Pitt begin to fight each other...and other men who are attracted  to the concept. Thus Fight Club was born. As time goes on Tyler begins a  destructive relationship with Marla and begins to assemble an army in order  to bring the materialistic culture he despises to it's knees. It spirals  more and more out of control until, in a very literal sense, Norton's world  comes crashing down.I found that though the story was dark and the  world within most inhospitable, I would very much enjoy a holiday in this  world that Pitt and Norton carve out for themselves. This, like American  Beauty, holds a dark and hyper-realistic mirror up to our own world and  gives one pause...pause in which we wonder what seethes just under the  surface of society.	5.0	A Dark Holiday	2000-05-06	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A22QU6BKIG8ASI	Jim Chappell	"I went to see Fight Club the first Saturday it opened only because Ed Norton was in it and I was impressed with his contribution to ""Rounders"" - I hade never heard of Norton before seeing ""Rounders"". In any event, the theatre was half filled with ""Twenty-Something"" guys apparently looking for a some violent orgiastic 'dust-up'. Many of the youngsters left when they discovered that was not the idea of the film. True, there are several scenes of pugilistic mayhem BUT, in my opinion, most people miss the whole idea. The movie is purely symbolic ... bear with me here... The story is actually about the 'Feminization of the American Male' and the movie is a very effective though cloaked response. I do not want to spoil the fun in uncovering the often times very clever symbolism so I will offer only two examples. The first is the character played by Meatloaf who is a member of the 'testicular cancer support group'. Meatloaf's character is plainly a male becoming defacto feminized as evidenced by his growth of breasts from the hormone imbalance induced from having his testicles removed. Of course his emasculation is from disease and not politics or the despicable 'Political Correctness' movement. A second humorous episode is the apparent vandalism of rolling a giant bronze sphere ""statue"" in down a hill through the front glass of a ""fern bar"". There are DOZENS of subtle, not so subtle, and hilarious symbolic offerings.A person could EASILY write a lengthy, dry and self-important facetiously erudite exploration of the why and wherefores of the 'Feminization of the American Male' in an attempt to ""spell it all out"" for the dummies but Fight Club dispenses with all of that. The movie is truly not an indictment of a societies need to tame if not 'domesticate' the American Male. It simply explores how slowly moving cultural attitudes can catch the less circumspect off guard and, well, drive them nutz - literally and figuratively. I was truly disappointed by Ebert's review of the movie (to whom I usually pay attention) when he described Fight Club as 'Homosexual sado-masochism' - Caused me to wonder what kind of weird stuff he has living in his closet.Fight Club ranks in importance with A Clockwork Orange as social commentary but, in my opinion, is much more subtle and sophisticated.

That topic is as old as ... and 2. it didn't happen yet in 1999 and just because the word terrorist is included or a picture of a building falling down means nothing).Well I can assure you Chuck Palahniuk is not a teenager and two if you have a brain and aren't the stupid, useless, mindless, superficial, blue collared robot that this movie describes you would understand that this movie isn't telling you to pee in grandma's soup or punch your friend, its just a pointer at how boring and mundane everyday normal materialistic life is and the decay of society. I love this movie because I agree with it and I understand if you don't agree with it but not for stupid made-up reasons. I read one review most likley by an old woman that said she was offended by the violence but got the message. Thats fine even though I didn't agree w/ her values.	5.0	The best movie ever made	2002-11-11	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2CUP34WSXH7NC	Jimmel Brown	This movie is genius. I'm a woman and I found this movie great! Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are wonderful, and Helena Bohnam Carter is sensational as the neurotic Marla. The fight scenes are so real I wanted to jump up and yell stop! This movie is a gem and a must see. The movie begins with Ed Norton a normal guy who just cant sleep. So, he gets intertwined in the lives of support groups during his late night hours and they help him sleep like a baby. While faking every illness that the others in the groups have he meets Marla. She even participates in a testicular cancer group. The nerve of this women, but she figures hey she doesnt have testicles, why not. Just as neurotic as he is they begin divying up the groups. But things begin to occure in Norton's life that he just cant explain after a plane ride where he meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. All the wild signs point to one man...Tyler Durden. Tyler seems to be an excentric soap manufacturer but he is so much more. Having Tyler in Norton's life helps him change for the best and for the worst. This movie is a must see!	5.0	Tyler Durden, Tyler Durden!!	2002-06-07	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3RB6NQOLOBXYD	"Jimmy Lee ""James"""	"To say that David Fincher's film Fight Club is underrated or for some intellectual film buffs would like to facetiously use the phrase, ""sleeper hit"", is possibly the biggest understatement of the last decade. One small but highly significant reason for this under appreciation (In terms of box office revenue) lies in the failure of the marketing department to promote this film appropriately. On the contrary, it's subject matter and material did not render this an easy task. With a very deceptive title like Fight Club, most audiences assumed this film to be simply just that, a film about fighting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In 1999 all that the film had going for it was Brad Pitt, end of story. Although I have not seen all of David Fincher's films I feel it is safe to assume that this will probably be one of my favorites among his other impressive titles in his catalog. This film is not just a highly successful book to film adaptation, (not to mention put Chuck Palahnuik on the map as a respected author) but manages to execute it's dark, witty, clever dialogue in such a timely and entertaining fashion that it remains quite memorable and very satisfying. The 10th anniversary Blu Ray edition of this movie is nothing short of spectacular; it's audio and visual department does not disappoint, but truly and fully utilizes the Blu Ray technology to its advantage. The technical part of my review will be saved for the last so I hope you will pace yourself. Enough said, I will begin.The narrator (Edward Norton), who does not go by any particular name in the film, works for an insurance company that investigates claims involving automobiles. His mundane but financially rewarding occupation requires very extensive traveling that renders the narrator to lead a very isolated and lonely life. Even when he is not traveling, we see him completing very repetitive sedentary office work that involves little interaction with anyone besides his unlikeable and distasteful boss. Adversely, this demanding occupation profoundly affects the narrator's ability to sleep as he suffers from acute insomnia and what also appears to be severe depression. As a result, Norton's derives a substantial amount of pleasure indulging in magazine catalogs and purchasing various collector set items such as trendy furniture, fashionable dish sets with all the small intended imperfections, tread mills, coffee tables, and other novelties. In order to treat his insomnia, the narrator consults a doctor only to find out that he will not be prescribed any medication but suggested to seek treatment in support groups for various forms of cancer to witness real ""pain"". Subsequently, an addiction follows from this experience when Norton admit tingly feels attracted to the universal atmosphere of sadness and emotional engagement with strangers. (Meat Loaf being one of them, go figure) It is here that the narrator comes across a woman named Martha (Helena Bonham Carter) who is a ""faker"" according to him because she does not genuinely suffer from any of the interminable diseases in the support groups but only participates for the movies and free coffee.On a plane during a midnight business travel we are introduced to Edward Norton's significant other/anti-hero, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) when they are seated next to each other. Tyler Durden is a very clever, knowledgeable and highly entertaining salesman in the business of selling soap. He is filled with arbitrary useful facts about potentially explosive household items, history and even philosophy to some extent; moreover, he comes across as very dark but amusing and personally engaging to say the very least. There on screen chemistry is highly plausible and works to perfection in every scene. The relationship between these two characters is further solidified when they meet for the second time after Norton's trendy apartment is mysteriously blown to bits all over the sidewalk. The narrator ponders the root cause to be a freak electrical occurrence. Despite of this catastrophic event (or is it ?), Norton finds comfort in calling Tyler Durden where they rendezvous at a local bar for some drinks; the narrator vents over his materialistic losses while Tyler Durden simply offers some solace with a very interesting and enlightening outlook on the relationship between human evolution and American culture.The narrator and Tyler Durden embark on a dark journey that reveals the truth about themselves and about society as well; and, as a result, a much deeper and more genuine relationship occurs between these two characters especially when Tyler Durden asks Norton for a favor in return for his hospitable shelter, ""To hit him as hard as he can.""Now, this film packs a very heavy social commentary that delves around many salient topics and themes that are bound to strike some interest in the careful and observant film goer. (At least I hope so) Personally, what struck me as important and intriguing what it's social commentary on corporations and their potentially adverse effects on American culture and human emotions, or in the narrator's case, lack thereof. The narrator exhibits symptoms of insomnia because he is ultimately depressed working in a single serving, dispensable and yet fast paced environment (at least when he's traveling) that deprives him of maintaing any real interaction with friends and family. Unfortunately and in spite of this, we see him enjoying the true and last American value in this country that becomes more prevalent within each passing year, consumerism, or as Tyler Durden puts it more plainly and effectively ""Buying S--- we don't need"".The narrator's life is consumed by the corporation as he inspects some of the most horrific car accidents, spends a considerable amount of time air traveling not too mention ordered around by a very unpleasant and discontented boss who is rarely satisfied. Let's just say that his work environment does not fully endorse the mechanism of positive reinforcement. A profound feeling of emptiness engulfs this character to the extreme point of him finding solace in things such as cancer support groups or in buying endless items in magazine catalogs; the narrator is merely struggling to find any form of emotion in this depraved and depressing American culture we live in. As a result, our anti-hero fills this empty space with feeling pain in fighting and even indulges in what seems to be a subtle form of masochistic behavior such as burning himself with chemicals or throwing himself into glass shelves. The corporation persistently produces this potent and profound feeling of emptiness that strips the narrator of his individuality by artificially organizing it for him. You are not an individual but a team member or a team player working for a much bigger and more important company. And we wonder why so many Americans are prescribed anti-depressant drugs and medication. The bottom line is that the individual is more often than not wrongly perceived as the problem and not the sick cultural environment that one works or interacts in.Ok, onto the technical specs of this masterpiece because that is what this film is and looks like, a masterpiece. I purchased the 2-disc dvd back in 2002 and I was utterly impressed with the quality of it along with it's array of supplemental material. Without exaggerating in the slightest bit, this Blu Ray completely puts the previous dvd release to shame. I did a thorough compare and contrast and it was worth every minute of to see the nice upgrade make it to my home. If I had to describe this transfer in one word, the word flawless justifies this very accurately.Cinematically, this is a very dark film indeed that manages to seamlessly and effectively intertwine with the nature of the material presented. Black levels are incredibly deep and consistent that allow some of the more bright colors to filter through quite nicely, particularly in the underground garage scenes. Pay attention to the vibrant and lively green neon reflections when the camera rapidly spirals down into the garage to expose the detonated explosives. Truly remarkable. Flesh tones are real and appear very natural and lifelike throughout the entire film whether it is during the abundant night shots, the interior house on paper st, the underground garage, or the massive corporate buildings. When Edward Norton attempts to deactivate one of the sets of explosives in the white van pay close attention to the sweat drops on his forehead or Brad Pitt's light facial hair, amazing.Like the picture quality, the sound will not disappoint either boasting a very nice DTS. 5.1 HD Master Audio. The Dust Brothers will immerse you in it's highly unusual and nerve racking industrial score. All of your speakers will given the royal treatment with this one, I can assure you on this. Dialogue is nothing short of perfection; moreover, it is clear, articulate and very consistent. I can also rest assure you that your subwoofer will not be left alone in the dark either as explosions will vibrate your floor while the heart pounding score will add a nice touch to the unsettling atmosphere. Every scene in this film is quite mesmerizing in terms of picture and sound but If I could specifically point out a great scene in which captivates all of these things accurately, I will have to say pay attention to when Edward Norton deactivates the explosive in the garage and subsequently battles Tyler Durden; shattered car mirrors will pierce your front speakers; glass toll booths breaks with superiority, hand to hand combat is exchanged wonderfully and a very nice clothesline executed by Tyler Durden will definitely spark some enthusiasm.This by far one of the most superior and worthy Blu Rays out on the Market.

Even though I don't like the movie.  I can't get over the subject matter of the film.  I have an open mind and love thought provoking movies of all kind such as Mullholand Drive, however this movie left a bad taste in my mouth.  People say in their reviews that corporate America has conformed our society, but are we not free to live in any way that we chose and try and make a living the way we see fit.  All this movie advocates is conformity and violence.  It says that it is ok to get your point across through violence and torture.  If this movie were trying to show this in the way of a black comedy, I could get past its subject manner, however there was no attempt at comedy in the entire movie.  All of the members of Fight Club had no original ideas of their own and behaved like drones similarly to a socialist rebuplic.  This movie seemed to praise socialism and bash capitalism.  If you watch this movie, I think you will see why socialism will never work and why we live in a capitalist society.  The movie teaches lessons and makes points that have been blatenly clear for some time.  I think there are very good ideas here, but the way they were portrayed in this movie is not for all tastes.	1.0	Not for all tastes	2002-07-10	46	12	34
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3NKFB39AIEN8W	J. O. Booker	"It took me a while to get around to it but I finally gave it a chance. Trailers and clips made FIGHT CLUB look like a film glorifying silly WWE-style backyard brawls.The opening credits zoom out of Ed Norton's body and up a pistol held by Tyler Durden (Pitt).  Norton narrates the story to bring the viewer up to speed.His character is firmly enmeshed as a dull, desensitized slave toiling as a claims adjuster, an easy, well-paid desk job. He rents a high-rise apartment bloated with designer furniture, name brand clothes, name brand food...He's addicted to and comforted by male support groups. Then, one day, a woman (Helena Bonham Carter) ups and decides to sit in.A chance meeting with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) prods Norton's character to blow up his safe, materialistic life and take residence in a dump on the edge of town. He and Tyler (Pitt) form a support group called FIGHT CLUB. Therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed to amp up aggression. Participants emerge pulpy but there are no losers. They are hirelings and chumps in the outside world. The brutish matches empower them. Groups prior to FIGHT CLUB reinforced their weakness, like E.D (erectile dysfunction. Ironically, a member of this group, a steroid abuser, has breasts). Finally they had a club no woman would join, a real MEN'S club.FIGHT CLUB is stunning and ultra-violent and open to interpretation including society's addiction to icons. As Tyler Durden (Pitt's character) says: ""The things you own end up owning you."" The solution, he believes, is to fight and give up being perfect. Bruises, swollen eyes, broken teeth and cut lips are trophies. Another aspect of the movie is idol worship. There is one scene that is especially grotesque and beautiful in illustrating the paradox of FIGHT CLUB. Norton horribly disfigures a new recruit. Asked why he replied nonchalantly that he ""wanted to destroy something beautiful."" This, to me, foretold the direction of the organization towards vandalism.The picture has a slick green hue similar to the sheen of the Matrix movies, or the hard, silver tint James Cameron uses. CGI is very effective throughout. Norton's fear is exposed in a chaotic sequence showing his internal physiology. In another, the picture jumps like a speaker to Brad Pitt's voice. Fight Club feels like a graphic novel-- very surreal and fun to look at. But it's not for everyone. Fincher did a great job. He could have shined it up and turned the noise down but didn't. I highly recommend it!"	5.0	The only club she won't join...	2006-09-20	18	14	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AJW5MRIDM6JHA	"Joe Holt ""Give yourself permission to live th..."	I had to buy it because it took me watching it around five times to fully grasp the singular nature of the two lead actors character. At the fifth time watching the movie, I was able to tell myself that Brad Pitt was simply a figment of the imagination for most of the movie. Once you can understand this, there are allot of nuances that really pop out. The looks from the crowds and people he encounters become clearer and you understand that he is beating himself up and obviously talking to himself the entire movie. And poor, poor Marla. Seriously, that girl must have endured some very confusing conversations. Plus, this is all make believe so in the end, you can simply dismiss any idea that you don't full understand. You can also apply that logic to the movie.	5.0	I had to buy this one!	2014-02-14	0	0	0

It has boundless extras like 4  different commentary tracks (I think this could be a record), documetary  features, and many different advertising features (I loved the Public  Service Annoucements).

It's psychological. It's deep. After watching it many times you start to see the simple wisdom hidden in it. The lines are uttered on one level but resonate on many deeper planes...Tyler is pushing Ed Norton to wake up and see things as they really are. But he won't. And we can all relate to him. We are educated, have good jobs, a good life, but something is missing...This is a great film, not simply guys fighting.And the DVD is excellent. you can view the movie with the director, actors, scene designers, and writers.

And  then there's the story.  As I see it a story is good if it can be real.  This fim could have been but then we discovered that brad pitt is an  imaginary character.  At this point the whole fim collapses due to the  large nuber of holes that have formed in its structure. Lastly, the story  is a pointless one.  There is absoultely no reason why this plot needs to  be told.  I can't think of one.  maybe you can. You must see this movie.

The ideas in the movie can be unsettling and uncomfortable, but that was the point of the movie. The direction is wonderfully done. The acting should've been oscar calibur.

Every critic that lambasted this film should be shamed... because obviously they  didn't really watch the film or they failed to grasp the layered content.  The film attempts to attack your pysche with subversive images and concepts  that are explored through the mind of a mentally ill character.  It does  not glorify violence... it does not offer violence as a means to solve  problems... it does not validate male aggression - at least it is social  commentary in the tradition of A Modest Proposition and at most it is high  art.  Director Fincher uses rich visual cues and subliminal techniques that  seap into your conciousness. He is quickly becoming one of my favorite  directors.  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver dynamic performances that  they trully enjoyed delivering.  Buy the special edition DVD and listen to  the commentary throughout the film.  This special feature suits this film  very well and the information shared by the director and stars is  fascinating.

My co-worker and I were discussing movies and books that throw you curveballs you never saw coming. This movie came up. I told him that I had wanted to see it, sort of, but never did. He recommended it and loaned a copy to me. I LOVED IT.Initally, I thought the movie was too dark, too disorganized, and the character actions were far too extreme. I remember thinking, why would any rational person do these things? Then, in the same moment he got it, I got it. I was thinking the same things he was saying. Noooo. Couldn't be. The movie had me replaying scenes for 2 days thinking ""ohhhh that's why he/she did or said that."" I honestly never saw the twist coming and I was still stunned days later when trying to unravel it all. I think this is gonna be one of those ""watch it again now that I understand it all"" kinda movies. The usual suspects made me do that.The only gripe I have with the movie is the ending. I'm not a spoiler and I'm not about to start now. However, bad CG and a tidy wrap-up just didn't fit the rest of the movie. I understand that the book does a better job of fleshing it out and I might pick up a copy instead of watching the movie again.

The packaging itself reflects the creative, self aware and at times self mocking element that is certainly akin to this movie's spirit.i purchased it the day it was released, months ago, and still haven't seen everything on it, internet trailers, international trailers, 4 different commentaries, the making of Fight Club, and eventually the movie itself.I remember the first time i saw this movie, expecting Director Fincher to push the limits on violence, to use all brawn, set in darkness and gore, not using any brains or wit, and i remember leaving this movie, dazed and wondering, wishing i could buy it on DVD right then.	4.0	Prolific collection of fight club media	2000-11-14	0	0	0

As soon as I saw the opening credit sequence, I stayed.  I now cannot tell you what movie I was originally going to see, but I know that it wasn't as good as this movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ARNWCLQZFQECA	John Paquette	Do you enjoy feeling uncomfortable, unsettled, even disgusted?  Do you giggle when made to squirm?  Then this movie is for you.When I saw Seven, I left the theatre thinking &quot;why was I put through that?&quot;  I wondered &quot;who enjoys seeing such pain?&quot;Fight Club is like Seven in an important respect: it shows a lot of human bodies being mistreated.  In this movie, however, most of the people being mistreated _choose_ it.UNfortunately, this movie is much more funny and entertaining than Seven.  It's even insightful about what people do when their life has no meaning or purpose.I don't mind a movie that jars your everyday sensibilities for some important purpose, but Fight Club, as a film, is fundamentally concerned with a destructive and self-destructive individual.  The film blames his actions on a supposed materialistic soullessness of modern society (stupid old mistaken idea -- Yawn).  Then it makes light of itself by being funny.Be careful whom you laugh with.Simply watching this movie is a self-destructive act.  It is seductive and entertaining, while inciting hatred for good, productive people.The movie itself is the cinematic incarnation of Tyler Durden himself.  It appeals to your inner criminal.Sadly, it is extremely well executed.  The film is a technical masterpiece, worthy of study by future directors.  Great skill has been applied to dull your sense that there's something wrong with what the film is advocating: the destruction of health and wealth.  The final event in the film says it all.Unlike the characters in this film, don't buy into the thrill of abuse.  Don't choose to be mistreated.  Don't see this film if you want to defend your life's purpose.  If you do, then -- like the men in the film -- you'll be sucked just a little further into someone's dimented, destructive, _purposeless_ fantasy.Contrary to what the film implies, &quot;consumerism&quot; (concern with achieving values) isn't sucking out our souls.  What's doing it is nihilistic films like Fight Club.	3.0	Another from the same sadist who directed Seven.	2001-03-05	16	7	9
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1OFZ2683M8PS8	John Paul	This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's visually impressive (top-notch job by Fincher); Norton, Pitt, and Carter are great; and then the story itself is original on the point of genius (...I'm sure everyone has a different, heated opinion on that).Most of the complaints I've seen posted are either that Fight Club is too 'pretentious' or violent.  First, the 'moral overtones' are not that didactic; sure, Tyler rants quite a bit...but you can take it or leave it.  Think of the movie as a case study of the self-destructive/fascist revolutionary mindset.  Also, the tone is lightened quite a bit by the 'dark' comedy present throughout.Next: the violence in this movie is not that extensive.  Some scenes happen to be intense, but are below the level of violence talked about in the daily news.  Don't think you're going to watch a Disney flick: it's not.  But it's sure-fire not as violent as most hollywood tripe.  One person dies... several fist-fights.Anyway, just watch it with an open mind.  And realize it is, to a great extent, a satire of both our consumer culture AND nihilism.	5.0	Thought-provoking COMEDY!	2001-11-20	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AIGO9CMSVMHMX	John-Paul Sears	Every once in a while, a film comes along which completely flips Hollywood head over heels, blasts its way into public awareness, and is recognized for its brilliance and messages by the people.Fight Club is by no means one of these movies. It is something far greater.For one thing, it was not recognized. The Acadamy, ever-so-typically, refused to acknowledge this film for what it is -- namely, the most perfect portrait of modern society ever set down on a plastic sheet. Indeed, if the Oscars HAD recognized Fight Club, it would have lost some of its potency. Part of its greatness lies in the fact that it is a true antiestablishment film, which have been quite rare since the Sixties, and being recognized by the establishment would have been rather contradictory. The fact that today's young men, and not the older members of society, tend to love this movie, is quite telling. This movie will never turn society on its head, but it will percolate through society, as it is already doing.The messages of the film conflict with those that society constantly sends us. Where every day we are subliminally convinced to invest in the economy, to trade in our youthful ideals for a place in capitalist machinations, Fight Club points a gun at our heads and tells us to do whatever the f**k we feel like. That capitalism crushes the individual. There are strong undercurrents of anarchy in the film, but this is not political anarchy; it is philisophical anarchy, the principle that we should all allow our minds to take whatever direction they want to. The entire film in a sense is an allegory; the message is that laws and rules restrict thought, but that the part of us that desires COMPLETE anarchy can get out of hand.In short, Fight Club is the most important and the best film made in the past several years. While I have heard that the film only appeals to GenX'ers, it is also extremely powerful for those like me in the &quot;25 and under&quot; category, who are also seeking philosophical foundations in a hypocritical, apathetic, cynical, and indeed, wholly unpleasant society.&quot;What's that smell?&quot;	5.0	I am Jack's message to society	2001-01-04	20	16	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ABX7SEE84DMLU	John P Bernat	"This film reveals, in a very disconcertingly direct way, the essence of being a man.You can't help despising every one of the characters. Ed Norton plays a weak, neurotic nonentity. Helena Bonham Carter plays a thoroughly unpleasant lowlife.Brad Pitt plays Tyler, an insufferable overaged brat. He's a smug, know-it-all ""nonconformist.""  Luckily for Tyler, his physical attractiveness lends credibility to his long lectures on manhood, because their content is direct and undestandable.  We've all heard this rhetoric many times before, but never done better.What starts out as suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power turns into something much more elemental. Their jobs are dull and don't offer intellectual challenge, spiritual fulfillment, or satisfaction. In other words, they've been cheated out of what they'd considered their rightful due as men.Tyler's solution is to reclaim their masculinity or overthrow the corporate hierarchy by picking fistfights and blowing stuff up. This becomes popular with other suburban white guys with way too much time on their hands, who decide that they're all victims, too, and that they all want to pick fights and blow stuff up, too.  Direct and functional.This spirals out of control, Sorcerer's-Apprentice-like, and evolves into a dystopian cult/army of suburban white guys; complete with rules, chants, and rituals. The members of ""Fight Club"" start as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying corporate bosses, and end as rebels in touch with their manhood, following Tyler like sheep.The movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting. It makes important points about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment.One thing I found really disturbing, though, is that I saw no African-American, Hispanic, or blue-collar characters, although those groups face at least as many difficulties and injustices as the middle-class office workers depicted. The lone woman character is physically and personally repellent -- worse, her only purpose seems to be as a spittoon for the men.Of course, the message reverses at the end of the movie.  If any man's self-worth and autonomy depend on a ""masculinity"" defined as brutality, then a dull job is the least of your problems.  Companies are in business to make money -- period -- and nobody's life is fun every minute of every day. If you're bored or unfulfilled -- paint a picture, climb a mountain, volunteer at the homeless shelter -- do whatever matters to you or others.If you hate consumerism -- throw your cellphone in the trash and wear your 1980s-vintage stonewashed jeans until they fall apart.Testosterone run amuck and mindless nihilism have cathartic appeal to angry, frustrated adolescent boys of all ages.  Each man is called to view this dialectic critically by the time this movie finishes.""Fight Club"" is still a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, of course.  These are vehicles for a visceral message about what manhood is.  Presenting bombings and beatings as self-empowerment is reprehensible unless you can discern a deeper underlying meaning."	5.0	Essential Manhood	2005-09-30	14	7	7
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1LKXI5LFE5SAC	John R	"Where as ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Wall Street"" perfectly encapsulated the 70's and 80's (respectively) ""Fight Club"" did the same for the consumer driven, dot-com world of the (late) 90's.Who of us could not relate to Ed Norton's insomniac, hate-your-job and life character?  His frustration for his career is so vivid (and not played for fun, ala ""Office Space""), that this is possibly Norton's best performance (considering his body of work that is really saying something).And Brad Pitt? He was born to be Tyler Durden. Pitt is phenomenal as Durden and commands each scene he is in with such charismatic force, he forever erases the ""pretty boy"" tags that have been unfairly cast upon him.While they are often overlooked (in the midst of powerhouse performances by Norton and Pitt), Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer is a sympathetic and integral character, as is Meatloaf's Robert ""Bob"" Paulsen.As for the violence...it is necessary. David Fincher truly wants all to understand the rage and frustration of Norton's character and all the members of the Fight Club and there was no other way to do it (hell, it is called FIGHT Club!).  The film is not as violent as many are lead to believe, and certainly not as brutal or distressing as say Clockwork Orange (which this film is often compared too).While Fight Club is a masterpiece...it is not for all audiences and some will just not get it.  Repeated viewings are recommended to get all the little twists and to get the dark humor (yes...parts are very comical!) and check out all the commentaries (there are 4 different ones).Last Thought: The best line in Fight Club, ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time"" is a classic one and, while will never enter pop culture mainstream the way lines from ""Scareface"" or ""Sudden Impact, have"" it certainly hits home and has more personal relevance than many other tired and overused quotes.Fight Club is a Classic!!"	5.0	Fight Club is a Classic!!!	2005-06-23	6	5	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JYQSRA9O34PN	John Watson	The real first rule of Fight Club needs to be, &quot;Don't talk about the  details of the movie 'Fight Club'&quot;.  Anyone who's seen it knows what  I'm talking about on this one.  This aside, it needs to be said that Fight  Club is absolutly unlike anything most people are prepared to see, and this  is why it is so excellent.  The DVD of this movie is a real work of art and  is really packed with things to explore.  Making it a 2-disc set maked it  nice for anyone who just wants to see the movie and no nonsence.  In the  end, the real power of Fight Club lies in it's use of a simple, steady,  almost droning pacing that takes the viewer on an amazing journey into the  darker parts of the human mind.  Once there, it's very hard to look away.  Enjoy!	5.0	Gritty Film Excellence	2000-09-15	1	1	0

But I'm a big fan of fighting movies so when I saw this, it blew my mind. Not only did it provide hard as nails brawling, but it also had a psychological story behind it. Edward Norton's character and Brad Pitt's character are complete polar opposites, yet the same as well. While one has a well-paying career, a lavish lifestyle, and goes to disorder meetings for comfort (even though he is perfectly normal), the other is satisfied without material posessions, lives in an abandoned house, and has a great knowledge of explosives. But together, they start a chain of fight clubs that spread throughout the entire world. These fight clubs aren't spoken about, but they are well known centers of one-on-one basement brawls. Soon these organizations grow into groups that try to completely break down society as we know it. While Norton's character tries to stop it, he doesn't know that the entire thing was on his own accord. While I learned something new about how the human psyche works, I also regained a new love for fighting. I recommend this movie whole heartedly."	5.0	THEY FIGHTIN' IN THE CLUB...A TALE OF TWO MINDS	2006-02-23	2	0	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3PBIZG3NB8501	Jonathan L Thompson	Fight club has gotten a bad rap among professional reviewers, so here's my take.  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!  This is by far one of the best films to come out of our so-called Generation X (I loved their first album).  It is a mantra for our lost souls, it shows us the truth about consumerism and materialism.  It's been called facistic and violent and cruel...  Perhaps it IS all these things, but our society is ALSO all these things.  You can't comment on the state of a society using a different language than the one spoken there.  We live inside this violent, cruel, and yes, even facist American culture and we must see it for what it is.  Fight Club helps this process along considerably.  I'm not telling you to go out and start beating each other up, but definitly take *SOME* of what this movie has to say to heart.  Besides that, Ed Norton is one of the most versitile actors working right now and is performance is EXCELLENT.  Check out Helena B-C's American accent too!  Great work.	5.0	That felt good...

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1XVLNN4IBM9GX	Jonathan M. Lourie	"This is a movie that I dismissed when it was in the theaters.  It has now achieved ""cult"" status.  While on its surface it appears to be a celebration of male violence it is much more than that. It is very violent at times and is certainly gritty and dark.  But this violence is necessary to the plot and where the director is leading the watcher.Fight Club is  a modern allegory which deals with redemption and salvation, although turning these concepts on their head.  Edward Norton does a great job as the disillusioned male filled with self loathing searching for the meaning of what it is to be a man in the mordern world.  He is a ""feminized"" male yuppie, with trendy Scandinavian furniture, a trendy condo and a meaningless life.  As Pitt's character observes in a memorable line, ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time""Brad Pitt does a great job of portraying the glib charismatic one dimensional proto-male.  Together Norton and Pitt start Fight Club, where men join to brawl in secret locations to feel alive and find meaning and self worth through the infliction and receipt of pain.  It sounds odd to me but it works in the movie.  But to dismiss this movie as a no holds barred, bare knuckle, fight movie is to miss the whole point of the movie.Helena Bonham Carter hands in a good, but not great performance, as the female foil.  She seems to work a bit too hard at her character and therefore puts a wrinkle in the movie illusion.  The appearance of Meat Loaf -  always a treat - is one of the highlights of the movie, portraying the confused male, Bob Paulsen.This is a movie that you have to watch until the end.  There are plot twists and surprises which are epic.  If you watch the movie only part way through or do not pay attention closely enough you will miss the nuances, symbolism and plot devices that make this movie fun to watch and entice you to think about it long after the movie is over.  This is one movie that is better the next day as you turn it over in your head.Be warned -  this is not a date movie.  And there is some clumsiness to the direction and the movie sometimes stumbles.  But what I really like about this movie is that unlike many of the shallow and flat movies that never strive for anything more than entertainment, this movie reaches higher and manages to hit the high notes enough that make it worth the experience."	4.0	Fight Club Plays Long After Its Over	2006-03-31	4	4	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1J1QS7I60O018	Jonathan Sabin	"My brother-in-law loaned us the ""Fight Club"" DVD about 3 months ago and I kept putting off viewing it because of my preconceived notions about the film.From seeing the previews, I had the idea that the film glorified fighting: I recalled a scene where Brad Pitt's character announces an 'assignment' --to go out and start a fight with a stranger.My reaction at the time was extremely negative. I thought it was, at best, stupid, and at worst, completely irresponsible.Damn was I wrong! When my wife asked me if we were ""ever"" going to watch the DVD, I reluctantly gave in. A little over two hours later I had to admit: I LOVED it!Ed Norton plays the ""Narrator."" When the film opens, Norton has the barrel of a gun inserted in his mouth, courtesy of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt.) Norton (as the Narrator) explains how he's arrived at this less-than-pleasant point in his life, and the film flashes back to a time shortly before Narrator meets Durden.We learn that Narrator works for a ""major"" automobile manufacturer in a position of questionable moral standing. Though it evidently pays well, (based upon his very well-decorated, upscale apartment), it involves making judgements for the company as to whether or not to recall autos based upon a mathematical formula that calculates the cost of lawsuits vs. the cost of actually fixing the problem. In a nutshell, if the lawsuits are cheaper, people die. This disturbs Narrator, but not so much that he's willing to give up the perks of the job.Returning from one of his frequent cross-country business trips, he winds up sitting next to Durden. Striking up a conversation, he learns that Durden is somewhat mysterious, even to the point of holding back what he does for a living, although he ultimately reveals that he's a manufacturer of hand-made soap, and gives Narrator a card.Good thing. Because when Narrator gets home from the airport, he finds that all of his beloved possessions are scattered around the foot of his apartment building, having been blown out the windows by a terrific explosion.Having no place to spend the night, he calls his new friend, they meet for a couple of beers, and upon leaving the bar, Durden eggs him on about ""not asking"" if he can stay at his place. While at first he denies that was the intent of his having called him, he finally gives in and asks Durden if he'd mind. He wouldn't. But before they go walking off to Durden's house, Durden asks Narrator to hit him. Hard.Narrator looks at him as if he's insane, but after being asked a couple of times, Narrator finally give in and clocks him in the ear. Durden returns the punch and they end up both 'going at it.' Much to his surprise, Narrator finds that the fight was absolutely exhilarating. And thus begins a very strange, but very well-done movie."	4.0	Glad I gave in!	2002-07-25	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A35HF8V3AZR0O	Jon Ballenger	"Fight Club is one of those movies that you either love or hate. In my case, I found the plot and characters very interesting. The idea of feeling good (or bad, I was not sure) about your life by pounding the crap out of each other was an idea that might not have worked out under another director's belt. But Fight Club's director, David Fincher (Se7en, Alien 3) does what he does best in creating a dark, creepy setting, full of plot twists and clever dialogue. In the beginning, Fight Club is full of humor. Our unnamed hero goes to support groups for people with various diseases. Although he does not have any of these diseases, he goes to feel better about himself. The first 30 minutes could be described as a dark comedy, but as the film progresses into the actual ""Fight Club"" stage, it gets more and more like a psychological thriller. Though, through bloody fights and confusing plot twists, we begin to see that Fight Club is much more than just a thriller. It tells us that we need to hnestly confront our own demons in order to figure out who we are, who we want to become, and how to take control of our lives. With good performances all around, I recomend Fight Club highly to anyone who wants more than just an ordinary thrill ride.

David Finch's direction, Brad Pitt is hilarious and great, Edward Norton magnificent, Helena Bonham Carter too. There are some travelling/macro/zoom out scenes that'll keep your finger on the rewind button. The scene where Norton fight with his boss is memorable. As is the catalog view of the world. The art direction is beautiful. Some fight scenes are hard, but they're fast, have a reason to be there and are not &quot;butcher made&quot;. As I said, this is not a movie on violence, like Warriors is. The real fight, here, is personal. Can't say more. The extras are great, just like on the Se7en DVD, also directed by Fincher. There are making off of most interesting scenes, lots of commentaries, a funny faux products catalog and other things that'll keep you entertained for many times. I had some blockings against this movie, since and imbecil entered a cinema here in Sao Paulo with something like an Uzi and killed 3 people on a session of it. Well, after seeing the trailer on the web and watching it, I realized that that guy was much more than an imbecil: a psycho that was involved with drugs, family problems and much more and, thanks to all his mind blowing addictions and problems misunderstood this movie.

So, all I will do is give my own ten short and punchy (pun intended) reasons why ""Fight Club"" is a must-see DVD:1) The complex characters. I loved the way viewers can look on the actions of our heroes as maybe a little strange (and even feel outright revulsion as the ""fight club"" concept flowers among their hundreds of followers), yet we can still identify and sympathize with the cultural pressures that drove them to develop their unusual outlet.2) The bizarre, jaw-dropping scenes. Swiping discarded human fat from the dumpsters at the liposuction clinic so that our heroes can make designer soap from it and sell it back to fat-cat women blissfully unaware that they contributed the main ingredient for its manufacture? I was on the floor!3) David Fincher's direction. Never over-directed, never under-directed. Just right.4) The ""Sixth Sense"" style revelation about four-fifths of the way in. It was clever and surprising, and provided yet another reason to watch the film a second time, to catch all the subtle clues planted early on.5)All the extras in the DVD edition. It takes a second disc to fit them all. Nuff said.6) The amazingly funny scenes. Even the throw-away lines had me rolling, like when we learned Tyler was the defendent in a class-action suit filed as a result of the high urine content in the soup he was serving at the hotel restaurant where he worked!7) The crystal-clear DVD transfer. What a picture!8) The great packaging, colorful and eye-catching. And I loved that the booklet with the DVDs proudly included as many negative reviews of the film as positive ones. So subversive!9) The great acting. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and-- yes!-- Meat Loaf were all perfectly in tune with the material and made us totally believe in them, despite the crazy situations in which they found themselves. And Meat Loaf accomplished that while wearing large female breasts for the duration of the film!10) The closing moments. What vision! We see tender words exchanged in the foreground between two of the major characters (I don't want to give too much away here) while outside the window behind them unfolds the strangest, most apocalyptic vision seen in a movie in recent years. I didn't know whether to laugh or stare in amazement, so I did both.I made the mistake of missing this film during its theatrical run (temporary insanity on my part), but had a ball discovering it on DVD...."	5.0	Buy or rent this right now!	2000-06-29	0	0	0

This movie is the best directed movie I've seen and is definitely in my Top Ten. This movie is very well-acted, well-directed, and has a very clever and twisted plot. The movie follows a nameless, forsaken man (Edward Norton) that hates his job and sees nothing out of life. On a plane, he meets an anarchist that makes and sells soap, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The two create a club called ""Fight Club"" that invites other forsaken men to release their tension by beating each other's brains out. Tyler keeps wanting to take the club up a notch and ends up creating a terroist army to abolish credit card companies to rid debt.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1NX4ZZ1DGJEOW	Josh Horner	I watched this movie on the fourth of July. It ended up being a great choice for Independence Day. I am 24 years old and relate to many of the social problems related in this film. Being that capitalism drives this  country it is obivious that we as a people have to consume large quanities  of products to run our economy. Everywhere you look and I mean everywhere;  there is an advertisement telling you of your need to buy. billboards,  television comercials, magazines, matchbooks, and whatever else.  Consumerism can be a soul taking action once people begin to equate what  they own with who they are. Television is a big culprit in this. Be like  Mike drink Gatorade(gatorade is a trademark of blah..blah..blah) drive this  car it says you're successful. As many of my generation I grew up with the  wonderful electronic babysitter. It was always on in my house think of it  as a communal fireplace. I had no real direction in life other than I felt  the need to be entertained. Fight club also takles the fact that men have  been feminized over the years. Men in are current climate are seen mostly  as sperm donors rather than people. Their masculine agressive instincts are  seen as a negative. So take an T.V overdosed male, place him in an eight by  eight cubicle after college in a stressful job. How does that person cope.  Fight club faces these issues by showing extremes. It offers no outcomes  only the problems. Which I feel is a flaw of the film. To those who dislike  the movie I say this. Should we really turn a blind eye to the ugliness  that sometimes surfaces in life? I feel we should think about them to try  to solutions on an individual level. Which is what I feel this movie was  about. Raising an issue to provoke thought. Also Fight Club does not  promote anarchy.	5.0	consumer beware	2000-07-12	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1IRBYOY6E72NT	Joshua S. Johnson	The first Rule of Fightclub...wathc this movie. From begiining to end this visually stunning and superbly directed film takes you for one wild ride. Beneath the bare fisted brawls and raging choas sprawls an intense web of deep philosophical meaning. Fight Club tackles the issue of a mans place in society where the onslaught of the politically correct and the idea of the &quot;sensitive man&quot; has left him wondering who we are and who we should be. A profoundly moving yet visceral film, Fight CLub delivers. I give this movie five big stars. Top tan movie. I also highly recommend the book, by Chuck Palahniuk for a thoroughly enjoyable read.	5.0	Bare Fisted Brawls, Deep Philosophical Meanings	2002-09-19	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ATYQU02NEM2TT	Joshua Wolf	American Beauty may have taken all the laurels in 1999, but Fight Club is a much better treatment of the same theme. Watching American Beauty, I was struck by how well it was made, but also by how familiar everything in the movie seemed as it moved toward its inevitable, obvious conclusion.Fight Club, however, is a braver, bolder film. It's the story of a man's alienation from consumer culture and the notions of masculine identity it foists upon him, just like American Beauty. Except that the punches in this movie are more physical than emotional, and Fight Club doesn't pull any. The script is sharply perceptive, with a mean wit. And nobody whines in this film.Director David Fincher imbues the film with a style that's very fresh and modern without resorting to hackneyed tricks like quick edits (although there are a few choice ones- if you see the movie, you'll know what I mean) or shaky handicams. He gives the narrator's corporate world a queasy antiseptic green glow, nicely matched against the wet, dark grime of the fight clubs. Don't let the dreary sets fool you though- Fincher manages to film them beautifully.Ed Norton is great as the narrator, but hey, he's great in everything. Fincher, however, has managed to pull some great acting from actors playing against type. Brad Pitt's surprisingly excellent as the anarchist/philosopher/bum Tyler Durden, but I think he's ultimately upstaged by Jared Leto as the blond pretty-boy whom Ed Norton beats to a pulp. Great, ballsy performance by Helena Bonham Carter as an unlikely ingenue. And Meat Loaf- I hate to say it, but he was really really really good.Like any good &quot;twist&quot; movie, Fight Club has a climatic revelation that both blindsides you and makes complete narrative sense. It begs to be watched a second time, and there's plenty of clever detail and juicy lines you probably missed the first time. The DVD's got some pretty good extras- among them, a bunch of commentary tracks, and deleted scenes. Look out for Helena Bonham Carter's original pillow talk line.It's a shame this film was largely overlooked when it was released, because it's a brave, original film. There's plenty of violence in Fight Club, but it's definitely not a glorification of it, but rather a vehicle for some insightul ideas about society. On the other hand, this film's definitely got serious nihilist and anarchist themes running through it, and is sure to offend upright citizens everywhere. Well, the credit card companies, at least.	5.0	A great underappreciated film	2001-04-05	1	1	0

Not only is the anamorphic widescreen transfer amazing(the quick frames of Tyler seem to  pop off the screen) but this film is loaded with, count them, FOUR audio  commentaries.  If you are a film buff or just an amateur moviegoer, these  commentaries are invaluable tools to finding out how the film is made.  We  have commentary by director David Fincher, one by Fincher, Pitt, Norton,  and Bonham Carter, one with Novelist Chuck Palahniuk and screenwriter Jim  Uhls, and one with the cinematographer and special FX coordinator.  And  that's just on disk 1!  The second disc features hours of supplementary  materials, ie. Trailers, PSM's, Interviews, and behind the scenes footage.  It is an extrodinary set and is the perfect component to any great dvd  collection.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A84P2QF6L57YX	J. Rossi	This is one of the best DVDs that has been produced yet. The movie itself is a scathing criticism of our commercially-driven me-first culture where real feelings have been replaced by TV clap trap faux-emotion. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as Tyler and Jack work extremely well together. Their interlplay in the movie makes the film move while David Fincher's direction is nearly flawless. He is albe to keep the film moving forward in an interesting way while Tyler and Jack continue to examine their role in a society that cares more about the rich and famous than the other 99.9% of the world. This is neo-socialism at its best. The adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book is excellent. All in all the movie is engaging while at the same time extremely fun to watch. It allows you to step outside of the world you know (if just for two hours) and experience an entirely different existence.The DVD package is top notch. There are two discs - the first is the movie and the second is full of behind the scenes glimpses, commentary from Fincher, Pitt and Norton, and all kinds of other goodies. Threre is enough in this package to keep you busy for a whole afternoon. This is the best example of what DVD movies should contain, and now they are just starting to figure it out and include loads of extras on a lot of the new ones. Buy this for yourself and experience a great movie and (one of) the impetus for the new breed of DVD packages.	4.0	I'm breaking the first rule of Fight Club	2001-02-05	0	0	0

That makes this movie very diffrent from those Stenven Seagal movies(obvious, isn't it?). I'm not saying this movie is for those who 'educated and knows stuffs' but for everyone! When you watch it, you WILL feel something, and you will think about it. That's what happened to me when i watched it first time(i watched this movie about 7 times ever since and i think i'm beginning to understand what i felt but..i won't tell ya, you figure it out by yerself).  I'm not talking about the obvious theme; mankind's desire to return to the primitive life they once had long time ago, which is nothing but a cliche. However this movie has something else, more than that. So like i said, when you watch it, you will feel it.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A22EGHMXFEUPTN	"""jstark182"""	This Special Edition Fight Club DVD from 20 Century Fox is definitely special, it's great and will not easily be matched, except maybe by Criterion. This DVD has so many great extra features that it's mind  boggling, and the picture and sound are just about perfect.  It's admirable  to see that the people who were involved in producing this DVD with 20th  Century Fox took their time and didn't settle for just presenting the  letterbox, 1 behind the scenes, trailer, and scene access, which would have  been OK, but, instead pushed the limits of what can and should be done on  DVD.  After all, why not use the DVD technology to present something  different and better than VHS and Laserdisc. The movie itself is very  underrated by many critics and viewers.  The performances are very good,  especially Helena Bohnam Carter and director David Fincher manages to  create a moody surreal atmosphere that is both beautiful and horrific. The  incredibly bad trashing of this film reminds me of one of my favorite films  &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; which when released in 1960, also dealt with  controversial subject matter on violence, and was similarly trashed by  stuffed shirt critics and viewers who give opinions depending on the mood  they're in at the time. Everyone who owns a DVD player should own this  Fight Club DVD, or might as well throw your DVD player away.

Pitt is extroadinary as Tyler Durden, a guy with a twisted philosophy, and Norton is amazing as Jack's body parts, or, in simpler, the narrator.

One of the most surprising - okay, shocking - amazing, disturbing, riveting, strangely funny (nervous laughter), and utterly can't-take-my-eyes-off-it movies ever made. A perfect commentary on the hyper-achieving, consumption-centric 1990s, Fight Club puts us on a bullet train from IKEA to anarchy knowing full well that Tyler's lunatics have blown the tracks at some point and we won't get there in one piece.  Fincher does an expert job of unwinding the film style from numb and glassy smooth to all the way crazy, gently ramping up the contrast, introducing bits of grit and jitter until until all you want is a bath and a cup of hot cocoa.  Or Thorazine.  I love this movie and immediately bought a copy.  Odd thing is that I rarely choose to watch it of my own volition.

Everything about the movie is excellent: The innovative plot, the acting, the settings, the cool CGI special effects, the subliminal messages, the disparate interpretations on just what the movie's message was. This is one of those movies nobody is indifferent to: No matter how you feel about it in the end, you cannot say you were not moved by it. As for the DVD, its quality is first-rate, and I loved the bonus materials, but I have just one small gripe: Why make two discs when one two-sided disc would have worked fine?

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A18BV4O63DOWNH	"""juno2"""	&quot;Fight Club&quot;  is a how-to movie; e.g., how to diss the  &quot;Establishment&quot;  and otherwise act like a twelve-year-old.  We learn the liberating catharsis of going to the bathroom in someone's soup, spraying water on passers-by, beating the hell out of our friends, forming  a terrorist boys' club, and so forth.  Immature young men will be  deliciously provoked by this movie; others will want to give it a wide  berth.Brad Pitt wears obnoxious floral-print shirts and a bottle of Dep  on his head.  Edward Norton's Narrator is self-referentially chatty -- he  won't allow us to simply absorb what we're seeing; he must give us a  smart-alleck play-by-play of everything.  The photography is some of the  worst I've seen lately:  it has the color of Army camouflage  (but I guess  that's what's supposed to be clever about it).The film tries to be  &quot;intelligent&quot;  early on, but only achieves a facile cleverness.  It's far too conscious of the audience's reactions, which mars the supposed  purpose of  &quot;enlightening&quot;  us to the ugly truths about our  commericalized society.  The truth about Tyler Durden, as revealed at the  end of the movie, will not surprise smart viewers, but it will doubtlessly  blow away its target audience:  angry 15-year-old boys who will make a cult  phenom of it, forever placing it in the ranks of the Cool Movies.

It is a very possible reaction to Radiohead's OK Computer, the best musical elaboration of the post-modern mundane mass of herd men - ""let down and hanging around.""Anomie or nihilism should be a justifiably much larger concern for the modern individual. Just look at the stupid commercials for yogurt that talk about women getting ready to go to work - all lining up to head off to the grist. Feminism - the women want misery! Quit running around and sit down and face your own life, face up to how meaningless most of what you do is.Watch Fight Club, see what I'm talking about, and then go read the real thing: Nietzsche. That's all Fight Club is, Nietzsche for dummies. Nietzsche's ideas are so novel and challanging that most fans of Fight Club can overlook the nonsensical climax and enjoy the social commentary.That is my recommendation. Read Nietzsche. If you need to watch Fight Club along the way, fine.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A33PNNJOWEGH3Y	J. Wolfson	Why is it that when people see Fight Club, some think that the film endorses violence or anarchy? When you read Romeo and Juliet, are you supposed to think that violence solves life's problems? When you look at Guernica, do you think that bombings are beneficial to human life?Fight Club is not an 'action' movie. It is a black comedy featuring social commentary and revolutionary visuals. It also features one of the greatest acting talents of our time, Edward Norton, as well as one of the most underrated actors, Brad Pitt, in a fantastic journey through the dark heart of american men. The cinematography, direction, sound and computer effects are all outstanding. They are beyond reproach.Many complain about the plot. Well, it started as a novel, and it was quite consistent and faithful to the original. Others complain that the ending was unbelievable and ruined the movie. Well, this is simply unfortunate. I personally thought the ending was fantastic, and gave the film a second layer where before there was but one. If you dislike the ending, you probably did not allow the film to draw you in and surround you in its universe. This movie requires your full attention and an open mind.If you require large explosions, naked women and extreme violence to enjoy a film, you probably won't like fight club. Ironically, the film does feature all three in varying degrees. But most importantly, the themes and opinions put forth in Fight Club are not necessarily those of the filmmakers. I'm sure David Fincher doesn't endorse murder or other depravity, but he felt it was important to include in the film to be faithful to the story. Don't persecute the film for its themes and mistake content for a message. Simply enjoy the world it creates and don't judge. The film certainly doesn't.	5.0	True Art . . .

Zaun ""Wakkorotti"""	This movie continues to increasingly strike home for me each time I watch it as I've gotten older and closer to the age of the main characters.  As I've depressingly realized in my own lifestyle, material possesions tend to define my entire self image at times.  And as this film tells us, we have to fight against that urge to conform to what our society would otherwise tell us to embody: a productive worker-bee drone that spends and consumes as much as possible while at the same time thinking as little as possible to accept the status quo.	5.0	Modern Classic - A Movie To Base Your Life On	2006-02-23	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AXPXB04XULN3E	K0MMIE	This Movie was easily the greatest movie I have ever seen.  At nopoint was I not amazed by its gorgeous cinemetography, or its plot that keeps the audience raptured.  This movie told you to think outside the box, so natuarally those who cling to the inner walls of the box will resent the message in this movie. I work in a movie theatre and this movie was definently snubbed by the public, looking at the title and wondering why Jean Claude Van Damme wasn't in it. The fact that the DVD will be a double disc crammed full with features only goes to show how much thought and care was put into this great film. I say film because a movie is something made by production companies to earn money.  While Fight Club is a film because it certainly did not make money, it also gives the world a message about your world and how to percieve it. I would seriously recommend to anyone to inves the $4.75 needed to rent this movie.	5.0	A Masterpiece of Epic Porportions: Hated by Conformists	2000-03-28	4	3	1

Dark, humorous and totally bizarre, with interesting characters played by an awesome cast.  I saw this in the theater in 1999, and watch it religiously 15 years later.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A339YKBOO7RTZ0	Kade	Every negative review I have seen of this film I have to ask myself what movie these people were watching.  Most critics seem to be completely numb to such things as subtlety, metaphor, sub-text, and content.  this film had  all of these in spades!  I thnk that a lot of people simply did not get the  meaning of this film.  It goes far deeper than the  &quot;fight-the-power&quot; plot line that one reviewer on Amazon  describes.  This film is worth a second, third, fourth, etc... ad infinitum  viewing.  Even paying close attention (I had some idea what to expect) I  probably missed stuff that will amaze me when I buy the video (which I will  do the day this thing comes out! ).  Ignore what the bad reviews say  because those people couldn't see past a couple fist-fights to see the  brutal beauty of what this film is.  This film (as well as the novel it is  based on) are like Hemingway on steroids, but with more intelligence.	5.0	Ignore all negative reviews of this film	2000-02-17	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1NIEIENEWXCCQ	kaioatey	Hmmm...This is an excellently acted, directed and produced film. Based on a creepy self-loathing script replete with scato-physical and scato-sexual fantasies. It would seem that the writer is exorcising his geeky ghosts at the expense of the viewing (and paying) public. The pseudo-anarchism seems like a cry for help. Can one appreciate great acting based on a bombastic self-indulgent script? There, right there, is the reviewer's dilemma.	3.0	reviewer's dilemma	2011-02-27	5	0	5
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AWKP2OZY4WB8M	Kalika	Heck, you don't even have to be a Brad Pitt fan to enjoy this movie (though I must admit, the shirtless and covered in blood look really works for him...)The Cast: We have a hard hitting, off the wall, home-made dynamite and soap producer. A therapy/help session - addicted insomniac. The beautiful chain smoking beauty that comes between tham, and the underground bloody mayhem of Fight Club.This is a great movie, well cast and superbly acted. If you're not especially fond of wanton violence nd lots of blood, then I wouldn't say this movie is for you. However, it's not completely superficial. There's a lot going on underneath the surface, clues to the excellent twist at the end. You'll need to watch it again, just to pick them out. So, we've got cute guys, shirtless and beating each other up as a form of therapy, a psychological twist that will make your head spin and lots of mayhem on the side for fun. A formula for a witty and thought-provoking film. (Even if the only thoughts that are provoked are: &quot;Wow, Brad Pitt is really really cute!&quot;)As the box says:MischiefMayhemSoap.Welcome to Fight Club.	5.0	First Rule of Fight Club---buy the film	2004-03-15	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A34H80WFA0P37N	"K. Anderson ""SCAR, of Upright Figurine"""	I'm not going to lie. I liked this movie well before i even purchased this product. I loved the weaving dynamics of the story, and it's dichotomy of  societal issues and personal growth. But this is not about that. This is about the product. The plastic discs encoded with a set of zeros and ones, and wrapped in a hardened paper shell. When it comes to that, I am also grandly impressed. The casing was artistic to say the least. A cacaphony-esque melee of imagery and mixed reviews, it shows the good along with the bad. All too often we see case seething with blatantly optomistic reviews, bestowing great acolades on these movies, that in most cases, are sub-par. This is not the case. As with most great movies, this one was hated. And these scathing remarks were not left unmentioned. Kudos to you, 20th Century Fox. Along side this is a hodgepodge of movie stills, quotable quotes, and propaganda, enticing the viewer into the ever addictive world of Fight Club. So what are we to do in this situation? Well we do what any consumer does after devouring the external imagery: we put the dvd in. The first disc is of course the movie. It is as we all remember, so i am not going to get into that. However, the commentary was entertainment in itself. A riotous mixture of philisophical wanings, whimsical musings, and technical meanerings, this was one of the highlights of my days for a FEW days. After finishing the movie (and all of it's commentaried versions), I proceeded to put the second dvd in. This is where the product gets it's less than perfect rating. The second disc, though inclusive of many funny, and poignant moments, just seemed to lack the extras that make this a truely fantastic disc. I do however recommend watching the publis service announcements. They were a highlight on disc two. So in conclusion, I rate this a four star product. The movie itself is equal to five alone but when paying for a special edition, I was just expecting something a little more special. Do not get me wrong though. This was a great buy and I would buy it again if I had to, so i urge you to get it as well. You will be pleased with this purchase for years to come.SCAR	5.0	An Excellent Addition To Any Audio/Visual Library	2007-03-08	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AU8C496DUFA0V	Kari	What can you say about a movie this shocking and fearless?  I don't even like violence, but this is one of my favorite films.  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were both excellent in their roles.  I have to say that I'm glad that Pitt is finally getting the respect he deserves from the male audience.  I think that before this film, he was viewed as a &quot;teeny-bop heart throb,&quot; which I always believed was an unfair description.  After his performances in such films as &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and &quot;12 Monkeys,&quot; I think he proved himself.  But apparently &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the movie that has earned him the respect he deserves as an actor.I respect the way the film followed the book closely, and I think it actually worked even better on the sceen.  And besides from the movie itself, this DVD is also one of the better &quot;Special edition&quot; DVDs out there.  It contains lots of nifty extras, that are very entertaining all alone.Excellent film.  Excellent DVD.	5.0	What can I say? Wow!	2001-01-15	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1DDD7W1HS6VT6	karl b.	There is a (perhaps growing) element  of macho anarchism that this film explores, much like American History X did in melodramatic form. It is built around a tribal male bonding that can be seen in various densities in the streets of our cities, the bleachers of  sports stadiums, or for that  matter, the offices of the corporate empire which is the ostensible villain  of this fable. Fight Club treats this  world with stylish, comedic  objectivity. The neurotic protagonist(s) display the polarities of cynical  conformity and violent revolt to the petty, fraudulent culture around them.  Something 'real' is found for a time in bareknuckle fisticuffs, a thudding  embrace of physical extremes and provocations to 'civilized' society. But  as these things go, it devolves into outright sabotage and guerilla  warfare. They create a substrata free of  social affectations, or more  accurately replace these with their own. There is a sinister side to this  subculture in the flesh, exemplified in gangsters, hooligans, skinheads and  wall street raiders; but this films treats it all with surreal  satire.Most of the movie takes place in basements, and at night, in the  lost outer regions of the rust belt. This forms an encroaching perimeter as  the jungle retakes the bones of ruined industry, turning its icons of  'progress' into its weapons-- soap out of lyposuction, explosives out of  orange juice and fertilizer. The film is very well acted. The unnamed  narrator's (Ed Norton) cool incomprehension contrasts sympathetically with  the schizophrenic mastermind in the out of control Tyler Durden (Brad  Pitt). Director Fincher never lets the on screen pathos, intrude on the  dark humour though.  Helen Bonham Carter manages to be both a wasted, end  of the tether female gargoyle and deliciously sexy as well.The whole  thing is like an inverted Eden story, innocence of a sort reclaimed,  somewhere beyond rock bottom. It really has to be watched twice to 'get'  some of the ambiguous dialogue once all is revealed. The film might have  worked better if it left a little more to imagination. It became cartoonish  in spots where some well placed dramatic irony and understatement might  have sufficed more effectively.  Still, the film evokes a portentous  finality. If the end of days is here, this gothic black comedy has its  number, much more so than any of the year's apocalyptic extravaganzas. The  message is its all around you, seeing it is just a question of attitude.  Despite its flaws-- the invention, cast and generally enjoyable mayhem  deserve  a bonus star, up to 5, especially for this genre.	5.0	fists and fuel bombs	2000-05-02	12	9	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ABQPBY4VNK40Y	Karl Flaig	"Fight Club starts off great.  Fincher loads on the music, the witty voice-over and superbly placed visuals.  Ten minutes into the film it appears as if the viewer is in for a wry, dark trip.  But that potential  never comes to fruition.  Rather than continuing to build the movie begins  a gradual descent into mediocrity and ridiculousness.  By the last twenty  minutes Fincher has gone into a nosedive, leaving viewers with two choices:  hitting the stop button or sitting through this teenage angst-ridden bilge.  What started off as a promising commentary on the loneliness and  powerlessness of an individual in today's society quickly turns into some  nihilistic hokum.  Ludicrous plot ""twists"" (which are obvious to even a  five year old) are piled on top of one another to explain the proceedings  as the movie becomes more and more silly.  By the end, you're wishing Finch  were at a Fight Club you frequent so you could have a chance to beat him  senseless for making this monstrosity.  Not even Ed Norton could save this  movie.  Brad Pitt's one contribution would be his chiseled form and as  we've seen with all his other work, looks don't make a movie.  All in all,  Fight Club is possibly one of the most inane, childish films I've ever had  the misfortune to sit through."	1.0	One of the worst films of 1999	2000-06-07	65	19	46

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AH59HRR3E97VT	Kate Marie	"After a doctor's visit, a handsome young insomniac decides he'll follow the doctor's suggestions to visit miscellaneous support groups to learn what true suffering is. Immediately he begins to find some relief and makes a new friend named Bob who is suffering from testicular cancer. But he also finds an intriguing young woman named Marla Singer who also enjoys frequenting support groups. Although she also doesn't suffer from any of the diseases and disorders that they pretend to have, he finds it impossible to feel the group's impact whenever Marla's around. After a series of possibly unfortunate events, he finds himself staying with a very new friend named Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden is everything this insomniac isn't and he quickly teaches him everything he needs to know. After an open invitation to fight one another outside of a bar one evening, the two develop a special bond and begin Fight Club. Even with a set of rules like, ""the first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club"" more young men begin joining the underground boxing matches. However something incredibly dark begins to develop and Project Mayhem is created. Also, Marla returns. As the plot climaxes with the death of a dear friend, the insomniac's views on Fight Club and Project Mayhem are strangely distorted and he begins to seek a way out of the mess he's stuck in.With an ultimate cast of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and director David Fincher, this amazing adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book is definitely worthwhile for anyone looking for a psychological thriller that will keep you in search of the answer until the last few scenes. This is definitely one of those movies where you must sit through start to finish to fully understand. After watching it the first time, viewers will be able to pick up on little hints throughout the film which make every time an enjoyable experience.I've seen this film probably over a hundred times and I still can't get enough of it!"	5.0	I am Jack's Review of Fight Club	2011-04-08	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2M5MMHCMEFO0G	"Katherine Curtis ""mokat98"""	I'll be honest, the first time i watched this movie, i hated it. I thought it was the worse movie of 99, a complete waste of time, film and talent. I didn't get it, the end just left me completly lost, why people called it one of the years best confused me even more.A few months later, my cousin asked me if i had ever seen it, and i told her i did and that i wasn't fond of it. A week later, she had convinced me to give it a second try (this kinda thing runs in the family blood). A month after that i find it on HBO or some other channel and decided why not try it again.This is one of those movies that needs to be viewed twice, and i know reviews usually say something along the movies plot line, but to do that with Fight Club might risk giving something away. It isn't your regular, 'you've seen one and you've seen them all' movie, it's differnt, kinda a depressing differnent, but still in a good way (the second time around). It makes me wonder if i should give Vanilla Sky and Magnolia another try, tho the later you might have to threaten me with a root cannel before i agree to waste another 4 hours of my life away.	4.0	and i hated it	2002-12-30	2	2	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3W07V9CZALBTG	kath	Not since 'Natural Born Killers' has there been such a furore over a film.  Reviews focus on the 'gratuitous violence' of the fight scenes, it's 'pro-fascist stance' and it's inability to actually provide any depth or  intelligence... However, these comments came from people that obviously  really didn't grasp (or even see) any of the movie they were discussing.  Fight Club is cinema at its most innovative, and from the very opening  scenes it is clear that it is not going to be the testosterone-fuelled  fist-fest that so may (including myself) thought it would be. The film  echoes in many ways the sentiments of 'American Beauty': our protagonist in  (mid-life) crisis, disenchanted with today's consumerist society, searching  for his equilibrium, yet is considerably more visceral in style and  content. The 'plot' is simple, (yet you WILL want to see it at least  twice!) although there are too many intracacies to into in such a short  space.  It also shows the 3 main actors (Norton, Pitt and Bonham-Carter) at  their best... not to mention the chance to see Meatloaf with a huge pair of  breasts! It is extremely unfortunate that this film has been so widely  overlooked, presumably due to the focus on the fight scenes (which as one  of the commentaries succinctly notes are not dissimilar in nature or  violence to what anyone would've previously seen in 'Rocky' films, merely  in a less 'family-oriented feel-good' context), because these only feature  in a small portion of the film. Yes, it is violent, but moreover it is also  hilariously funny and often extremely poignant.  And as a DVD it has  possibly the best array of special features that will keep you enthralled  for days!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3FVFJ8D95E9KY	"K. Bentley ""amateur critic"""	Fight Club is an in-your-face film which reflects reality and socilogy better than any other movie I can think of. It begins with the protagonist, his insomnia, and finding solace in attending support groups. He is also materialistic browsing through IKEA catalogues looking for the 'dining set that best defines him' and works at a lucrative job. His life is about to chance when he meets the eccentric and somewhat psychotic Tyler Durden on an airplane, and ends up living with him aftersome extenuating circumstances. Throughout the film, Durden (played brilliantly by Brad Pitt) and the protagonist (Ed Norton) form their own way of life, randomly being philosophical and observing human nature and obstentanious materialism, and the 'fight club' they started turn into a mini-army, and the ending of the film is one of the most surprising twists ever in a movie.Adding to Norton and Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter plays the pessimistic ..., Marla Singer, who serves as a nuisance to the narrator but an object of Tyler's 'affection' (if you want to call it that). Surprisingly, Meat Loaf (that's right... that guy) plays Bob, a person whose life was destroyed by testicular cancer who is the protagonist's allie at Remaining Men Together (a support group for men w/ testicular cancer) and eventually joins the somewhat sadistic yet therapeudic ring of fight club.This movie is destined to be a classic. Powerful dialogues, breathtaking performances, suspense at every scene, and a study in sociology and humanity, only a few movies have reached the intensity of Fight Club. It's a film that demands to be analyzed and seen many times for pleasure or observation.	5.0	My favorite movie ever	2003-03-14	2	2	0

I just wanted to watch a movie about fighting, so why not watch one called ""Fight Club""?  I was really excited about seeing this, too, being a big fan of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.The majority of the movie was really great, it kept me watching because of the great mixture of drama, comedy, and violence.  The only problem was that the ending was quite unexpected.  I'm not going to say what happened (just in case you haven't seen it yet), but I will let you know that it actually made me think...which was not what I wanted to do at that time.  That was my first time watching it.The second time, I enjoyed it even more.  The acting is amazing, the story line is great, but it has a deeper ending than you would come to expect from a movie about a Fight Club.  Just as a warning for when you go and rent it...because you definitly should.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AZ871AFK178OZ	Keen to Analyze	It's a piece of art, very well done for what it set out to do. It has a lot of good messages about what life is and how it needs to change. However, the destructive nature of the film that never redeems itself/finds any redemption made me not particularly like this movie. It makes you think which is good. I actually watched it for a class at Seminary. We looked at religious themes in the movie. The debasement of the flesh, which many Saints throughout the century took on as a way to get to the spiritual is a theme in the movie. Of course we know this is too destructive.	2.0	Artistically done yet not my taste	2013-07-11	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2R0I45IF1NZJ0	Keith Copeland	David Fincher (in my personal opinion) is the personification of what is truly great about film making today. When it seems every film released in the last decade has been either some rehashed, recycled version of a  previous classic, or a sequel to an already rediculous story told two years  before it (i.e. &quot;Austin Powers&quot;) Fincher's ideas, style, etc,  protray his individuality and orginality as a director who pulls no punches  and appeals to the audience on a level that's always higher than the  &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; unlike so many films do these days  (i.e. &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;). &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a  perfect example of how intelligent, beautifully shot films can make it in  mainstream Hollywood. Too bad most of the other ones have to be independent  or foreign films.	5.0	Another Fincher Masterpiece	2000-02-23	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AZJV6BZ0MOQLS	-keith hale-	There is a need to avoid ruining this film for the unfortunate souls that haven't challenged themselves with it!  So the trailers and even some of the word of mouth lead me astray.  I too thought it was probably going to  be &quot;Top Gun meets Toughest Man In The World wrestling&quot;.  The  trailer did have touches of brilliance from the Tyler monologues, so i  didn't dismiss it.What made me finally go was that it was added to the  Midnight Movie list of my local Landmark Theatre, the Inwood in Dallas.  I've only seen ONE &quot;bad&quot; film there, and even it was  enjoyable!CAVEAT - PLEASE beware of setting people up with too high  expectations, like i did!  I was telling everyone it was the best film of  all time.  Sue me.  I was under the influence or brilliance, and genuine  originality.  But as a result some of my friends had what i call the  &quot;Fargo&quot; experience.  (If i hadn't heard how Earth-Vaporizingly  Magnificent Fargo was, i would have probably enjoyed it immensely.)Fight  club is outstanding.  But if they mentally multiply Citizen Kane by Dr.  Strangelove, stir in Life Of Brian to taste, and subtract (shudder)  Starshi* Troopers... they may actually be disappointed.*Side Note* -  (like the rest wasn't &quot;side&quot; enough) i convinced my dear friend  to enjoy this movie with my help.  She has completely lost her vision in  recent years, and so i rented it, and paused it to answer questions and  supply crucial visual cues.  I needed to be able to discuss it with her,  and i felt uniquely qualified, or at least willing to help her  &quot;watch&quot; it.  She loved it.  I had learned my caveat at that  point.So.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AM31WG1P8YX3E	Keith Watt	This film is amazing.  When I first saw the trailers I expected some macho attempt to satirize the political correctness of the 90's.  Instead it goes much deeper.  It evolves from a editorial on modern materialism to a true psycologial odyssey.  It's definately not to everyone's taste, but if you like dark satire with hints of humor along with an unpredictable, twisting plot, this film is for you.	5.0	This film rocks!	2002-08-16	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A345G0OZD8OZY8	"""keljen"""	This is in my opinion, one of the best movies of last year. The acting is superb and so is the writing. Protests of over-the-top violence in this film leave me a bit confused. Yeah, so there is a lot of fist fighting, but  for the exception of one fight, everyone is a good sport whether they win  or lose. I'm sure a fight could be a liberating experience because most of  us go through life trying to avoid confrontation for whatever reason. That  is beside the point, however because there is much more going in in this  film and repeated viewings are almost required.The DVD has some great  features. You can listen to four different commentaries while watching the  film. There are deleted scenes, storyboards, concept art and other cool  stuff. This is the way that all DVD's should be made. All of this can be  purchased for a good price, considering that there are two DVD's in this  edition. Highly Recommended!	5.0	A great movie with plenty of extra stuff on the DVD	2000-06-07	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1X6OKEF425Q2D	Kelly Corbin	I really did not want to see this movie, and after I saw it, I really didn't know what to think of it at first. First of all, whether you liked or hated the movie, it really does make you think about our society and how  out of control it is.  After thinking about it for awhile, I really do like  it and plan on ordering it.  What so many critics just do not understand is  that the movie is not about a bunch of guys releasing their anger and  tension by fighting: it is a very important warning to our society and how  it is so wrapped up in materialism and consumerism that it is basically  dead.  The acting was amazing: boy, has Brad Pitt really come a long way  from his Cool World and Thelma and Louise days--he was absolutely wonderful  as the psychotic Tyler Durden.  And Edward Norton-I keep gaining more and  more respect for this actor.  Ever since his debut in Primal Fear, he has  proven that he is one of the best actors in hollywood today.  All I can  say,is David Fincher, you are a genious!  I do recommend that everyone sees  this movie.Also, check out the soundtrack...it is amazing and full of  energy!	5.0	Thought-provoking film	2000-05-05	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2PXHFGJZBNLXB	Kenji Fujishima	"I had heard so much about David Fincher's popular 1999 film FIGHT CLUB that I felt that I owed myself to see what the big deal about this movie was about. Now that I have, my personal reaction can be summed up in this way: I respect the film's skill and style, but how were so many people sucked into swallowing this film whole?Yes, this film is very well-made. Director David Fincher is a virtuoso film stylist, and he brings his hard-rock style to bear in this film even more than he did with the disturbing SEVEN. It is his unrelenting but occasionally exciting style, as well as the good performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, that carries you along through most of the movie: this is a movie that vibrates with fever and energy, and the first half-hour of the movie really does draw you into the Narrator's dead-end life. (The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is often strikingly gritty.) And it must be said that FIGHT CLUB is never boring. How can you be bored by a movie that is as unremittingly violent, both physically and mentally, than this one? Or with Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, spouting off his magnetically anarchic gospel, telling us to rebel against all the lies we've been fed by, I guess, ""the establishment""? In its own way, FIGHT CLUB is a gripping visceral achievement.And yet, what does all this blood-stained machismo add up to in the end? To a blinding revelation that supposedly sheds new light on all that has gone before, and yet simply seems like something screenwriter Jim Uhls, adapting Chuck Palahniuk's book (which I haven't read), thought might be cool to throw in, following the lead of Christopher McQuarrie's big twist in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. But even that controversial twist seemed more, not less, convincing! Did people really actually take this film's big twist SERIOUSLY? Did they really buy it as easily as they apparently did? I shared Edward Norton's disbelief during the final stages: I wouldn't have believed it either.It is really a shame the filmmakers here felt that they had to manipulate the audience in this manner (although apparently, based on this film's popularity, they succeeded). If FIGHT CLUB had been less concerned with plot tricks than with Norton's character and how he gets out of the rut he feels he's in with his life, this film might have been an immeasurably better film. For me, all the graphic violence and, later, the fascism of this film really blunted whatever message Fincher and Uhls are trying to convey here. I seriously cannot tell whether this film is meant to be an attack of Tyler Durden's gleeful anarchy or a celebration, so explicit and indulgent this movie is regarding the violence it purports to condemn. Really, this film would have been a lot more disturbing if FIGHT CLUB had focused on the Narrator and the changes he makes in his sad life, instead of being merely ugly and muddled.As it is, FIGHT CLUB is an unfortunate mess of interesting ideas about rebelling against society buried under a lot of impressive filmmaking style and a lot of brutal violence. David Fincher is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker---his 1995 film SEVEN was an equally grisly but much more disturbingly effective serial-killer thriller---but this film is basically a triumph of style over substance. Though never boring, it is at heart a very stupid macho movie, and I am amazed that more people haven't seen right through its intellectual pretensions. Skip it."	3.0	Well-made and never boring, but rather ugly and muddled	2004-08-27	13	12	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AKWLOVMHSN41D	kenneth groom	Someone said that you either love or hate this film. Well I hated it. and  I  find it difficult to understand how anyone could do otherwise. It is an ugly, squalid, repulsive film about the dark side of human nature. Everything about it is depressing from the brutish thugs who spend their time bashing the hell out of each other, to the dirty, dank, derelict building  in which they carry on their odious activity. And it's unrealistic.They would all soon end up in Intensive care with broken noses and their handsome faces reduced to pulp. And why should any handsome bloke volunteer to have this done to them? And suffer the pain that goes with it?  It's not only not realistic, it doesn't make sense.Not only  do I hate this film but I find it inexplicable that someone of the calibre of Helena Bonham Carter should be willing to appear in it. It can have done her reputation no good (in my opinion). From the beauty of Merchant Ivory to this pretentious rubbish. What a come down.  However, I must admit I didn't see the whole film; I was so sickened I  couldn't watch any more.	2.0	A revolting  film.	2002-12-24	29	7	22

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A18OJGVKDMMMGU	Kevin Miller	There are some movies that can only be enjoyed on DVD.  The kind of movies that retain a certain level of theatrical magic the big movie houses hold.  Fight Club falls deep in this category.  The resolution and sound quality during the film are extremely high.  The first disc includes four audio tracks ranging from the director alone, to the cast together, remembering the movie as it runs, giving a behind-the-scenes play-by-play.The promotional material on the second disc is worth the purchase alone.  In addition to mini-documentaries on different topics from special effects to the over scoring during the opening tittle sequence.  This two pack combo can help you start a Fight Club of your own, in your living room.	5.0	A Great DVD	2001-01-17	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A324LH8S4C8U4W	Kevin Nieman	Who else but David Fincher could take a darkly comedic book like &quot;Fight Club&quot; and pump it up like a lab rat overdosed on caffeine?  The book's author, Chuck Palahnuik, even said that the filmed version was  better than his book in many ways. The book's themes of insomnia,  purposelessness, anti-consumerism, and nihilism, are all here in this film,  but Fincher doesn't just make this a static translation. He uses creepy  effects, camera tricks, and some other surprises to make the viewer a  participant instead of a coach potato blindly watching an illuminated  screen. Fincher plays with you, messes with your mind, and challenges you  to break out from the usual moviegoer mold. He takes an excellent book, and  makes it even better with the additions of Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena  Bonham-Carter. The audio tracks on the DVD are far above anything I've ever  seen, and the supplemental disc is so packed with extras, that this is an  absolute MUST BUY for any DVD lover out there.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A37ORV4GEO2Z3T	Kevin Parrish Claussen	This movie excited me when I saw it because it was the first major movie playing at cineplexes that seemed to criticise corporate consumer society. There are issues of class (as in economic), questions about quality of life, and a critique of modern society like none I have seen in a movie with this distribution. You'd expect it from an indie film usually.There is some irony that it was released by a major movie company and Brad Pitt is the main ego, Tyler Durdun. When Pitt's character criticizes the image of mans toned physique in a CK ad on a bus, one has to laugh. Pitt is exactly the kind of image that his character hates, but oh well. The point of the movie, the message, is still retained.In light of recent events (Sep.11th), a film about home grown terrorists is probably not too popular. Never the less, Tyler Durden and company remind us all that we &quot;...are not the contents of your wallet, your car, your income, or your khakis.&quot;Amen.	5.0	Corporate made Anti Corporate American film is still great.	2001-12-05	5	3	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A4YA53T7UX458	Kevin Smith	Most of us have Tyler Durdens within us.  We tend to live life at a pace at which we are directed by society.  We are trained to go to college, get a job, get married, buy a house, have children, and plan for retirement after 30 odd years of working.  Ed Norton plays are character who realizes this pattern early in life and attempts to live a more fulfilling life.  He meets his inner-being Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and Fight Club is born. However, our facinating life is insignificant if we have no companion for emotional fulfillment.  In comes Marla.  If you seek a more fulfilling life as did Ed Norton's character, you can relate to this movie.  It was excellent.	5.0	Fight Club is Excellent! We all need release.	2001-01-30	5	2	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A6YEBFPYCIED1	Khaled Mahmoud Al Anani	Every once in a while, you see a film that actually gives you something to really think about long after you leave the movie theater. Brad Pitt's and Edward Norton's superb performance will captivate you through this unabashedly anti-establishment movie all the way through. The pace of the movie can seem somewhat slow at times, but that is only because the director is probably preparing for something really special. The graphics and the music/sound effects add to the ambience that one can only expect from a movie this unique. And add to that a script where the writer is willing to challenge just about everything we take from granted in our urban societies, and you've got something that will keep your mind twisting for a long time after you see this film. And if you thought that was all, check this out: the film has a storyline with completely unexpected events that just keep getting more shocking towards the end of the film. Among the many things this film will give you to think about is what kind of minds came together to produce this absolutely twisted and yet remarkable piece of work.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A32K4BV5DFG3KP	Killerwokz	Fight Club is a crude raunchy slugfest that knocks the wind out of you like an unsuspecting kick to the balls. Edward Norton a mealy mouthed insurance inspector runs into his antihero, a wise smart mouth punk, who knows what ails today's men. They have lost their animal instinct, the bloodlust, and their will to survive. The two start up a clandestine bare knuckle fight club. Surprisingly clubs spring up everywhere. The members begin to worship Pitt and Norton like gods. Things take a turn for the worse as the fight clubs turn its energy on society. Norton slowly but surely begins to realize that there is something really familiar about Pitt. This is really a great film if you're planning to be part of the new revolution; of course we all know the first rule.	5.0	Anarchy anyone?	2007-06-15	2	1	1

The characters are fantastic and the message itself will make you think quite a bit. After seeing it once, you will want to watch it again. Or about five times in a row. It is that good.

This is a complex, layered, multi faceted plot delivered in a crisp visually stunning manner.This isn't ""just"" a movie about guys who fight to get out their frustrations, that's like saying Jaws was about fishing.  Alongside the biting social commentary and the primal macho juice, is a parable about losing yourself in your own problems, lying to yourself for as long as you can, realizing it, and seeing the effects it has on everyone around you.  What's great is all of these pieces, a wounded romance, anti-boss revenge, triumphal combat, a devoted personality cult, can be appreciated as individual bits and scenes, but still work together to advance the story arc.Even setting aside the very original plot, the movie itself is just great to look at.  A greenish, glistening, unhealthy glow permeates the urban landscape of the film.  The pacing, presentation, acting, and foreshadowing are all perfect.Loud, original, technically impressive, and fun with a mind game ending that makes you analyze the entire film again....I hope you'll take a look if you haven't already."	5.0	Well, at least I've got that couch thing covered.	2002-06-28	0	0	0

This is one of the best films of last year, and it was hardly recognized.Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are amazing in their roles.  They make  the characters come to life.  For me, this movie was a big slap in the  face.  How many of us are living lives like Jack/The Narrator, looking for  fulfillment in our lives?  I think that is the main reason why so many  people disliked this movie--because it was real!  Aren't we all looking for  the dining set that defines us as a person?  This movie is absolutely  hilarious, and the dialogue is wonderful (most of it coming from the book,  which I also recommend highly).This movie shows what our society has  become, and what we, as people, are becoming.  To me, this was a much  better depiction of the 'main character who realizes that his life isn't  what he expected it to be and is looking for fulfillment' than American  Beauty was.  (It's the same theme!  So why did so many people love Amerian  Beauty so much?)

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A356RFKNIG043B	K. Swanson	Fight Club MUST be seen twice to be truly understood. Can't say more than that, it would ruin the fun.This film was way ahead of its time in its devastatingly exact portrayal of the emptiness of its time. Give this puppy a few decades and it will be seen as perhaps the finest celluloid expression of millenial ennui/nihilism. The violence is entirely necessary to the experience, and this isn't the standard defense-industry-sponsored Hollywood Gun Porn; it's straight-up bare-knuckle brawling, and its visceral point hits home hard. In the anesthetized homogenized consumerist vacuum of a culture that we call home, it takes at least a few solid shots to the jaw to begin to wake up from our American Dream/Nightmare.Fight Club was widely panned upon release, and no wonder. This is one of the most subversive major studio films of all time, intelligently deconstructing modern film and the entertainment/distraction industry in general. Fight Club's heroes blow up the headquarters of credit card companies (!) in a decidedly unapologetic way...not really the message our Feudal Lords wish us to ponder while being entertained. Why not buy a copy on your Mastercard just for kicks, but whatever you do don't burn it for everyone you know just because the message of this film is more important than making money for the system this flick slams at every turn.So many hidden details, so much black humor (the Ikea lifestyle catalog scene is brilliant), three excellent lead performances, tremendous writing (Palahniuk must have been thrilled with the adaptation), a wild score, state of the art editing, sets, and direction, and so much more.But, and this can not be overstated, you absolutely have to see it twice; the second viewing is a completely different animal, and will make you realize how thoroughly manipulated we are by modern culture, no matter how above and beyond it we think we may be.For a culture constantly and adoringly staring up its own ahole, Fight Club is a satisfyingly violent enema.	5.0	I dislike violent films, and I love this movie	2007-06-24	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A136MAOWGCU2C2	K.T. May	"I'm a 22 year old woman and I must admit that I did not want to watch this movie at all when I first saw it two years ago. My boyfriend kept saying, ""come on, it's awesome, it's awesome""...so I gave in and watched it and I knew it was gonna be good when I saw those little film splices of Brad, (although, of course, I didn't know what they were), in the beginning. I knew the psychological aspects would be hard-hitting. When the credits were rolling, my jaw was still open. The underlying themes are incredible and so true, (which have to be credited to their creator, Palahniuk, who is also amazing). I read the book after I saw the movie and I definitely enjoyed the book a lot. However, I must say that ""Invisible Monsters"" was definitely my favorite Pahlahniuk book so far. Damn good book. But this movie was incredible. I avoided it 'cause I thought it was a typical violent guy movie, but I think I am a better person for seeing that movie. One element that always remains in my head is the point Palahniuk was trying to prove about surrounding yourself with possessions, convincing yourself that you're happy. Man....the storyline is head-shaking, it's so good. Also, I've said it before: Edward Norton is a fantastic actor. He was perfect for that role."	5.0	Chuck Palahniuk is the man...	2004-10-08	0	0	0

I would go as far as to say that this film deserved more nominations than BEST SOUND, I mean give me a break!  David Fincher's film had one of the wittiest scripts that I  personally would have given it a nomination ath the Academy Awards.  It  stands out as one of five great scripts that we'll ever see transformed  onto the screen from this past year.  The other four: American Beauty  (obviously), Election, The Insider, and Magnolia.  Each of these writers  are geniuses in their own right.  Now, to explain my review title: I rented  this from my work and about 30 minutes into the film, the picture went  black &amp; white.  Most of you would say, &quot;I'm going to go take this  back and get another copy.&quot;  &quot;HELL NO! &quot;  This movie grabbed  me by my shirt and beat the **** out of me with it's raw feel and it's  dark, witty, inventive script and direction.  I wouldn't dare shut it off.  I was enthralled by it.  Entertainment doesn't get much better than this.  So I sat through another hour and 30 sum minutes and enjoyed the hell out  of it!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A79Q8J5DAG55N	kyle porter	This has got to be my favorite movie ever made. It's sounds extremely  cliche; a man's praise for a superficially masculine,  testosterone-drenched, wham-bam-thank you ma'am pile of celluloid. Not at  all true. This film made me think, and no movie fitting the preceding  description has ever accomplished that. This film also shocked me with  frank but intelligant philosophy, stunning performances credited to Helena  Bonham Carter and Edward Norton, and original-ironically trendy-premise and  execution. The sensationalism, assumed to be horribly adolescent, is so  effective, the audience is left gathering itself and arriving to the  conclusion that while it may have its share of violence, slapstick,  shockers, and bizarre mannerisms, there was a lot to think about in all  that. You can thank this film for the strangest slice of a reality gone  reanimated, as a nameless Joe Average plunges into a tale of mischeif,  mayhem, and soap. Edward Norton is the timid white-collar consumer, a  simple materialist with an addiction to stuff he doesn't need but buys to  fill holes in his pathetic, numbing existence, like anyone else would.  Stricken with the boredom of office jargon and despondency, while suffering  heavy insomnia, Norton finds an obscure comfort, and pitiful just as well,  touring support groups for diseases and what not, releasing tears and his  sleeping restraints. while this is all well and good, his encounter with  the vivaciously-dead Helena Bonham Carter lands him back in square one,  resolving to his new (single-serving) friend: Tyler Durden. Enigmatic,  rebellious, confident, vulgar, unconventional, and smart, Tyler (Brad Pitt)  leads his pal into a foreign world of obscure humor, the dangers of  soap-making, the philosophy of chaos and anti-sociality, theraputic  violence, and taking action against the ideals of the material world that  chains us all. Unfortunantly, Tyler expands his quest to unchaining more  and more people, until massive and ludicrous terrorism throws Norton into a  plot that threatens society entirely, and places Norton on the other side  of the world we all take for granted. Collectively, this film was amazingly  written, directed, acted, filmed, and produced to create one of the most  misunderstood and underrated films of the decade. See this film for  everything it can offer you-which I garuntee heartily is a lot.  kyle@porterworks	5.0	I saw this film with one thing in mind:	2000-05-18	5	3	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1F6OPXM5LDZ4M	LackOfDiscipline	There is little I can say about this film that is worthwhile.  A submissive insomniac (E. Norton) meets a capitalist/anarchist (B. Pitt), and they create &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  In time the club mushrooms into a  national franchise of mayhem and destruction.I am not a born again  Christian or anything like that, but I can't help sympathizing with those  who complain about the effect of mass media on our youth when I think about  a movie like this being praised by so many &quot;critics&quot;.  This film  is so disgustingly subversive and the &quot;values&quot; that it promotes  are so twisted and subhuman that one can only hope that the audience would  dismiss it as a mere &quot;contrived and forgettable heap of dung&quot;,  rather than taking it's &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; too  seriously.As I watched this film I felt nauseous most of the time and  left the theater feeling very disoriented.  In general I don't object to  violence in a film, but this one had a particularly sadistic attitude.  I  would not recommend this film to anyone (especially male children).  The  reason that I rate it as a two star film is for the twist ending, which was  really very clever.  Overall though, this is a wonderful example of pop  cultural trash being hailed as &quot;high art&quot;.  If you want to see  something in a somewhat similar spirit that IS worthwhile check out Stanley  Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange - a film that has value.	2.0	I often wonder about people...	2000-05-27	16	5	11

People who don't like violence or incredibly weird plot twists (even though there's only one incredibly weird plot twist, it's a doozy) should bypass this one.  However, people who don't mind the afformentioned should consider at least renting Fight Club.This movie is very stylish, which is something I appreciate in movies.  Of course, I've seen plenty of horrible movies that were very stylish, so Fight Club's got a lot more redeeming qualities than just that.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are awesome together in this movie.  I didn't really like Helena Bonham Carter in this though.  On top of some pretty cool fight scenes, the humorous parts of this movie are very funny, the most memorable for me was when Tyler Durden and Norton's nameless character steal from a liposuction clinic.All in all, this movie moves quickly, and never gets boring.  It has just the right amount of action, comedy, and one incredibly weird plot twist.	5.0	Fantastic	2002-03-18	2	2	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ZCCFD426KYK8	Larry Taylor	The extreme fights, the terrorism on conformists, and the fresh performances by Brad Pitt (who is absolutely outstanding), and Edward Norton are a few things that make Fight Club one of my favorite films of  all time.  What I am amazed at is the lack of success the film had, even  after the publicity and hype.  Either way, this movie is definately at the  top of my A-list.  If your reason for not seeing the film is the rumored  extreme violence, you should not let that deter you from seeing it.  Many  films before, (and since) then have had violence of equal or lesser  amounts, but they have not been so metaphorically eye-opening as the  violence in Fight Club.  If anything, you should see this film to see the  surprise ending, and to see Pitt and Norton go out on a limb in their  careers.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AF29TNM0A9PYK	"Laura Lea May ""Beauty sleeps deep within the ..."	This film redeems the bad quality films that have been made over the past few years.  When I first sat down to watch this I was grosely afraid that it would be stupid, only because I am not a Brad Pitt fan, I don't like his style.  But in this film he made a change that was absolutly amazing...and I think that this film should receive more credit.There is a Zen like atmosphere throughout this film, where Edward Norton's Charater remains a emotionally dead individual looking for something beyond his mellow suburban life.  He meets Tyler Durden on an airplane, a man who sells soap for a living to different companies like Macy's and Belk's.  But with his job he is actually happy...and he is also content with letting go of everything just to reamin happy.  Unplugged from reality you might way.By strange chance (I won't tell you) the two of them are brought back together by a simple phone call and talk over three pitchers of beer.  They room together at a house that is so ramshackle it should be condemnded.  But it isn't.  The two of them decide that fighting is a good way to release frustration and let go of material life as it is known.  Fight Club is born.Recruits are brought in, the house becomes a safe place for these guys to enjoy what they like...fighting.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ASG6PSR648OET	Laurie D	Like 1996's Primal Fear, Fight Club is a film that must be watched repeatedly in order to fully comprehend its cinematic brilliance.  Clues  that lead the viewer to the plot twist near the end of the film can be seen  throughout the movie, which makes it necessary to see this movie more than  once.  Perhaps my opinion is biased due to my respect for Edward Norton as  a talented actor, however, Norton did not have to carry this film by  himself.  Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meatloaf, Jared Leto and a slew  of other supporting actors helped make this film the convincing tale that  it is.  What is so convincing about it, however, is that we can all somehow  relate to Edward Norton's character, who finds himself trapped in the  machinery of modern life.  He accepts his worker-consumer status because,  after all, people like him are the ones who make the world go round.  Soon  he finds himself grasping for help deep within himself when he finds that  others can not give him the support that he needs.  This is when he meets  Tyler Durden, who turns his life into a game of breaking out of his  zombie-like state of living.  The most significant arguments of the film  come from Tyler's philosophies on life and how one should avoid being  ordinary.  This was a great film, with original ideas and frightening  points about the lives which we all find ourselves living.	5.0	A Great Masterpiece	2000-08-08	4	3	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3K5IMGDCDBCNF	"""lecorel@hotmail.com"""	The best thing about David Fincher's masterpiece is that you can take away what you want from this film.  Fight Club isn't really about anything.  That is sort of the theme and the beauty of  this film because that is how real life is.  Being able to watch this film and draw your own conclusions it what makes this film so special.  Additionally it is probably one of the most well photographed and edited films ever.  Stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton form the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for a new generation.  They perfectly represent a generation that  does not want to be told where they are going, they want to find out, but are not sure how.  Fight Club is an anthem, everyone should see it once. Of coarse then you have to watch it again and again.  It is addictive.	5.0	No Rules	2000-12-11	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2BA9AO95K32Q1	Len Feder	This is a very violent movie with lots of blood and fighting, but I don't mind that.  I'm a fan of the old Ultimate Fighting Championship, when they used to slam each other in the head with elbows and the blood would flow,  so I'm not in the least offended by the blood in Fight Club.  I thought  this was going to be a straight ahead movie about some regular guys forming  a fight club to experience knocking each other's brains in, to get the  adrenaline rush, to see how good you were in something fairly close to a  street fight, though of course not a street fight since both contestants  agree in advance to show up, and a measure of safety from eye gauges and  death is assumed.  I did something like this myself when I started a  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club where people went full tilt, though no punching  was allowed, just &quot;wrestling&quot;, more like submission wrestling.  But that is not what the movie is primarily about.  It is just one of the  macho images the protagonist has flying around in his head.  The movie  isn't about a fight club.  It's about the meanderings in the mind of the  protagonist, who isn't planted firmly on the ground.  The movie held my  interest but I found it too long and at times too wierd.  The robotic fight  club members were a bit too much.  One man's insanity is another man's  cult.  I think this movie would have worked better for me if they had kept  it simpler, as in Keep It Simple Stupid.  The bizarre and unbelievable  directions they took it in lost me.  Try editing it next time.  Change the  focus.  Make it real.  I hadn't realized I was watching sci fi or fantasy.  You have a good concept here.  Just rein it in and give it some focus.  This slop is all over the place.  What's that about the girl?  What's that  about the political messages?  Huh?  What are you doing?  Sorry, it really  doesn't come together as an artistic whole for me.  It needs a ruthless  editor to pare it down a half hour, and it would benefit from some reality.  Even granting the macho dream concept, the Norton-Pitt dichotomy, it needs  work.  Tighten it up.	2.0	Missed the target	2000-06-11	32	6	26
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A8WTR7LLEEAA3	"Leon Roberts ""NegroDamus"""	What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? Nothing! and why is that? Because this film is still great, and is now commonly known as a cult classic.From 1999 to 2013 I've had to have seen this film at least 30 times. I kept re-watching this because there are so many quick hidden elements to this film. for Example, Do you know how many times Tyler Durden flashes in front of the screen before we are introduced to him on the plane? Well, I'm not telling you because it was fun re-watching and counting for myself.The movie is still watchable and the movie has stood the test of time. While watching this film it's really hard to believe this is a 14 year old film. So enough drooling over the film itself, lets shift focus to the 10th Anniversary Blu-ray version.I've seen this in theaters, watched on VHS, Owned it on DVD, and now the blu-ray. The blu-ray version tops all formats in visual quality. The blu-ray Special Features are fantastic but, they are the same quality as the features from the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD that came out years ago. I think that they should have re-vamped all of the Bonus content in HD.

I liked the part where the ""army"" members start chanting, ""His name is Paulson,"" after it sinks in the guy is dead.  And it was funny when the army guys tried to pick fights with strangers, and it was really hard to get ""normal"" people to fight.A silly, childishly ""romantic"" totally unbelievable riff on a Walter Mitty character gone mad.  Conrad's Secret Sharer on steroids.Are we to believe that the Norton character won't spend the rest of his stupid life in jail?  Why didn't he shout out when the cops were going to castrate him - that would have ended the entire jig?  Why did all those losers do whatever he told them to do?Is this supposed to be a meditation on the motivation of the herd?  The truth about why young men join gangs and death squads?  A ""serious"" critique of our consumerist, alienated, mass society?  And what an ironic, ""happy"" ending, watching buildings blow up and holding hands with the one you love...Gimmee a break!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1J3X04M5ZI9S0	Lil' Rowlands	"Fight Club, for many years now, has been one of those movies that challenges many genre's of movie-making.  With the combination of action, dark humor/satire, drama, a bit of adventure, and wicked turns on love and heartbreak, this movie tests the boundaries over critics and other directors.  David Fincher, who also did SE7EN (THUMBS UP), The Game, and Alien3 (his first movie feature), Fincher has proven himself worthy of being one of the greatest directors after improving his skills of the rather dissapointing, last film, of the Alien franchise.  You have Brad Pitt, who is a loose cannon in the act of proving his ""friend"" that he is everything he is not as he FIGHTS his way through his own problems throughout the movie.  You have Edward Norton, who is referred to as 'Jack', making up his imaginary friend, Tyler Durden, to help him become...Shall we say, stronger as he tries to find out that HE WAS Tyler Durden through all of his kicking and screaming with Tyler Durden.  Other characters, such as Jared Leto (Angel Face) and Meat Load Aday (Robert Pulsen), play more smaller roles, but Meat Loaf's character helped make Fight Club hilarious in the most sickest ways.  I remember reading about how many bad reviews Fight Club got (The Collector's Edition has a thick booklet with most of them).  Some of them were funny and some of them simply tore the movie in half.  David Fincher gave no apologies to how offensive the movie got towards some issues and towards other questionable parts of the movie...If I was the director, I would've given no apologies either cause Fight Club was an excellent movie to watch and witness and was definitely a breakthrough for Fincher, along with Pitt and Norton."	5.0	An incendiary bomb that explodes in your face	2006-01-26	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	This video is weird, provocative and totally consuming. It kept me intrigued for its full 140 minutes and when it was over I thought about it for a long time.Edward Norton stars as the unnamed narrator who cannot find peace in his life in spite of his perfectly furnished condo.  Brad Pitt plays the charismatic bad boy Tyler Durden, who changes the narrator's perspective forever.  Together they form a fight club, an underground support group for disaffected males who pummel each other into ecstatic enlightenment.  It's a twisted black comedy that intensifies in its violence and its meaning.Ed Norton is one of the finest actors around today and it's amazing that he didn't receive an academy award nomination for this role.  He acts with his whole body, knowing just when to wince or open his eyes in rounded wonder. We see his character shift back and forth, experience pain, pleasure and fear as well as all the nuances of emotion that a human being is capable of.Brad Pitt's performance is more one dimensional but he also gives a fine performance.  And Helena Bonlam Carter as the chain-smoking woman in their lives has a small but significant role.I tried to read the novel by Chuck Palahuniuk several years ago but never got past the first chapter.  I found it dark and depressing and hard to follow.  However, as a screenplay and assisted by the writing skills of Jim Uhls, this wordy and strange novel takes on a whole new life.  David Fincher, the director,  brilliantly shot the fight sequences shadowed in darkness, but still full of blood and gore.There's a surprise at the end of Fight Club which was very much in context with the plot although it takes the viewer into a different sense of reality.  It certainly  made me want to view the film again to catch all the little hints that must have been dropped along the way and that I missed.  I couldn't help thinking about it later and I expect I will continue to do so for a long time.This is a quirky, twisted and dark film recommended only for those who are willing to experience some uncomfortable moments. So be prepared for the discomfort as you enjoy some good filmmaking.	5.0	Quirky, twisted and uncomfortable - but fine filmmaking	2000-09-23	3	2	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3BXS0A7CMJ1CJ	linus	"In FIGHT CLUB, the self-consciously ""daring"" adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's excellent cult novel, men assemble and pound one another in dank basements; they spit blood and teeth and then return for more next  week. When this isn't enough for them, they wage war on our consumerist  culture with media-friendly, attention-getting pranks that escalate into  mass destruction. I bought all this in the book, because Palahniuk's  fevered first-person narration puts you inside the exhausted rage of  powerless young men who are sick of it all. A movie, however, can be a  delicate animal, and this one begins boldly and gradually dies.What  happened? The screenplay, by first-timer Jim Uhls, is pretty loyal to the  novel; the Narrator, a nameless corporate drudge played by Edward Norton,  delivers many of the book's best lines in sarcastic voice-over. But -- and  here I must step very lightly in order to avoid major spoilers -- what  worked on the page, especially the credibility-stretching plot twist, comes  off labored on the screen. Readers of the book may sit there wondering how  director David Fincher (SE7EN) will sustain the illusion from scene to  scene. Newcomers, in turn, may wonder why many of the scenes are so  stilted, with characters entering and exiting as in a screwball play. And  when the surprise is sprung, nobody in the audience so much as  gasps.Certain images, certain surrealistically funny bits of  business, occasionally made me think ""I really must buy this on DVD,"" which  is in hilarious counterpoint to the anti-consumerist message the movie is  selling. Reading the book, I wasn't thinking about DVDs. Palahniuk made you  ponder the lost masculinity of a generation, the ease with which a  charismatic brute like Tyler can assemble disgruntled men and unite them in  chaos. The book is a modern horror story about how populist fascism can  flourish here, and about why this is the perfect time for it. (The detail  of soap made of human fat is no accident.) The movie, unfortunately, is a  stylish blank, a countercultural advertisement just as slick as the ads it  claims to disdain. The last reel, which departs from the book and gives us  movie-ish thrills we've seen a hundred times before, is about as saddening  a commentary on Hollywood as any I've witnessed. What's even sadder is that  those involved with FIGHT CLUB think they've made something scathing and  radical, and that some viewers might agree with them."	2.0	You can understand this movie and still not like it much	2000-07-24	21	13	8

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1NUNYRFNUF2JJ	LittleDee	"""Fight Club"" tries to be provocative and oh-so-hip, but it's essentially an ugly, mean-spirited -- and worse yet, *pointless* -- tantrum.You can't help despising every one of the characters.  Ed Norton plays a weak, neurotic nonentity.  Helena Bonham Carter plays a thoroughly unpleasant lowlife -- the sort of woman who wouldn't care if she were wearing underwear even if she were hit by the proverbial bus (which, by the time she'd been in the movie ten minutes, I was devoutly hoping for).  Brad Pitt (whose character ""Tyler"" inspired similar bus longings) plays an insufferable overaged brat.  He's a smug, know-it-all windbag who spouts preachy anti-materialistic rants -- while wearing expensive trendy clothes -- but in garish colors, so we know that he's a ""nonconformist"".  Luckily for Tyler, his physical attractiveness lends a specious credibility to his lectures, because their content was simplistic and hackneyed -- we've all heard it many times before, done better.  If they'd cast, say, Dennis Franz in that part, the tirades would have had the underwhelming effect that they actually merited.The movie begins with the content and theme of a fair-to-middling ""Dilbert"" comic strip -- suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power.  Their jobs are dull and don't offer intellectual challenge, spiritual fulfillment, or satisfaction.  In other words, because of evil corporations...  or having been raised by single mothers...  (or something)...  they've been cheated out of what they'd considered their rightful due, and are now stuck with the same problems that everyone thinks normal when faced by women, African-Americans, and the working class.For some reason -- possibly because the filmmakers quite correctly surmised that a movie consisting entirely of anti-corporate sermons wouldn't sell very many tickets -- Tyler's solution is to reclaim their masculinity...  or overthrow the corporate hierarchy...  (or something)...  by picking fistfights and blowing stuff up.  This becomes popular with other suburban white guys with way too much time on their hands, who decide that they're all victims, too, and that they all want to pick fights and blow stuff up, too.This spirals out of control, Sorcerer's-Apprentice-like, and (d)evolves into a dystopian cult/army of suburban white guys; complete with rules, chants, and rituals (see what I mean about these people having way too much time on their hands?); every bit as dehumanizing as their jobs.  The members of ""Fight Club"" start as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying corporate bosses, and end as sheep-like drones mindlessly obeying rabid-dog sociopath Tyler.  The movie has the nerve to try to pass this off as rebellion...  or asserting their individuality...  (or something).Granted, the movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting.  Granted, it makes points -- about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment -- which are valid, and might even have been thought-provoking, had they not been delivered in such a God-awful heavy-handed fashion.  Anyone intelligent enough to contemplate such issues doesn't need them pounded home with a sledgehammer.But a competent presentation of a ridiculous, muddled premise (""Single mothers""?  Who is this -- Dan Quayle?) is worse than an incompetent one, because it's harder to dismiss.  The filmmakers attempt to disguise/justify/redeem the movie's hateful, no-win false dichotomy (one can escape being a victim only by victimizing others) with trite thematic content (materialism bad), but all that does is make it prissy and hypocritical as well as thuggish -- like putting a doily over a Sherman tank.The movie has no African-American, Hispanic, or blue-collar characters, although those groups face at least as many difficulties and injustices as the middle-class office workers depicted.  The lone woman character is physically and personally repellent -- worse, her only purpose is as a spittoon for the men.  So if I understand correctly:  The movie has no blacks, no Hispanics, no working-class people, only one woman (who's a caricature, and loathsome as well), and crypto-Nazis (Tyler actually confesses he renders soap from human flesh -- but it comes from fat people, so that's supposed to be hilarious and cool -- apparently he's not quite subversive enough to deconstruct mainstream esthetics), setting bombs and beating people up as a solution to depersonalization...  but it *does* rag on Ikea.  REAL progressive!Get a clue, fellas.  If your self-worth and autonomy depend on a ""masculinity"" defined as brutality, a dull job is the least of your problems.  It's supposed to be shocking news that jobs are unrewarding sometimes?  Companies are in business to make money -- period -- and *nobody's* life is fun every minute of every day.  Imbuing your life with meaning is *your* responsibility, not your employer's.  If you're bored or unfulfilled -- paint a picture, climb a mountain, volunteer at the homeless shelter -- do whatever matters to *you*.  If you hate Ikea -- don't buy their stuff.  If you hate consumerism -- throw your cellphone in the trash and wear your 1980s-vintage stonewashed jeans until they fall apart.  Or wouldn't that be trendy enough?Testosterone run amuck and mindless nihilism have cathartic appeal to angry, frustrated adolescent boys of all ages, but they don't make for a good story, nor interesting filmmaking.  Despite pretending to be a Deep Meaningful Parable...  (or something), ""Fight Club"" is still very obviously a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, and not much more.  Presenting bombings and beatings as self-empowerment is reprehensible enough without also insulting the viewer's intelligence with a smokescreen of ""moral"" posturing -- to say nothing of the infuriatingly condescending assumption that those who disagree ""just don't get it"".Even Brad Pitt with his shirt off can't make this movie watchable -- and I am a person who likes looking at Brad Pitt with his shirt off.  Unless you prefer your dimwitted violence with a side order of sanctimonious rhetoric, skip this movie and watch ""Beavis and Butthead"" -- at least they're funny."	1.0	Huh-huh-huh, blowing stuff up is cool	2002-08-02	131	44	87

I sat still through the whole thing, from the opening credits in the cerebral cortex to The Pixie's &quot;Where is my mind&quot; in the end.I must say it was one of the few movies I have seen that has captured my undivided attention for so long - that made me go to the video store pick up the DVD only hours after watching it for the first time.The dialogs are incredible and you will be blown away by how seemingly small and even funny remarks can sum up deeper concepts. Beware - if you have psychotic inclinations, I'd rather you didn't watch it because it can be, well, encouraging.The glorious Helena Bohem-Carter hits the perfect tone playing Marla Singer and Edward Norton's performance is worthy of awards and standing ovations. I cannot believe how neglected this film was in regards to how the actors portrayed their characters. I was completely immersed in the story and feel the same every time I watch it.The film's editing is also worthy of attention, because it managed to bring the story together without destroying the director's great work.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	If someone picks a fight with you, will you run - or will you fight?  Most people will run.  One of the premises of Fight Club is that modern men have become emasculated and have lost the ability and desire to fight.  Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) offers men a chance to get in touch with their confidence.  It is a secret underground fighting club.  No weapons, no team-ups, no refs, just old-fashioned, one-on-one fistfights.  The main rule in Fight Club is that you can't talk about it.Ed Norton plays a timid, insomniac auto recall investigator who goes to medical support groups to feel better about himself and get some sleep.  He meets Marla, a woman with similar low self-esteem.  Marla is also a support-group junkie.  Right away, he dislikes her intensely, and they start arguing.He meets Tyler when his condo is mysteriously blown up.  Lost without his Ikea furniture, he moves in with Tyler.  The two start the club.Based on the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club (his first novel - wow!) is different from any other movie out there.  Completely free from the Hollywood blockbuster formula, the movie offers laughs, black humor, and some serious questions about masculinity in the modern age.Just as a completely unrelated aside, Brad Pitt is so damn gorgeous!!!	4.0	Great Alternative Film	2005-12-27	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AQBPAN0CJ2YF3	LORRAINE M. RYAN	Fight Club does have a great deal of violence, it is true.  If you take  that as a given, then you ready yourself to see some very important  questions that this film brings into focus. Anyone who wonders about the  consumerist vision of life will certainly see things differently after  viewing this film.  It will at least bring into question the search for  material things and what that means.  I believe another part of this film  has to do with men.  According to the film, men need to connect with others  in a very physical way.  It seems as though the only way they can feel  anything is by being extreme - in everyway.  I think this is a rather  limited understanding of maleness.  The writer, however, wants to express  something about males....I can only guess this from the fact that most of  those who make up the cast are male.  There is only one main female in the  cast. I believe the philosophy expressed can be one that all can hold  whether male or female.  Is this a useful way to see men?  I don't really  think so....however, even with this stereotypical vision of males....I  think the film has a great deal to offer all people.  All people who really  want to question, law and order, who want to question what is taught about  success and so on.All of the actors were well cast and should be  applauded.  The writers and director should be praised for creating a  worthwhile film, one that makes people think, and this, certainly needs to  be rewarded!	5.0	Fight Club	2000-06-28	0	0	0

Fincher is an able director. Brad Pitt can make sparks fly in the right hands. The production design is without  fault.  Unfortunately, the structure and the payoff don't quite meld into a  satisfying experience.  By the final third, one is left with &quot;is that  IT?&quot; as the riddle of conflict is unveiled.  Still, FIGHT CLUB remains  a rarity: a thinking person's film.  It has anger and pizzazz, but suffers  some confusion with its oddball dance with homerotica that more or less  winds up as curious windowdressing, and not much else, considering the  film's pretentions to being deep.  It is great to hear one cry against our  numbing consumerism, and that I champion.

Anyhow, this movie is great and I think the entire  violence and anarchist themes the media criticizes are overblown.  There is  more violence in the first 5 minutes of Saving Private Ryan than there is  in this entire movie, and to the best of my memory, only one person dies in  the movie, which really isn't much of a body count at all.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30IW37FOB3LBQ	Luis R. Martinez	This film grows on you, or rather pokes at the back of your brain, burrowing deeper with each replay.Edward Norton (Narrator), one of the great actors of our generation (X), shows his comfort and unique take on  playing Everyman's Bipolar. Brad Pitt is Nortons perfect foil. Pitt is at  his best when he goes to the edge (i.e. 12 Monkeys) and he does it here as  Tyler Durden a truly original character.  Helen Bonaham Carter (Marla),  strange! and yet beautiful, nothing spectacular but does her job and  advances the plot.David Fincher (Director) creates a mesmerizing and  visually stunning, albeit gory film (The squeamish are warned). Fincher did  not create a movie he created a cinematic experience that leaves you  thinking, pondering, analyzing, the characters, the realities of the film,  the environment, and the message.The story is disturbing with a nice  twist, which really lets you now that you are not just watching a formula  movie.  I disagree with others take that this film glamorizes anarchy. That  is superficial overview of the film and does not do this deep story any  justice. Yes the film criticizes consumer culture, but by stripping of the  packaging and lowering the volume and showing us the underlying mechanism.  The same mechanism that propels fascism, or communism, or any ism for that  matter, the one that drives the herd, that tiny little need to belong.  I  do concede that the mentally challenged should not watch this film for fear  of Fight Clubs and Durden wannabes springing up (I am sure they are out  there).This is the kind of film an entire film class can write a thesis  on and each person will reveal a different message, not due to a lack of  focus but because of a density of layers. That credit goes to Chuck  Palahniuk the author of Fight Club.A Great Film!	5.0	His Name is Robert Paulsen!	2000-07-23	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AZRJH4JFB59VC	Lynwood E. Hines	If it weren't for the fact that The Matrix was also released in 1999, I would have no problem saying that this was the best film of that year.  At this point, I feel that these two films must share that honor, as both were ground breaking on multiple levels.Fight Club is primarily a pitch black comedy, as someone mentions on one of the four commentary tracks included in the DVD.  Some people will understand the comedy and enjoy it.  Others, like my wife, will not.  This is the only movie that I've asked  her to watch that she would not finish.  About half way thru, she said she was done and walked out.  This film is a wild roller coaster ride, and as with the real thing, it will thrill and excite some, while just making others sick.The level of detail in Fight Club is remarkable.  Finding all the subliminal Tyler's is just the begining.  For example, Ricky (the kid who couldn't remember if he had ordered pens with blue ink or black), is in the scene where &quot;Jack&quot; is leaving his office for the last time, with blood all over his face, and a shopping cart filled with computer equipment, being escorted by security.  Ricky recognizes &quot;Jack&quot; and just has this wonderful smile appear on his face that looks like a combination of surprise, delight, and respect.  This happens in the edge of the frame for a second or less.  David Fincher was definately thinking about the DVD crowd when he put this masterpiece together.What can I say about the 2-DVD set that hasn't already been said?  It is spectacular.  The extras are fantastic, not just a bunch of lame schetches (although it includes these too for those who enjoy them).  There are numerous deleted scenes, and all of the behind the scenes stuff is actual video footage, not stills.Just for completeness, this movie is not about fighting.  It is about being so numbed by the blandness and meaninglessness of life in the 90's that the only thing that can get your attention is having the living crap kicked out of you.  It's about how easily some people are led.  It's about trying to find your place in a world that doesn't make sense.  It's about coping with your father walking out on you when you were 6 years old.  And of course, it's about how stress can result in a fractured personality.As for the violence in the file, it's not the kind of violence that you are probably used to.  For example, only one person dies in this film.  Compare that to &quot;The Terminator&quot;, or any number of other films where lots of people die.  I think there are two key aspects to the violence in this film that disturb people.  First, the depection of a couple of the beatings is pretty graphic, and the makeup work is very realistic.  Also, the sound effects of the punches are superbly realistic.  Second, other people are shown during a couple of beatings, and they are clearly very disturbed by what they are witnessing.  It is normal human psychology to take emotional cues from others, and the emotional cues coming from the other actors make it clear that you are supposed to be very disturbed by the events that are transpiring.  So, while Fight Club isn't particularly violent in terms of how many people die, the violence that IS there is driven home with great force.	5.0	Best black comedy in a LONG time	2001-01-28	14	11	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1252Y8F8WHNQU	"Madhu Aryal ""satchet"""	"To explain the profound effect the film has had on me would be Herculean, but I will do my best. The social commentary and dark humor left me bemused, shocked, and philosophical. The story is not as simple as the title would imply It is not a meaningless movie of underdogs and champions, nor is it a blood bath. It is a brilliant, blunt, and beautiful re-examination of all we've come to believe. The story is captivating, thought-provoking, and at times humorous.After Watching Fight Club I realized that I could relate to the movie. I don't mean I am able to relate to blowing up my own apartment or starting a secret fight club in the basement of a bar or causing havoc all around the nation, I mean a lot of the thinking that Narrator does in the movie I have thought the same to some extent as well. This movie challenges the viewer to take a good hard look at their own life.To quote Tyler Durden ""We're consumers. We are by-products of a life style obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra."" a satirical rebellion against the pseudo-civilized, brand-orientated but under-satisfied life we live today.In reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie, after letting it sink into my mind and giving it a second viewing, it was just amazing. Durden (Pitt) is near addicting; you begin to see why so many people would follow him. That ""who cares I do what I want"" personality is portrayed perfectly. Jack (Edward Norton) is like a slave to his deadening job at the office and has a cynical view of the world. He is trying to find a way to deal with his insomnia, caused by his discontent about everything in life. He meets Tyler and finds in him everything he is not; he has found his alter ego. Tyler is a sort of bad-guy, who is exceptionally convincing and confident and who has everything figured out. They start 'Fight Club'; groups of men fighting each other in a basement. These men are also fed up with society and by fighting they can get rid of their fear and hate.What starts out as suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power turns into something much more elemental. Their jobs are dull and don't offer intellectual challenge, spiritual fulfillment, or satisfaction. In other words, they've been cheated out of what they'd considered their rightful due as men. This movie is about searching, searching something new. ""Fight Club"" is really cathartic - it gives the feeling of freedom, it gives hope, it gives the sense of deliverance from the weight we carry on our shoulders.It is not just about the younger generation getting their kicks but also about questioning the nature of society. It's about emotionally dead people who can't feel anything except through violence, and it's also about the desire for community, a support group, to make life bearable in our unbearably meaningless world"	4.0	great movie!!!!	2006-07-27	6	5	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A12VJM8J3AIXA0	madkinglear	This is a fantastic movie!  Fight Club is a mean, dirty, bloody journey into the psyche of men in the modern world.  I won't even get too much involved in the plot, which is surreal and not without its share of twists and turns. A lot of what this movie is about is these frustrated emotionally-numb men realizing that the world we all live in (9-5 jobs, wives, kids, IKEA, Starbucks...) has robbed them of thier ability to feel anything, along with any dreams they once had.  They connect to their primal rage in some of the most awesomely graphic bare knuckle fighting you'll see in a movie...Fight Club. Once they start the club they open a whole can of worms; the fighting almost becomes addictive, and they eventually begin to look at the world like a pack of wolves watching a herd of sheep.There is a whole mess more going on in the movie that I'll leave for you to get to yourself; sex, violence, morals, insanity, space monkeys and making soap to name a few. I've been a solid fan of both Norton and Pitt since they made this flick and it sits as kind of a perfect little treasure out of the late nineties.  For those of you who have never seen it, give it a whirl if you can handle some bloody fist fighting.  If you haven't seen it in a few years I recommend you watch it again; remind yourself why you liked so much the first time.	5.0	Great Guy Flick	2007-03-15	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX	magellan	I came to this movie wondering if it was going to be as good as all the overheated media hype and fluff had made it out to be. It was touted as representing the anger and consciousness of the X generation, and maybe it does. But this story about an alienated loser who creates a violent cult of similarly inclined young men who weekly beat each other up and then plot to destroy society's institutions, although perhaps not great, is still pretty good. It's also reminiscent of the movie, Crash, based on the J.G. Ballard novel, in its theme of a repressed and narcissistic culture of violence that lies just beneath the surface of our otherwise highly polished, technologically advanced society, an interesting idea. There are some good scenes in the movie, but some of them didn't quite hit the mark. But Ed Norton is a fine actor, and he turns in an excellent performance here, and he is certainly one of our best up-and-coming young stars. All in all, a pretty good flick with some interesting ideas, some fine acting by Norton, and a dramatic ending, and I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.	4.0	Good but not great	2002-09-01	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3MV5JAUA58LS8	"""magicthighs"""	Stop everything you are doing and go see Fight Club, then see it again with pen and paper.  I cannot even  begin to describe the profundity and  visceral power  of the movie; sorry, &quot;movie&quot; is not an adequate  term to describe this life changing, paradigm shifting, introspective  journey.  Semantics aside, Fight Club  was 2.5 hours of intense adrenaline  pumping mayhem that oscillated between intensely poignant and brutally  disturbing.  This &quot;movie&quot; is an unapologetic critique on the  empty consumer/consumption/recycle idealogy that has defined our existence  on this planet.  It is not until you see this movie from the perspective of  our pathologically insane protagonist do you really see your life and  question YOUR sanity.Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give a tour de  force performance; quite possibly the best in their lives.  They symbolize  the polar extremes of abandon-restraint, freedom-bondage and  fantasy-reality; yet their distinctions are not entirely black and white,  but instead meld into a weird Yin-Yang.  You cannot help but to empathize  with both characters because they reflect our conscious and subconscious  desires.  Their underground, anarchic lifestyle, existing at the edges of  society affords them the ultimate freedom to live with impunity.  The  direction is sleek, the cinematography is graphic and the sex scenes are  downright salacious.  The fight scenes are graphic and brutal, but  necessary.  These are men emasculated by their meager pedestrian lives,  regaining their sense of power through the spilling of blood and endurance  of pain.Go see this movie, it will change your life.	5.0	Brilliant, life changing movie	2000-08-10	3	3	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A254QJ5BTEUH85	Magus	This movie has a lot of different themes in one. From what society is told to value, and in a lot of cases pointing out the obsurdity of many things; even things like good soap. Edward Norton who's the narrator talks a lot at the beginning about what he does for a job, checking his companies accidents incase they need a recall. Whether he really dislikes this or not is left to the viewer. Insomnia plays a really big part of his life, and lot's of air travel for his job. He explains how he likes arranging and buying furniture to match a catalog, it makes him feel better.One day the narrator decides to go to a help group, where his first time he meets Bob played by Meat Loaf. A somewhat strange character Meat Loaf plays. The narrator finds that he sleeps easier that night, so he goes to many different help groups contuing to sleep everynight.One day when he is flying on a plane for his job, he meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt. This is where the story takes a dramatic turn for the narrator's life. Tyler is not a polite guy, and seems to disapprove of Ed's character. They have an interesting conversation though, one of the many flaws with that he sees with socities ways. The oxygen masks aboard airplanes he says are uses to calm people, getting a high; though not really protecting you at all.After the plane trip and the meeting with Tyler, he finds his condo room burned from an explosion. So he uses a card with Tyler's number, a soap company business card. They talk in at a bar for awhile, and Tyler says just ask me already if you need a place to stay. From out of nowhere Tyler gets the narrator to hit him. Then they fight out in a parking lot.The narrator seems almost relaxed more after the fight, his attitude already is changing from the time he first meet on Tyler on the plane.It's interesting to see Norton's character change, his condo room burning the only place he found an outlet from his job has him needing something else. Tyler introduces him to what he finds is really important, and it's not the way the narrator's life is. The both of them make an underground fight club, which Tyler tells all members to not tell anyone as a strict rule of joining. A lot of people from different classes of living join, you get the feeling they were seeking something different, their lives somehow not forfilled. Not unlike our narrator. The fight club forms groups of a different sort later on in the movie.I like all of issues brought up in the movie, of valuing material possessions that can get the point of the only thing in some people's lives, feminising men to the point of no dignity, raised by single mothers being normal, not going for your real goals if they take along time to get there. These issues usually aren't popular to bring up in any movie, quite the opposite. The humor is also great at some points. The story is ever changing, not knowing where they're going next. Definetly a rare type of movie.	5.0	This is The Best Soap	2008-04-04	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	There are moments when Fight Club loses its pace; when moments drag.  Put aside this one flaw, and put it aside you must, and you're left with a piercingly intelligent deconstruction of modern life.  It is a movie perched on an overhang, with just enough height and distance to give a snarling, infuriariting perspective on a society that has turned us into docile husks.  Ever feel that sinking emptiness inside, the hollow, clawing demise of your soul?  Ever wish the plane you were on would crash, putting you and a couple of other hundred meaningless lives to rest?  Fight Club tells us why it is so important to live, and what it means to take control of your life and scream to the heavens that you matter.  Even if you don't.That's where Fight Club begins for it's lead character; a man trapped, looking for a way out, knowing that he can't escape it alone.  He needs a hero; a savant; an angel.  And into his life walks Tyler Durden, a roaming, phantasmagorical Christ figure, ready to grab him by the neck and beat him into consciousness.  I don't want to tell you more, but rest assured that the dialogue is crisp, insightful, and wonderfully real.  The story is crystalline, full of metaphor, nuance, and irony.  It is also breathtakingly violent, showing us how much we all need the equivalent of a sharp, short, shock to the face, to spit a few teeth into the sink, to feel the sting of lye burning through skin, through sinew, into bone.  Pain may be the most real thing we have.  It's the only thing that may make us listen--to ourselves and others.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt shine, but so do the rest of the actors.  The cinematography is lush at times; macroscopic at times; flamingly good.  The directing is a wonder.Films rarely are this good; stories are rarely so timely.  And as you watch the final moments unfold, they may put current events in a very different perspective.  Thank god this movie was made; it would not have been made later--as you will learn.Watch it.	5.0	Art.	2003-10-12	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2TBMX78M7PD5T	"Malvolio ""scott15724"""	"Synopsis: A young auto industry analyst finds an antidote to the boredom and emptiness of his life by participating in a brutal underground sport called Fight Club. As more and more disaffected men begin setting up clubs in urban centers everywhere, the movement takes a sinister turn, ultimately expressing itself in apocalyptic violence.Fight Club includes a surprise twist that may make you think of other movies like The Sixth Sense or The Crying Game. But the surprise here is not built in with the cleverness and subtlety of The Sixth Sense - you won't be tempted, for instance, to go winding back through the movie trying to find clues. And that's all right: because while The Sixth Sense gets its creepy power from subtlety and sophistication, Fight Club's calling cards are brutality, attitude and corrosive humor. Like the desperate contestants in the pastime that gives the movie its name, Fight Club throws a fusillade of punches hoping that enough of them will land to make it a winner. Ultimately it succeeds.The story's narrator (Edward Norton) is a twentysomething who investigates auto accidents for his employer, an unnamed car company. It's his job to calculate whether enough consumers will die horrible deaths as a result of the automobiles' defects to make it financially worthwhile for the company to initiate recalls. Not surprisingly, the young man has trouble sleeping; he spends his bouts of insomnia poring over catalogs from places like Ikea, compulsively furnishing his apartment in a quest for emotional satisfaction. For a while he finds some human comfort by frequenting cancer and disease support groups, feigning illness in order to connect with the other attendees - but that's ruined when the groups are infiltrated by another ""tourist,"" played to cynical perfection by Helena Bonham-Carter. Finally, on one of his frequent business trips, the narrator encounters a challenging, wildly unconventional soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) - and his life takes a radical turn.The core of Fight Club is the tension between the charismatic Tyler Durden, a nihilist whose antisocial behavior spins ever more perilously out of control, and the narrator, an ambivalent character with one foot in the fight clubs and the other still in the button-down world of corporate conventionalism. Edward Norton does a beautiful job with the lead role, convincingly embodying both sides of the conflicted young man; he provides the movie with its emotional core, and holds his own even when sharing the screen with his incandescent costars. Pitt gives the film its ferocious energy and sense of danger, in much the same way Tom Cruise lit up an earlier Brad Pitt movie, Interview With the Vampire. For the part of the hard-bitten, consumptive looking Marla, Bonham-Carter provides just enough vulnerability to make her sympathetic by the movie's end without compromising her character.Insofar as it focuses on the narrator's eccentric quest for human connection, Fight Club is a brilliant film. The metaphor of reaching out and touching other human beings with a bloody fist is not only inspired satire - it is oddly fitting as an emblem of our culture's increasing social clumsiness. (The only way to break through anyone's carapace of possessions, arm's-length communication devices and 21st century intellectual reserve is to beat his head against a concrete floor.) Unfortunately, the movie eventually runs short of material in the fight clubs and shifts its attention to ""Project Mayhem"" - wherein Tyler Durden's nihilistic vision becomes the linchpin of an improbably vast underground movement. At this point, Fight Club loses its power and focus. It is also around this time in the film that we are let in on the surprise I mentioned at the outset. Although the surprise does shed interesting light on the character of the narrator, it doesn't manage to save the last twenty minutes or so of plot development. Despite its faults, though, Fight Club is well worth seeing. Its rawness, edgy humor, and exciting performances easily compensate for the late failures of the plot."	4.0	Fight Club delivers a TKO	2002-07-24	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3DT5X9I5IAEBL	man_invisible	After seeing this brilliant, definitive-of-our-time movie trashed left and right by...other critcs, I was expecting something derivative and poor when I curiously went to see it.  Instead, I was riveted, amused, and left quite shaken by the experience &quot;Fight Club&quot; unleashed upon me--so much so I saw it two more times in the theaters before it was unfairly scuttled into limbo.  David Fincher is simply the most exciting, risk-taking director working in mainstream Hollywood, and it really surprises me that a major studio was willing to shell out big bucks on a project this risky.  Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't see the same movie I did, which caused a short theatrical run.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make an incredible team here, and it's good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a characer without an English accent.The way the movie indicts materialism as a form of security and satisfaction is a statement more true than many figures in Hollywood are willing to accept, no doubt.  Norton's anonymous everyman is easily accessible for comparison with ourselves, and his deadpan narration perfectly encompasses his losing fight with the modern world as his sanity drifts.  Pitt's Tyler Durden is an all-id misfit that's really the highlight of this &quot;pretty boy's&quot; career, because the character runs against his image.The filmmaking technique is dazzling despite its considerable grunge (a Fincher trademark).  A lot of scenes are carried out with incredible innovation and originality in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (Norton's direct-to-camera explanations, wobbling film stock, subliminal images, etc.) as opposed to a normal Hollywood film that would merely do something in a derivative way to get it over with.All in all, if you allow &quot;Fight Club&quot; to suck you in, you'll go away from the movie shaken, high, and absolutely exhilarated.  Personally, I'm all for a theatrical revival.	5.0	simply incredible	2000-10-24	14	11	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30ZPSYOGFJXR6	Manola Sommerfeld	Excellent commentary on our decay as a society.  Superb dialog (&quot;Which historical figure would you like to fight?&quot; &quot;Gandhi&quot; &quot;Me, Abraham Lincoln.  Tall guys are good fighters&quot;).  There were a few details that bothered me all along, like Tyler showing up at Marla's apartment (how did he know the address?), or how Tyler's knowledge of explosives did not link him right away to Jack's condo.  But the bother i felt was more like having a minuscule pebble inside your shoe while rushing to catch the bus: you know it's there, but it's not too painful to stop and get it.  In any event, i was very surprised at the end, and everything made sense.  What a relief!  Brad Pitt was another big surprise.  He is funny and does a great job in his role.  No surprise with Edward Norton.  I would watch anything with him in it (even that Keeping the Faith fiasco of a movie), because he never lets me down.  In summary, this is a different sort of movie with a very smart plot.	4.0	A movie to watch several times	2001-10-09	1	0	1

If you get past all of the idiots that start rambling off the rules when you mention this movie to them, there is a lot to take in.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2O9ERK81HPK52	Marc Nolan	Please excuse my bad typeing...it is too early and i am too tired...sleep you heartless muse return to me.Well at the time i saw this movie i was in college. Far away from the little city i call home up here in the SF Bay  area. I was down in Long Beach, near the bright lights of LA. But those  lights dimmed that night just long enough for the silver screen to change  my mind for all eternity.  My two close friends at college Molly and Matt  are dragging me to a movie that i havent heard anything about, not one  preview or review this is a pure trust issue. The film opens up with ed  norton in some sort of situation with brad pitt..both good actors. Norton  for American Histroy X and Pitt for 12 Monkeys..another great film. Anyhow  i decided to pay attention...somewhat. Little do i know that within a half  an hour i would be blinking. I wouldnt want to miss what happens in that  micro-second while my eyelids flash down and up to flcik the film off my  retina's. YOu can tell that i liked it. i will not tell you what  happens...i will tell you though to trust me like i trusted my college  buddies and go see this film. Never mind what you might have heard about it  just being a guy flick about men beating each other up...it goes so far  beyond that that the hubble telescope only brings back faded images of what  it used to be 1000 years ago. Then once you watch it (like the sixth sense)  you will need to see it again and again to pick up on it all.  Trust me you  will wided your mind with this one...it is the psychodelic drug that feeds  your breain and it is all perfectly legal.Thanks for reading this far.	5.0	Opening Night, Opening Horizons	2000-02-10	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ABO092BYA4VMU	Marco Freire	"David Fincher's best film so far is violent, hilarious, disgusting (verbally and phyisically) and fun. Brad Pitt stars as Tyler Durden, Edward Norton is credited as ""narrator"" and Helena Bonham Carter as sexpot Marla Singer. Norton flies off to L.A. where he meets a new ""friend"" (Pitt) who sells soap causes mischief and later, starts fight clubs. Later, Pitt asks Norton to hit him, and then the two start brutally punching and kicking each other. Soon, this ""sport"" has now developed all over the country. But, Pitt has his own agenda. This movie is weird, although at times downright hilarious such as Pitt and Norton hitting golf balls into random places, fight club members doing their homework (getting into a fight, and losing). And Pitt sometimes says the most gross things, such as admitting he reads porn and masturbates, and the most gross thing he says is ""chop a penis off and throw it out the window"" But one scene where he holds up a liquor store clerk with an unloaded gun and the things he says are profound.Overall, a very good movie.Rating: 7/10"	4.0	Great movie, extremely funny but kind of weird	2005-04-26	4	1	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A11HESQXNWF5V6	Marc R Cebrian	I walked into the theater expecting to hate this movie...but walked out thoroughly amazed.  This is one of  the most under-rated brilliant films I've seen in a long time.  The directing and editing style is top notch  that keeps pace with the interesting characters and ever-developing  plotline. -- People hated this movie, yet LOVED the &quot;Sixth  Sense.&quot;  I don't get it. -- &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a wonderful  satire in the age of &quot;Men are from Mars.&quot;  Over-the-top violence  seems to be consistantly misunderstood (see: &quot;Natural Born  Killers&quot; as an example) and it appears to have happened again here.  A  great story, snappy dialogue...plus, Edward Norton continues to demonstrate  himself to be one of the greatest actors of his generation...This movie is  a must-see for anyone who loves movies.  I can't wait to get the DVD so my  friends and I can end the raging debate about all the flash frames in the  beginning 20 minutes of the film.	5.0	One of  the Best over-looked films of 1999	2000-02-21	35	28	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A37YY9BZJ4RMZQ	Mark Erikson	There were a lot of movies in the 90s that were excellent (though relatively few compared to the piles and piles of crud churned out), but Fight Club was the best of them.No other movie really pulled in all the right elements to deliver a fantastic end product.  David Fincher as director, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, a soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, and Meat Loaf.I stumbled on Fight Club by accident.  The Sixth Sense was sold out, it was opening night for Fight Club, so I went.  There were only about five people in the cinema.  In fact, almost nobody saw Fight Club at the cinema.  In Australia it came and went in a matter of days, and most people never heard it even existed.  But word spread, and when it hit video every copy in Australia was out for weeks.There seems only two schools of thought on the movie, people who loved it absolutely, and people who loved it except for the unbelievable twist at the end.Personally, I found the twist to be only a slight stretch, since it was just an exaggerated example of something everybody does, and the story is made more brilliant because of it.	5.0	Probably the best movie of the 90s	2000-12-19	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15MSV5ENQRUTB	"Mark J. Repp ""themark"""	I am a big fan of both actors, cult and indy films, and most creative exercises in cinema. However, after waiting for &quot;Fight Club&quot; to  come to DVD, I was most excited about the Special Edition extras. After  finally seeing it, all I can recommend are the extras, and certainly not  the complete waste of talent that this film is. The &quot;story&quot; is a  contrived 2-hour-and-17-minute series of vinettes seemingly meant to  portray the characters' boredom with everyday life and how even graphic  violence can become boring and lead to more extreme sources of  gratification. &quot;Fight Club&quot; will leave you shaking your head,  leave you extremely disappointed, and make you feel both irritated and in  need of a shower. What a downer! Even indy film lovers will no-doubt feel  cheated by David Fincher's off-target directionless mess. Fincher thinks  it's cool and ground-breaking to use subliminal shots of a blown-up penis  (twice) and foreshadow the Brad Pitt character with one-frame shots of him  before he actually appears in the film.  Does this impress most viewers?  I  doubt it.This film seems to be targeted at viewers who love to thumb  their noses at non-film buffs who supposedly &quot;don't get it&quot; or  aren't &quot;smart enough&quot; to figure a film's message.  Well, let me  tell you, folks.  It's not worth trying to figure out this work of  depravity.  Telling us that the world is decaying is not much of a message,  is it?  And watching one sick scene after another is pretty depressing  stuff; although somewhat like watching a series of car accidents, it can be  addictive to some (hence, the 5-star reviews? ).  This film misses the  mark it intended to hit, and Pitt and Norton need a better film to show off  their acting range because this one is a waste.	1.0	Unbelievably bad	2000-07-21	78	25	53

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AY2WLFER9C9A	"Mark Schaefer ""themarkman99"""	A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable about disaffected, emotionally emasculated young men whose search for meaning leads straight to their inner bare-knuckle brawler. Fight Club is the brain child--make that brainless, testosterone-fueled gut child--of scruffy wild boy Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and a nameless, insomniac cubicle slave (Edward Norton). They meet on a plane, bond over the coincidence that they're carrying the exact same briefcase (though Tyler's is full of the chi-chi soap he sells to high-end boutiques, while our office peon's bag is packed with papers.) A freak accident blows our protagonist's tastefully appointed apartment to kingdon come and propels him first into Tyler's pestilent house on the industrial side of town, and then into a bloody, sweaty journey of self-discovery that never goes quite where you think it's going. Faithfully adabted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fincher's film is a brilliantly realized series of sucker punches, a philosophical howl disguised as a muscular guy movie. Neither Palahniuk nor Fincher is onto anything new: The plight of the post-feminist, post-war generation of men without fathers, coming-of-age rituals or meaningful jobs launched the Iron John movement and keeps an army of therapists in clover. But Palahniuk nails the searing alienation and directs it into something simultaneously horrifying and logical (not for nothing is he regularly campared to J.G. Ballard); in his hands Fight Club and its successor, the anarchic Project Mayhem, seem perfectly reasonable alternatives to spiritual suicide. One expense report at a time. Fincher translates Palahniuk's muscular prose into viscerally powerful images as fresh and invigorating as they are profoundly disturbing. He also gives Pitt and Norton the room to deliver what may be the best performances of their careers to date; Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto are equally striking in supporting roles.	4.0	The fist next time	2004-12-11	5	3	2

I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Chuck Palahniuk's works, whether by book or film. It's a wonderful film for Brad Pitt lovers as well.

The Novell, which I read after seeing the movie was just as good, was great to begin with!!! And the movie just brought everything to life! I dont think anyone could have played Tyler Durden the way Brad Pitt did! That is exactly how I would have imagined Brad Pitt! The first time I saw this movie I was blown away! I taped it, I bought the video, I bought the book, read it in about three days, and was not the least bit dissapointing. the movie is a great conversation starter too, because it leaves alot of doors open, but it doesant leave the audience puzzled. After seeing it, you wont say &quot; Wait, I dont get it?&quot; Youll understand whats happening but at the same time youll discuss it deeply afterwards. The movie delves into alot of deep issues, certain problems with modern society. And no matter who you are, after seeing this, you will not be able to disagree with the message in this movie. Actually there are a few messages, but they all connect to one thing. Although its a very graphic and violent movie, its not just pointless violence, it all has a part in the movie.

They did not do the movie justice.  And once you see the movie you'll understand why the trailer was lousy -- they couldn't really tell you much otherwise they would give the story away.  And no, it's not a movie about a bunch of guys fighting.From the first scene to the end I was hooked, especially after the first plot twist.  It was one of those &quot;what the...!&quot; moments.  If you are not offended by violence and sexual situations this movie is worth a shot, but pay attention to details.  I can't say more without giving away the very complicated plot.

This 10th anniversary release of Fight Club is staggering, and a testament to how a high-def release should be done. I read that David Fincher himself had minimal or no involvement in this transfer, which makes it all the more interesting knowing what kind of perfectionist he is.But rest assured, this release fulfills on every level. The video is true to the original print, with no apparent grain reduction or edge enhancement that I could detect. Detail in both close-up scenes and background is solid throughout.Even better than the video is the DTS HD Master Audio track--it buries the original completely. All the old reference scenes such as the mid-air collision, ""Operation Latte Thunder"" and car-crash sequences shake the building to its foundations.Watching this release again on Blu Ray--a film I've watched numerous times--was almost like watching it again for the first time.

And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm  not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AS7B4W4KOPQNV	Matteo	"This was one of the most clever and entertaining films I have seen in my entire life. It was filled with wonderful performances and interesting twists in the plot.  The movie is about an insomniac, played by Edward Nortion.  Because Edward Norton's character is never named, I will call him ""Ed"".  Ed is only able to go to sleep, once he has had a good cry.  So, he goes to depressing groups filled with men that are dying of cancer.  All of a sudden, a creepy woman, Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), starts going to these groups, which annoys Ed very much and it prevents him from sleeping.  Later on, while on a plane, Ed meets Tyler(Brad Pitt) and eventually moves in with Tyler because his house was burnt down.Later on, while fighting, Tyler and Ed find out that fighting really helps them let out their emotions and helps them sleep as well.  As a result, they start a secret club called ""fight club"", in which random men attend to fight eachother and let out their anger.  The club becomes very popular, and the men in the group form a sort of cult.  In this cult, the men start ""project mayhem"" in which they cause trouble around the world.One day, Tyler is gone, which leaves Ed alone with the cult and project mayhem.  Ed can't handle all that pressure, so he leaves and looks for Tyler.  For some weird reason, everyone keeps mistaking Ed for Tyler.  I'm not going to give anymore of the story away.  This is one of my favorites, and I reccomend it to anyone who can appreciate a brilliantly made film.  Go see this!"	5.0	Pure Genius!	2002-07-11	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JVK81G6D3M9T	Matt	This is as much a social commentary as it is a look at mental illness. Well written, brilliantly acted, and full of meaning and subtext. This is a far deeper story than many will detect. Watch it with one eye trained on mental illness and it is very different. Guys tend to like this movie because it is filled with a bunch of guys beating each other up, but that is not what the story is about at all. From the perspective of one with a psychology degree, this is a very sad story of a man with tremendous inner conflict and pain. There is much hatred, pain, self-loathing and self-harm between the lines. Fantastic movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2XINU2MGAERR7	Matt	This is easily the greatest film of all time. One of the reasons for being so great are the great preformances from Ed Norton and Brad Pitt. The film is very misinterpreted and have read many reviews stating that it is to  influental and nilistic, however it is really mocking it self on these  terms . Fo example Tyler Durden rebels against almost every product,  becuase we don't need it for survival, films included so why is there a  film about it, because it is self mockery. And this one of the things that  makes the film so clever and witty. The amazing plot devlopment at the end  is just amazing. This film contains many new style visual effects and the  mis en scene that is created by the greatest director around at the moment  is just fabolous and makes you feel like you are in the dark place where  the narrator is. This I think is one of those films either you love it or  you hate it. You have to read the film correctly, it is a black comedy  thriller. The comedy is very subtle but also very funny. Some of the  cleverest movie lines are in this film &quot; With a gun barrel stuck you  only speak in vowels&quot;. The screenplay has been very well adapted from  the book exluding of course the ending. YOu have to see this film, and even  if you don't like it you can still appreciate it for it style. In ten years  time this could be the most popular cult film of all time.	5.0	The Greatest movie or all time !	2000-03-13	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1VCPMT1RRS7K0	Matt	"The special edition bonus DVD is pretty indepth.  There is plenty of bonus material to keep you busy for a while.  There are deleted scenes included and you can actually choose the angle at which you will view some of them.  Pretty cool.  There are many short featurettes for which you can also choose the audio and visual options.  Overall, the special edition is a good step up from the original DVD.  The case is a cool matte finish and it folds out neatly.I genuinely enjoyed this movie.  It lets conservative people live out their fantasies through the character of Tyler Durden, much like Michael Douglas did to a degree in ""Falling Down"".  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are truly remarkable together in this movie and they each seem to be irreplaceable in their respective roles.  The scenes are gritty, grimey and nearly morbid, for the most part- which lends it a certain lure.  This film appeals to the primal part of most people.  I, personally, thought it was wonderfully different and very enjoyable.Definitely recommended viewing."	4.0	I want you to hit me as hard as you can	2006-02-07	12	9	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1N6T0S3QTG3DR	Matthew D. Felix	I'm amazed at how few reviewers understand the message of this movie is:Modernity is inherently alienating and dehumanizing, ANY kind of re humanization is better than none or rather that it's inevitable that humans will eventually be thrust back together in more tribal-type relations and that although the form that this will take will often be ugly the process is both necessary and better than the alternative (the cube,the suburbs etc). The fight club doesn't represent the corruption of the characters, it is their salvation! The fact that they have to be saved in such an ugly way just high lites how pathetic their normal lives are. The fight club represents a true society  albeit one that is very brutal and unsustainable (versus one like out own that is temporal,artificial ultimately irrelevant[since it really can't inform the future]).  Maybe it's just because I have reading so much about Bedouins for the last 2 years but it just was very recognizable to me.  The fact is that wherever or whenever you go, a real economy of human relations will have certain basic traits:it will be relatively small (50-200 people),it will have a hierarchy based on ability and needs, it will be efficient and it will be intimate. A beautiful,timely film.Matt	5.0	Many miss the point	2008-03-08	3	2	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AYR273GVA8S5D	Matthew G. Walters	Brad Pitt is proving himself to be the James Dean of our generation. After such brilliant roles as Jeffrey Goines (Twelve Monkeys) and David Mills (SE7EN), Pitt has reached a pinnacle in his role as Tyler Durden. Coming from the brilliant mind of satirist Chuck Palahniuk, Tyler could not be seen as portrayed by any other contemporary actor. The mannerisms, speeches and action of Durden are so well articulated by Pitt, that we often loose focus on the protagonist of the film, portrayed by Ed Norton (American History X). The catalyst that ties the whole movie together is the director, David Fincher (also of SE7EN). His work ethic of perfection pays of greatly in the end product of this film. Says Palahniuk in the DVD commentary (paraphrased, since I don&#65533;t have time to go back and transcribe it)'After seeing the end product, I was ashamed of the novel I wrote'. In an era where modern literature is ... and disfigured in the filmmaking process, this is a telling comment on Fincher's professionalism. I eagerly await his future releases, Panic Room, Seared, and (possibly) Rendezvous with Rama.This is definitely a DVD worth owning, with two discs, containing four commentary tracks, trailers and BTS; you will easily become a Fincher-Palahniuk disciple as well	5.0	Wanna Fight?	2001-09-19	2	0	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Denounced by several key critics and avoided by many moviegoers, Fight Club has seemingly found its audience on DVD. Pardon the pun, but its a knockout of a movie. Violent? Oh, yes. Gratuitous? I don't think so. I can understand the controversy. Violence in society is at the forefront of today's news. I don't think Fight Club is any more pro-violence than Saving Private Ryan is pro-war.Edward Norton plays a character referred to only as The Narrator. I think this was done for two reasons, one of which I can tell you without writing a plot-spoiler. His character is nameless because he has become so alienated and frustrated that he has no identity left. He is the victim of the empty promises of the bourgeois lifestyle that, sadly, so many of us are caught up in today. Many of us work for corporations so vast that they are both faceless and soulless. Never in history have so many material goods been dangled before us, The the more we acquire, the less fulfilled many of us are. As the movie says, sometimes the things we own wind up owning us.One day, The Narrator comes up with a plan. He starts attending support groups for people with various mental and physical afflictions. He thinks he will feel better if he hangs out with those who are worse off than he is. This works until he meets the chain-smoking, neurotic Marla [Helena Bonham Carter], who has the same plan, but for different reasons. After a few weeks, he confronts her and demands that she change her schedule so that she doesn't go to the meetings on the days he does. When she refuses, he sinks back into his personal abyss. Things change when, on a plane flight, he meets Tyler Dane [Brad Pitt]. Forceful, direct and more than a little anarchistic, Tyler is the antithesis of The Narrator. When our character arrives home, he finds his condominium has been destroyed by a mysterious explosion. Not knowing where to turn, he calls Tyler, the only person recently who has made sense to him. He moves into Tyler's derelict house. Soon, the charismatic Tyler commandeers the basement of a seedy bar and transforms it into a fight club, a place where other frustrated males can beat each other senseless. A few months later, there is a string of clubs across America. Tyler becomes a hero of mythic proportions to the members, and The narrator is always right by his side.The idea of a fight club may sound like a testosterone induced hallucination. To a degree, it is, but that's taking the literal approach. Most of director David Fincher's movies are metaphors, and none is more so than Fight Club. Here he gives us a vision of a vast segment of males suffering a mass identity crisis because modern society has rendered them so powerless. The club is make believe. I fear the identity crisis may be real. Of course, beating each senseless doesn't solve their problems, yet there are many examples in history of groups so oppressed that they wind up taking out their frustrations on each other. Regardless of whether of not you agree with Fincher's assessment, the fact remains that this is a brilliant movie.The cast is superb. Norton and Bonham Carter have excelled in everything they have ever done, and Pitt has his best role since Legends of the Fall.	5.0	I loved this much maligned movie	2002-03-19	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ZQ5MR6UENUQD	Matthew McPherson	First of all, I'm going to keep this clean.  No socially acceptable  adjectives could make it clear how phenomenally great this movie truly was.  I gave it 5 stars out of 5, but it deserves 6 or 7 out of 5.  It is, in my  opinion, quite simply, the greatest movie ever made.  Every time I watch  it, I like it more.  For those of you who haven't seen it, Fight Club  is the story of one man's frustration with modern 'life' and what he does  about it.  Fight Club is the ultimate expression of nihilism.  It shows a  life that has hit bottom, that has lost fear, and can accomplish anything.  I heard people say things about it like 'The fighting was pretty good, but  it had a weird ending.'  These troglodytes didn't deserve to see the movie.  These are probably the same people who think that 'Starship Troopers' was  primarily an action movie, and that Jet Li is the greatest martial artist  in the world.  Not only did it have an incredible plot, but the writing  was fantastic, too.  There are so many lines that make me shiver when I  hear them.  You must buy this DVD.  You have no choice.	5.0	words fail me	2000-09-06	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3P7GYZQXT0QNK	Matthew Murray	Few movies seemed to divide critics and audiences the way Fight Club did in 1999.  Adored by some people and abhorred by others, Fight Club is a wonderfully complex and compelling film.  Is it serious?  Is it a social  satire?  Is it something else entirely?  Who can say?  Who needs to?  It is  a movie that you simply must watch, and whatever you end up thinking about  it, you will be a better person for having seen it.  Spectacular acting by  Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Brad Pitt (in approximately that  order) make an already interesting screenplay all the better.  The DVD  version includes lots of extras which enhance the experience of Fight Club  even further, but don't let not owning a DVD player prevent you from  watching this important and, I feel, thoroughly entertaining and worthwhile  movie time and time again.	5.0	A complex, but spellbinding, film.	2000-07-26	0	0	0

I missed it in the theatre's, like most, but didn't know much about the film when I saw it, which is great because it had such a profound affect on me. I've seen this dozens of times and holds up on every viewing. Carter is maddening and heartbreaking all at once. It's very dark and has great effects and camera movement, as you would expect from Fincher. Kind of Michael Bay actually done well.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ET1NZ7QZKN6M	Matthew Tundermann	Fight Club is a totally unique, underrated movie.  I rate it one of my personal favorites, especially the dvd version which comes with so many special features.The movie itself is so incredible due to the plotline, which has you moving in one direction and then throws you such a curve that you'll be blown away.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are incredible opposite each other, complimenting each other's different characters.  Norton portrays a bored man living a mundane, routine life that he desperately needs to escape.  Pitt's character provides Norton with that escape, but you'll never guess the way the movie will go once the action starts building.  It'll catch you when you're not looking.Fight Club is one of those movies that you'll need to watch again just to go catch some of the little things you might have missed the first time and help you enjoy the depth of the movie's plot.  With some dark humor thrown into the mix and plenty of action, I think Fight Club is a real winner.  It also features one of the best fight sequences in movie history.	5.0	A brilliant movie	2001-06-05	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"The movie: I love Fight Club. It's one of the best American films of the past 20 years. Literate, funny, disturbing, shocking, and endlessly entertaining, it's really without flaw. Thank goodness it got made before 2001, after which a film that lionizes the exploits of a domestic terrorist who plots to destroy buildings could probably have never been made.The performances are all quite good - Edward Norton before he started believing his own press, Brad Pitt, well, being Brad Pitt very well, and Helena Bonham Carter in the perfectly cast role (if not typecast at this point) are the highlights.I'm not going to say much else. If, somehow, you've avoided seeing this movie, I would hate to spoil it for you. It's a must see, plain and simple, up there with the films of Kubrick, Scorsese, and other American cinematic luminaries of the past 50 years.The Blu-Ray:Wow. I was cringing, hoping and praying to the Blu-Ray gods that this one wouldn't be ruined as other films of this vintage have, (such as Gladiator) by a terrible, disrespectful video transfer, loaded with edge enhancement, excessive DNR, and the like.Well, my prayers were answered. A fine, lovely film grain is preserved in this 2.40:1 1080p encode. Detail is very strong, especially in cloth textures. This is a DARK movie, and the blackness is well represented, with deep, rock solid blacks. Shadow detail is great, though, with loads of information present in the shadowy near-black parts of the picture. BE SURE TO CALIBRATE your TV before watching this! You must have your brightness, contrast, and gamma set properly to get the most out of this flick. The color palette of the film, with its sickly greens and browns, and its omnipresent fluorescent lighting, is well-preserved.Fight Club was an early DVD which was very good for its day. This Blu-Ray takes that DVD, smashes it teeth out, rubs its face in the dirt, and urinates on its corpse. The quality of this transfer is close to or equal to that of the best current films today. It really is stunning.Audio is presented in a 5.1 channel DTS-HD soundtrack that works perfectly fine. Much of the film is dialogue heavy, but when the surrounds get churning, they sound great, and do not obscure the dialogue. This is really the main thing I want out of a soundtrack - to not have to constantly adjust the volume while watching the movie. Fight Club succeeds.Extras include 4 commentaries, with everyone from the director to the stars to the author of the original book having a say. The making of and retrospective features are a mix of old and new. I can't tell if all of the extras from the previous disc are present, but at least some of them are. The new stuff is in HD, the old stuff in SD. I must say, the organization of the extras is not great. The menus are a tad confusing, and a lot of small things are hidden in small corners. Most irritating is ""Jack's search index,"" which mixes clips of the film itself with other more fleshed out features in a giant alphabetical list. Not very useful, given the need to remember what you've selected before.In summary:This disc is a worthy upgrade. It houses a great video transfer, and at least as much extra material as the original 2 disc DVD, all on one Blu-Ray disc. At the price it's currently going for, it's a steal.Even if some of the extra features are missing from the DVD (which I have not taken the time to confirm due to the irritating menu system), there really is no reason to hang onto your old set. This one is superior in just about every conceivable way. No DVD could do what this Blu-Ray does. It is unquestionably superior and should be the disc anyone serious about this movie owns."	5.0	Stunningly good Blu-Ray for a 10 year-old film	2009-11-17	16	13	3

The video quality is superb with very little to no excess film grain.  The color is balanced, as is the black level in darker scenes (this is a very dark movie, after all).  What really blew me away was the sound!  I thought the DTS track sounded pretty nice on the DVD, but wait until you hear this movie in lossless format!  The dialogue is so clear, the impact of punches, kicks and explosions is so real, you really feel like you're listening to the action live.The menus are also very clever.  If you owned the DVD version that had the red FBI warning screen when the disc started playing (the one that made fun of you if you wasted your time reading the pointless warning), you can expect more entertainment on BD.  I'm a huge David Fincher fan.  Get this movie and enjoy it again and again.I am Jack's Inflated Sense of Accomplishment.	5.0	Top-notch transfer of video and sound to your eyes!	2010-09-26	5	3	2

Now I don't mean I am able to relate to blowing up my own apartment or starting a seceret fight club in the basement of a bar or causing havoc all around the nation, no, I mean alot of the thinking that Narrator does in the movie I have thought the same to some extent as well. Fight Club is a wonderful movie when you see it the first time. However it is a thinking movie, meaning don't watch it with a bunch of your friends because youre bound to miss many important little details in the movie. Tyler Durden is by far my favorite when it comes to movie characters; His views on modern day society, specifically pertaining to the U.S. are views I can relate to and also find myself as a part of those views. To quote Tyler Durden ""We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra."" The movie takes you on a wonderful roller coaster of feelings and emotions, towards both Narrator and Tyler Durden. i believe this is one of Brad Pitt's best roles ever and I think a lot of people, when they think of Brad Pitt they also think Tyler Durden.

This ought to tell the prospective viewer one thing:  Here's a classic that should not be missed! True, some critics say there's too much gratuitous violence, but this is more than balanced by the dark comedy and social satire that pervades it. There's a definite philosophical undertone here that can't be ignored which adds to rather than detracts from the whole experience. Anarchy, fist fights, and mayhem were never so much fun to contemplate till 'Fight Club' came out. For the record, in an uncommon twist, I felt like the movie was much better than the book it was based on.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2WKKTVYS5H61M	Mecca Egypt	Fight Club is a very atmospheric, highly-stylized, complicated movie that deals with the issue of existentialism through the eyes of a nameless character deemed &quot;Narrator&quot; (Ed Norton).I thought that the film was all-over-the-place thematically (trying hard to juggle itself between Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot; and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;), complicated, and ultimately contradictory. If the film was so much about antiestablishment, anti-consumerism, and anti-big business, then why did they advertise many name-brand merchandise in their film? For instance, IKEA had to approve of its name usage the film's script in order for them to use it. The film is so hypocritical. In addition, the film gets rather lengthy and dull after the first hour. I found myself turning off the film and doing other things. Fortunately, I returned to it and during the end it started to pick back up. On first watch, the film is very confusing, but once you watch it a second time or at least ponder it within your mind for an extended period of time you begin to piece things together in the very complicated plot.I read a lot of reviews that said &quot;this movie made you *think*,&quot; of course this movie will make you think: what movie DOESN'T? Even if a movie is horrible, it will make you think, &quot;Wow, this is a horrible movie&quot; (or something along those lines), right? So spare me with that argument.Also, I read a lot of reviews from people who completely agreed with all of the film's hegemonic beliefs and ideologies. The idea that we are all &quot;living in a time with no wars, we haven't had any major wars, therefore what is our purpose,&quot; and the tired, fashionable, Gen-X notion that we are all living meaningless, purposeless, lifeless consumer-driven, commercial, social-climbing lives. If you *really* believe this is so and stand completely behind these viewpoints, why don't you turn your COMPAQ computer off along with the SONY VCR or DVD PLAYER you used to watch the film, leave your 3 BEDROOM HOME, abandon your HONDA, and go to the woods, so that you can live off the land, smell musty, eat grapes, and get mauled by a bear.Stop griping and complaining about the world being a &quot;horrible, meaningless place&quot; and do something about it. Make your life worthwhile: go volunteer, help out in the communities of those in need (like the inner city or even your own community), try to make a difference instead of sipping your STARBUCKS FRAPPACINO and watching films by overpaid actors and writers, while you sit on your duff complaining about how screwed up YOUR WORLD is.	2.0	Thought-provoking or Hypocritical?	2001-03-07	30	11	19

There are actually some surprising similarities between these two standout films - both are a visual and psychological journey that will leave the viewer amazed and disturbed.  Pay no attention to the maniacs who rave about this movie.  Pay no attention to the maniacs who attacked this movie.  Just pay attention to 'Fight Club', for it deserves your entire alert mind.Read other reviews for a plot summary - I would rather bring up some rarely mentioned facts about this film.  This movie was based from a groundbreaking novel by Chuck Palahnuik, which deserves as much praise as it's theatrical counterpart.  'Fight Club' has an extremely enviable soundtrack, featuring a complete score by the Dust Brothers.  Their work, a blend of techno and atmospheric ambience, feeds perfectly to the chaos and brooding terror of 'Fight Club'.  I should also mention that Tom Waits also appears, as well as the best and siglemost inspirational band of all time - The Pixies.  Fans such as myself will be euphoric upon hearing Black, Santiago, Deal, and Lovering used perfectly (I won't ruin which song is featured in the film), as they should.Movies often not seen because of bad word-of-mouth: 'Moulin Rogue', 'Requiem For A Dream', and now 'Fight Club'.Ignore the gossip.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A23YAKEZBI286W	megily	..I went to see FightClub because of the contravery that was already forming around the movie that had been in the threatres for less than a week...but I left the movie theatre a changed person.Not only are the special affects outstanding and the dialogue so complex that you need to watch the movie multiple times to catch all the subtleties, but the plot line itself has lays upon layers of meaning!  If you want a love story, you've got one, if a strange and fairly disturbing version; if you want some good ..fighting, there is that, too.  And may I state a second time that the special effects are beyond reproach, which is a very high compliment coming from me.  But none of these things are the reason that FightClub stands out in my mind...the movie is so amazing for the multitudes of messages that it portrays, messages that I believe every single person on this planet needs to be hearing right now!  Why do we let what job we have dictate our lives; why do we spend our entire lives trying to pay off credit card bill depts that we used to buy furniture that we didn't really need?  Do our possessions make us who we are?FightClub is about two men who somehow, despite the American world they have grown up in which is totally based upon consumerism, find a way past it all, and find a way to fight back.  It is trully too bad that more people have not seen this film, that there are people who will never watch this film because it is known to be 'violent'.  Yes, there is violence in this film, but believe it or not, it is not violence without a point; Tyler Durden and his buddy use violence to awaken the mind, as a means to see things as they really are, with the blinders taken off.  And as their blinders come off, so do the viewers, and they get the chance to see America in a way we would never view it ourselves.I would recommend this movie to anybody, whether they enjoy violence or not.  If it turns your stomach, I implore you, fast foward through those sceens (there are not all that many, in actuality) and watch on.  You will not regret it!	5.0	Everything that you could possibly want in a movie	2001-05-17	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"In ""Fight Club,"" Edward Norton plays a man who is completely dissatisfied with his life. He begins attending support group meetings in an attempt to fill the void. Along the way, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a messed up girl who's also working the support group system, and Tyler (Brad Pitt), an eccentric yet admirable soap salesman who helps Norton's unnamed character form a fight club, where men get together and release their aggression by beating the crap out of each other. Eventually Marla becomes involved in a dangerous affair with Tyler, and the fight club phenomenon catches on as more men join the group and branches of the club start popping up all over the country. Norton's character finds himself trapped in what appears to be a hopeless situation, and then a shocking revelation near the end of the film turns everything upside down.Yes, this film is violent, which is why a lot of people don't like it. But ""Fight Club"" is absolutely brilliant, with a unique plot, fantastic characters, and a perfect mixture of depressing, horrifying, and hilarious moments. This is a truly unconventional movie that deserves many accolades, and it's a lot of fun to watch."	5.0	I love this movie!	2007-10-22	4	3	1

Which is how I ended up viewing this movie. I won't deny it's a little odd, but oh so quotable and one really can't beat Edward Norton. In my book he's a better actor than Brad Pitt, and he's no slouch either.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ADTUS88NFTW23	"Melkor ""dark lord"""	Fight Club is my favorite movie.  For years my favorite movie was Terry Gilliam's Brazil, but Fight Club has managed to remove it from the mantle and take it's place as what I consider to be the finest film ever made.Not to quote the infamous line from the movie, but you truly cannot tell a person about Fight Club.  It's like The Matrix, it's a film better seen the first time knowing nothing about.  Even better if you go into it with misperceived notions of what the movie's about, so you can be proved wrong.I think the only problem with the movie is that it was meant to be seen on the Big screen.  It uses certain camera tricks and techniques that were meant to enhance the theatrical experience.  I fear that anyone seeing this movie for the first time at home will not take from it everything that the theatrical experience provided.So...for a proper viewing of this film...PLEASE follow the following rules:  1) be relaxed.  be ready and in the right state of mind to sit back and watch a long film.  It's NOT like watching &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, but it is an involved film that will require your patients and attention 2) remove all distraction.  Go to the bathroom, unplug the phone, and be settled to watch a great movie 3) turn off the lights, you'll like the movie a lot better in darkness...it's a very dark film and you'll need darkness to see everything 4) if you didn't like it...wait two weeks and watch it again.For a movie review:  It is difficult to talk about the film without ruining it.  I first saw the preview for it when I went to see The Phantom Menace.  It was part of a Fox set of previews.  I saw a bunch of guys fighting and a bar of soap.  I thought, &quot;Is this like that lame Van Damme movie Lionheart?  No thanks.&quot;  In fact none of the previews made me want to see it.  Months later, after it's release, I heard a radio add for the film.  The add sparked a little interest in me because it involved the reading three scathing reviews by critics and one positive review.  I thought it was very ballsy of them to release those adds, but I still didn't go see the movie.The next week I was away in upstate New York on a job interview.  I was flown there from California and had nothing to do on Thursday night in the tiny town that I was staying in.  They had an impressive movie theater, so I thought I'd unwind from my 10 hour interview by taking a film in.  When I arrived at the theater, Fight Club was just starting, so I bought a ticket on a whim (even though I really didn't like Lionheart very much).  I walked out of that film with my mind buzzing.  I had just enjoyed one of the most incredible theatrical experiences I had been through in a very long time.  As soon as I go back to San Diego I took three friends to see the movie.  I was so excited for them to see it and to hear their reaction.  I Needed someone to talk about the film with.  After the movie, and for the entire ride home in the car, no one said a word.  I thought to myself &quot;Oh no!  They hate me for making them see this movie.&quot;  Finally all three broke the silence and thanked me for taking them to one of the best movies they've ever seen.  I saw that movie 4 times in the theater, because I wanted all of my friends to see it.  Some loved it, some hated it, some didn't get it...but all were happy they saw it.I don't want to give away any of the movie.  I'll just warn you that you'll like it or you'll hate it.  Either way, you should see it.  If you have no opinion about it...you need to learn to think a bit more critically about your world and the art that you see, because this is a film that you should have an opinion about.As for the DVD, like the Seven DVD, David Fincher packs it full of goodies and commentaries that make it a worthwhile purchase.Finally, you can make a great Trilogy if you watch three movies in this order.  First watch American Beauty, then Fight Club, and finally Office Space.  All three films have similar messages told in very different ways.  Watch Office Space last, because the first two films are so heavy, you might need a little comedy to lighten your mood.  Warning: watching these three films may make you quit your tedious job/life and go look for something more fulfilling in the world.	5.0	My Favorite Film	2001-04-17	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3MADDVW4SWWK8	Messianic Nihilist	title- A great film to own, but wait for the DVDFight Club is a fantastic film... In it's original and unique style, Fincher has created a method of artisitic film that I'm sure will copied over and over  again.But it's not the style that draws you to the film; it's the  immersive world of the nameless Narrator (Edward Norton), a world all to  familiar because it is ours.Tough, gripping, and cynical, Fight Club  asks us to step aside and take a look at our own consumer culture and ask  ourselves if we like what we see: That is the real message at the heart of  the movie, and it is conveyed through the nihilistic icon Tyler Durden.  Durden's dark philosophy is not meant to be something imitated or looked up  to; Tyler is a warning, he is representative of the cultural dissident that  will inevitably be created by the empty consumer culture in which we live.  The message is that if we don't fix ourselves, Tyler may be our only  solution.Even if you'd rather overlook the deep philosophical subtexts  within the film, Fight Club is an enjoyable, fast-paced, uniquely  staccato-styled film that grips you by the throat and won't let go. You  couldn't stop watching it even you wanted to.The DVD version of Fight  Club, with it's endless extras, and capacity for INCREDIBLE home theater  experience, is probably one of the best DVD versions of a film that has yet  been released!	5.0	perhaps the best DVD version of a movie yet released	2000-05-04	2	2	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AAHNNU77VQHGD	Mete omolu	"The movie, ""Fight Club"" is the story of the socially-challenged Jack, a 30-year old man who lives in an urban area. Jack is suffocated by his job  and badly suffering from insomnia. At the beginning of the movie, the  interesting point that drew my attention was Jack's struggle to find an  appropriate club or association, in order to overcome his problems and  distress. Furthermore, in the movie, thousands of  social clubs and  self-help groups' adds on  newspapers gives clues about aspects of urban  life and social interactions in highly industrialised societies.I think the  movie, &quot;fight club&quot;, so far is one of the richest movie in terms  of urban sociology. It reflects an aspect of a young man's life, fellings,  fears and problems in a highly industrialized city. The urban life is quite  hectic, competitive and almost every social movement has been  institutionalised. It is possible to see many social associations clubs,  these clubs are for variety of specific groups in those societies, such as  associations or clubs for subcultures, gays, feminists or for people who  have cancer. As people are away from their parents or relatives or have an  limited time to see his/her parents or relatives in urban life, people  usually feel alienated from the whole society in urban areas, they,  therefore, prefer to share or solve their problems through psychiatrists or  social clubs and self-help groups. That was the case, as far as I have  noticed in the movie, since Jack(Edward Norton) was living alone in an  urban area and probably he was away from his parents and relatives, by  looking at newspaper adds he was trying to find a self-help group to solve  his sleeping disorder. Obviously, I suppose, people in urban areas view  these associations or self-help clubs as essential part of urban social  life, in such clubs people meet people who suffer from the same problems or  who belong to the same ethnicity or group. Thus, people are able to deal  with their loneliness and alienation in urban areas. These association and  self-help clubs in urban areas virtually replace with strong friendship,  kinship and other close social relationships in individuals hometowns or in  rural areas.  In addition to urban alienation, which occurs as a  result of lack social ties and interaction among individuals in urban  areas, commodity is the second step for those who experience urban  alienation. In the movie, Jack was quite upset when he saw all his  furniture was burned in his apartment, and he said that ""my furniture was  me"". By this statement, it can clearly be concluded that Jack virtually  identified himself with his furniture and the other properties that he  held, besides he viewed them as important parts of his life. Obviously,  this scene is a good example of commodity fetishism. In commodity  fetishism, alienated people, in urban areas, virtually identify themselves  with their wealth and properties. Individuals' cars, furniture, houses,  wealth and even type of credit cards are the chief indicators of their  prestige and status. Commodity fetishism is especially valid in the urban  areas of highly industrialised countries.  For me, the movie, ""The  Fight Club"", is not just a movie but a reflection of the highly  industrialized societies within their own institutionalized structure. In  the movie, therefore,  the importance of self-help clubs and other social  association clubs in urban areas are emphasised. The terms such as urban  alienation and commodity fetishism are clearly displayed in some specific  scenes of the movie."	4.0	Social life in urban areas	2000-08-30	1	0	1

Graham ""mabelle805"""	Had I paid attention to the lukewarm critical reviews this movie received upon its relaease, I would have passed it by in the video store, and that  would have been a mistake.  This is a brilliantly conceived, written and  acted examination of the age-old philosphical question: what is the meaning  of life?  &quot;Fight Club&quot; attempts to answer this question about  modern life, which the film views as a vicious cycle of consumerism and  dissatisfaction, and then you die.  This movie is a lot more than a series  of punch-ups among testosterone-driven Neanderthals; it stayed with me for  days.

"The first rule of fight club is ""you do not talk about fight club"",  but i'm gonna risk both this and the second rule of fight club: ""you do not talk about fight club"". David Fincher is a funny guy.FC is about an insomiac (Edward Norton in fine form). he has a crap job which involves daily menial tasks. but he is clever/cynical - you decide. He takes a bunch of pills to sleep but they dont work, then he finds the answer...He attends help groups and by crying/letting others cry he can finally sleep. thenhe meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carta). She attends help groups (a 'tourist') including one for testicular cancer (dont ask). After meeting her he cant sleep.Then he mets Tyler (Brad Pitt). Tyler Durden. Then his apartment is blown up and moves in with Tyler. Him and Tyler start Fight Club.  It goes national. Marla and Tyler have rocky relationship that falls apart, but thats a sideline to the main story.The Edward Norton character becomes suspicious of Tyler and finds out the real reason..and target... for Fight Club. cue plot twist and jump back to the first scene of the film.This film has everything from topless totty (HBC), to fights, to explosions reminiscent of McVey. Oh, it has a killer plot as well that twist every time you think you get it right up till the final not-quite-climactic scene. and it explains that you can make dynamite from soap and sell rich people's fat back to them.Laced with irony, wit, and sharp dialogue this is David Fincher's Pulp Fiction. something for everyone. it is a must see film."	5.0	The First Rule of Fight Club is...	2005-03-04	2	1	1

You see this film has an ending that like Sixth Sense, will most likely be an incredible suprise. I'm not going to spoil either movie, but it must be said that like Sixth Sense, Fight Club stays true to two very different realaties, and repeated veiwing will show that the neither reality was fundamentaly violated. This is the great thing about the DVD, you can watch the movie enough to really understand the movie.One note, many people have seen Fight Club as extoling violence and nihlism. I would alter the alternate viewpoint that the movie's message is merely to demonize any lifestyle that would so deaden a person to feeling, that people would have to turn to fighting, and masochism to feel anything.	5.0	Too Brilliant for its own good.	2001-04-02	2	2	0

Two hours later I had never been  so happy to be proven wrong. And I was proven very wrong. This movie is  amazing. I forgot that unlike other Hollywood pretty boys, Brad Pitt has  integrety and would never make a movie like Titanic. Fincher Pitt and  Norton are just the ultimate combo.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1RG9ZHTI0KHVW	Michael Sharkey	Beautifully photographed and exquisitely directed, David Fincher's Fight Club is a full-on assault to the senses.  But don't get me wrong, this is not a bad thing.  The central plot revolves around a bored yuppie portrayed  by Edward Norton.  In his quest to find some higher meaning in life he  stumbles across two dominating characters, portrayed brilliantly by Helena  Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt.  The chance meeting between these individuals  will forever change his life as he is propelled into a grimy world of  support groups and bare knuckle fights.  While this may not be considered a  fun film to watch, it will stick with you long after it is over.  Bonham  Carter is devilishly good as the snooty Marla and Pitt is a fireball as the  macho Tyler Durden.  But again, it is Ed Norton who propels the film along.Although not a typical action movie, the pace moves very quickly  despite the two hour running time.  The fight scenes are indescribable as  Fincher shows the reality of what happens after being hit in the face.  Fight Club does have flaws but the end result will not disappoint.	5.0	Believe the Hype	2000-05-24	28	21	7

Each repeated viewing of this film turns up new details, plus this is a good excuse to watch it as many times as you can!The DVD is full of extra features which go into great detail about the creation of the film.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2JRLX8JPDB9KR	Mike Davidson	I was on a streak of bad movies before I saw this masterpiece, and it provoked me to see it 3 more times.  It combines a unique blend of comedy, action, drama, and even a great mid-movie plot twist to form, in my  opinion, the greatest movie of all time!  Norton's character is especially  cool - you can relate to him in a lot of things, whereas Pitt's character  proves to be the exact opposite - a man who has the ability to let  &quot;that which does not matter...truly slide.&quot;  I now have the movie  poster adorning my door.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE, and take your friends and  family with you!	5.0	Best movie of all time	2000-02-16	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2BDJ6TVFL85TF	Mike	This is such an awsome movie I really can't understand how thisdeserves any less than 5 stars.  The acting, concept, and just theoverall appearance of the film is done to perfection. It was shot and edited really well.  The only reason I guess someone could rate this so low as I saw someone rating it 2 stars is that they just didn't understand the concept of the film.  And I think some people just dont understand the comedy in this film.  It's supposed to be funny too.  I thought the humor was great.  And the acting of Edward Norton was outstanding.  Along with others like Brad Pitt.  I also guess the reason people would think to rate it so low was they were expecting a totally different type of movie.  It's definitley not straight foward fighting in some club.  It goes so much beyond that.  And I think that's what makes this movie so cool. And this movie was explained so well, they had an explanation for everything that you wondered about so you wouldn't get lost for too long.  Unlike movies such as The Sixth Sense which was praised when they don't explain it very well. How can someone go by for however long it was during the time between when he died and started talking to the boy?  You can't go by a day and not realize if no ones said anything to you let alone how ever long it was; I know it was quite a long time.  And how would his mother set up an appointment with him if she couldn't talk to him, and we know the kid didn't set it up?  I suppose I'm getting off subject I'm just pointing this out because it has always bothered me how a movie with such gaps can be praised like that.  I just think people were too caught up in the moment to think about it.  Anyways, Fight Club is one of the best movies I have ever seen and everyone needs to see it!	5.0	This is possibly my favorite movie right now.	2000-06-14	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1VLHZ9KXRGVE0	Mike	I am Jack's story:Fight Club is about total chaos and anarchy set in the modern-day world. You know the place. There is a gun pointed straight into our mouths and for a second, we see nothing but...wait, let me start eairlier...This is the story of a no-name individual (let's call him Jack) who feels, well, stuck. He lives in a very respectable apartment with some very respectable clothes and furniture with a very &quot;respectable&quot; job. Jack has spent the last six months of his life with insomnia. He can't sleep, nor can he keep a clear idea of what's going on around him. As he says, &quot;everything is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy...&quot; I am Jack's life, and I'm ending one minute at a time.I am Jack's solution:Along come the support groups...Cancer, tumors, trauma, Jack has none of these things, but for some reason, feeling the pain of others who do helps him sleep. Jack starts attending as many of these sessions as possible in an attempt to feel the world around him. He lets go, and cries with the victims of these groups. And, as he so eloquently puts it, &quot;Babies don't sleep this well...&quot; It seems that Jack is cured until Marla Singer comes along. Marla is a tourist to these groups just like Jack, and she reflects his lie. &quot;I couldn't cry...so once again, I couldn't sleep.&quot;I am Jack's call for help:We wake up on an airplane on the way home from a business trip. We stare at our single-serving peanuts and our single serving cup of coffee. Next to us, a man spouts his incredibly cynical, yet subtly brilliant views on the world. Meet Tyler Durdin...I am Jack's need for friendship...Tyler and Jack have an interesting conversation for the rest of the flight, and Jack leaves and arrives home to find his apartment in flames...I am Jack's complete and utter numbness...Jack decides to call up Tyler for a place to stay for reasons that are unclear to both us and Jack.I am Jack's new life:We meet up with Tyler in Lou's Tavern discussing the next step for Jack. What happens now?...I am Jack's inflamed sense of confusion...Outside the bar, Tyler discusses things that Jack can do to help himself, including offering Jack shelter at his home. Jack accepts and off we go...&quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can.&quot;I am Jack's thoughts:Fight Club is one of those rare films that was recommended to me by some friends of mine, who told me how cool and mind-blowing it was. The thing that makes it different from all of those other movies is that I actually ended up loving this film for everything it is and everything it tries to be (most of my friends' tastes compared to mine are drastically different). This film is sheer brilliance, and it sends a very strong and clear message to everybody: One needs to accept their life as it is and do what they can to make it better for themselves and others around them.I am Jack's DVD, and I am worth every penny.	5.0	I couldn't cry...so once again, I couldn't sleep	2003-08-16	8	6	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ZX5079G6KROH	"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian"""	When Susan Faluhdi wrote a piece saluting this film, but really promoting her own book Stiffed, I decided I'd better have a look. We're nearing the end of the Century and the Millenium and the jig is up in nearly every direction. The Cold War is over. The major political fights in America are over lifestyle issues. The folks producing films are forced to use vaguely focused Arab terrorists as villians, because the traditional communists are our friends, sort of. And Feminists are writing books in defense of abused MEN.Its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed up with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes from knocking one another senseless. First its the two friends, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton who knock one another about while living in a broken down abandoned building. But in the words of an old Chrysler commercial, it starts a movement, a momentum a beat. And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs forming all over America.You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed Norton handling the narrative, the voice-over. Ed goes through the usual contortions. Bored in the meaningless job he holds in the corporate world, Norton quits and takes up an equally meaningless unemployed existence with Pitt. Why work for the soulless corporate machine when you can appear just as prosperous with no job at all.Lingering in the background is a decidedly un-English-looking Helen Bonham Carter. Helen hasn't a lot to do but smoke cigs and look downmarket and fetching. The storytellers are holding her out here in hopes that either Norton or Pitt will make a move on her. For Pitt, that is out of the question. Norton walks her home a couple of times. But Helen doesn'treally get a lot of action in this movie. So much for the love interest.The movie is a guy thing you see. I can barely remember what the climactic scene at the end is about. Its just a lot of cosmic acting out; Jimmy Carter's Malaise. Its supposed to mean something, but it doesn't have to really, since its producing the requisite violence for a $75 million domestic gross. The violence is meaningless but necessary to stir interest among the 18-34 year old demographic this film is aimed at. Go see the Brad Pitt movie about Tibet, or catch Ed singing in that Woody Allan film of a few years ago. The Fight Club should have been aborted at birth.	2.0	Killing Time When You're Young	2001-02-20	8	5	3

I bought it for DVD, and again all I could say was &quot;Wow!&quot;  This is an amazing DVD packed with everything you could ever want on two discs.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	The first time I saw this movie, I roamed the streets afterward with a crazed look on my face, observing everyone I saw out of the corner of my eye.  The second time I saw this movie, I did pretty much the same thing.  It has an enormous effect on me.There's something very unsettling about &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  It's not the graphic violence; I can handle that.  It's not the idea that to be a twenty-first century twenty-something male is to be disenchanted and disassociated; frankly, that's just giving in to your inner crybaby.  No, the thing that's unsettling about &quot;Fight Club&quot; is that the whole system we've set up to pamper our enormous egos is a sham.  A wasteful, illogical, unspiritual sham.  The goal of this movie, then, is to be our collective soap.David Fincher is a great visual stylist, infatuated with his director's palette.  He uses every trick in the book here, and consistently stops just short of going over the line of good taste.  And to me, that's what makes this movie so special.  He pushes the limits, but it never feels like he is pushing too hard.  And for a two-hour plus movie chock full of special effects and visual magic, that's an astounding feat.Edward Norton is spot-on.  He is dry, constantly on edge, and very much awake.  I felt exhausted just looking at him.  The scene where he fights himself in his boss' office is both funny and frightening.  And Brad Pitt is just perfect here.  It frustrates me when people bemoan his casting in this part -- I wonder if they were watching the same movie.  The character needed to be charismatic, rebellious, intense, funny, very physical and especially very beautiful.  Who else could they have cast?  These two actors work extremely well together.  Of course if they didn't, the whole house of cards would cave in on itself.  And it never does.  Throw in Helena Bonham Carter -- witty, spacey, and crackling with life while doing a dance of death -- and you get an excellent triumvirate of lead actors.Two minor quibbles:...the exploding refrigerator scene was unnecessary, one of the few times when Fincher goes too far in his visual styling....Meatloaf, while definitely looking the part, just didn't have the acting chops to pull off his critical role.So it's not perfect, but it comes pretty damn close.Sometimes I feel like I can go on forever about this movie.  There are just so many good things to talk about.  But I'll stop now in the hopes that the masses who stayed away while it was in theatres discover it now.	5.0	I am Mike's glowing review of Fight Club	2000-09-26	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1HTBRDN8OGI44	Milo	Fight Club is the kind of film that you will watch and then see it again... and again.  It has so many hidden layers of social criticism that I was just impressed and fascinated with what the director intended to convey in this (beautifully shot) work of art.  The direction is perfect, the acting is flawless (even Meat Loaf and Jared Leto put on some wonderful performances), the storyline is twisted, intelligent, and carried out at the right pace.What makes Fight Club the great movie that all reviews below tout it to be?  Its radical criticism of modern consumerism is just one of many reasons.  Another one is its call for intelligent anarchy, one which seeks to awaken the modern man from the robotic position that social norms have designed and assigened to him.  One more reason would be the fact that it deals with one of humanity's primal insticts: violence.  Its depiction of violence as an art and a release from modern stagnation makes this movie, without a doubt, one of the best flicks of the past decade (and, certainly, of all time).As far as this DVD goes, it is worth every penny that we pay for it.  The original and artsy packaging is just one reason.  The extras and quality of the DVD itself is the other.  It is definitely worth buying.  Just renting wouldn' allow the viewer for further exploration of this brilliant film.	5.0	Beyond outstanding	2002-06-04	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	Whoever has seen the trailer of Fight Club will think that knows what it is about: a bunch of bored masochistic men that almost kill each other to prove they're alive. Ah, and stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.Truth is, that's only part of the package.Fight Club is a dark and nihilistic saga about the life of average men, at the brink of a new century. A right -or left- hook through the solar plexus of movie goers. A wake-up call to reality.Norton serves as an anonymous narrator; he's an average Joe, with a mindless job, drown in boredom, hungry for status and motivation; until he meets Tyler Durhem, a rebel soul that lives to impress others.Everything in Tyler is unusual: his wardrobe, his shameful way of saying things, his eagerness to look for fights. It doesn't take much time to lure the narrator to one of his fights and found The Fight Club, where the prerequisite to belong is to not speak of fight club.The intern fights are not enough, the pranks emerge. One step at a time, the club prepares to a bigger goal: massive destruction. And Tyler's and the narrator's relationship get fishy.Norton and Pitt throw themselves into their characters with such craft it's impossible to recognize them. Pitt is very convincing as the relentless Tyler; Norton finds a way to exude his wrath and confusion although his character is very cold.While Norton and Pitt try to see who will first break each other's nose, Fight Club lets out to the surface a splendid critic about greed, the waste of our consumit society, our egotistic aptitudes and the violent nature of men whose only contact comes when they are beating each other.No, Fight Club is not another movie of men throwing punches without reason, consumed by violence and self-pity.Good for that!	5.0	A real K.O.	2005-06-17	2	0	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Edward Norton who is billed as the narrator of the story, plays a man who suffers from chronic insomnia that has caused him to become obsessed with finding and buying all the objects that complete him as a person. In an effort to break free, he soon becomes a frequent visitor to self help groups. He begins to discover that hearing other people's problems make his pale in comparison which finally produces a cure for his insomnia. He also meets a slippery soap salesman named Tyler Durden ( Brad Pitt). The two soon become friends and develop the concept of underground fight clubs. All different types of men are allowed to take out their frustrations on the world by fighting each other. Tyler soon becomes obsessed with using the fight clubs as an outlet to rewrite the rules of society by assigning memebers of the clubs tasks to be completed before each session that consist of committing random acts of vandalism and violence. Things soon start to spin out of control however, when the phenomenon of the fight club spreads to other cities all acorss America and more and more men are willing to do whatever it takes to have their next fight.Fight Club is one of the best films ever made in my opinion, and if I had make a list consisting of my five favorite films, Fight Club would definately be on it. The film provides an interesting premise taken from the novel of the same name written by Chuck Palanhiuk, as well as constant laughs, hard hitting action, and incredible performances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. Both Norton and Pitt have great on screen chemistry together and appear as if they could be friends in real life. The fight scenes in this movie are extremely well choreographed and come off looking very realistic. They offer a savage and raw style of fighting that makes most fight scenes you will see pale in comparison. Perhaps my favorite aspect of Fight Club, is the story behind the film taken from Chuck Palanhiuk's novel. The issues of the story take an honest and humorous look at consumerism and the way that society is obsessed with defining themselves based on what they own. The film stresses that after awhile the things you own, end up owning you, and this is what leads Tyler on his mission to show that you are only free to do anything, once you have lost everything.Overall, the acting, interesting and humorous premise, and fantastic fight scenes all come together to create a fantastic film. Fight Club is one of the few movies that I actually consider a must own for anyone's DVD collection.A solid 5/5...	5.0	Definately one of my all time favorites	2004-12-06	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2T4GK3THJP374	M. Psiloutsikou	"... to all those people who made this great movie for all the bad things I said the first time I saw it. Let me elaborate..I only went to see the movie because of my beloved Edward Norton. You know, I have even seen smootcy  for the guy (which is not so bad, by the way). I spend most of the time pissed off because of all the blood, fighting, fake BS ""you don't need cars, furniture, label cloths"" until the time -sorry for giving it up- the narrator finds out Tyler doesn't exist but in his head. This story twist was all I really enjoyed in the movie... And I spent some time saying the worst things about it.Then the DVD was released, so I rent it for Norton's interview at Yale. Defining moment!!!! First of all the promotion package of the movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen (unfortunately these things only reach the US or at least they don't reach Greece), such an inspired catalogue, kind of reminded me of [...] The rest of the bonus material was good as well, but what was really worth it, was watching the film for the second time. Totally different... Knowing what is really going on, you have a chance to observe the little things that don't catch your eye the first time. Plus, I forgot about the blood and fighting and paid more attention to the excellent humor the movie has.. Irony mixed with anger, a bit desperation, and full of antitheses... amazing!For example, there's a scene where Helena Bonham Carter's character, a woman that is, enters a support group for men with testicular cancer... It's hilarious! Or the scene in which the macho Brad Pitt's character shows up in a ridiculous pink robe with matching goofy slippers.You have to see it.. please more than once. This movie just doesn't get boring. The more you see it, the more you discover. It's almost the same feeling you have when you come along amazing books."	4.0	My apologies....	2003-11-06	5	2	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	A fascinating, stylish and incredibly brave film that has touched a nerve amongst a generation brought up to work in useless jobs for 12 hours a day, this film is great if, like me, you've ever wanted to just smash something,  anything, into a million pieces and laugh at the mess.It's not just  about fighting, though - it's a dark comedy of contemporary society, filmed  in a dazzling, incredible style, and acted with panache by a series of  people who portray ennui compellingly. Edward Norton is fantastic -  half-dead, zombie-like, wandering through the film without any recognisable  personality, he's nonetheless compellingly cynical and world-weary,  especially in the few moments of office-bound, repressed rage he allows  himself. Both Brad Pitt and Meat Loaf (Meat Loaf!) are excellent too - Mr  Loaf being the only likeable character of the lot.These players move and  talk through a strange tale of a rebellious underclass, terrorism and soap,  culminating in an ending which, if not in the mind of the protagonist, is  the most astonishing ending to be at the end of a modern Hollywood  film.The music is great, too - the Dust Brothers do the spartan score,  which veers from stomping techno to soul and back again.Like it or not,  this film will stick in your mind.	5.0	Tear	2000-05-19	4	4	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	David Fincher's movie isn't at all what the title implies.  Okay, so there's fighting but there's definitely a lot more to it.  The movie begins with narrator Edward Norton as an insomniac who solves his problem by crying it out at support meetings surrounded by dying people.  That is until Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) turns up.  Also a tourist she ruins his sessions, until he goes to live with Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) after his flat is burnt down.  Both men manage to fight out their pent-up aggression and Norton almost manages to forget about the enigmatic Marla.  Gradually this 'fight club' grows into an expression against a comsumerist society with rules and orders.The movie poses several important questions about the nature of society and the nature of the self, comparing the rules and order of society with the rules and order of the self.  Certainly on this level it should be applauded as being in a recent rush of intelligent Hollywood movies, and this is definitely one of the best of the lot.  With regards to acting it's a real gem, with Norton proving once more that he is capable of just about anything a director can throw at him.  As Tyler, Pitt adds to all those annoyingly unnoticed superb performances that he's notched up and Helena Bonham Carter plays against type marvellously.It's also beautifully shot, demonstrating the characters' lust for violence well.  The violent scenes are not for the faint-hearted but there's also nothing gratuitous here.  Plus, there's an ending that makes you reevaluate everything that's gone on before.  This is scary, thought-provoking and at times absolutely hilarious viewing.	5.0	Not at all what I had expected	2002-04-07	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW	Mr. Cairene	Fight Club is a movie that scars.You walk around with a hot head(literally) for a day, trying to get to the bottom of it. This coupled with an overwhelming desire to see it again, and you have a serious state  of confusion. That confusion, left proffesional critics with no option but  to dismiss it as a showoffy stylistic exercise with no purpose. As a  regular viewer, I find this to be a truly unique film. Most say that its a  satire about gen X dis-satisfaction and rise of cults.Other, myself  included, call it a comedy. The truth is FIGHT CLUB IS ANYTHING YOU WANT IT  TO BE. If you have and IQ in the low 60s you may want to go out and get in  to a fight, and it is to you that most movie critics felt a responsibility  when panning the film, to the rest of you see this film, and then see it  again. It is so rich that you can't possibly catch all of it in one  viewing, so many ideas tossed around that you can debate, if that is your  thing. The one quib I have with Fight Club, and I'm sure you've heard this  before, is the twist half an hour towards the end.Without giving away  anything I will say that it ruins the volatile dynamic the film had going  between the lead characters. I would have loved to see where their  relationship would have ended up without the intervention of the script. On  the other hand this u-turn provides it with yet another sub-text,madness.  Whether, you love this film or hate it, (I loved it), you have to see it at  least twice, becuase you've never seen anything like it before, and  unlikely to see anything like it again. That makes , that rarest gem in  movies.AN ORIGINAL.	5.0	Mind Boggling	2000-03-05	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3PTEP0XNWPZ4S	mrcocoman	Provocative, intense, violent, insane, all these words describe Fight Club. But there's more to Fight Club than a bunch of fight scenes and violence, there's an inner meaning, which hints towards the fall of the  materialistic western society. The people in Fight Club are nothing less  than the victims. They are victims to society and each other as the story  developes. Brilliantly acted, an incredible plot, you can almost feel the  characters pain. The originality of this movie itself baffles the mind. If  you watch it once and then watch it again you can truly appreciate the  twist ending and the originality of the cinematography. What else is there  to say other than: Watch this movie, it is a MUST SEE.	5.0	One of the best films of the 90's	2000-04-30	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2JY9TJJVIHWHM	Mr. Creative	This movie is certainly not for the meek and there is no shortage of violence, however if you are a fan of Brad Pitt or Ed Norton, this film is a must see.  While the performances in the film are first rate, it is the direction of David Fincher that elevates the gritty and moody scenery to a supporting cast member.  If you've ever wondered what your life would be like if you simply did whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted to do so; Fight Club is the violently brilliant answer.	5.0	Talking About Fight Club...	2014-01-09	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AQ0Z03B8DLVAW	M. Rigdon	This is an excellent Blu-ray title and excellent movie in general. I got the special edition DVD when it came out and I honestly thought I was going to have to buy another copy before I heard this was finally coming out on Blu-ray. Many times when an older (only 1999) movie comes out on BD you can't really get much benefit from the higher resolution but they did a great job with this one. On the many closeups you can see minute lines and even beads of sweat that were unnoticeable in the DVD release. It really adds another layer of depth to the characters and makes you appreciate David Fincher for his attention to detail.	5.0	Yay!	2010-01-26	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AKZIMPFXCDPJZ	M. Rinehart	This is a great movie based off of an equally great novel.  Chuck P. always writes off the wall story lines, and this one is no exception.  The movie's cast put on great preformances about the unmasculization (if thats a word) of modern men.  Many people complain about the violence, but without it the point wouldn't come accross so well.  I'd reccommend this movie to most, especially those who are young white, and possibly angry, young males.  Then read the book.

With the media and advertisements revolving around us every single day, this movie presents the possibility of want versus need.  Then delving deeper past that, it breaks down the entire category of &quot;want,&quot; and what &quot;want&quot; even is.  What is truly necessary in life, and to get rid of what isn't.  The movie deals with fighting, but is not nearly as gory or disgusting as any war movie out there.  It depicts fighting as that which is primal and of life, not things like your Brooks Brothers suit, or Armani shoes or whatnot.  &quot;How do you know who you are if you've never even been in a fight?&quot;  To test your physical limitations and your actual mortality other than this perspective of who you should be as so friendly presented to you from the media and what deems us as viewable in society's eye.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1YHKSTVSYEYTU	Mr. N. Carnegie	"When this movie first came out I had no real desire to see it. All of the publicity was about how violent the movie was and there was not much mention of anything else. I was a bit of a David Fincher fan after The Game and Seven and I really like Edward Norton, who in my opinion is the finest actor of his generation, but I still thought who really wants to see a movie about people knocking lumps out of each other for 133 minutes? I certainly didn't and so weeks went by until one of my favourite UK movie magazines published their top twenty movies of 1999. What was top? You guessed it, Fight Club. But I still wasn't convinced. However, I'd seen everything else that I'd wanted to see and Fight Club was about to leave the theatres and on the basis that every review of the movie in the UK had been five star I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect to enjoy it but I kind of felt that as a supposed film buff it was my duty to watch even if I was going to hate it. I couldn't have been more wrong, I was blown away by this movie. It was nothing like I expected and nothing like the hype. And it's not just a guy movie either, I watched this with my wife and she loved this movie as much as I did and at the end she turned to me and said one word ""wow""! Sure there is some very realistic and gorey fight scenes in this movie but to characterise it as a mindless bloodfest is to do it an enormous disservice. This is an incredibly powerful movie that pulls one surprise after another. It has an incredibly original script, excellent direction and wonderful acting. Not only is the ever fantastic Edward Norton better than he's ever been before (or perhaps ever will be) but he is ably supported by Brad Pitt (who I'm generally not a great fan of) as the charasmatic anarchist and soap salesmen Tyler Durden, the superb Helenah Bonham Carter totally cast against type as Marla (...)(in what should have been a multi-award winning performance) and Meat Loaf. Yeah, Meat Loaf in good film, understated, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it? Not me but then Fight Club is that kind of movie, it is nothing like you'd imagine.I don't want to give the plot of the movie away in case you haven't already seen it. To my mind the best way to watch a movie (and in particular this movie) is with no prior expectations and an open mind. This movie is a rollercoaster ride that will take you places and directions that no movie has taken you before. How good is it? Well, I read a magazine interview and Edward Norton stated that when he and Brad Pitt watched the movie for the first time, Brad Pitt turned to him and said ""you know this is the best movie we will ever be in"" and Edward Norton agreed. That's how good it is! Darkly comic, a visual and verbal assault on the senses, Fight Club is perhaps a movie before its time that has divided (and will continue to divide) audience opinions to the widest of extremes. Does it have a deep and meaningful message? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't and maybe that's exactly the point, maybe that's how our world is at this particular place and time. Whatever, in my opinion Fight Club beats the hell out of most other movies and fully deserves five stars."	5.0	USE SOAP!!!	2001-11-28	5	4	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1S5B32WYMEE44	"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words"""	Fight Club is certainly not a monumental film, but it struck a chord about the modern condition.  The comedy is of the blackest variety and you will have to suspend any squeamish-ness you may feel toward very violent films to reap enjoyment out of it.  But all the roles are skillfully played, especially by Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden, and underlying the banality of blood and mayhem is a message...a message that perhaps life doesn't have to control us...life can be what you make it...just be carefully you do so thoughtful with positive human regard and a degree of clarity.  Attempting to control life can get out of hand.Chuck Palahnuik's novel comes to life in the adept hands of director David Fincher (of Seven fame).  It is no surprise that the scenes are slickly cool, the violence is of the &quot;in your face&quot; variety, and we are entertained despite our misgivings. The movie has some real &quot;Momento&quot; moments, so I won't try to delve into the story-line to risk giving any of those away.  A truly fetching role is turned in by Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer a chain smoking barely hanging on to life love interest of Edward Norton's.  Their chemistry and interplay is terrifically authentic and dead-on funny.  Brad Pitt take the show though as Tyler Durden, an ultra-confident hipster that makes soap.  The lines he and Norton toss back and forth are classics to be remembered and quoted in bars, around water coolers, at support groups.&quot;Fight Club&quot; is an experience you owe yourself, if not for anything more than to ponder the state of society and what is truly important.  I think if you see the movie out to the end and get past the violence, you may find this message though-provoking.  You just may find yourself laughing along the way.--MMW	4.0	Just Fight Not to Laugh	2004-06-27	4	2	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A154H6AY9C46IA	Nathan Stradinger	Perhaps the most controversial film of 1999, &quot;Fight Club&quot; fulfills that very request, nailing the viewer harder than they ever expected when they walked into the theater.  Needless to say, it  encountered harsh criticism from the word &quot;go&quot;.  The reason for  the criticism?  Well, that depends on who you ask.  Those who dislike the  movie will say it was simply too over-the-top with its handling of violence  and that it harbored fascist principles, trying to endear them to the  mainstream.Oh, shut up.I'm not going to dispute the fact that this  is a violent movie.  It is, but that's not the point of it.  Unlike other  movies that purvey violence simply for violence's sake, &quot;Fight  Club&quot; puts a mental twist into it.  Use the fight to reduce yourself  instead of glorify yourself.  Get one step closer to having nothing,  because it's one less hurdle you'll have to deal with later.  Is it  necessarily a well-rounded, intellectual plan?  No, but no one ever said it  was, anyways.  It's just a sexy concept that these men who seem to have  lost so much can latch onto.  Oh, and as for the fascist theory, this film  does deal with a lot of nihilistic principles, but it also doesn't put it  in a positive light.  Did the people who hated this movie not notice how  things started to spin way out of control after Fight Club began to grow?  I thought not.This film is also deliciously incisive with its dark  humor.  That's not to say that it doesn't straddle the line sometimes, but  when it does, it's clear that that was the intent of David Fincher &amp;  Co., if for no other reason than to take the viewer out of their comfort  zone.  Besides, this film deals with some sick people, so wouldn't it be a  bit out of character for the humor to be in the same safe nature as a  sitcom?Okay, onto the actual execution of the film.  One word:  brilliant.  Fincher's direction is superb in every aspect, from his limited  use of CGI to the minute details, and I mean MINUTE (subliminal Tyler,  anyone?)  Jim Uhl's adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's killer 1996 novel is  both faithful and filled with new scenes that you swear you read in the  book.  The editing is seamless, and again, the special effects never  overthrow the story yet add a new dimension to many parts of the film.  As  for the music, the Dust Brothers create the most original soundtrack of the  decade, refusing to play the game safely and instead making a sonic  companion to the film's feel, which takes more talent than most would  think.  Finally, the acting.  Although Pitt's name appears first in the  credits, this is Edward Norton's movie.  As our narrator &quot;Jack&quot;,  he portrays every emotion to a capital T.  His deadpan delivery in his  voice-overs provide some of the biggest laughs in recent memory, but in his  actual live-action scenes, you feel anything and everything he feels,  particularly rejection, redemption, confusion, and really, really, really  messed up affection.  But hey, don't think I didn't appreciate Pitt.  Just  as funny as Norton, his role is the more dangerous (and therefore, the  sexier) of the two.  In any other movie, he would have stole the show.  Finally, Helena Bonham Carter shifts so effortlessly as Marla Singer that  it takes awhile to fully grasp the character's changes.  Infectious human  waste she is not.In closing, while many people will not agree with this  movie, at the very least, they should pay it respect for being willing to  take on issues we don't like to acknowledge, its ability to make what we  don't want to see both provacative and intriguing, and its near-flawless  execution.This means you, Ken Turan.	5.0	I Want You To Hit Me As Hard As You Can	2000-07-22	0	0	0

Instead it delivers a comedic and intelligent critique of both consumer culture AND its extremist alternatives.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	When Fight Club was released in 1999, it was panned by many, if not most, movie critics who dismissed it as no more than a twisted waste of film.  What wasn't expected however, is how Fight Club has become a modern day cult classic that no one ever saw coming.  I won't waste time with the storyline, you can read about it in the Amazon review, but what I will say is that director David Fincher has come quite a long way since his directorial debut helming the dreadful Alien 3, the way he seamlessly infuses CGI with the film is amazing.  Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter give knockout performances.  Norton's narration throughout the entire movie is unexpectedly hilarious at some parts and chilling at others.  While yes, the film is quite brutal, but it is nowhere as violent as perceived to be, and I love the package design (the fact that negative reviews of the film are featured in the booklet is genius), and the commentaries and deleted scenes are worth owning the movie alone.  All in all, Fight Club is a stunner of a movie that will keep you wanting more long after the credits end.	5.0	"""I want you to hit me as hard as you can"""	2002-09-11	5	4	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AIOVEJXUCAQPI	"Nero ""CJH"""	"Fight club is a psychological thriller with twists and turns a plenty.  This film is a stance on our societal status which is a poor state indeed.  Fight club is filled with dark humor, it is a cult classic and of course it is an anarchical view of our society.  Fight club is a great film, and I must recommend to any and all who are willing to watchStaring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it is about a man's internal struggle that he pushes to his real world. His struggles with his self confidence, insomnia, and an addiction to self help groups slowly destroys what life he has (Norton).  This struggle is furthered by a slippery and sinister soap salesman(Pitt). The two men find them self's fighting as a ratical form of aggresion therapy and male bonding. Their idea of fighting groups catches on and ""fight clubs"" pop up all over the country.  These clubs lead to mad anarchical attacks on random targets all around town. All is well, or as well as it could be until an eccentric woman played by Helena Bonham Carter, gets in the way.  Her interference leads to a downward spiral into insanity, Violence and self realization.Fight club is filled with dark humor and a satirical view on our societies current state.  During the beginning of the two main characters relation ship Pitt's character ask, ""Are we really men, in the hunter gatherer sense of the word?""  He goes on to explain to Norton's character that we have become a society of consumers and not a society of providers. This scene is culminated when they fight simply to relax out side of the bar they were in.This films strange point of view has built a fan following like many a film, however, this is one of a special breed. Fight club is a cult classic, it is the cream of the crop when it comes to movies.  Not simply for its ultra-violent happenings, but for its underlying anti-conformist tone and unique political stances is what makes fight club a cult film.  Through fight club we follow these two characters through there disturbed and perverse adventure towards rock bottom and eventually self realization.This is most assuredly not a film one would want the kids to see, Fight Club is a film respected and recommended by many a critic. With its dark humor, ultra-violent satire and cult following, fight club has the ability to stay on a ""top movies of all time list"".  Like many before and many that are sure to come after, Fight Club seems to point out and even accent our societies worst aspects, though unlike other films Fight Club shows these problems in a cartoon like manner.  Still a movie it is a movie all should see at least once, twice if they want to understand it all."	5.0	Fight Club is no Fight Dud !	2004-12-06	1	0	1

It  is for all of us who have meaningless material possessions but still cannot  find peace inside. David Fincher has impressed me for the third time,(  Se7en and The Game)proving his place in making movies with a twist.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2CA4JPTCL6QIJ	newmath@yahoo.com	Chuck Palahniuk's novel captures the growing discontent with consumer-capitalism with this dark story.  Fincher's adaption is excellent, as are the performances of Norton, and Pitt.There is so much touched on in this movie, it's hard to list.  One major theme being the nihlism of modern society - and the all-too American obsession with acquiring material possesions to fill a spiritual and emotional void in one's life.Norton's character (an IKEA obssesed yuppie) finds an outlet for his angst in late night brawls with others who share his disillusionment.  Things escalate from there and culminate in a plot to bring about &quot;economic equalibrium,&quot; and a neo-tribal state harkening back to simpler times.  This work is a serious social critique.Make no mistakes; its a Hollywood production all the way, but there is a lot being said here.  If you like this, I'd recommend reading some more of Palahniuk's stuff, and &quot;TAZ&quot; by Hakim Bey.	5.0	Consumer-Capitalism, Primitivism, Culture Jamming and Soap..	2000-12-25	2	2	0

In the case of Fight Club, that may be true...BUT...part of you can't help but think, &quot;WOW, this is so  true...&quot;  Ed Norton plays your avearge Joe.  A young man who is  suffering from job insecurity and insomina.  He buys lavish things to show  his place in society, like most of us feel we have to do.  Ultimatley, he  comes to realize that everything in life you own, in return ends up owning  you.  Fight Club is an amazing film based on fantasy turned reality.  Somewhere, inside all of us, we have the same feeling and intuitions that  Ed Norton experiences in this excellent movie.  Although dark and graphic  at times, you will find that this movie is one that will soon become a  classic.  It's unfortunate that it hasn't gotten more recoginition.

This film easily keeps up to par with such movies as The Matrix or The Usual Suspects.  An explanation of the message the movie conveys, however, would probably take up more than the alotted space- it is NOT JUST ABOUT FIGHTING.  I will, however, say this: Fight Club attacks the most basic norms of our society and brings out truths we just don't want to accept.  Once you fully understand the movie, you will question some of the most basic things you do in daily life.  Fight Club is a MUST-SEE for any movie fanatic with an open mind and enough time to watch it more than twice. (You'll need to if you want to understand it!)

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AQIUKUAY2R2A8	nick	...do *NOT* talk about Fight Club. Well, I'm sorry, I have to.As we open Fight Club, we're introduced to our un-named narrator, played by Edward Norton. The Narrator is going through life as it is scheduled, nothing out of the ordinary except for his long, insomnia-ridden sleepless nights. He stays awake looking through endless magazines and infomercials looking for those special possesions that will make his life complete. Then, by chance, he realizes something:If he attends support groups (for which he doesn't really have the problems), he can find inner peace, and sleep at night. He joins every group he can find, and sleeps like a baby. His life is going perfect, until Marla. She was also a tourist, going to every group for whatever reason. Our Narrator can find no peace with another faker present, and so his life falls to shambles again. Then, he meets Tyler Durden, whose conversation style and way of taking what he wants is fascinating to Edward Norton's character. Durden and the Narrater find a new form of entertainment to fulfill their lives, they fight. Men watch them, and they fight too. Soon enough, it becomes a weekly meeting (or... beating) in a local bar's basement.Everything is going great in life. And then, Marla screws our Narrator again. She and Tyler fall into an affair which affects everything our Narrator knows, including their Fight Club. It grows into a national cult, and spirals out of his control, leading to a climax you won't believe, and you'll have to watch the film again and again to understand.---A great modern film from the director of the astonishing Se7en, Fight Club is a love or hate film. It's definitely a must-see at least once for everyone, as it is filled with action, dark humor, and suspense. Great acting from both Norton and Pitt, as well as several supporting actors. Beware if you're faint of heart of stomach, some of the fights are brutal...... but so is the mindf--- you'll experience from watching this flick.	5.0	The first rule of Fight Club is...	2002-10-28	1	0	1

Jack is like a slave to his deadening job at the office and has a cynical view of the world. He is trying to find a way to deal with his insomnia, caused by his discontent about everything in life. At first, he finds this in visiting support groups. Every week he visits different support groups and finds a way to release his tension by crying. This is until Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, shows up at every support group. Jack can no longer concentrate and therefore he needs an alternative for these support groups.He meets Tyler, played by Brad Pitt, and finds in him everything he is not; he has found his alter ego. Tyler is a sort of bad-guy, who is exceptionally convincing and confident and who has everything figured out. Together, Jack and Tyler start 'Fight Club'; groups of men fighting each other in a basement. These men are also fed up with society and by fighting they can get rid of their fear and hate.This gets out of control when Fight Club, led by Tyler, changes into an well organised fighting-machine which sabotages society.Jack develops moral doubts about Fight Club, but Tyler seems to get more and more extreme in this situation.At this point the movie starts to change into a psychological thriller, which makes it so good. The twist at the end is unexpected and is a very strong scene. Despite its humour, the movie comes across frighteningly serious. I guess that, and the superb acting of Norton and Pitt, is what makes people want to see it again and again."	5.0	One of my favourites!	2005-11-28	0	0	0

I had put off watching it for a long time, and then one day my roommate and I popped it in.  I was blown away.  I've seen it a few more times since, and each time it gets better and better.  There is a lot that a first-time viewer wouldn't pick up on and it's great to go back and pick those things out.  The acting (Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter....and MEATLOAF) is fantastic, as is the direction and the effects.The message of the movie has stayed with me ever since I first watched it - it is a fantastic commentary on our consumerism-driven culture as well as our lack of originality as a whole and our fear of deviating from the path of least resistance.  I may not be a guy, but sometimes I want to be Tyler Durden...I want to laugh at someone who deserves it, and question the status quo, and.....make soap.This is a movie that one cannot judge based on someone else's opinion (although I have tried my best to provide a very biased opinion!).

To hear people raving about it so much I was almost expecting the 90s equivalent of Citizen Kane. Nah. It's a very well-acted, extremely welll-photographed interest-holding film, and yes, it's not difficult to get all the underlying points, and yes, it even has a not-surprising but you-still-never-see-it-coming twist, thanks to the way it was directed. The only big flaw is Bonham-Carter's character, which is annoying and too much over the top. But that doesn't hurt the movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A26EYMWIKNV8LI	"Norah Brown ""rocketgal5"""	It is scary what most people are not getting out of this movie.  Yes, this movie starts out bashing materialism, but if that is all you can see, you've really missed it.  What is truly scary is that most audiences who are excited about this film seem to be to glorifying Tyler's character and praising his rebellion.  The guy is a Hitler character, killing people, destroying everything, and stripping individuals of their identity.  Sure people are fed up with capitalism to the point where violence is the only thing that seems real.  No one is denying that.  But, this movie is also a satire on the proposed solutions.  I think this is why people are confused at the end.  Everyone is willing to be cynical about our violent, materialistic society, but not many seem brave enough to consider the possibilities that could come with rebelling against it.  There isn't a tied up in a package message to this film.  It makes you think and think and think because some answers just aren't obvious.  Great film!  I hope people start understanding it better or we are all doomed!	5.0	Scary...	2000-10-15	2	1	1

It was a complex movie--a thinking person's movie--and the odd movement that sprung up within its context could hardly be characterized as excessively respectful of authority figures (the hallmark of fascism), or indeed of even society itself. Indeed, if you are foolish enough to judge Fight Club (the fictional Club in the Movie) in real-world terms, it was plainly message-driven rather than leader-driven: Some may recall the scene in which Cornelius nearly loses his manhood! I don't want to say any more; I've given away too much already. For those who want a wonderfully weird, HILARIOUSLY funny, bizarre, smart movie that disturbs you repeatedly but leaves you cheering in the end, I STRONGLY recommend ""Fight Club""!

I'm not suprised that women haven't liked this movie very much, and I've concluded it is generally a movie for guys. It focuses on a turning point all men face, the transistion from early twenties to adulthood. In our culture, we often neglect questions of identity, and we typically indulge in consumerism as Ed Norton's character does in the beginning. Then comes along Tyler Dirden (Brad Pitt) who challenges Norton's life. Implicit in this is a string of doubts: I was a boy, then a teen, then young, now a man, and that means? where did that go? why did it go? It is like a midlife crisis 10 or 15 years too soon. This movie tries to reinforce that it is better to establish identity than to worry about other people's perceptions. Indeed, the characters go overboard on this, but I doubt most people will go that far. If people just look behind characters' motives and try to see the lingering doubts, the movie becomes far more intelligible and less of a macho bash.	5.0	more than meets the eye	2001-09-19	2	0	2

It was a wonderfully complex vision of the inside of aman's mind. After finishing it, I felt that the movies could never capture the feelings that the book created. I was very wrong. This is one of the few movies that is on par or better that the book version. Others in this catagory include: The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the Green Mile.One of my favorite things about this DVD is the booklet that comes with it which contains reviews of the movie. Some of them are so terrible by people to frightened by the surface to dive in an really explore the meaning of this movie.&quot;You are not your name. You are not how much money you have in your bank account. You are not your khakis. We are the all singing all dancing... of the world.&quot; A message from Tyler.One of my personal favorite touches in this movie is Tylers brief appearences in the movie in the ealy scenes. Tyler has many jobs in this movie, and among them a film projector runner. Fight Club shows his guerilla influence thoughout. Such as his image appearing for a few frames in the scene and vanishing.Normally I hate Brad Pitt, but his performance as Tyler is perfect. Ed Norton really shows off his acting skills as well, in an tragically ingored film. Well, folks, now is your chance to endorse the dying genre of the Great Film. We may not see the like of such a great movie for years to come. Remember, you need to die before you can be reborn.  END	5.0	A Modern Misunderstood Masterpiece	2000-06-16	0	0	0

For example:  &quot;this movie discriminates twords women&quot; or &quot;it  glorifies violence.&quot;  First of all, it does neither.  It is a daring  and fun ride through the the human mind.  It is a psychological and daring  thriller that says a LOT about our society and doesn't blind us from the  truth.  Another good thing about this film is that it doesn't censor  itself, it says what it wants and it's not scared to.  It's a mind trip  that is hard to look away from once you're watching, it's like a drug.  It  is also one of those movies that puts you in it's world and doesn't let you  out until the ending credits.  Not to mention that there are some very  amusing parts to this movie that will have you nervously laughing.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A22PV91A5CNOGO	"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY"""	"About half way through David Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" I found myself remembering one of Barney Fife's lines from ""The Andy Griffith Show."" 'Here at The Rock we have two rules. Rule Number One: Obey all the rules.' It is highly unlikely that the director had any desire to remind viewers of this ancient comedic moment, but there's no denying that odd flashes of humor crop up here and there throughout the film. ""Fight Club"" has been described by detractors as overly slick and heavily macho, but its fans find it clever and visually stunning, with moments of real brilliance. I think the fans have got it right: there are some moments of brilliance, and if you can deal with the explicit violence the movie is beautiful to watch.The unnamed protagonist (excellent work by Edward Norton) is a sad sack white collar worker suffering from insomnia and drifting aimlessly through the more or less soulless environment of contemporary urban America. In an effort to feel connected to something--anything--he becomes a support-group addict, religiously attending self-help meetings for alcoholics, cancer patients, etc., etc. When his apartment, with all of his carefully collected worldly goods, literally explodes, he finds refuge with a chance acquaintance, the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt in a rivetting performance). It is with Tyler that Norton's character finds a new, seemingly meaningful way to feel ""connected"": the two men fight. And fight and fight. It makes them feel ""up,"" it makes them feel real. Other men, most of them oddball or dysfunctional individuals alienated from society, join their fight club. The narrator is torn between his better instincts and the attraction of Tyler's way of life and nihilistic philosophy. As Tyler's persona becomes more and more disturbing--he has also seduced the only woman for whom the protagonist has any real feeling (well played by Helena Bonham Carter)--it becomes apparent that he, and the greatly expanded, nation-wide Fight Club, must be stopped. But how? And who, exactly, IS Tyler Durden?The decaying interiors and dark exterior shots that abound in ""Fight Club"" are wonderfully filmed in a manner slightly reminiscent of ""Blade Runner,"" and the truly fine acting by Norton and Pitt sends out sparks. Even during scenes that are in no way believable (I can't explain or I'll give away the ending), Norton effectively conveys the impression of a confused and frustrated Everyman. Pitt is dark and charismatic, and yes, he looks great, even in Tyler's hideous bathrobe and other unappealing garments.This film is not for the weak of stomach, and the conclusion may be disturbing for those who were in New York for 9/11, but it's a genuinely interesting creation. It may not be as deep and thought provoking as its most avid fans proclaim, but it is a fine piece of work, definitely worth at least one viewing."	4.0	Clever...fascinating...I may never buy designer soap again.	2004-08-31	4	4	0

For those who have only seen this movie once or twice, some of you might have missed a couple of brilliant moments in the movie:(1) Brad Pitt or some brief half-second collages of him appear in a few scenes before he makes his proper entrance in the movie (the plane scene with Norton).  Think of the storyline, and you'd understand that's done for a very good reason.  Ingenious.(2) The very last second before the movie ends.

But if you are a single male between the  ages of 20 and 30, then this film is likely to strike a chord deep within  you as it brings to light many of the tacit frustrations we've silently yet  universally been suffering under:  the unreasonable lifestyle requirements  imposed upon us by our materialistic culture, the lack of direction or  definition for men in this modern age, etc.  This movie shows how one group  of men chose to cope with these issues, but the movie never claims that  their way was the only way or even a good way to cope.  This film does not  glorify violence like many of its critics claim.  This movie is simply  honest about violence. This show is an oasis of thought provoking substance  in an otherwise disappointing era of mindless movie waiste.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	"First impressions count, they last, and I think they explain the overwhelmingly positive reactions of the Amazon readership to this film. The first hour of Fight Club is truly, exquisitely, brilliant: patiently (if acidly) observed, witty and deadpan, and the punches it lands - good, solid punches - are of the purely figurative kind. The first hour is nothing like what I was expecting (well, there's no fighting, for a start), so much so that I had to check I actually had the right film. But it was so good, so clever, and so funny that I really didn't mind whether I did or not.So, on the strength of that, sans doubte, five stars: Norton is beautifully understated as the nameless narrator, Helena Bonham-Carter reveals the burned out sex-kitten side of herself that previously I could only fantasise existed, and Brad Pitt, always arch and aware, is as charismatic and magnetic as anyone I've seen on screen. Because he's so cool you tend to overlook the fact that he's an extraordinary actor as well.But doubts began creeping into my mind the minute the first punch was thrown. They took a while to solidify - the game could have gone any one of a number of ways; the violence stayed intermittent and along with the punches there were some interesting (if, er, heavy handed) consumerism vs. individualism arguments getting thrown about, and there seemed to be a Brad Pitt as Jesus thread gathering pace, but suddenly everything went terribly wrong, the narrative ceased making any sense, and this clever, articulate and stylish film devolved into an ultra-violent, but otherwise pretty run-of-the-mill high-octane action movie.What happened? Well, put some of it down to Curse Of The Twist. This is a phenomenon which really only started in earnest with the Crying Game, where the twist made the film; was followed (cleverly) by the Sixth Sense and (laboriously) by the Usual Suspects, and now seems to be obligatory way of finishing off a film where what seemed a great idea when it started turned out not to be (see for example the Shawshank Redemption, Signs, and A Beautiful Mind). Problem here is that the twist completely undoes all the good work done in the first hour of the film. A picture that was making some clever points in a pretty palatable way all of a sudden just doesn't any more. And all of a sudden there are lots of guns and lots of punching. Great.And I'm not sure the twist even works (I'd have to watch it again, and to be honest I can't be bothered): the point of a twist is to give you a set of facts and imply that they should be interpreted in a certain way, and then to reveal the critical piece of information which reveals that everything must actually be viewed another way. I have a sense that some of the facts from the first half don't square with the revised scenario.This was all immensely disappointing, because this could have been a great film - I still think the first 60 minutes is a great film, but I guess if they had stopped there then, on account of the lack of fighting, they couldn't have called it ""Fight Club"".Olly Buxton"	3.0	Ruined by a bout of Twister	2002-12-26	4	1	3

Most people know what this movie is so I'm not going to tell the plot of Fight Club. However, I like the movie enough that I bought it on blu-ray.I think that the story is interesting and demands more than one viewing. It's really interesting how you view Fight Club the first time and then how you view it on repeat. It almost feels like you're watching a different movie. The acting is great and believable. I will say that this movie isn't for the faint of heart. There isn't alot of fighting for a movie called Fight Club, but that's because this movie isn't about fighting. When there is fighting it's very brutal. There is plenty of other violence in this film that is very graphic.Moving on to the blu-ray. The packaging is pretty cool looking but it's an eco-case. If you don't know what an eco-case is it's the new re-cycled cases they've been using on blu-rays. The paper is very thin and feels like you could break it if you dropped it. Other than that it's great. The movie looks very good for a movie that was released in 1999. There is a thin layer of grain throughout the movie but it's hardly noticeable and sort of suits the movie. Everything is pretty well crisp looking and is a definite step up from the dvd edition. Where this blu-ray really succeeds though is with the sound quality. The bass in your speakers will vibrate the walls each time someone is punched. The sound quality also suits the atmosphere and tone of the film and voices sound very clear. Also, the ""plane scene"" sounds incredible.I rate this movie an 8/10 but I rate this blu-ray a 5/5.

Being a downshifter, living in and dealing with the consumerist system but not being of it, the many 'selves' we have (and projection of the shadow side) in a fickle-minded society going on as if they will live forever, and dying never having lived. In addition to this is the need for male initiation where fathers are deadbeats or absent outsiders, and knowing who and what you are as a self-sufficient and self-reliant individual distinct from the herd mindset - qualities which cannot be touched, bought or sold, or change on a whim (certainly not from any external influence).In his saying,""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world,"" I realize the lesson here in existentialism is not about finding some ultimately materialistic (and temporary) idea of happiness, but about finding and creating meaning to one's life.

The members of fight club turn into a gang and vandalize the neighborhood. Quickly after that, the fight club has members all over the country and has turned into more of an army. The army's goal is to blow up the buildings of the major credit card companies. The cops don't care because they are part of this terrorist organization.

I think Brad Pitt is a great actor but this had to be one of the worst movies in his career in my opinion.	1.0	Can't figure this movie out...	2009-04-08	57	5	52

And then you should read some more books, likeRabid: A Novel,Tree of Smoke: A Novel, andSurvivor.The movie is good. Brad Pitt as Twitchy Tyler is superbly cast, though I always pictured Tyler as black. The movie, however, has a different end than the book, and it's a big difference.The book's end is about taking power back for yourself. The movie's end is about losing power over your obsessions. This is large difference. The book is way better, and if you see the movie, you should read the book twice so you understand where Chuck is coming from.	5.0	The second rule of Fight Club	2006-08-27	6	5	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2XR54R8DUGDUW	Patrick Prevenas	Leave it to the &quot;family groups&quot; in this country, who can't take responsibility for raising their own kids, to file so many loud and  thoughtless objections against this incredible movie.  &quot;Fight  Club&quot; is one of the most original and ingeniously written, directed,  and acted films that has come along in a very, very long time, and its  ultimate message about society is far more intelligent and responsible than  the critics and censors even tried to give it credit for, but would have if  they'd just *paid attention to it*!  The initial story of Jack and Tyler  is utterly hilarious in its shocking tastelessness; we laugh at its plot  twists in the same sense that we laugh at the inspired rudeness of  &quot;South Park.&quot;  The violence is not so frequent OR graphic as I'd  been led to believe, because David Fincher's incredible directing makes the  violent moments both very funny at times, and at others, more disturbing  than a lot of blood and guts ever could.  You will find yourself, by turns,  both amused and horrified at the ideas and images presented in this  provocative film, and you WILL remain constantly engaged.  The  &quot;surprise ending&quot; definitely warrants at LEAST a second viewing,  but I don't feel that it holds the whole story together as sensibly as it  should... though it does do a pretty understandable and consistent job  around 95% of the time.  It's hard to fully describe and analyze  &quot;Fight Club&quot; without writing a veritable 10-page paper, but all I  can say to the easily offended is, just grow up and enter this movie with  an open mind... you'll be surprised at how interesting and responsible it  ultimately is.  The world should be glad for a director like Fincher, who  can handle material like this both intelligently and fearlessly.  The  performances of Norton, Pitt, and Carter are absolutely first-rate, and  their dialogue is utterly brilliant.  There is nothing to complain about  over this movie; instead, there should be celebration of its originality,  reverence for the talent that created it, and respect for the dangerous  ideas that it isn't afraid to confront.  Whether you love it or hate it,  there's no denying that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those very few  films that you simply must see, even if only to see what all the fuss is  about!	5.0	Absolutely awesome	2000-09-20	10	8	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3E1AMYRYSMHSF	Paul D. B. Wharton	...An outrageous claim, i know, but this is one outrageous movie. Cast away any notions that this is a gratuitously violent film - as many reviews will have you believe - and ponder on the fact that this is perhaps as much about fighting as 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is about motorcycle maintenance.  Yes, there are some rather graphic scenes of fists and blood, but this is merely one part of the complex story that makes up this sensational bit of cinema. Without going into too much detail: Ed Norton [brilliant] is having serious trouble sleeping, and this is the basis for all the mayhem that ensues.  This film ought to have you utterly absorbed by the orderly chaos that is Norton's life, which - with a generous dosing of laughter, shock, violence, and stabs at society - builds up to a mind-blowing climax. And that is the best part. The ending. Whereas with '6th Sense' the twist destroys the entire movie, here the climax is truly that. Up until the end this film is excellent. And then it becomes brilliant. Outstanding.  Watch this film the first time, and find yourself dazed, as if from a heavy right hook. Watch it a second time to check for flaws. And i think you will find there are none.This DVD also contains various commentaries that make the whole experience even better.  You cannot purchase a more worthwhile DVD.	5.0	Quite possibly the best film ever made....	2000-10-08	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AWFPO0SDMD4QR	Paul	If any DVD was produced on the same level as the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition and the Toy Story 3-Disc box set, it is this DVD.  Fight Club is not only a VERY well produced DVD, but the supplemental material will keep you busy for LITERALLY hours.  You will finally have a reason to 'break in' that angle button on your remote.  As a story, Fight Club takes a more cerebral approach to ones thought processes.  Containing many cool effects, Fight Club may make the average movie viewer pop a few Excedrins while trying to figure out the point of the film.  While many may finish the movie in total confusion, mostly everyone will agree that Fight Club is a unique movie experience.  When I received the DVD package, I was instantly impressed with the graphic design of the outer package, the discs themselves and the booklet that is included.  Initially, this DVD comes off as a &quot;special edition&quot; rather then a simple &quot;movie release on DVD&quot;.  Whoever created the graphics on the cover and throughout the booklet has a very active imagination.  Disc one has the film, disc two has the supplemental material.  ** Pause the third FBI WARNING at the beginning of the disc....it is quite funny**  Disc one offers you your usual &quot;chapters&quot; choices with 'moving' scenes (like The Matrix), audio setup for Dolby surround for both a 2 speaker setups and 5.1 setups in English and Spanish.  This is also a THX certified DVD, so it includes a THX setup screen.  Disc one also gives you the choice of several audio commentaries to listen to throughout the film, including David Fincher, Bradd Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, the novelist and the screenwriter, the Director of Photography, Visual Effects Supervisor and a couple of others.  In a nutshell, you have a choice to listen to A LOT of people, a great addition to this DVD.  Picture quality of Fight Club was incredible.  Overall, the picture is moody and dark with beautiful blacks and wonderful color detail.  It is beautifully photographed with incredible shadow detail and crystal clear highlights.  Sound quality was equally impressive.  Being THX certified, you can expect nothing less then awesome.  Edward Nortons voice-over sounds very live, as though he's sitting right in front of you.  The sound has beautiful detail, with stereo separation being impressively realistic and the music and dialogue recorded incredibly well.  Surround detail is amazing with some scenes having deep bass that will make the neighbors call the cops.  Disc two will stay in your DVD player for a long time.  The supplemental material includes crew and cast information. behind the scenes of the production, the visual effects and on-location footage  with commentaires and multiple angles.......WOW!  Disc two also contains seven deleted scenes as well as trailers, TV spots, music videos, an interview with Edward Norton and a bunch of storyboards, visual effects stills, paintings and many other additions to keep your fingers happy on that remote.  The Producers of this DVD should be applauded....not only is the picture and sound quality top-notch, but the graphical elements and the supplemental materials included are fantastic and incredibly entertaining.  I highly recommend this DVD for those who enjoyed this movie in the theatre, who are curious about the film, or those simply interested in seeing what a superb DVD release is all about.  Enjoy!	5.0	Fight Club-another reason to own a DVD player.	2000-10-26	16	13	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AMEGKY9E7DJMT	Paul	What can I say that hasn't been said except that for the 10 year anniversary it is awesome to see a movie that holds up. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do such an awesome job of bringing this story to life, and the chaotic message that underscores this movie is just as important today as it was when the movie came out.I always feel like a bit of a sucker when I buy DVD's or Blue-Rays now, because I am a Netflix member and there's digital content available (through legal channels!) but this is one movie I am glad I have a hard copy of. I remember leaving the theater when it came out and thinking - man, what have they done?10 years later, I feel the same way when I pop it in the PS3.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AD04C2V32YEUP	"Paul Hiebing ""engineer nerd"""	&quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those rare movies that appears only when the right combination of forces behind it give everything they've got to the cause. It takes a gutsy director, a clever screenwriter, a brilliant  cast, and one hell of a production crew to get a film of this power and  importance made and made well. It's about a desperate disenfranchised man  who unconsciously desires a way out of the life he is in now. He craves  something other than his condo life, his (mentally and spiritually) numbing  work, and his lack of love.  Because of this, we are strapped into a  dizzying ride through the pristine psuedo-secure modern world and the dark,  grimy and often disturbing land of &quot;hunter/gatherer&quot; human  nature. But &quot;Fight Club&quot; is also about every one of us - it makes  us examine our pathetic lives and forces us to look closely at the choices  we have made and reminds us that it isn't too late to change our paths in  life while at the same time warning us to watch our step and not fall into  mindlessness. This has to be one of the best most underrated movies ever  made. Every detail in it has been scrutinized, every motion done naturally  deliberate.  It is funny, it is frightening, and if this movie doesn't make  you think about your life, then you are one of those most in need of a  Tyler Durden.	5.0	I am Jack's overworked adrenal gland.	2000-07-20	9	7	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2FT22FKKY7VRK	Paul M. Gunther	I'll get this out of the way early: I've never read the book.I'm also not going to give you my opinion of the film. Oh- who am I kidding? I like the film. But that's irrelevant. I'm here to talk about the disc. The DVD.  The candy.In my opinion, this is the single finest disc produced to  date. This is the disc you buy to play for your friends to make them run  out and buy their own DVD players. Not only is the transfer perfect, not  only is the sound incredible, but it also has an amazing array of extra  features ranging from alternate takes and deleted scenes, to behind the  scenes peeks at the filming of individual sequences. And it is the  presentations of these that really make it stand out above the crowd.For  instance, when you watch the alternate version of a confrontation between  Norton and his boss, you not only see the alternate version, but also get  to view the version in the film immediately afterwards, to place it into  context. And, if you like, you can listen to an optional commentary  explaining the context of the scene, why it was changed, and what they were  trying to accomplish. There are also just plain deleted scenes, in which  you get to see it book-ended by the scenes between which it was originally  sandwiched, again with the optional commentary explaining why it was cut.  And there are several of these scenes.You can also watch the creation of  many effects sequences, following them from the drawing board to execution,  with alternate video and audio combinations: for instance, you can watch  the creation of the plane crash, with one of two video options, or watch  them split screen, with one of two audio options, or you can watch it in  any combination you like simply by pressing the &quot;audio&quot; and  &quot;angle&quot; buttons on your remote.You can also watch the filming  of different scenes, with different audio options, as well as the video  option of watching director David Fincher scouting the scenes and  explaining to his crew what is going to be going on, or, again, watch it  all split screen if you choose, with different audio  combinations.There's more. There's lots more. But do I need to still go  on? Have you not already clicked the &quot;buy&quot; button? What are you  waiting for?	5.0	Great movie, phenomenal disc	2000-07-06	12	9	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2UMV7XVHQDZ13	"paul tahan ""sno dome"""	This movie is brilliant.  You are first introduced to a Mr. Narrator (Edward Norton), who is living his job, suffering insomnia, and crazed about IKEA furniture.After becoming conscious of this constrictive lifestyle he constantly questions himself.  This questioning reaches out to many philosophical concepts, and alludes to many questionably sane people.  Finally, after curing his insomnia with group therapy for conditions which he himself has none of, he meets Helena Bonham Carter, a fellow group therapy faker.  Her role is that of a chain smoking suicidal sex crazed lunatic, it is at this point that Norton's character reaches the boundaries of his subconscious.What follows is the battle between Edward Norton and his subconscious, with Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden along for the ride and bringing an organized method to this madness; Fight Club.  Fighting society, this group attempts to create a segue for the blue collar, white collar, run of the mill every day workers trapped in a routine lifestyle just like Edward Norton's character.  Growing to national proportions, Norton eventually finds himself overwhelmed, shocked and confused by some of the deeds the group has graduated into doing.The DVD version of this movie aesthetically perfect.  The transitions are second to none, everything is very clean.  The supplemental disc contains scenes that were, unbelievably so, too gruesome or questionable for the final cut.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it while your waiting for your order to arrive.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3CB0D0P117Q3Z	pcast99	I want to start out by saying Fight Club is one of my favorite movies and every time I watch it I cannot turn away or do anything else until it's finished as it is so captivating and ingenious. I read the book before I watched the movie and I did enjoy Chuck Palahniuk's novel but to me it wasn't a masterpiece. But then this movie comes along and it left me speechless.This movie deals with an unnamed narrator telling the events of his life, how he works for a crooked insurance agency and his boring dull life eats away at him to where he develops insomnia and begins buying things he doesn't really want or need. He later meets up with a man named Tyler Durden, who the two begin a friendship and begin causing all sorts of chaos.I will not give any else away to the plot in case you've yet to see the movie, but I will praise this movie.ALL of the actors in this movie, even the minor characters, were simply flawless. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton I feel were robbed of an Oscar as I think they both gave the best performances of their careers. And the writing was so crisp and engrossing you will lose track of time.Fight club is a movie that will challenge you're perceived outlook on life and society, so maybe it's not for everyone, but this is the most underrated movie ever and unquestionably David Fincher's, Brad Pitt's, and Edward Norton's best film to date.	5.0	A rare case of a movie being better than the book it's based upon	2012-09-06	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"I believe that movies are made to entertain. I basically enjoy all kinds of movies...action, comedy, romance, sci-fi, thrillers etc. and I rarely criticize a movie because I know the effort put in to make a movie. But every once in a while, a movie comes out that does more than entertain, it makes you think, it makes you question and it changes your perception about various things. Well, Fight Club is one of those movies. I have watched this movie many many many times and it never fails to astound me. This is in my opinion, one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.It is basically about this guy, only known as the Narrator who is a white collar employee, working a 9 to 5 job, has his own apartment and his own collection of branded items. Sounds familiar? It's not surprising many of us can relate to this guy. Anyhow, even with all these material items, he finds his life unsatisfying, he feels that something is lacking. Because of this problem, he suffers from insomnia. He finds solace in attending those self-help sessions but soon meets another faker, Marla. The presence of another faker makes him uncomfortable and the sessions don't work for him anymore. It is then that he meets Tyler Durden, this cool, smart talking dude in a plane. This guy intrigued him and when the Narrator returns to find his apartment burnt, he turns to Tyler for help. From there on, this movie spirals to dizzying heights, with the creation of Fight Club by the Narrator and Tyler, and later what seems to be a takeover of Fight Club by Tyler leaving the Narrator clueless about what's going on.I really have to say this movie really fascinated me so much with it's intelligent ideas and dialogue, partly because deep in my heart, on some level...I can relate to the character, and although I don't agree with everything that is said, it does make me think and how many movies can do that? Fight Club to me, represents our lives in a twisted way. It challenges us to think about things in life, for example our view of success. Does working a boring job to pay for things we don't need a success? Do you experience fulfillment or do you think you're wasting your life away? (...)Everybody involved in this movie did a fantastic job but extra credit has to go to the director, writer and the actors. David Fincher has come a long way from directing music videos for Madonna. I am a huge fan and I've seen all his work, Aliens 3, Se7en, The Game and more recently Panic Room. No one but him can create an environment of decay and desperation in this movie that just grabs you. Kudos to the actors involved too. Everyone was perfectly cast. The talented Edward Norton was excellent in his role as the Narrator. He so accurately resembled the average guy that it was scary. His voice has a perfect tone for narrating the story and he reminds me of a young Kevin Spacey. If only he gets better roles, he may very well go down a legend in Hollywood. Brad Pitt has always acted in likeable hero roles as well as ""feel good"" movies and he has managed to pull it off but in many of those roles, there was nothing special or extraordinary. In this movie, he was fantastic. I consider this to be his finest work together with his role as Det. Mills in Se7en. No one but him could've pulled of Tyler Durden. When he spoke, it just didn't sound written, it sounds authentic, the words come alive...like he really lives his life that way and it's what he truly believes. Any other person might have made it less exciting but Pitt nails it. And last but not least Helena Bonham Carter as Marla was also a really good choice. She did not have much screen time, but the times she does appear..she delivers with a fine performance.There was a lot of bad publicity about this movie and although I admit this movie may not be for everyone, I loved it and so did most of my friends. I HIGHLY recommend this movie. This movie is not a renter, it's a keeper. It's movies like this that sets the bar higher for American cinema...seriously. And finally, as Tyler said ""It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything""."	5.0	I am Jack's feeling of awe...	2005-05-28	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1S2M6SA4OAUNK	Perry	Fight Club is the chaos created by one man with a dissociative personality disorder and it seriously shows the potential for Mental Illness to pervert the world as we know it.The acting was great, I never cared for Ed Norton before this movie but, I really like him as an actor now.  Brad Pitt was cool, reserved and in control or, as in control as the man who wasn't there could be.  Helena Bonham Carter was Marla in a reserved sense but, she still managed to pull it off well.  Meat Loaf Aday as Robert Paulson had a small role in the film but, it was well played and well used to support the story.The screen play was decent but, it lacked some details that helped you understand some things in the movie.For instance, the Mechanic had a larger role in the book than in this story and he helped to explain mind of Tyler Durden as well as being the man who would attempt cut off Ed Norton's Nuts (which wasn't in a police station by the way).  Also, Marla has a series of boyfriends with serious issues and she not only thought the whole split personality was cool but, actually helped Ed Norton stay awake so Tyler couldn't take over his body.  Another point is the fact that the main character realized he had multiple personalities a little more than halfway through the book as the two met in passing, and then he spent most of the rest of the book trying to undo the damage that Tyler had done.  And finally, they left out the fact that Tyler instructed them all to cut people's nuts off if they made any attempt to shutdown Fight Club in any way, and this lead to threats against police chiefs and a fridge full of frozen testicles from people attempting to stop the movement.Overall, they did do a really good job with the movie but, I still recommend you read the book as it builds upon the story and you will actually get a pretty good sense of how the story would really unfold.So, with that said, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you've been living under a rock for the past 13 years and really need to climb out from under there!	4.0	His Name is Robert Paulson!	2013-03-26	0	0	0

FX commentary on the special effects, 4 different commentaries of the film!!

Edward Norton, Jr. is one of the greatest actors today and does not disappoint with his performance in this movie.  Brad Pitt, Helena Carter and others perform excellent acting jobs in this memorable film.  A film that explores the &quot;doldrums&quot; of 24/7 consumer life; ignore the sometimes unrealistic fiction (ie numerous law-breaking acts with no police reaction, the Fight Club's contacts in every business in the city, etc.) and enjoy the film for the great piece of cinema it is.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30QPQC2FC79H0	Peter Whitney	OK first off, if you want a movie that's just fighting and violence then this is not for you.  But if you want a movie that's full of dark black humor and lines that will stay with us forever then you're in luck.  Edward Norton is at his finest playing an insomniac who goes to support groups as a means to fall asleep, and later ends up creating his own (Fight Club).  Along the way he runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt's best role since True Romance) and that's when the fun really starts.  I don't want to get to into it because that would ruin some great scenes but watch for a cameo by the lead singer of Live.  The commentary is great with Edward Norton and David Fincher (Brad is pretty witty himself) but I could do without Helena Bonham Carter's commentary.  She's too full of herself and I think that she had to do it seperatlly because the others hated her... that's what I think at least.  The internet promos are cool, the public service announcements are to die for, plus the Spanish adds are cool.  You can even see a few adds they geared towards women.  There is a nice video for the Dust Brothers video (watch it after the movie) and pictures of the promo catalog that they gave out to hype the film.  The booklet on how to start a fight is one of the few DVD booklets worth reading.  All and all this is why they made DVD players, for all the bonus material.  So much they made two discs.	5.0	breaking the first rule	2000-10-12	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1JPUGCPI9VHD	Philip B. Clark	Most of the &quot;Fight Club&quot; reviews posted here focus on the brilliance of the film and it's message. I, on the other hand, would like to focus on the challenges it provides to it's audience. Having been a fan of Stanley Kubrick for years, I must compliment David Fincher as being the only director working today with a similar passion for filmmaking. Films are a director's way of communicating an art form, and Fincher has managed to do that with each of his releases. &quot;Fight Club,&quot; &quot;Seven,&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot; are all in my top 10 films for that reason.As human beings we should have a thirst for challenges, and Fincher provides that to his audience with his cinematic creations.To truly love films we must be willing to suspend our belief systems and accept a difference of opinion. Fincher, like Kubrick, causes his viewers to do this. Like it or not, when you view a film by either of these geniuses, you have to admit that it has caused you to re-think aspects of your own life. Because of this, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is worthy of the highest rating.	5.0	David Fincher - The Next Kubrick	2000-06-07	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2M85X8L4258QR	"P. Holmes ""holmesnyc"""	Fight Club is such a literate, well-acted, visually impressive movie that you could easily miss the fact that it doesn't have a singe interesting thought in its head. It's central thesis is that men are being emasculated  by our consumer culture, losing touch with their nature -- which manifests  itself here and in Chuck Palahniuk's book through the desire to beat other  men senseless just for the heck of it.You wouldn't think this idea was  big enough to support a 20-page short story (it isn't) and so it's not  surprising that the film seems heavily padded with scenes that do nothing  to develop character or move the plot forward, but give Brad Pitt and Ed  Norton plenty of opportunity to flex their pecs.Still, Norton's as good  as ever -- he can take mediocre material and make it seem special -- and  Pitt is at his near-best, as he was in David Fincher's Seven. Watch for  Meat Loaf, by the way, in a surprising role.The movie is visually  stylish, and the fight scenes pack a punch, but ultimately the whole thing  is emptier than Fincher's previous work: Seven and the underrated Alien3.	3.0	Less there than meets the eye	2000-06-22	8	4	4

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1F4RN70FUQBTU	Pi	"I like many other reviewers here, did not see the movie based on professional critical reviews which characterized the film as just a violent gross out based on the ""underground boxing clubs"" founded by the main characters. I accidentally saw part of the movie on cable and am very glad I did.The fight clubs and any violence associated with them are very ancillary to the main story. The thought provoking story can be viewed many different ways, but one theme that keeps recurring is that of the cult of the fight clubs. The cult of personality that stems from the founders, the blind faith of the followers and how what starts out as essentially a good thing, as the originators find new lives removed from materialism, takes a dark twist and the death of a member is considered a sacrifice for the cause. It could be the tale of almost any religious journey as principles are sacrificed to fanaticism. Whether you choose to seek this or other allegorical interpretations of the film, it is enjoyable on many levels, not the least of which is the story of the Narrator and his descent into madness and redemption.The vehicle which propels the movie (the relationship between the Narrator and Tyler) will be the subject of some discussion as the vehicle that carried the movie ""Memento"" was and is. Can you suspend a little disbelief in order to fully enjoy this movie on repeated viewings? I can. Even knowing the major plot twist, I have enjoyed it many times since. It is a great film and further, stands as a great adaptation of the book. Even the author thought the adaptation added to original. I can even say for full disclosure, that I was not a fan of Brad Pitt or Helena Bonham Carter before this film but their performances in these roles are probably the best of their careers. They were really well cast and the feeling is that Director David Fincher really got them to bring the original characters alive on the screen. Ed Norton in his portrayal of the Narrator, is a perfect foil to Pitt's Tyler Durden.Please enjoy Fight Club. Rent it, own it, read it or some combination of the three.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3LG5FUVNV4PU4	Plastic Eggs	Oh man, oh man, talk about a film that doesn't deserve all the cult like respect it gets, then let's talk about Fight Club.Misunderstood by practically every mindless drone who, after watching it for the first time, went out and started their own clubs leading to severe, yet hilarious, injuries and other goings ons, what we have here is a violent nosedive by David Fincher who crafted a supreme piece of neo-noir called Seven.The philosophy of the film is not profound nor deep, nothing penned by the hand of Chuck Palahniuk is capable of this.  I know a guy, whom I respect, who likes Palahniuk but he KNOWS that he's simply literary junk food; not everyone is hopeless, I guess.Hey, guess what?  Even non-conformists conform to rules, and mob mentality is bad and stuff, because you have total freedom but at what cost and blah blah blah, hey, great, I don't care, tell it to the 250lb meathead.  Losing all hope is freedom; laughable, utterly laughable.NOT as laughable, though, as the lauding with pride of the negative comments made by critics in the 2 disc edition's pamphlet.Cute.	1.0	What do you get when you adapt a worthless novel?

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A291KA254QZ742	"""player31"""	Yes, that is a bold statement, and yes I've seen more of the so-called classics than say most people (Due to an exponential amount of free time), but this film is truely great. As compared to some other films, I quickly came to the realization that 'Hey...there's nothing else like this'. The characters are complex, and the plot is thick. Many, many, many, hidden details placed carefully throughout the movie that elude to the fact of the final outcome between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton (and not moronic clues, such as ones found in Scream as to who is the killer. Meanwhile, I've fallen asleep.)The Narrator(Norton) is kind of humorus in the fact ol' Chuck's idea while writing the book without and name for the main character was to make this possibly about anyone, any average Joe.The movie does an awsome job in staying with the book, sans a diefferent ending (which I personally liked the movie better, seeing as there was no hope of a sequel.) And a few missing details on how to blow up various things, which is a big suprise they left it out.Every actor is perfect, David Fincher is perfect, and the ideas behind it are...well...perfect. Escapism, split-personalities, survivalism, all tackled without being politically correct. It's not suprising that this movie turns a lot of people off. All great works are like that, controversial. The violence turned off some people, and many people wondered what in the heck this was in the theaters, when they thought this was going to maybe be like Bloodsport.Going over the details is pointless, this film must be seen.	5.0	"Quite simply put ""The Greatest Movie in the World"""	2002-01-20	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AX5DYX4L82DDG	"P. Murray ""Impavido"""	"One of my most favorite movies EVER!  This movie caught a lot of flak for its violence and some even declared it ""fascist"".  What a load of crap!  It's the most anti-fascist movie I can think of.  It shows you how people who are lost in this modern world (as many of us are) can be taken advantage of by a very charismatic person with an alterior motive.  The men who are attracted to the Fight Club are dulled by their mundane and de-masculinating modern lives, so the only way they can feel alive and like men is to beat the living crap out of eachother and commit boy-hood hijinx.  It becomes their support group, their way to make life bearable in our unbearably meaningless world.  Tyler Durden (Pitt) gives them meaning and the kind of macho comradery all men want, but he uses that to take advantage of them....to turn them into ""Space Monkeys"" (Watch the movie and it will all make perfect sense).I like David Finchers work as a director, this is his best movie.  His dark style compliments the dark humor and mood of Fight Club VERY well.  I don't think any other major director could have done a better job.  (Watch out for the subliminal Tyler's in the first 20 minutes of the film, it's great.  Way to go Mr. Fincher!)Brad Pitt IS Tyler Durden!  This movie made me come out of the closet as a Brad Pitt fan, he was just great in this movie.  Edward Norton was also well cast and did a great job, but Pitt made this movie shine.Fight Club has fantasticly twisted dark humor that takes shot after shot at our culture.  If you like dark humor like me, you will love every moment if this movie.  Oh, and by dark humor I mean finding a terminally ill woman begging for one last sexual encounter before she dies funny... You can't get darker than that folks.  If you are easily offended DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.  (And if you are easily offended may I recomend you only watch Disney films.)WARNING!: This is a total guy flik! Not many women will enjoy it!"	5.0	Have you ever met Tyler Durden?	2005-04-17	7	2	5
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A4QG6MAN84A4K	"""pocock"""	FIGHT CLUB arrived in the US with a blaze of publicity stressing its violence and nihilism; some critics (and those close to the production) countered this with the suggestion that it was an anti-materialist  jeremiad. On a second viewing, it seems like neither -- it's easier to see  it as a smart, committed and complex piece of filmmaking. David Fincher  once again dazzles with his direction, which is as intelligently energetic  as the acting of Brad Pitt and, especially, Edward Norton. What's really  impressive, however, is the way that the film manages to flirt with an  anti-materialist, hyper-masculine primitivism even as it suggests that  we're all a little too sophisticated to buy it (as it were).FIGHT CLUB  may hold that we're not the clothes we wear, or the credit cards in our  wallet, but it's savvy enough to realise that our paths of thought and  modes of organisation are almost entirely contaminated by the world we've  created. Is the solution to destroy that world? Well, that's an option --  but watch closely in the movie's second half and see how subtly and  hilariously Fincher undermines this: the anarchists begin to chant  management-speak, to dissolve into a collective identity, and to form  franchises as if they were selling frappucino rather than revolution.  Norton is especially horrified at all this, and his wonderful reactions to  the disintegration of 'Project Mayhem' are the calm (and moral) centre of  the film. Rather like ANIMAL FARM, Fincher tells us that we can have our  revolution, but it's going to cost us dear; perhaps even the individuality  and reason which we'd hoped to gain from our actions.	5.0	The year's best satire	2000-02-02	166	148	18

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AIRHRV3D8X4J1	"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina"""	I want to start off by saying if you are one of those people that faints at the sight of blood, or is deeply disturbed by a little violence than FIGHT CLUB is not for you! Now for the rest of you that can distinguish a movie from reality here is my review. FIGHT CLUB starts out a little slow by introducing you to the no name narrator and ticking-time bomb played by Edward Norton. On a plane ride he meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden played by BRAD PITT. The two meet on a plane ride and Tyler gives Edward Nortons character his card. After the Narrators (Edward Norton) apartment blows up he calles Tyler hinting around that he needs a place to stay so, Tyler than invites him to stay at his place. Eventually the two start a new form of therapy by getting out there aggression and starting a underground club called FIGHT CLUB. Everything seems to be going great untill Marla Singer (played by HELENA BONHAM CARTER) gets in the way and makes a bad situation even worse. FIGHT CLUB has little to do with fighting and more to do with the way EDWARD NORTON's charater can not come to terms with his multiple personalities. I don't want to give away the plot, but if I don't give it away many of you might not give this movie a fair chance, by making preconceived notions about the film before you even see it. EDWARD NORTON's charater and BRAD PITTS character are the SAME! Edward creates Tyler Durden who is someone he sees himself as, someone with confidence, someone who takes risks, and most importantly someone who is a leader and knows where he is going! This movie will surprise you with the clues it gives you during the whole movie, yet you never seem to come to terms with what is really going on untill the end when you discover that the two lead charaters are actually the same person. This movie is in the tradtion as such classics as THREE FACES OF EVE, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and SEVEN. This movie was over looked by so many, and being a huge BRAD PITT fan I truly believe he gave one of his BEST performances in this movie! Check it out it is a great flick and with the BONUS disc it offers 4 commentaries, 17 behind the scenes vignettes, Multiple Angles, theatrical previews and much more. I highly encourage any of you to BUY FIGHT CLUB!	5.0	FIGHT CLUB- Heres what this Great Movie is about!	2001-01-14	6	1	5

It is inovative and ya the underling issue has been used before but this one is diffrent. Mostly im a reader I have read 1984 and Zen and The Art of Motorcycle matinance. But what is diffrent is that they dont hide the meaning it comes out and tells you ""We have lost our root and must find them.""It is true that the dicision was split down the middle with reveiwers and most did not get it. The movie was revolutionary hell i liked it better than the matrix. The thing is that it is really gritty but most good movies of the 90s were like the Tarintino films. But what made its so interesting was the camera work in three frames they sliced in Brad Pitt. I dont no why but they did and of course the last frame of film they put in something interesting if your curious check it out. So all i can say is that there is no one reason why this film is good it is just the acumulation of it. If you want to see a weird film rent it or buy it."	5.0	Weird film	2005-04-06	2	0	2

When you buy the collector's edition, you make a commitment and understanding that the film is already good and you know you want to watch it and the the only truly debatable issue is the packagingSo, judging of movie content aside, let's review the product- as a collector's edition item- and not the film itself.There is only one reason why I would suggest against buying this product:1. The packaging sucks when compared to the former collector's edition releases becausea) the glossy finish falls flat when you realize that the original effect is supposed to be brown paper wrapping. Way back on the first collector's edition release and up till this recent one, Fox made the packaging matte so that it actually had that gritty feel of paper.b) this glossy finish is also on the inside insert which just makes the entire thing look cheapc) the spine design is crap compared to the original releases.Now why SHOULD you buy this product?1. The extra materials included (though not exactly the wealth one would expect) are worth the watch2. For a collector's edition DVD, the tag was pretty cheap so I gobbled it up.The movie, without a doubt is definitely worth what you pay for but the packaging was a downer.

Fight Club asks the life questions that every consumer in the USA should be asking of themselves. It grabs our values by the throat and demands that they answer for themselves.  Beautifully photographed, the movie is dark and disturbing in hopes that you will not lose the point.  It admonishes but never preaches. It challenges without giving the answers. Fight club is about soap, and one man's search for meaning. It's about loyalty, leadership, and the mentality of the pack.

In this brilliant film, a collection of low class losers become so powerful, they in literally bring cooperate America down to it's knees.  Fight club is a witty, humorous inventive film that captivates the mind, as well as the freedom that total release brings, along with slow deterioration and pointlessness an aimless life will bring.Brad Pitt delivers a comical and raw role as a free spirit intent on exposing the true horror and misdirection this material world brings.  He loves to move place to place, and to mutilate the body, to invoke a state of complete freedom and valance.  He despises the `things' such as jewelry, entertainment devices, and the economics of the current first world countries.  He in fact shows the true irony and stupidity of the wealthy when he sells rich overweight woman their own fat back to them in the form of expensive deodorant soap.Edward Norton plays the middle class hard working man, doing duty cover-ups for a deceptive car company.  When he tries to find meaning in a variety of support groups, which in turn make him feel the pain of others to mask his own empty life.  Then he finds another woman has the same idea, and that is when he begins to lose his new found solution.  After a series of business trips, he finds a witty friend and finds that he is his new best friend.After at a traumatic event, he realizes that fighting is a strangely releasing thing, and that he loses all of his fear and doubt about the future.  As the fight club grows, Edward finds that he is no longer holding such a close on his friend, as Brad begins to have an affair with his old suicidal friend. Eventually, the group spirals out of control, as does Pitt, when death exposes the group for the dangerous cult it is.It is then when Pitt disappear and seemingly starts more destructive groups in other cities when Edward Norton finds out that the battle against this insanity literally lays within his own mind.Though I did not like the twist in this movie, the ending was still satisfying, though while I was blown away by the nerve, wit, and humor during 80% of the movie.  The dialoge was absolutely intelligent and witty. This movie is absolutely excellent, a psychological masterpiece, and a joy for any movie lover.	4.0	A Delectable Serving of Cellulite	2004-04-17	0	0	0

Still, I'd say they have done a very, very good job. Some dialogs are directly from the novel, verbatim. And most descriptions in the book truly come alive in the movie.Brad, Ed and Helena have all done a very terrific job at their roles, and I must commend the casting director - I don't think any other Hollywood actors would have fit these respective roles better.If you haven't seen the movie ever, go get it and watch it.

Also, contrary to amazon's listing, this is NOT a DTS sound edition - it offers 5.1 dolby and below only.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2B8G7W3JXKMZA	"Randolph Bradley ""RBJ"""	"Don't forget to suspend disbelief.  This film is about a thinking, feeling, individual's quest for self-fulfillment.  Face it: Not everyone wants CK suits and a BMW.  However, everyone wants a sense of purpose.  Fight Club uses primordial, violent, almost sickening imagery to convey the struggle one may go through to sort through society's standards in quest of inner peace, freedom, and individuality in an increasingly materialistic world.  In the modern world, traditional values such as love, honor, devotion, patriotism, even faith are being subverted by slick marketing of desire attachments (BMW?) by international corporations.  Who says work your butt off to protect American values?  No: You work your butt off to get more things.  This film does not solve anything; it just makes you think.  And you'll think about guy things.  The masculine, logical mind has a tremendous burden in each generation.  Thus, people seeking a romantic movie are appalled, and people seeking an adventure are pleased.  The controversial ending resolved one man's life's purpose; his inner struggle was successful.  In a sense, he destroyed his ""evil twin,"" who distracted from psychological balance.  Fight Club grew on me, and I now rank it as collectible."	5.0	To Psychological Balance	2001-05-15	12	9	3

I didn't remember Tyler Durden's cameo in this movie, but what happens next is even stranger; after about 20 seconds of displaying the Drew Barrymore title and options, it pixelates and fades away into the common Fight Club top menu loop (with IKEA furniture galore) I expected to see.Sometimes the movie plays sound; sometimes it doesn't.  It's just clearly a poorly dubbed version that shows how terribly unreliable Black Friday Blu-ray deals at Amazon are.  I probably won't avoid these deals because they're so darn good, but I'll definitely make sure I open the shrink wrap on them and test them before the return deadline.

Wasted, gray lives, that's what its like in Socialist countries. So what do these fighting young men do to combat Corporate Fascism, they kill and destroy like Nazi's. Clear thinking there, hey!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3CNP5NKE8O2Z	Ravi S. Madapati	"FightClub (FC) isn't a movie. It's a superbly well-portrayed philosophy. A culmination of the all the events that led to the excesses of capitalism, this movie smashes them all, in their face. It is impossible for someone who has never seen this movie to read a review and decide on buying the DVD. You just have to see the movie, in case you missed it, you just have to buy the DVD. Well, let me just start by quoting a line from this masterpiece, ""How much do you know about yourself, when you've never been in a fight?"". How much can you base your joy upon someone else's deeds (reviews) when you never saw the movie yourself?FC is the Taxi Driver of the 2000s. It portrays all the decadence from the evils of excess materialism. Unfortunately, capitalism is a cause for this excess. Not to say its an evil in itself but as Thorstein Veblen pointed out many decades ago, the greatest enemy of capitalism is not communism or the trade unions, it is the heartless, money-spinning, corporations. Galbraith pointed out in the fifties that companies change consumer preferences through advertising. Tyler Durder in FC says ""You are not your khakis"". This movie is as much about understanding economics as it is about entertainment. Dont define yourself by the CK name on your sleeve, or the Ralph Lauren, who is getting free advertising when ever you show his name off your clothes. every young man can associte the IKEA nesting habbit shown in the movie. its sadly true about new galaxies being named after super corporations because they are taking over our lives. Demand seems to have stopped driving supply, its supply that is driving demand. I am sure this movie would make J B Say quite happy for that point. And its true, ever wondered why people who buy a $ 100,000 machine say they bought it for ""Engineering""? I am sure these guys dont understand how their airconditioners work forget the car.The dialogues in the movie make the movie worth watchin many times over. ""Sooner or later, the things you own, end up owning you"", ""I found freedon, losing all hope was freedom"". well there are so many lines like that in the movie, you would want to get the screenplay.The casting is just perfect. the actors never give you the impression that they are acting, which is how it shhould be. Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham deliver the performance of their lives. A feature film cannot get better than this. David Fincher is not only detailed at the micro level (the opening credits of human brain anatomy or the scene were Ed Nortons flats gets filled with furniture) also at the macro level (Ed Norton realizing that he is Tyler Durden and the way script progresses from Project Mayhem to the end). What a movie! Fincher is one of the best directors of Hollywood.Well, credit goes to Jim Ulhs for the awesome screenplay and Chuck Palahniuk for writing the great book with the same name. This movie rules! Fincher, Ulhs and Palahniuk gave us something that we could cherish till we die. the ending is poetic, with a mind-blowing song from The Pixies enthralling you while saying "" Where is my mind"", so apt!!!Watch it, watch it again and agiin, you will never be the same. this movie is a beatiful mix of philosophy, economics, psychology, all set in high-powered fightclub atmosphere. This movie brings great joy and great pain at teh same time (that awesome feeling). well, let me finish with a line from the movie "" Its only after you lost everything, you are free to do anything""...."	5.0	Greatest Movie Ever Filmed!!!	2003-07-04	2	1	1

This film is an artistic achievement for David  Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bodham Carter, Chuck Palahniuk,  the Dust Brothers, and all others involved. It scratches at the soft  underbelly of status quo in so many ways. The basic plot of a mentally  imbalanced man searching for what he wants in life helps extrapolate the  myriad themes present. It shows how all the operations to run the  civilization men built are controlled by women. The basic instinct of man  is useless in this society. Tyler's vision of laying venicen on the streets  of &quot;some abandoned superhighway&quot; show the desire to recreate that  purpose. This does not describe the ingenuity of the themes involved, but  1000 words could hardly come satisfactorily close.  Additionally, I am  not surprised that many of our esteemed film reviewers have brushed this  film off as an ultra-violent, underdeveloped, and weak attempt to explain a  story. This can be partially explained by these reviewers apparent biases.  They are people of another generation, and the ability to grasp ideas  contrary to entrenched ideas is disturbing. Something as new as Fincher's  adaption of Fight Club is too strange to be taken seriously. Also, one  completely intriguing aspect of this film that many dislike is its absence  of complete closure. This is also disturbing to some. I notice that people  often enjoy a movie better when they are dictated what they are supposed to  take from the movies message and what they are supposed to understand  happens. I will not tell you the end of the movie, but it does not wrap a  story ending in a big red bow for the viewers to unwrap and feel content.  It leaves thoughts and ideas to be sorted out and independent conclusions  to be drawn. To do this well is to create art. The Chuck Palahniuk, and the  cast and crew that made Fight Club a movie did this well.	5.0	A Classic for a Younger Generation	2000-06-13	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2A5IOAP5QCK5P	"""reel07"""	David Fincher's &quot;Fight Club&quot; starts out as a satire on modern society, claiming how programmed and materialistic the world has become. Edward Norton stars as a white-collared worker, who's an insomniac and  feels is trapped in his dead-end job. Then one day, he meets Tyler Durden  (Brad Pitt) on the airplane supposedly as a &quot;single-serving  friend&quot;. He then talks to him, learns about where he's coming from,  then finds out that he is a mysterious fellow. He meets Tyler again and is  taken into a dangerous underworld, or cult, called the Fight Club, and  soon, finds out that he is trapped and cannot escape.  As said before,  the film starts out as a satire against society today. As the whole idea of  the Fight Club flourishes in the story, the film becomes a profile of  violence and the horrific side of human anger. Finally, one more surprising  turn is taken, and the film turns into a tightly wound psychological  thriller. The film exceeds at all these levels, but not fully so. The fatal  flaw was the ending. Of all the current David Fincher films I've seen, they  are excellent, toy with your mind, but are completely diminished because of  the poor ending. I found the ending in this film to be laughably bad and  utterly stupid. &quot;Seven&quot; was a great film, but was ruined by the  ending, as was &quot;The Game&quot;. Another problem with the film was that  there was too much of the Helena Bonhamn Carter character, Marla. Many  scenes with her could have been trimmed, because her character dragged the  film a bit. but the flaws were overpowered by a strong script, strong  characterizations, great acting and photography, and many great moments.  The idea of the fight club is inventive and highly fascinating. Edward  Norton plays his character with energy and belief, and never lets down.  This really shines on Brad Pitt as one of his greatest, if not, his  greatest job of acting, as the multi-dimensional god-like Tyler Durden.  Though the film takes many turns, the message still remains this:  anti-Society, as seen through a group of lost souls, who never had any  direction in life to go, were spat on and rejected from society, and could  not fit into the world.	4.0	Fight Club	2000-06-09	3	2	1

It looked like &quot;The  Matrix&quot; meets &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, the former of which is  overrated and the latter is just plain lame. And what was up with that  stupid soap? But when I saw Fight Club for the first time, the soap became  an integral part of my daily life. I was blown away. Edward Norton is  absolutely unstoppable as the narrator, and Brad Pitt combines a certain  sexiness and bad-boy sensitivity to create Tyler. David Fincher has created  a masterpiece, and after Fight Club, you won't look at the world in the  same way. Previews can be decieving!

Acting was great, but the story line and theme is too abstract, making interpretation with shrugging shoulders.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A8PITW0ODMIJ0	Renee Elliott	GENIUS! .... if it were even remotely possibly to capture the artistic brilliance of this cinematic masterpiece in a word (as feeble an attempt it may be), it would have to be CLEVER. One can not even begin to describe this film without failing to do it well-deserved justice.  Unjustly promoted as a typical Hollywood sell-out action flick, starring Brad Pitt, I never had any intention of seeing Fight Club. The only potential element of redemption I foresaw in it at all, was my appreciation for Edward Norton's extraordinary talent. Fearful of losing respect for Norton as an actor, I braved the potential cinematic disappointment after receiving a positive review from a respected movie buff friend of mine. Skeptically, I entered the theatre, unaware of what would prove to be significantly different from what I was led to expect. What instead unfolded before me was a divine delivery of unusually witty dialogue, biting dark humor, exceptional acting (surprisingly, even from Brad Pitt), hilariously insightful narration, a remarkably original script, phenomenal directing, ingenious filming and inventive imagery, as well as a wonderfully complimentary soundtrack, collectively juxtaposed in rare harmonic perfection. Cleverly shocking, Fight Club unravels as a brilliant satire of modern civilization as well as a disturbing poke at the mundaneness of a consumerist existence. Iconoclastic in it's portrayal of our cultural conventions and values, the philosophy entertained in this movie challenges our most basic beliefs and assumptions about reality. The bland and insignificant Jack, personifies repression and dissatisfaction with existence, while the irreverant and radically anarchistic enigma, Tyler Durden, personifies reckless freedom and intensity of experience. These dangerous extremes, on both personal and social levels (capitalism vs. fascism), are shown in a critical light. The riveting and refreshingly unpredictable plot leave intelligent viewers both amazed and bewildered, intensely satisfied with the quality of cinema displayed. As for the author, Jack Palahniuk, how is that working out for you, being clever?	5.0	Cinematic Perfection!	2000-10-07	7	5	2

The film had an all-star cast of people like Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.STORY: Poor Jack has not been having a good life. He has had a busy year, he is an insomniac, he goes to several anonymous meetings just to keep himself busy. Every meeting he attends, a beautiful woman named Marla always follows him. She even attends the testicular cancer one (LMAO!). While on a flight home from a business trip, Jack meats a man named Tyler Durden. Tyler is a soap salesman, and after poor old Jack finds out his home has been blown up, he goes to live with Tyler in an old abandoned house. Soon, Jack and Tyler create their own club called ""Fight Club"", an underground club where people can hold fights. Soon, the project becomes controversial and turns into something called ""Project Mayhem"", a club planned by Tyler, where every night, each member causes destruction and chaos. It's only a matter of time before Jack becomes confused, and things spiral out of control!THOUGHTS: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this back in January, and I thought it was gonna be the same old fight movie, but it's not! I couldn't believe what I was missing. I didn't know how amazing it was going to be! Plus, there's a HUGE twist at the end, that will shock you like no other, and leave you breathless!DVD: The Steelbook edition is a must have. It is packed with special features.

I love the style of writing, the political satires, the dark imagery, the characters... everything. One of my favorite books to date. The film, to my delight, followed the novel very closely, and took many direct lines from it. There were a few slight changes for the sake of smooth story telling, and there's the fact that the movie has a completely different ending for the same reason. Overall, the movie is fantastic with amazing acting jobs and great imagery. The book is definately worth reading, and if you have yet to watch this film, I recommend picking up a copy of ""Fight Club"" the novel as well.

Griffiths ""bookchoice"""	Who do you identify with more - Jack, the insomniac office drone who hates his job, but can't escape, who loves IKEA furniture but hates himself for it, or the mysterious Tyler Durden, by day a soap salesman, but by night  someone much more subversive? This movie was billed as being about  fighting, but its really about the human soul and the box of  conventionality in which we keep it locked. Here's what Tyler Durden has to  say: 'We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We  have no great war, or great depression.  The great war is a spiritual war.  The great depression is our lives.' For Durden, consumerism and the  American dream is the enemy. The film asks whether there might not be a  crazy free spirit, an urban terrorist, an unabomber, in each of us, and if  there is, what we are going to do about it. If cancer sufferers can have  their own self-help groups, what about modern-life sufferers? What will  allow us to actually feel the pain of modern existence?	4.0	Tyler Durden, c'est moi!	2000-07-27	9	7	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2RY64L8YR96MM	"""rhino86oo"""	Well, first I can say, I am not a fan of Brad Pitt. I would of thought that he was a female draw, bringing nothing for the guys. For that reason, I did not see this at the theater, I could of but I did not. However, now that I viewed it on DVD, I have a new apprecation for the actor. He brought to this film, a street wise, who gives a damn attitude that made this film what it is. I can not say I am going to run out and see every film of his after seeing this, but just give apprecation. Edward Norton, well I have been a fan of his for a while. Supporting People vs. Larry Flynt, Keeping the Faith amoung others. So that was an even and great match to me.The film has so many twists and turns that it will keep your head spinning. I went in to this film, awaiting a hoorid movie, and came out thinking what a great job. The black humor sticks all throughout the film. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt make a club, a fight club were they can get their pent-up, oppressed anger out, the natural way, no drugs needed, maybe a beer and a smoke after words. If you do not understand the plot, it is as simple as that. Well not really, it actually more clogged and eroded than you can imagine.The DVD review...This DVD is packed, leaving anyone with a smile on their face. Two featurets and tons of &quot;spots&quot;.So, I am suggesting that you should view this film, even if you do not like the actors or what have you. It is 5 out of 5 and maybe to violent for some but, well...Hoped I helped you either way,R__Y__A__N___A__N__	5.0	Soap...Never use it again...	2000-11-18	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A140SCX7I5M56K	"""rhodessedohr"""	A movie hard to swallow by many movie-goers, even the best and the brightest adults I know cannot fully incorporate this movie into thier minds, understandable. I have been explicitly interest in movies for as long as i can remember, i am only sixteen years old and i saw this move about two years ago, i liked it when i first saw it because i recognized the excellent direction and outstanding acting from Norton, Pitt, an Carter, i was also interested in its dark style and excellent writing (so much i read the book right after seeing it) however after many viewings in the last year i have come to a more insightful appreciation of this movie and it has become one of my favorite movies.The very beggining of the movie is a honest sight on the flaws of modern corporate society. I have always had a removed feeling from society so this immediately spoke to me. it then progresses into a sight on male bonding and masculinity through violence. this is a part of the movie that many object to for its explicit scenes of men beating the CRAP out of each other. however most guys will jump all over this because it's &quot;cool&quot; regardless of it's meaning. it meaning is the raw testoserone power that some people have trouble controlling, this results in silly squabbles and spiralling toward unreasonable violence, so this violence presented in the movie appeals to men in a way mainly misunderstood by women, but is also presented in a sarcastic, dark-humored context. However its ability to give the men involved a strange type of solace with thier life also speaks clearly. As this man conflicted with different lifestyles begins to lose the life he knew he meetes a friend named &quot;Tyler Durden&quot; who has a simplistic male nihilistic view of the world that he present to the main character in a positive light.Now the movie moves into yet another stage that for most people seems to miss the point of the movie completely and is definitely the most difficult to understand, a psycological twist in the mind of the main charcter leaves him questioning everything that has happened to him in the past stage of his life. This at first glance seems to be a selling &quot;plot twist&quot; with no meaning but &quot;BOX OFFICE&quot;. however this allows a second viewing time to digest everything in an entirely different light not only in plot but in meaning as well. This puts the Modern Nihilistic view in a more balanced light. All in all this gives an objective view of nihilism and allows men to have a chooice in what kind of life they want to lead and how they want to control it.Now, what about women? This movie is pretty much intended for a male audience, however the character of Marla Singer show the role that women play in this aspect of men's life, it also allows a stab at how we view women and that we should try to take them much more seriously. however she is the spark that sets off the entropy of a spiral toward destruction.Throughout the movie are small nuances that would take a long time to explain each one, however this shows that alot of thought and interest was put into this movie, and after many viewings im not sure i get every point this movie tries to make.It is alot to swallow in 140 minutes and take many viewings to take it in entirely, therefore i recommend a second viewing if you thing you really didn't quite &quot;get it&quot;. but of course what do i know and what credibility do i have. I'm only 16.	5.0	a truthful insight on so many aspects.	2004-04-08	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2PPZNGRLFDUX0	"R. Hudak ""Hudak-Budak"""	"Hear me now and believe me later: this movie is one of the most important movies you will ever watch. Not only is it a great movie in it's own right, but the message it espouses is something everyone needs to hear.As Brad Pitt says in the movie, ""You are not your job, you are not the clothes you wear..."" An anti-materialism theme rings loudly throughout the movie, and it's something everyone should think about. ""It is when we have nothing that we are free to do anything.""Some reviews said the movie is fascist. That is wrong. If anything, the movie has a Communistic flavor. The party works together for the betterment of the people working in it. They all live together and work in shifts to mutually help the other party members. Their ultimate goal is to bring down the corporations and dissolve the state, aka the bourgeoisie. And as the group demonstrates in the scene with the Chief of Police, it is the working class, everyone around you, that is responsible.But don't let a fear of Communism get in the way of you watching this movie. The other themes and messages are important as well. Not only that, but it's just a darn good movie, with a great surprise ending.The DVD comes packed with hours upon hours of extra footage, including 4 full-length commentaries and a plethora of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes vignettes.The bottom line is: see the movie. Buy the movie, whether you have to get this DVD, the single-disk DVD, the VHS, the LaserDisc or the 8mm film.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A191ZQLBJ1L3BO	Rhyl Donnelly	This movie was so brilliant! Normally movies based upon books don't live up to what people expect, but this film went beyond. At first I thought it would be stupid because Brad Pitt was in it, but he actually wasn't that bad. I also like the fact that David Fincher directed this movie, he did a very good job in fooling the entire audience, much like he did for the film Se7en and The Game. Fincher will probably never top this film in the rest of his career, this is his masterpiece. Meatloaf also has a role in the film and luckily he doesn't sing, his character is actually very amusing. Now I know I'm disobeying the first and second rules of Fight Club by writing this review, but it's just that good that I am willing to risk everything on this film.	5.0	One of the best movies I have ever seen!!	2001-12-25	4	3	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AXL04QKU2OL83	RICE187@HOTMAIL.COM	This movie works on so many levels, a rarity in films these days.  There's the anti-establishment, anti-materialistic angle.  There's the strong sense of homo-eroticism among the fight club members, scenes cut to resemble  sexual acts.  Another great aspcet is the surprise twist, ala &quot;The  Usual Suspects&quot;.  With all of these great cinematic layers, and more  that there is not enough room to mention, this is a movie that forces you  to watch over and over and actually think!  One more thing, if Meatloaf  doesn't get nominated for a best supporting actor oscar, it's a crying  shame.	5.0	WOW!	2000-02-02	7	6	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AST59VZKYSJPT	Richard Giles	I thought this movie was brilliant at the theater. I enjoyed its black humour. I can understand why many people may not like it because of its violence, but it didn't phase me. I found the story, and the cinematography  just beautiful.So the movie itself was great. The DVD is brilliant. Its  adds to the movie in the way only a truely utilised DVD of today can do.  The interactivety is impressive. Though I would have liked a bit more of a  documentary that stepped me through the making of the movie.One of the  best features of the movie is the commentry by Fincher, Pitt and Norton.  The discussion wouldn't be out of place with the guys sitting in your  lounge room over a few beers. With their humour and their insight into the  ideas of the movie.The features that show off how the movies SFX will  just amaze. I love computer graphics, and this stuff REALLY shows what you  can do.If you liked the movie, get the DVD. If your looking for a very  clever transfer, get the DVD.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1XQQ6D0L21M9B	Richard Grayson	I don't want to say that fight club chnged my life but it did, by helping me put into words what i've felt for years.We are all clones,Tyler shows us this.We buy what the TV tells us,we wear what everyone is wearing,we act a  certain way because we are conditioned to act this way.Just think about  that,let it sink in and re-examine your actions and what really causes you  to do things you do.  This  just scratches the surface of what Fight Club is about.When I sat down to  watch this movie I was expecting the Ultimate Fighting Championhip because  of title,the whole movie contains about 10 minutes of fighting.Contrary to  some critics the violence in the film was not meaningless,this was the most  justifiable violence i've seen on film.  David Fincher directed this film perfectly.His use of camera  angles,shaking the camera,and blurred shots fit so well with the tone of  the film.Brad Pitt was an excellent choice for the role of Tyler Durden the  man who makes and sells soap for a living,but is extremely complex.This is  Pitt at his best.Edward Norton plays a run down white collar worker who is  not happy with his job,his looks,his whole life, and no matter what IKEA  furniture set or how much DKNY clothing he buys he still feels  incomplete,sound familar?  Fight  club is the most well made movie i've ever seen.In addition to that it is  the most insightful movie I know of.It tackles issues other movies don't  have the guts to.You may hear someone say they didn't enjoy this film,watch  it for yourself.These people fall into two categories,those who could not  understand the film because of tunnel vision,and those who are afraid to  admit what they may have become.	5.0	&quot;The world we all know is there,but don't want to admit&quot;	2000-03-12	2	2	0

"Now, I guess it's time to talk about Fight Club.I finally got a chance to see the film on my recent flight over to China...completely unedited.As you might expect, given the title, the film is violent. But, it is well shot, with great performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Elizabeth Bonham-Carter, and Meatloaf.Edward Norton plays a professional and frequent traveler, who lives alone and without personal aims. A chance meeting with Brad Pitt's character sets things in action, and the two men form a bond through fighting, and then by setting up a ""fight club"". The fighting is a way of release for people who feel disconnected and overly controlled in their lives...but it represents also the deeper problems in society, and the urge to fight back against them. The fight club begins to take on a life of its own, with Brad Pitt's character forging a more sinister purpose for the group. The situation spirals out of Norton's control, and he tries desperately to pull things back...when he encounters the true nature of Pitt's character.Meatloaf dons man-breasts...that takes courage. I would do many things for films, but I won't do that.The violence is unsparing, and sometimes hard to watch.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A14JN0SRDOUS59	Rick Gagliano	First of all...I truly hated it and yet liked it. Okay, I know you are wondering what kind of rating is that, but it is true. While I hated the film for it's violent content, I liked the quality of the story and the  outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.  Any film that makes &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; look like a Disney  movie is a film that is truly not for everyone. My immediate reaction after  seeing this film was that I would not encourage anyone to see this film,  nor would I even want to review it for fear that it might spark someone to  want to see it. I don't think I have ever seen a more violent movie nor do  I ever want to see one. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is truly in a class by  itself. It is a film that you would not want to take a date to, nor is it a  film that will entertain you...I can't imagine someone running down to the  local Blockbuster and picking it up for a quiet evening at home. I am not  one for censorship nor am I one for banning a film, but I would seriously  question the judgement of someone who viewed this film and considered it  entertainment. The story centers around the relationship of two people,  Pitt and Norton, and the enjoyment they get from beating the  &quot;heck&quot; out of each other. They fight not for sport, but for the  pure enjoyment they feel from the pain they inflict upon others and in  return have inflicted upon them. Bottom line...I feel it's time we add  another rating to our rating scale...&quot;NRQ&quot;...&quot;No Redeeming  Quality&quot;. This film has no redeeming qualities, is not entertaining,  nor should anyone see it...but it definitely is one film like no other.	1.0	First of all...I hated it.	2000-02-13	184	16	168

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A22B7OKOA28G84	"""rift6x@hotmail.com"""	Hmmmm....The entire world seems to have missed the point.  This is not just a story of rebellion and self-destructive philosophy to find some strange form of enlightenment.  This is not just silly lines and guys fighting violently.  Not just sex.  Not just insanity.  This is certainly not a story of freedom.There is a political and social message I've noticed not many people are recieving.  It's a poke at every radical out there who fights against &quot;the Establishment&quot; or the &quot;Man.&quot;  Watch this movie again.  Fight Club begins as something innocent, a way to rebel against standardized norms of pleasure.  What it transforms into is a terrorist regime.  Sure, in Fight Club they managed to escape from enslaving jobs and the &quot;oppression&quot; of modern suburbia through this unsanctioned variety of rituals.  But in Project Mayhem, the innocence of rebellion turns into e x a c t l y what they tried to escape from.  It's all right there in the mantra of Project Mayhem: &quot;Sir, we do not ask questions in Project Mayhem, Sir.&quot;  They become Space Monkeys, like the slaves to nine-to-fivers, the old lives they think they've destroyed.  Everything comes back to where it started.  The rebels form their own chains of self-oppression.  In order to rebel, they must establish a conformist society (Project Mayhem).  They lose their names and personal identities--exactly what they hated about regular society and jobs that lead to anonymity and industrial disallusionment.  The means to usurpation are different, but the underlying bases of Project Mayhem are just as empty and disgusting as the real world's foundations. I suppose this, like many great films of our era, would be easily misinterpreted by the idiots looking for blood and violence, and stupid lines.  Critics looking for sub-par Titanics.  The empty-minded award givers who gave Michael Caine (Michae Caine!) an Academy Award for one of hte worst written, acted, and directed movies ever--Cider House Rules.  (Let us not forget: &quot;What's your business, boy!) I am a writer and an artist and philosopher--Fight Club appealed to all three facets of my being.To all the kids who started their own fight clubs, and you'd be surprised at how many actually did--the idiots--I say this: actually read into the movie.  If you have any ability to interpret intelligent symbols, you will see past what everyone else praises emptily.  Don't be a Space Monkey--the movie managed to fool more people than even Palahniuk, the writer of the book.David Fincher, Pitt, and Norton deserved Academy Awards.  Especially Fincher.  Probably the greatest social analysis in film of any generation.  The rest is just delicious garnishing.	5.0	Look a little bit closer--this is not just a Fight Club.	2001-04-27	17	11	6

The movie was akin  to a flashback of taking shots in the gut from guys I barely knew who were  trying to toughen me up for combat.  A lot of people seem torn on the  ending whereas it made perfect sense to me.  It was incredibly shocking and  in my opinion very original and gratifying.

Add a final plot twist that makes  no sense and there you have it.I understand the point of violence in the  film. One needs to see what the human body is capable of, but this was  overkill.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	Fight Club (David Fincher, 1999)[originally posted 13Oct2000]Fight Club is one hundred thirty-nine minutes long. It would, perhaps, have been better served by being one hundred thirty-four minutes long. Right up until the last five minutes, Fincher was angling to become another of the directors to have more than one film on my hundred-best list (a quick run-through shows he'd be the ninth, but don't quote me on that)*. That said, I'm going to focus on those first hundred thirty-four minutes.I had some problems for the first half-hour or so with the Bret Ellis-esque fascination with brand names (excepting, of course, the wonderfully clever scene in which Fincher populates Norton's character's condo with catalog pages), but once I realized that Palahniuk was actually going somewhere with his brand-consciousness mayhem, it stopped being annoying. (Memo to Bret Easton Ellis: learn something.) The dialogue and the narration were both clever, witty, and in places laugh-out-loud funny. Fincher, as is his wont, keeps things atmospherically dark and claustrophobic, and all of it adds up to a powder keg with a bunch of small compartments ringing the big one. Little jolts hit now and then, mostly connected in some way to Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, in an extremely unexpected role) and her relationships with Tyler Durden and the narrator.For those who may have been living in a cave the last year and a half, a quick synopsis: Norton, a nameless corporate drone (the corporate version of a claims adjuster, in essence), meets the enigmatic Tyler Durden on a flight from one generic city to another. Durden is everything the narrator is not; mysterious, ebullient, straightforward. The two become fast friends after a freak accident blows the narrator's condo apart. (The astute cinemagoer should already be seeing the parallels to the underrated Lowe/Spader flick Bad Influence.) As part of the deal Durden strikes with the narrator in exchange for letting the narrator crash at his place, Durden asks the narrator to hit him. The two get involved in a fight, and the narrator, a support-group addict, realizes how liberating it can be to simply fight. Eventually, the street brawls the two get into regularly start attracting others who are drawn to this brand of redemption through violence, and Fight Club is begun.Despite the trailers for the film and my expectations after seeing Fincher's earlier work, the amount of violence in here is kept to about the minimum it has to be to get the point across; there are only two or three scenes that actually cause winces. More surprising was the film's comedic aspect; I laughed out loud a few times while alone, something that rarely happens when watching movies. It all comes together perfectly, the archetypal modern tragedy brought stylishly down to the level of metatheatre during the film's climax... and then it all goes belly-up. One imagines (gleefully, it must be said) Aristophanes or Sophocles rising from the grave to smack Fincher across the head with a skeletal hand and growl &#34;what the hell were you THINKING?&#34;Still, unlike usual, I refuse to let the last five minutes of this film deter me from singing the praises of the first two hours plus. Script, direction, casting (did I really forget to mention Meat Loaf? The man was fantastic... and I really have to say, I don't care if it IS his real last name, &#34;Meat Loaf Aday&#34; is even funnier...), setting, cinematography, it was all fantastic. Tarantino meets Hitchcock with a dash of John Ford thrown in. But then ending keeps it from reaching the heights it deserves. **** ed. note 9Dec2013: Dario Argento, David Cronenberg, John Frankenheimer, William Friedkin, Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Lumet, Takashi Miike, Yasujiro Ozu, George A.

I was wrong.This week my teen-ager, who does NOT watch many DVDs, told me I had to see it, so I picked up a copy at Best Buy and by gosh and by golly, this is a philosophy movie, not a fight movie.Yes, there are a few scenes with blood all over, but if anything, once comes away feeling, as the director intends, that fighting is life-affirming.This is a movie for intelligent people who have some angst about the way things are going under the mismanagement of the ""business as usual"" political parties, and for those who question the ""gerbil on a wheel"" existence that most jobs offer.I found it completely absorbing and very worthwhile."	5.0	My teen-ager insisted I watch this, and he was right	2007-10-27	9	7	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A38G64S5VMRI1P	Robert Graves	"A preacher once prayed, ""Lord, please give me a good sermon to go with this joke."" Likewise, I can imagine Fight Club's writer praying for a good movie to go with his plot twist. But if this was his prayer, it went unanswered.Meet ""The Narrator,"" played masterfully by Ed Norton, who is a deeply troubled young man working for a major auto manufacturer assessing whether recalls on defective auto parts will exceed the cost of all the lawsuits that could result. The Narrator initially has two problems, an insatiable materialism and insomnia, the latter of which he eases by going to various self-help groups for afflictions he doesn't actually have, ranging from testicular cancer to brain parasites. Once he allows himself to cry at a meeting, he can finally sleep again. But trouble rises further when The Narrator meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another fraud in the support group racket. The Narrator is unable to focus at the groups in her presence, being reminded of his own lie. Marla, looking like a rejected kewpie doll, agrees to attend on different nights so as not to disturb him. The tone of sexual confusion is obvious even this far into the movie, from characters such as Bob (Meat Loaf Aday), who has lost his testicles and since developed breasts. If it sounds like I'm describing a new Woody Allen movie, just read on.Enter soap salesman Tyler Durden, portrayed by a rougher tougher Brad Pitt doing his 12-Monkeys schtick. The two meet on an airplane and it becomes immediately apparent what is brewing: Tyler is everything The Narrator isn't. He's rugged, handsome, and very bold with his words, spouting off the post-modernist nihilism that this movie aspires to. After a very brief and witty exchange, Tyler leaves The Narrator with only a business card.It's not long before these two friends are reunited. The Narrator returns to his apartment to find that it has exploded in his absence, and homeless, he calls Tyler and they go out for a beer. Their night out ends in the parking lot with Tyler telling The Narrator, ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can."" And thus is born the Fight Club. It begins with only The Narrator and Tyler, but quickly it expands to include hundreds of men in many franchises across the country. Their motive? Simple: To beat the piss out of each other in order to experience a realness they can't get anywhere else. Apparently it's only in pain that we are truly aware of ourselves.Things quickly turn south, however. Tyler starts a lecherous relationship with Marla, troubling The Narrator deeply. And then the Fight Club itself gets skewed when the men who were once only adrenaline-filled over-grown boys fighting it out turn militant, joining Tyler's ultra-secret ""Project Mayhem"" team. They all live in Tyler's dilapidated house and perform various assignments from destroying corporate art and franchise coffee bars, to urinating in restaurant-goer's soup and inserting porn clips into children's movies at the theatre, with Tyler continuously spewing his anti-capitalistic philosophy all over the audience's lap. The members of Project Mayhem feel as though they are at last real individuals, although they are engaging in mindless cult-like activities.Circumstances begin to spin out of control, and just when you think the plot couldn't be any more derailed, enter The Gratuitous Plot Twist, that staple of recent flicks, to shock (trick) the audience into thinking this is a deep and enigmatic movie.Deep? Enigmatic? I'm not buying it, friends. What director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) and writer Chuck Palahnuik have created is in my opinion art for the sake of being artistic. While some critics would hail this as genius, don't be taken in. It is much more difficult to write a real story with real characters. It is much more difficult to tell a story that is supposed to be believable rather than one that is almost entirely symbolic. Films such as Fight Club take the easy way out by exploring surreal themes - if it's uncharted and undefined, then how can they do it wrong? They can rest assured that it will appeal to at least one underground coterie. The real challenge would have been for Fincher and Palahnuik to delve into the topics of masculinity and nihilism from a more traditional story format. If an avant-garde movie such as Fight Club is to be given credence, it needs to be superbly beyond superb.And, alas, Fight Club, while containing some good one-liners and excellent acting, never gets off the ground despite taking a giant leap. The average movie-goer will wonder what this film is supposed to be. A commentary on manhood? Mr. Mom did a better job. Is it a comedy as Palahnuik himself suggests? I'm not laughing. Is it a moral critique? I hope not - ""capitalism is bad, but urinating in soup and putting porn in Cinderella is good,""?I don't want to take everything away from the film - there were certainly some clever aspects. For one, Tyler's home-made soap is fashioned from human fat, which he sells to high-end department stores. What we have then is people reveling (washing) in their own refuse (fat), Tyler's main message throughout the movie. And the acting is not to be questioned, but would we expect otherwise from Norton and Pitt?Unfortunately, though, Fight Club seems to fall on the very grounds on which it tries to stand - what it attempts to say is undermined by what it actually is. It is nothing more than a product of the very attitudes it aspires to spurn in the film. Overdone visual effects, gratuitous violence, unabashed sex scenes - does this sound like the movie of a true reformer or a good ol' boy looking for fun on a Saturday night? It's very hard to take the movie's message seriously, especially when it makes the trendy accusation against materialistic values, but only offers fascist ideals in their stead. I don't think Fight Club is going to produce any proselytes to its counterfeit grown-up suggestions, since one would almost have to already be a cemented nihilist to sit through it. But it should be enough to trick a few intellectuals into thinking that they alone bear the burden of ""getting it."" I fear Fight Club is destined to become nothing more than a scar on Fincher's otherwise excellent resume."	2.0	A swing and a miss	2000-10-07	26	13	13

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A30JWBSVCFYXPE	"Robert Knetsch ""Wanna-be theologian"""	I'd heard the hype over this film, yet never really know what I was getting into.  I knew there would be violence (I mean, look at the name!)  And I knew I really loved Edward Norton.I was by no means interrupted.  Watching as this man (played by Norton) tried to find meaning in groups of people, at times getting more and more wacky.  Eventually, by meeting Tyler Durden (Pitt), he joins the Club that gives him the best sense of belonging.  A club of men who fight, who are insanely violent to one another, who are bound together by an oath, yet secret as they are, they become incredibly popular.  They become an organized group of men who are closer than a military unit, with initiation rituals that would drive some people insane.Durden proposes an evangelical nihilism and wants to spread it everywhere.  Meaning is only what you give it, no matter if it is completely violent and acts against your own conscience.  And this is the purpose ofd fighting for its own sake.Make no mistake, this movie is dark, violent and disturbing.  Yet is seems to appeal in some way to our desire to ask questions about how one gives meaning to themselves or to anything of which they are a member.  What makes us feel alive?  Do the means to feel this way justify that end?In opposition to American Beauty - a film that also espouses a kind of nihilistic tendency - this film is open and honest, brutally honest, in telling you where such a belief could very well take you.  One can believe that Durden is a realistic character.Then there is the twist near the ending.  I won't give it away.  In some ways I liked it because it was as shocking, or even more so, than the ending to The Sixth Sense.  And I like to be shocked.  It turned the movie completely around.  On the other hand I think what it did was take away from the honesty of where the nihilistic philosophy could take you, and instead puts it in the realm of insanity rather than reality.  And that was just a a bit of a cop out to me.  That is the only thing that kept me from giving this a full 5 stars.	4.0	An incredible, daring film	2000-11-03	2	2	0

Then I saw it  again and realized that the filmakers are TELLING you the surprise all  along, and that the twist DOES make sense, you just can't read everything  that happens on screen as literal.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AV43VPYZNJ7ZB	Roberto Vila	Going into this movie, I thought it would be a shallow story, depending on the two main actors (Brad Pitt and Edward Norton) to deliver box office numbers, and little else.  I was shocked by what I saw during the first viewing, and it only gets better each successive time.Fight Club is about a man (Edward Norton) who becomes unsatisfied with his normal life.  He hates his job, has serious insomnia, and only finds relief when surrounding himself with others who are suffering.  He meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a business flight, and they become quick friends.  Tyler leads him into a life he never imagined, forcing Norton's character to hit bottom so he can improve his life.Fight Club is beautifully shot, has a great script and appropriate background music.  The script challenges the viewer to think about their life in different ways and makes them think about the consumeristic culture in which people find themselves today.The DVD has tons of extra commentary and outtakes - which only make you appreciate the movie even more.

The writer of this anti-consumerism tosh is obviously so pleased  with himself, so smug, that he has tried to produce something which he  expects us all to stand back and say &quot;wow&quot;.

Truesdell	Every so often a movie bursts upon our cultural shores with direct hits on so many levels that it overwhelms our ability to completely absorb all the content in one viewing. This movie goes to work on enough different levels that it can hold the thinking viewer fascinated through a good dozen presentations at least. After all the signs, symbols, philosophies and twists have been deciphered there are still the detailed production values and crackling acting to keep us entertained. The screenwriting is precise, detailed, and hits the targets dead center.In the end, after all the analysis and repeated viewings, there is nothing left to the imagination, everything having been presented explicitly in the course of the movie. There are really no open topics of debate, no unfinished threads. This self-contained completeness may eventually cause the movie to drop from my fascination radar but until that day, I enjoy the benefit of some well-crafted art.I don't recommend this movie to anybody--not my best friend nor my worst enemy.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AM4ZQJ0IORVWG	"Rob ""Revuman"""	"Ok, before I get too far into this review, let me mention that this is one of those movies that you are either going to love or hate.  Some people will love it because of its very black, sometimes cynical comedic style  while others will hate it because of its ""supposed"" glorification of  fighting and its farfetched concepts.  And this is the point of the movie,  to make you think rather than to make you love it.  That's what makes this  movie so great; there are no restrictions, no censorship, and no lies.  The  movies tells things in a way that is unrestricted, which makes everything  more vivid and more powerful than if it had been made around the  aspirations of the audience it wished to draw into the movie theater.  And  although people will certainly have their opinions, I believe that this  illustration of the freedom of movie making puts it right up there with  cult classics like Blade Runner and others.First off, the Script is a  thing of beauty.  Not only is it filled with very dark images all set in a  comedic tone, but it also illustrates perfectly the message that the movie  is trying to portray.  It also has that uniqueness to it that separates  Fight Club from all other previous movies.  It isn't just a rehashing of  old ideas but a unification of many radical ones in order to form an  original plot and idea, which translates into a genre-breaking film.  Fight  Club itself is part action, part black comedy, part mystery, part thriller,  and part insanity.  In this way it makes it difficult to compare to any  previous movie because it is so different from anything that I have seen or  that has been produced in the past.The acting is also top notch.  Brad  Pitt is, out of all the characters, the one who holds the screen the best.  His role as Tyler Durdin, the strange yet sharp alter-ego friend Jack  (Norton), is one of strength, craziness, class, style, and intelligence, is  hard to miss and is a classic Pitt performance, similar in style to that of  his crazy portrayal of the inmate in 12 monkeys.  Although Norton does a  good job as Jack, the narrator, in the film, he doesn't have the same kind  of flare or presence that Pitt carries throughout the film.  And, at times,  he sound like the little kid who's always being pressured into doing the  `bad things' during recess hour.  Then there is Helena Bonham Carter, who  shines as the crazed and slightly neurotic love interest of Pitt and  Norton.  Although her presence in the movie isn't huge, her placement in  certain scenes is vital to the forward motion of the plot and the entire  movie in general.Also, one reason to get the DVD rather than the VHS is  that you get tons of extra, for lack of a better word, stuff on the second  CD like behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, audio commentaries,  storyboards, and more.  If you love to see the insides of a movie and find  out more about why the director or the producer or actors did certain  things then you'll love all these extras.All in all, regardless of  which one you buy, you will end up seeing a movie unlike any you have ever  seen...I guarantee it.  Director David Fincher's look at the underground  world is both slick and startling and anyone who calls him or herself a  movie buff has to give this movie a chance.  Even if you're reluctant to  let it grow on you, I promise that once you take the step to pop the movie  in your VCR or DVD player you won't be disappointed...I know I wasn't.RevuMan:  Ground control to Major Tom...sorry, could think of any relative  words of wisdom...oh well...Peace!"	5.0	A most controversial masterpiece	2000-06-16	8	6	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1CJ1FBD9I2VTN	Robyn Long	Fight Club provides an alternative perspective on the world we live in -- a VERY alternative perspective.  The first time I saw this movie, it scared me to death.  Confused, I left the theater, continuing my attempt to understand the meaning behind all the gore.  I was too fascinated to leave it alone so I saw the movie many more times, each time seeing it in a new light.  Ed Norton's character satirized the place we work, the mail order catologues we drool over, and the support groups that we so dearly depend on.  While on a plane, he even adresses the &quot;single servings&quot; of condoments and beverages and the like, while at the same time identifying Brad Pitt's character as a &quot;single serving&quot; friend.  Ed Norton's character endures struggles at work and with insomnia, and throughout the movie helearns, with the brutal tutelage of Brad Pitt, that his life is not a tragedy and he has to learn to live life for what it is.  He discards the value of material objects and things of the sort.  Brad Pitt's character wishes to be &quot;delivered from clear skin and perfect teeth,&quot; meaning these things are not truly important entities in life.  Even though this movie is a challege to watch and endure, the message it delivers is worth it.	5.0	&quot;You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake&quot;	2001-11-01	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1MA0NZ182LVCG	roger bailey	Fight Club is an attrroctious movie that reeks of 15 minute fame.  The idea that all working class people can expect nothing good out of their miserable little lives and that we all need to be reduced to nothing but individuals who are truly no better then everybody else doesn't sit well, nor does the sight of men with large breasts or stealing liposuctioned fat to make soap.  Elements like this are true signs of the 15 minute fame mark.  Had it been kept with the premise of fighting to work out tension it could have been better.  Brad Pitt also makes for probably the most tetched character in movie history.  This movie is hidious and goes on WAY too long.	1.0	A little anarchists dream come true	2000-11-27	64	14	50

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	The `machismo factor,' though it lies at the root of virtually every shoot-em-up war film, western and action picture Hollywood has ever  produced, has, strangely enough, gone largely unexamined in films as a  subject itself. `Fight Club' becomes one of the first movies to actually  address the issue, bluntly and directly. Before it eventually spins out of  control, this provocative film audaciously confronts a disturbing, but  truly pertinent anthropological issue: in a society that, for purposes of  its own survival, actively discourages violent behavior, is it possible for  a man, conditioned by eons of innate but ever increasingly repressed  `hunter/gatherer' instincts, to ever cut himself loose and be true to his  real nature? And if he doesn't, can he be said to ever be a `real man,' or  is he simply a hollow shell allowing society to determine what he values  and how he lives?Edward Norton stars as Jack, a man so softened by the  amenities of a modern technological culture that he has even replaced  pornography with the IKEA catalogue. As far from his barbaric ancestral  roots as any man worthy of the label can be, Jack has turned to haunting  feel-good support groups to fill the void his empty life devoted to  meaningless culture-driven values has created for him. Suddenly, into his  life walks Tyler (Brad Pitt), a sardonic, tough talking thug, the total  antithesis to Jack and a man completely in touch with his male-based  instinctive need for simple hand-to-hand physical confrontation. Together,  the two set up an underground club designed to give men like Jack the  opportunity to beat the living crud out of each other and therein find  their way back to their true primordial selves.Not only does `Fight  Club' explore a fascinating and long-overdue theme, it insidiously lures us  in to the glamorous excitement of the fight scenes themselves. Much as we  may resist their pull, we are so appalled by the alternative we are shown  in the form of Jack's drearily routine office environment, the stifling  conformity of his decorator-influenced, perfectly coordinated apartment and  the self-aggrandizing emotionalism of the many support groups he visits  that we feel as liberated as he does by the simple physical aggression of  the unregulated bouts. This is the genius of the film: it makes us just as  cognizant of the compromises we ourselves routinely make to social norms as  it does Jack. What is most impressive is that the film could easily have  turned into just another cautionary tale, a violent tract warning us of the  dangers of allowing these instincts to run amok. Instead, the filmmakers  have been careful to keep most of the activity in the realm of  self-contained mano-a-mano confrontations. In fact, the club members do not  employ guns, and, for the most part, scrupulously avoid hurting innocent  bystanders or killing anyone. (Just for the record, this controversial work  is actually a much less violent film than most of what passes for benign  action cinema these days). Although there are a few steps taken by the  group in the direction of involving outsiders in provoked fights and  eventually detonating some empty buildings - these are, by the way, the  least authentic sections of the film - the violence really doesn't extend  much beyond the confines of the club itself. Thus we are spared the  tiresome moralizing one might expect from a film exploring this  theme.Where, then, does the film ultimately come out on this issue? Is  `Fight Club' a socially irresponsible call for the unfettered use of  violence to create societal chaos, or is it a sly black comic vision of a  world gone crazy intended to highlight the dangers of just such a  situation? The answer to that question is really not an easy one to come  by, for the film itself loses its way in its final half hour. Having set up  this fascinating premise, `Fight Club' decides, rather inexplicably, to go  the sci-fi route, setting up a Jekyll and Hyde situation that both  undercuts the seriousness of the theme and spells the message out in far  too simplistic terms. Also, unlike in `The Sixth Sense,' the surprise  turnabout ending doesn't make sense in the logical context of the story.  Are we to actually assume that Jack has been fighting HIMSELF all this  time? It is true that the dark comedy flavor that runs throughout the film  does create a world where the improbable can be made possible. But the  suspension of disbelief required by the final acts of this film places far  too heavy a burden on the audience to make the drastic shift in tone truly  work.Special note should indeed be made of the extraordinary  performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Pitt, in one of his finest  roles to date, conveys the macho hard-edged physicality and sardonic charm  necessary to lure these men to his way of thinking. Norton always keeps his  character focused and life-sized, allowing Tyler to exploit these inner  yearnings yet remaining enough on the outside to continually question the  validity of his actions.`Fight Club,' for all its imperfections and  moments of confusion, deserves credit for finally attempting to explore a  theme too often exploited but rarely examined by Hollywood. The film  provides some real food for thought and, in all honesty, how many movies  can you truly say that about?	4.0	flawed but brilliant film	2000-07-25	4	3	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3HU5BARF5DSN4	"Ross Davis ""ensomniac"""	I loved this film from the first time I knew that it existed. Fight Club. I wanted to see it because I thought it would be a film based on organized, underground, raw violence and in a sense it was, but the first time I viewed the movie in its original theatrical release I didn't quite understand. After I finished watching, it set my mind into motion. I was asking myself what the point of the whole thing was. I knew I had to have a copy for my own. After careful viewing the second time, the entire film seemed richer and less disorganized. The focus was no longer on the 5 or so fighting scenes, it was about a deeper message. I know that other diehard Fight Club fans know what i'm talking about, a revolution in thought.Don't get the wrong idea , this movie isn't great just because of the fighting. It has loads of comedy! I admit it's not Naked Gun, but there is subtle and blatant humor throughout the film. It is truely enjoyable to watch.After 5 or 6 viewings it literally becomes a cult film. You start to believe the ideas presented in the movie, and you start to act out those ideas. I don't mean picking fights with strangers on the street, everything you do is affected. In short, if you give this movie a chance (3 or 4 viewings) you will discover the true beauty behind this masterpiece and it will change your life, for the betterment of mankind.	5.0	I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge	2001-01-12	2	1	1

All in all Fight Club is a tour into the darkness and mayhem of  modern day society and this tour your just going to have to take to beleive it.With director and actor commentarys by Brad Pitt  and Edward Norton and director David Fincher and , production  notes and deleted scenes Fight Club is sure to please any DVD owner so dim the lights get the popcorn ready and put in this truly awsome modern day epic for you to own.	5.0	The heart of darkness for the 90's , morbid but inteligent.	2000-09-28	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1N16ZSJ1BXJFL	"R. Pfeil ""cartman4president"""	... Brad Pitt.  I hate to say it, but the man is an extremely talented actor.  Ocean's Eleven, Snatch, Fight Club, Seven...all amazing flicks.  But I'll tell you...Fight Club is the best movie ever made.  Here are eight reasons why:1) You cannot categorize this movie, it's everything.  It's action, it's drama, it's supsenseful as anything in some parts, it's funny, and it's horrifyingly graphic.2) I've noticed something different all 123258005 times I have watched it.  I know, I know, the number is what I like to call an exaggeration.  But seriously, I have picked up something new that makes the plot even more extreme each time I have watched it.  ... I have seen this movie probably at least 150 times, seriously.  I am so sad.3) It's brilliant.  All these people keep bashing it as dangerous and demented.  How about thought-provoking?  How about a new angle on the world?  How about a message to go against everything you believe and just listen?  How about the fact that there's millions of movies like that with those themes, but Fight Club does it differently?4) Edward Norton is my favorite actor.  It's just a piece of the puzzle.  Ever since I saw American History X, I knew that this guy was for real.  You wanna know why he gets almost zero publicity?  He chooses not to.  He thinks it would interfere with how you saw his characters if you knew the real him.  Wow, now that is conviction to your career.5) The soundtrack is the finest soundtrack that any movie has put out.  The only soundtracks that come close are Terminator II and The Mothman Prophecies.6) This movie was flawlessly written.  If I could write a movie like this, you wouldn't see me critiquing someone else's genius on this website.7) The pure fairy boy gets destroyed.  Usually, fairy boys win.  The fairy boy in this movie...how he looks after the...well, watch it.  You'll see what I mean.8) David Fincher is brilliant.  Um, that's all.Watch this movie, and your brain will hate you the first time you watch it.  But isn't that supposed to be what watching movies is about?  Stimulation that interests your eyes and your brain?  Please watch this.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  Don't just rent it.

It's  got some interesting audio commentaries (at least two of them are with  director David Fincher), a boatload of publicity (including some fake PSA's  with Ed Norton and Brad Pitt), and great behind-the-scenes segments,  wrapped up in a package that stands out from its competitors.  Aside from that, the movie is a rather stunning trip  that obviously isn't meant for everyone.  The performances are great, from  Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden (a sick philosopher-nihilist who turns into a  vicious carbon copy of himself),Ed Norton's troubled Narrator (who has to  deal with life while dealing with Tyler), Helena Bonham Carter's twisted  Marla, to Meat Loaf's tragic Bob.  This movie was unsettling, both visually  and verbally.  Is it a great movie that'll be remembered in 20 years?  I'm  not sure, but hopefully if it is, it'll be as a cautionary tale, not as a  &quot;cheerfully fascist big-star movie&quot;.	5.0	I am Jack's Great DVD and Jack's Stunning Movie	2000-06-23	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AYIHIIOO7Z6P0	Ruth Henriquez Lyon	This is one of the most interesting Hollywood films I have seen in a long time.  The plot revolves around a young man and a new friend with whom he starts up a fighting club for men.  However, contrary to the previews as  shown in theaters, the film is about a lot more than just a bunch of guys  fighting.  It explores some very troubling themes--the shadow, consumerism  and its deflection of our spiritual drives, alienation and lonliness in  urban culture, the repression of our basic instincts--just to name a few.The cinematography is stunning and uses a techique employed by the  character Tyler Durden in the film:  Tyler, in his job as a theater  projectionist, splices pornographic one-frame shots into the films he runs.  Watch Fight Club closely--there are two places where a fleeting shot  appears, once about 15 minutes into the film, another at the very end.  This end shot undercuts the rather schmaltzy Hollywood closing image in a  sarcastically humorous way.And that's another great aspect of this  film--the anti-social humor, which will not appeal to all tastes, but which  is brilliantly carried off.  Just seeing Brad Pitt in his filthy bathrobe  with the appliqued coffee cups all over it is funny.Pitt's acting is wonderful, so is Ed Norton's.....and the two  of them together make a synergy which is very powerful.  Helena Bonham  Carter does a great job as Marla, the love interest whose vulgarity comes  off as an almost endearing quality.I have never really liked Hollywood  films much, finding them too defensive of the status quo.  However, this  film is in an altogether different league.  It is daring, provocative, and  very funny.	5.0	explores the personal and collective shadow	2000-07-23	8	6	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AVUT34FZMS6MG	Ryan	First off, controversial content aside, this movie is just plain well done. The acting is superb, the script well written and the atmosphere, sets, camera-work and pacing are all excellent. David Fincher has created  an amazing movie.It's violent, true, but I think the violence in this  movie has been extremely overstated. Saving Private Ryan was worse than  this, violence-wise, and (although I'm probably going out on a limb here),  I'd say it's an inferior movie as well. So are many action movies.More  to the point, unlike most Hollywood action flicks, the violence in this  movie has a point, and is there for a reason. I can't say that I left this  movie vowing to fight the evil corporations or to live faster, better, more  spontaneously or anything. But I did come away thinking, which I think was  more what was intended.At least try this movie out. It's well worth your  time.	5.0	Just a good movie. Really.	2000-03-05	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1T2FQ93BH46BN	ryan	Has anyone noticed the amazing similarities between fight club and American Beauty?  Both movies are revolved around guys who are fed up with modern day society and its flaws.  Edward Norton can't take the routine of life anymore, so he starts a fight club to deal with the stress.  Not  unlike Kevin Spacey who can't take life anymore and starts smoking pot,  blackmailing his boss, standing up to his family, and working out.Both  movies are very alike, yet one of them was nominating for best picture.  Fight club is one of those movies that comes along and blows you away.  I  agree that american beauty was a great movie but was undeserving of all  those awards, ESPECIALLY the cinematography award which should have gone to  sleepy hollow or FIGHT CLUB.I only saw the movie once but i look  forward to renting it soon and buying the dvd. The movie has a message,  which is hard to find these days on the big screen.  The movie was also  beautifully shot.  I commend Fincher for his vision and realize that the  man who was onced almost called upon to direct Return of the Jedi is a  genious.  All of his movies including Aliens 3 have a vision all on there  own.  Few directors can incorporate a different style for all there movies,  Fincher always manages to display  uniqueness even within himself.  I  highly recommend this movie for love of film and for the love of a great  movie, thank you david fincher.	5.0	amazing similarities	2000-04-07	16	12	4

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3MZ0THMA7QAC7	Ryan Knieff	This movie is truly a great film.  Covering all the genres, Fight Club is funny, sad, violent, mellow, suspenseful and most importantly great all throughout from beginning to end.  Keeping pretty true the book by Chuck Palahuniuk, Director David Fincher did a really great job portraying it.  This DVD also has some great special features:  deleted scenes, 4 or 5 commentaries, advertising trailers, commercials, and internet ads, easter eggs, and much more.  The was one of the first DVD's I bought.  After seeing it in Theaters (which I drove 70 miles to go see), I didn't think watching it home could ever be quite as good.  The VHS version doesn't offer much other than seeing it again, whereas the DVD scores an eagle as far as entertainment, quality, extras, and superb sound...featured in Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS, and mastered in THX.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A8BIZG3SOG5HV	R. Yonk	But the twist in this is way different than the book's. Edward Norton plays the role of an unnamed character who makes his living inside a cubicle taking memos and his home-life revolves around the Ikea catalog and trying to improve his life materialistically. He learns through the movie that his life's priorities were controlling himself and that society's lies causes him and others to feel bad about their lifes. A tad nihilistic and some holes are in the plot narration, the same fault in the book, but by its end you understand the main character's new view on life. This probably ties with Se7en for Brad Pitt's best performance and is a great step for Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, to gain light on his interesting style of narration. I recommend reading the novel before watching the movie though, as the novel's plot is quite different and some minor characters are altered, so if you watched the movie first you will be confused by the masterpiece novel--which you will want to read after watching the movie.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JWM4PWS3WZOM	"S. Adams ""AtomicSwirl"""	"It amazes me how many people totally miss the point behind Fight Club, which is one of my favorite movies.  The movie is not actually advocating mindless violence or fascism.  Consumerism is not the movie's real target either; consumerism--in men--is a merely a symptom of what the movie is really criticizing. Nor is Fight Club ""macho porn,"" as Roger Ebert originally called it.Extremely relevant to the modern American culture, Fight Club is a dark comedy which acts as a cautionary tale about what happens to society when its men are emasculated, devalued, and robbed of any meaningful role as men.  It is no accident that the themes of castration, fatherlessness, and effeminacy keep popping up in the film--they are essential to the main idea.In short, the movie warns that when men and boys are stripped of their manliness and robbed of strong positive male role models, they will eventually rebel.  Since they don't know how to act as men in a positive way--channeling their masculinity in creative and constructive ways--they will resort to the crudest and most primative form of masculinity, brutal destructive violence."	5.0	A Great Cautionary Tale	2006-09-13	21	17	4

It was made with a low budget, as a tribute to late 70s horror films. It not only has a similar message, it IS the soap. A homeless guy with a digital camcorder made it, and its SO well done its crazy. A lot of the themes are the same in both, but BLOODLUST pulls it off without the help of a major star or studio. It goes for a more SHINING-like atmosphere, so dont expect a thrill ride- but in a lot of ways its way better than this late 90s holdover, which smugly takes on corporate America and slick products by ....well, BEING the thing it hates. Not awful, but very overrated. BLOODLUST, however, is very UNDERrrated and fans of this movie should check it out.	3.0	Stylish but mediocre	2011-11-11	8	0	8
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AF9RH93YB091P	Samantha	Although I am a 13 year old girl, and have not had many of the narrators problems.... i understand the point this movie makes. Material possesions....you think you own them, but they own you. Tyler's wisdom is freakishly true. Fight Club, the name of the movie, doesn't even really describe the movie. This movie is not about fighting, there may be some, but that's not the main point. Hitting rock bottom, that should be the title. Forgetting about sh** you buy, and find out what's really important, pain does not matter, it's not even real.  The point of this movie is to help see yourself as you are, not how you'd like to be. Ed Norton (narrator) has to find this out for himself, and he realizes this when he meets Tyler Durdin (Brad Pitt). Tyler is free, in every way a person can be, and he teaches the narrator to let go and believe nothing, and know nothing. That is the true meaning of the story. Tyler has different ways to show his understanding of life than any other person. By destroying material possesions, names, and even questions, everyone becomes the same, and there is no war or depression. In this movie there are several times when Tyler himself tells this to you, quotes and confrontations are presented. If you watch close enough and pay attention you might actually become Ed Nortons' character. That is how down to earth and real this movie is. How one psycho person can change everything with a sense of truth. Watch the movie, and you will soon understand the point of &quot;FIGHT CLUB&quot;!	5.0	On a long enough timeline- the review is pointless	2001-01-13	5	4	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AVJU8RV0BKC2D	Sam B	This movie would have to be one of the best ever. It not only offers entertainment like never before but it also educates us to some extent. It takes us on a rollercoaster ride on how a white collar worker suffering  from insomnia deals with life.There is no other movie like it. This is  original and stays true to the novel. These are just a few of the reasons  this is a great movie. The movie isn't just men fighting with each other,  like trailers and the name itself may lead some people to think. There is  only about 10% of the movie where there are two people beating on each  other. It's a movie where you just can't stop watching, it keeps you  thinking all the way through it and you can watch this movie over and over.  The cast was excellent and they played their roles without fault. Edward  Norton is the real star in this movie, you will realize this in the first  10 minutes. Some of the greatest dialogue is heard in the first 10 minutes  and continues all the way through.There is a lot more to Fight Club than  meets the eye. It is a must watch for anyone really.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2T7PPMDKPPZYY	"""samroot"""	"Edward Norton's character ""Jack"" lives a lackluster, dreary 9 to 5 job in a cubicle typical of corporate America today.  Jack can't sleep, ends up going to group help meetings, faking any type of condition to get a release, in the form of a good cry.  He meets another fraud in Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) and it ruins it for him.  They agree to split the meetings so they don't have to see each other.  Then, on the way back on a business flight, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Jack gets Tyler's business card and when Jack finds his apartment has been blown to pieces, he calls Tyler.  They end up meeting for drinks and then at Tyler's request having a fight.  They bond and Jack is invited to live with Tyler.Tyler lives in an abandoned house, a real dump.  Things start happening that affect Jack profoundly.  The fighting eventually builds into a cult following and becomes Fight Club.  The common line is ""we are a generation of men raised by women.""  Profound statements by Tyler seem to flow like a river. Jack has a meeting with the boss due to Jacks failing performance at work and the resulting scene is one of my favorites.  The Club turns into a rowdy group, causing chaos across the city. Fight Club grows and eventually moves to other cities.Tyler ends up with Marla after a plead for help during a suicide attempt, Jack hates her.  Tyler starts ""Project Mayhem"" without Jack's knowledge and the extremes that this action is leading to are more than Jack wants to deal with.  The ending is a big twist and begs one to see the movie again to see where the twist should have been a known during the movie.The fascinating cinematography, the rapid pace, the plot development and the unbelievable acting just cannot be fully appreciated in one viewing, making this one of my most watched DVDs.  Edward Norton's narration is perfect and I watch the movie to listen to his narration as much as anything else.  Brad Pitt has the ability to portray the Alpha male to a tee and his personal style exemplifies Tyler Durden."	5.0	"""You met me at a very strange time in my life."""	2004-01-22	4	2	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A20N0GEJHM2NK6	Sam Tuthill	Brad Pitt/Edward Norton: two awesomely talented actors (Edward Norton much more multitalented, but Brad Pitt excellent at the kind of supporting role that he was nominated for in 12 Monkeys) teamed up as a match made in  heaven. I read the novel before seeing the movie, and the screenplay  adaption is brilliant, leaving out and/or adding things, and making other  people say certain lines along with mixing around events, excluding the  unneeded and adding the lacking. Amazing cinematography mixed with awesome  CGI sequences that look very real. An atmosphere and feeling only the way  David Fincher could show it (check out Seven and the Game, you'll see his  style). Great editing and SOUND EFFECTS EDITING (Oscar nomination). Now my  problems: Helena Bonham Carter's character was made totally useless in the  movie. You neither hated nor loved her flat &quot;charm&quot; or lack  thereof. Secondly: Even though this movie is &quot;anti commercial&quot;,  there is a ton of product placement (from Krispy Kreme to Starbucks and  White Castle), and it's made very obvious. Third: the twist towards the end  makes hardly any sense in the movie. In the book, it is explained in a way  that makes sense. I say, see the movie, then read the chapter where it  happens. And FINALLY: I believe that, though very unHollywood in style, I  believe that the producers bowed to the cheap Hollywood  &quot;money-making-and-pleasing-more-people&quot; technique. Showing the  movie to a test audience with a couple different endings, telling the  audience to decide which it likes the most. The ending in the book was very  different, while visually beautiful in the movie, it was definitely a  &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; to a unique film.	4.0	one of my favorite movies. but. . .	2000-05-25	20	13	7

(literally) out of each other, and those people who actually took the time to discover that the previous assumption is totally false.  A friend told me I absolutely HAD to see this movie, so I rented it.  Not paying attention to the first 20 minutes, imagine my surpise to suddenly be stricken completly confused by what I was hearing.  I immediately rewound it and began it again, giving it the attention it deserved.  After it was over, I rewound it again and watched it.  It was perhaps the 5th or 6th viewing that I finally took everything in.  Not to say that I didn't comprehend it; the plot is quite understandable.  But it is unbelievable how many subtle points indicate everything that is to come.  Similar to the opening of ""The Sixth Sense"": pay proper attention, and the solution is easily predictable.  However, ""Fight Club"" has not much to do with a group of men getting together and venting frustrations by bare-knuckle fighting (with draws connections to Brad Pitt's role in ""Snatch"").  The fighting is only incedential.  It serves simply as a method of finding people who meet certain characteristics to perform certain activities.  Almost everything about the movie makes you wince: from the fighting itself, to the camera work beautifully expressing the disgusting conditions surrounding the characters, to the final scene during which you sit there in amazement and total awe.  It's at the same time hard to believe and completely understandable.  There is no other way everything would have happened, and yet you sit there in a stupor because you are still upset at yourself for believing the same thing I did.  I happen to only be 17 years of age at the time I'm writing this review, and I have not seen as many movies, obviously, as the people who wrote the published, professional reviews of this movie, but my hat off to the director, producer, actors, screenwriters, and scriptwriters involved in the making of this movie, along with the open-minded people who actually took the time to absorb this movie for what it is: a perfect piece of cinema that forces you to realize that these things are not only possible, but they do happen. In fact, a friend of mine recently moved from Wisconsin told me that there was an attempt in his town to ban this movie because people were reinacting many of the characters' activities.  Similar in fact to the reaction in England of Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange.""  And how many people are still talking about that movie?"	5.0	Suprising	2002-10-13	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A37O59DLEGDNTQ	SardonicCynic	&quot;Fight Club&quot; was one of the most overlooked films of 1999. Yes, it attracted a lot of controversy for it's graphic violence, but a lot of people missed the film's main point. It is a jarring, thought-provoking  satire on society in the 90's, and it's consistently sharp observations  about men and their search for lost identity is something that is easy to  admire. &quot;Fight Club&quot;'s unflinching portrayal of destruction and  havoc unleashed, physically and mentally, is at times tough-going, but  never boring to watch. David Fincher does a masterful creating both a  visually and mentally compelling picture. Edward Norton is good, but Brad  Pitt is simply astounding as the fearless sociopath. The film's scrutiny of  man's needed gain for power and ultimate rebellion against society may be  too pessimistic for some people, but might also be tremendous for others.  The only major flaw in &quot;Fight Club&quot; is it's last third, it  totally goes off-course, and detracts from it's overall credibility. That's  too bad, because if it wasn't for that, this could of easily been one of  1999's most brilliant film. It's definitely still worth a look though, it's  too important to miss.	4.0	Unforgettable	2000-02-02	5	3	2

Aside from the typical morbidity of David Fincher, I was  pleased by the originality of the film and the performances of the two  leads.

I feel this film deserves a second viewing to catch it all. Not at all what you expect from the trailer. Theatres need to strictly enforce the admittance of minors to this film so ignorant teens dont start up fight clubs all over. This is not about fighting in the usual sense.

Fight Club requires multiple viewings.  Regardless of what type of person you are, you will have a powerful reaction to what you see.  Some movies are made to simply entertain and make money but Fight Club is one of those rare movies that will leave you pondering a few things. In this way, Fight Club is similiar to such classics as A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver.  Love it or hate it, you will have an opinion about Fight Club and you'll have to ponder this movie to decide where you stand on the matter. Most men will love Fight Club because, well, all men have a Tyler Durden inside...  of course, some of you guys have buried your poor Tyler so deeply in politically correct rhetoric and Oprah Book Club sentiments that you wouldn't recognize your manhood or any of your natural limbic, hunter-gatherer instincts if you found it floating in a bowl of chowder.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2I87ATKI5WO9N	Screwtape	**sigh** This movie depresses me, not because it's sad or mean-spirited, though it certainly is the latter for much of the film, but because many people just don't get it.  &quot;It was fascist!&quot;  &quot;It was chauvanist!&quot;  &quot;It was misleading!&quot;  Most of these comments boil down to, &quot;It made fun of me!&quot;, in which case one may certainly be right.  The film is thoughtful and violent on a much deeper level than quasi-philsophical fare like The Matrix, but it's ultimately optimistic.  There's a lot of parody to the movie, but there's also a lot of serious social commentary.  Fight Club is dangerous.  That much, everyone can agree on.  Much whining takes place concerning the film's apparent lack of social responsibility, but all Fincher does is address the obvious.  Yes, there are disenfranchised American men everywhere, and they need more than they have.  Fight Club is the other side of the American Beauty coin - sex is one issue that is coming to a head, aggression is another.  An eerie similarity in the 'resignation' scenes in both of these movies proves that point.  Jack may not like women, but Marla is more than he bargains for and surprises him to the point that he risks everything he has for her, pitting himself against his role model, Tyler.  The violence here is painful, that's true, but I much prefer the honesty of Fight Club's non-lethal beatings to the kinetic, casual cruelty of The Matrix's now-infamous Lobby Scene, in which at least thirty people are brutally killed.  This is, again, the perfect companion peice to American Beauty.  Watch Fight Club, and think.	3.0	Bleak Genius	2001-03-11	2	2	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3393R28QRPGDV	Sean Edwards	I've been reading a lot of these viewer reviews, and one thing that stands out to me is the variety of interpretations people have of this one film. This film can interpreted in a multitude of ways. Some people see it as a commentary on the soulless nature of our consumer society. Others see it as discussion about the emasculation and alienation that men face in our modern culture. Some people focus on the anarchic aspects, and the irony of how men seeking individuality become identical drones in a terrorist organization. Then there's the psychological aspect of one person integrating their divergent personalities. This film is all these things, and probably even more that I can't think of.For me, the whole film can be seen as metaphor for the search for equilibrium. Everything in the film is about the conflict between opposites, and one man's struggle to find peace and balance in this never-ending struggle. It's about the conflict between the animal impulse and civilization, between men and women, between chaos and order, between life and death. The soap that cleans you, is paradoxically made from the decomposing waste of dead animals. It's no coincidence that Jack's coffee table is a yin-yang design. Jack settles his conflict with Marla by negotiating a fair split of the resource they both want, the cancer support groups, a very feminine method of conflict resolution. Tyler settles his conflicts by threatening to castrate those who oppose his wishes, a rather more masculine and aggressive method of negotiation. The entire film is about Jack's integration of these competing impulses, and it's also about how the entire world stuggles to deal with the same issues.Life and everything is this constant struggle between light and dark, and neither side can be complete by itself. Unrestrained order leads to the soulless emptiness of Jack's furniture quest, unrestrained chaos leads to the nihilistic self-destruction of Tyler's anarchy. The ending is spot-on perfect as Jack integrates himself achieving peace and order, through the violence and chaos of shooting himself. Order arising from chaos, just as life itself arises from the primordial soup. It's very Zen, and I loved it. Best movie I've seen in years.	5.0	This movie is deep	2005-03-13	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A31AX9E0FJDR9W	Sean McDonald	The beauty of this film is that it is at its heart a romantic comedy. Not excatly &quot;You've got Mail&quot; but not the harbinger of Gen X doom that everyone makes it out to be either. At its heart, this movie wants to  make you laugh, and it constantly hits its mark. The jokes (often darker  and darker as the film progresses) are fast and furious and the ending is  not so much the narrartor overcomming Tyler, but realising that Marla  (Love) is what makes his life worth living. The exploration of Nihlism,  buddism, anacrchism are just diverting sidebars in what should be viewed as  the funniest black comedy ever (ok there is Dr. Strangelove but what is so  funny about the end of the world?). Forget the fights (ask yourself why  they are worse than any Arnie movie... are you bothered by real, not  cartoon, violence), forget the Nihlistic rants (the &quot;Robert  Paulson&quot; chant should be enought to make you realize that groups like  this are mindless anyway) and focus on the dry pointed humor that runs  throughout as a beacon to this disaffected generation.Oh and yes this  DVD is AWSOME.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AFDDWKS1E4PZN	Selena	Okay...maybe Brad Pitt was 83% as to why I watched this movie in the first place, but it's really not because of his looks, it's because as a man, he does a kick-ass job of being a manly-man! I mean, it'd be great to see him in drag too, but I'm just fine without it! Helena Bonham Carter is another one of my favourites, I had first seen her in Sweeney Todd and I was like &#34;She looks familiar...&#34; and then I remember seeing her in Harry Potter that summer and thought of how good she was there too! (yes I like my occasional crazy B*s every now and then, but who doesn't?) I later watched Hamlet with Mel Gibson and Helena and (yes I still loved her there). So she also had a driving force in me watching this movie. But I love the movie because it is so full of psychological/dark humor/thrilling action/sex and I swear, I almost became a 16 year old boy watching this movie, it teleports you and moulds you and drags you along in a way like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

It achieves all that with a brilliant narrative style and clever dialogues. The plot, seemingly simple, delivers one of the best surprise twists at the end.

The underlying social commentary in this brilliantly written story/movie was truly fascinating and captivating.  I was presented with ideas rarely presented in any artistic genre and shocked that they were in this or any film.  I found a great mix of humor, action, and creativity.  I have since become a great fan of this work and others by the author of the book.  This was an amazing film and the DVD was great because of all of the extra stuff on the second disc.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3A3PTSJWCXZJV	Shane C. Desmond	This vastly under-rated (and misunderstood) film is one of the best films of the 90's.  From the stylish, gritty, flashy direction of David Fincher (Se7en, The Game), to the career-high performances of Oscar nominees Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, to the devilishly conceived story  (very faithfully adapted from the brilliant Chuck Palahniuk novel), this is  a film that should be in absolutely everyone's collection.The most often  misunderstood facet of this film is its intention.  Fight Club does not  glorify violence.  It is not an over-sensationalized piece of propaganda.  It is a scathing, intricately woven social satire.And for DVD collectors  out there - this one is going to be HOT!  The DVD edition has absolutely  everything you're looking for - and even without the added features, this  is a film whose high level of visual and audio accomplishment deserves to  be viewed on DVD.  And the score (composed by the Dust Brothers) is one of  the most unique and effective you will ever hear.A Masterpiece.	5.0	Best Film of 1999 will be the best DVD of 2000.	2000-05-02	1	1	0

Helena Bonham Carter is an odd pick here, she is known for her Merchant Ivory aristocrates, but she knows this character and she owns it.  The twist at the end is of course famous, it will make you want to watch it again..and again.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AS5AOMK89VZMB	Shaun O'Sullivan	David Fincher's explosive movie draws the viewer in as if he's sucking venom from a snake bite. Never before has a film so sucessfully captured the zeitgeist of an era. With it's constantly evolving narrative, Fight Club throws more punches than you can keep up with. A left hook here, a right jab there and before you know it, you're begging for mercy.The real secret to Fight Club's success is the way in which the viewer is so shamelessly manipulated into seeing Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as the everyman hero of the underdog. However, just as you're cheering and applauding Tyler's philosophy on life, you suddenly become aware that the movie has taken a dark turn and perhaps Tyler may be more than a little dangerous. Everyman hero? Or mentally unstable Anarchist. Despite his ruthless honesty and genuine belief that the world can be a better place if we all just learn to let go of the excessive garbage we each carry around, physically, emotionally and spiritually, there comes a point in the movie where Tyler sheds his skin and becomes about as heroic as Timothy McVey (The Oklahoma Bomber). A disturbing thought to imagine anyone ever cheering and applauding his behavior and view of the world!Director David Fincher has created a movie that treats film making as a blood drenched contact sport. Right from the opening scene Fincher grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go for a second. Watching Fight Club is the cinematic equivalent of riding the biggest, scariest rollercoaster 20 times in a row without stopping even once. The dialogue flows like machine gun fire. The editing skips and jumps in perfect synchronicity to the pulses and beats of the techno driven sountrack, and the flawless cinematography and production design combine to create a vision that seems plucked from the dark and twisted imagination of HR Giger. In short Fight Club is work of genius. Watch it... if you think you can take a beating.	5.0	Who do you wanna fight?	2001-02-22	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3N9TGJFS6IQFY	SheLikesDvds.com	"This is a film that was completely mismarketed. This is not a film, as the previews and original teaser suggested, about pure male testosterone being manifested in basement brawls. It is not a mindless-violence, action-hero flick used solely as a vehicle to show the washboard abs and chiseled man-waist of Brad Pitt. It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character. It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society.In this phenomenally directed film, we watch the main character, ""Jack,"" played by an intensely baggy-eyed Edward Norton, stagger through his Starbucks-saturated life as a claims investigator for a major automotive company. Upon returning from a business trip, two major turning points coincide in Jack's life-he meets the charismatic and unfettered soap salesman Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and he returns to his condo to discover that his precisely coordinated IKEA-like furniture and accessories have been incinerated in an explosion. The first appearance of the ""fight club"" after which the movie is named occurs that same night, when Jack calls Tyler for some solace over a beer. As they leave the bar, Tyler challenges Jack with the words ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can."" Thus begins the strange world in which men beat each other up seemingly just for the pleasure of it.Tyler, with Jack always a few steps behind him, builds an underground network of fight clubs, where men come to test their strength and feel alive. This is not a film that exploits violence simply for the entertainment factor. It's a deeply funny, deeply thoughtful film about the roots of violence, and the possible need for violence amongst the displaced men of today's culture. Suckled on advertising and inhabiting the soft life of corporations, how can the past hunters of society not be driven to make violence-or at least something that feels powerful-with their hands? It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi-god in the culture simply because of their gender, and also taps into the hopelessness the younger generation feels at having been raised without our fathers.Helena Bonham Carter is really the only woman in the film, but having a mostly male cast does not hurt this film for an intelligent female audience. So many of its components speak more directly to a generational frustration than any male-female dilemma, and the insights on the current male situation through this film are thought provoking regardless of gender.Rest assured, you'll be able to discuss and debate this movie with your friends for countless hours, and each time you view it, you'll find something new to contribute to the conversation. It does have a Sixth-Sense-esque plot twist that I won't reveal here, in case you agreed with my initial statement that the flick was mismarketed, and therefore never saw it. I'm eternally glad I let myself be argued into seeing what I had already dismissed as a gratuitous smash-fest featuring the less-than-desirable Pitt (I call him ""Pockmark""), as it now holds strong at #2 on my list of favorite movies of all time. David Fincher has created something truly stunning out of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, and the acting performances by all involved are hilarious, dynamic, utterly natural and completely absurd...."	5.0	Not just a guy flick	2002-03-28	1	0	1

The movie was not logical, but it did make me admire the strange story of those silly people: Through fighting, what comes out is not just blood and tears, but all those emotions that you have been hiding, all those things that have made you unable to sleep; By unleashing those forces, the man is reborned, with nothing but that animal instinct that releases the sinful world of its deeds with a sense of a new found justice.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1DZ5E379PY5E4	S. Kite	I realize that this issue has been discussed to death already but it's important to understand something. Civilization is not a natural state for humans. There are those in society who have adapted to appreciate the new  environment and deal with it.There are far more of us who walk around  day-to-day feeling something missing, feeling like it just isn't right.  Fight Club is about that feeling. It's not necessary for everyone to like  this movie. I know many people who don't, and while I feel they miss the  point, it's a perfectly reasonable response. The movie is violent--it uses  the strongest poetic imagery because it is covering an important topic.  This movie strikes a cord for some people, not in a bloodthirsy way, but as  a sort of utopian snapshot. For someone trying to decide to see this movie,  if you think I'm crazy and that there's nothing 'wrong'. That you don't  feel like the whole system is out of place--avoid the movie. It's not for  you. It's for those of us who felt Predator was more than another Arnold  film. It's for those of us who watched Instinct and enjoyed the first part  of the movie, but not the second.Oh and it's not fascist...the neo-nazi  overtones are coincidental to the arrangement of the plot.	5.0	There's more here than you think	2000-02-17	3	3	0

Fight Club was good.The most important ingredient for me in awarding stars to a movie is that it was a realistic film. A believable film. You know, ""Could this happen in real life?"" That's the key for me.I'm not saying that the Fantasy Genre doesn't interest me. It does! Just look at my other reviews here. Look at some of the movies that I've given high marks to. The Descent (2005). Night of the Living Dead (1968 & 1990). Even 1997's Starship Troopers earns high marks. Why? Because the director pulls you in with adult situations where the players all act like adults; they do what you'd expect them to do when faced with their given situations. Or at they do something, while not expected, is not out of the realms of possibility.In Fight Club the acting is good...it even boarders on great. The story is fun. The twists and turns are unexpected and brilliantly executed. The development of the actual Fight Club?...Well...would you expect employees of every establishment and institution to become members? Next level: would every single member that joined to fight in underground Ultimate Fighting matches also seemingly become as interested in becoming terrorists? Of course not. So taketh away from my experience and ability to walk away with an above average experience.Fred Durst may have ""seen the Fight Club about 28 times,"" but I have and will see it just once. I was entertained. It was a good movie with fast moving action. But the reality factor took it back a notch.Fincher's resume is full of ""good"" movies.

But because I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton I went ahead and bought this film. It was nothing like I expected at all.To start off Edward Norton is an unnamed man who has insomnia, to fall asleep he goes to support groups where he meets a man named Bob (played wonderfully by Meat Loaf), going to these support groups helps him sleep and makes him feel better about his life. Everything is going well until a &quot;tourist&quot; to this groups comes in and shatters everything, this girl (played oddly by Helena Bonham Carter) and Edward Norton make a deal so they can share their support groups. All is going well untill Edward Norton meets a man named Tyler (played by Brad Pitt) a soapmaker, on a plane. After getting off of the plane Edward finds his bags gone and goes home to his apartment to find it blown up. The only person he has to turn to is Tyler, the man he met in the plane. After meeting up with Tyler, he stays at his Tyler's house and they start up a group that fights so they can get their tension out...hence... FIGHT CLUB!This movie is very freaky, very funny, very violence, very provocitive, and very good. This movie reminds me of a Stanley Kubrick film. Edward Norton of course, is great as always. The end just freaks you out and leaves your jaw hanging. This is surely one of the most startiling films I've ever seen. It just literally blows you away. I simply couldn't believe it. I've never, and will never probably ever see anything like it. This is going to be a cult film, I'm pretty sure.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2IAORRZUP7J9F	space monkey	"I saw Fight Club in the theaters in '99, not knowing anything about Chuck Palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie.  What I saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one *question* life, consumerism and where we're going as a society.  It was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection (""how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight"", ""if you died right now how would you feel about your life?"", the whole Raymond K. Hessel scene); intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi-layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay.Today, 7 years and several Palahniuk books, Fight Club tee shirts and posters later; after making my Internet banking, credit card, phone, online gaming and ISP logins ""Tyler Durden""; after police found a bunch of high schoolers in another county in my state imitating the movie in a local barn when they were busted after coming home to their parents with bloody noses; after several people have read my email addy and quoted the movie or shot back a quick ""Heyyy.... A FIGHT CLUB FAN!""- the movie remains needless to say, my all-time favorite.  There is very little grey area with people who've seen it (look no further than the rated reviews here)- most either like it or hate it.  If you're a more intellectual ""thinker"" and a little graphic violence and foul language doesn't easily offend you, give it a viewing (or read the novel if you're more bookworm than movie buff).The sign of a good song is that its melody and lyrics stay in your head long after you've finished listening to it.  The sign of a good *movie* is not only that its scenes and classic one-liners from an extremely intelligently-written script replay in your mind because they're just THAT memorable, but that its message is so timely, relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it's still talked about today.  There are message boards on the Net still discussing and debating new talking points about the movie TODAY, 7 years later; there aren't too many other films that have sparked this kind of intelligent, thoughtful and self-exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing.  Some of the more misogynistic scenes (""I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need"") are cast in a new light given Palahniuk's recent coming out of the closet, surprising many fans.On to the DVD itself.  I own many, and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary, Fight Club paraphernelia, a couple hilarious PSA's and a cool music video.  It's considered by many to be one of the most comprehensive DVD's ever produced.  As to negatives: the film has some fairly graphic violence and a great deal of cussing & cursing, the latter of which detracts from a script (IMO).  If you can move past this, get this DVD or at least give it a rent and watch what is destined to be one of the most talked-about classics of all time."	5.0	All-time classic social satire	2006-11-13	4	4	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3OKJUWRA5TIUO	Squid Fizzy	"Now THIS is what the DVD format was made for!""Fight Club"" is possibly the most surprising thing that has ever happened to me.  First of all, it has been completely mismarketed.  While the subplot of two men starting an underground movement where anger and aggression is released through physical conflict IS present in the movie, Fight Club is a much more intricate web of human emotion.  It does not glorify violence, as many may have assumed.  This is a very ugly movie, and yet, it is strangely beautiful.  Director David Fincher is known for making cheerless yet compelling movies, and this is his finest.To reveal too much about the plot is to spoil the fun, which is possibly why all of the trailers for this movie seem to be so misleading.  But in essence it is the story of Jack (to which he is indirectly referred, as his true name is never revealed) and Tyler, two unlikely strangers, who meet one day and realize they are tired of life.  That night, as both are leaving a bar, they drunkenly begin to fight each other because its something neither of them has ever done, and when it is over, they are intrigued by what they have done.  This fighting continues as Tyler and Jack find it is a way for both of them to release their anger and tension without guilt.  The weekly fighting sessions begin to attract more people, and this escalates to the point where the fighting actually begins to become an organized activity.  Of course, the fighting itself is chaotic, but all the members of the club are bound under rules that must be followed.  This continues for a while, but soon, Tyler becomes bored by it all, and uses his faithful followers to orchestrate more complex scenarios.  This eventually leads to an out of control Anarchist movement that extends far beyond the power of Jack, who has become powerless now that Tyler has assumed full control.  Throw in a suicidal girlfriend, Meat Loaf, a twist ending, a barrage of innovative visual directing techniques, and the Pixies, and you have yourself one killer movie, without a doubt the best film of 2001.And that's not even the HALF of it (pun intended for those who have seen this film).I would be lying if I said that Fight Club is likely to be enjoyed by all who see it.  And not to be sexist ladies, but I think Fight Club may be targeted more towards the guys (this is not to say the feminine populace will not like the movie, only that their is a higher level of testosterone present than there is estrogen).However, even if you see the movie and dislike it, the two-disk special edition version of ""Fight Club"" is possibly the best overall release to come from Fox EVER.  The widescreen anamorphic transfer is flawless, the 5.1 surround is exceptional, and the features are...extensive.  Begin with FOUR full length audio commentaries (I only listened to the last one so far, but it was highly entertaining), a seemingly endless supply of featurettes, a few deleted scenes, a barrage of great storyboards, and end with some cast and crew bios and trailers for good measure. On a more comedic note, there's also some hilarious publicity material, and an outtakes reel.  That's a pretty deluxe package, and I can't see any reason to not own this DVD.  Don't bother renting it, it you've read this far, your going to want to own it!This isn't just a movie, it's an experience. Highly recommended."	5.0	Make way for Fight Club	2003-01-01	12	10	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3DY46ZABF4CMQ	"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer"""	From the opening credits, that take place as you are zooming out of a garbage bin, to the very final blast of the movie, you are hypnotized into the world of its lead Edward Norton who flawlessly plays the down, dull, depressed and lonely insomniac. His disoriented thoughts leads you through a trail of helpless explorations in the world of dark dumbing depression. People with insomnia are bound to find bliss watching Norton carry out his hallucinative journey. He begins attending sessions for terminally diseased patients speaking out. One day, he meets this very well dressed, well spoken, and handsome man named Tyler Durden. He sells soap for a living. The two hit it off and literally hit it off every night in the streets. Other dysfunctionally miserable men of society join in and the two form an underground cult they call fight club.Okay, I'm not going to get into details as to what happens next...but the story's got so much hidden secrets. The movie will end leaving you in complete awe and you'd want to watch it again!The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed. And the stylish directing of David Fincher, the genius behind Se7en, brings back the noir-ish grizzly theme of his previous and present films back to your own viewing pleasure.This movie is highly recommended.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2UW83R0JOZZ6	S. Schell	This is a definetely a movie for men. It is 100% pure testosterone, blending unmerciful and horrific violence with nihilistic conviction. It is also a sardonic look at the American society and the mechanical agendas we  keep day in and day out, working towards our ultimate goal which is the  immortal sin: materialism. Fight Club not only scoffs at our civilization,  but it forces us to envision a totalitarian society in which we live only  for self-destruction and elimination of order. Pure anarchy and  unadulterated rage. What could be more fun?Even though I'm a woman and  this film literally slanders the female counterpart, I was able to look  past that to see that the story does make a significant and amusing point  in all its glorified madness.&quot;The things you own end up owning  you&quot; is a pitiful but inevitable statement made by the prime minister  of chaos himself, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). He explains in so many words  throughout the scattered scenes that we are but mindless consumers drowning  in the money-minded occupancy of our twisted souls, and that in truth we  are nothing more than living, breathing shells all bound by the same  animalistic natures. Soon after the foundation of Fight Club is created, a  nationwide following ensues and Tyler's steadfast minions devise a plan to  annihilate all major credit card companies and all records pertaining,  setting the world's infinite circle of debt back to zero.Following two  steps behind is a soft-spoken victim of society, nameless and  impressionable. He appears to be Tyler's right-hand man and develops his  killer instinct for rebellion and rage. You soon learn that this  &quot;Jack&quot; is the one behind it all, Tyler Durden the resulting  fabrication of his sudden and inexplicable epiphany.The camera work is  creative, flashy and strewn all over the place, the story moving with the  emotional adrenalin of its characters. This could be classified as an  action flick, but it doesn't contain even half the eye-candy car  crash/fire/explosion exhibitions that normal action movies are saturated  in. Fight Club packs the punch with its corrupt ideals and frenzied  motivation, making it a unique classification for the action genre.None  other than David Fincher could have done the movie justice with its dark,  surrealistic mood and spectacular performances from its leading men. He  seems to get the best out of Brad Pitt, whom I, for quite some time,  considered a very mediocre actor and at best just another pretty face.  Edward Norton barely needs guidance here, the perfect picture of the  unassuming and compliant citizen turned masochistic and vengeful mutineer.  As for Helena Bonham Carter, she's an endearing attachment, but more than  anything she's a fifth wheel. The movie could've been done without her and  not much would've changed except for the exaggerated sex scenes, which were  mostly added for humor anyway.If you're looking for a movie that has an  acerbic approach and a wild streak like you've never seen, a movie that  makes you question the way you live and how you think, then head in the  direction of Chuck Palaniuhk's convulted tale. Your hopes will more than be  met.	4.0	Fascist Chauvinism At Its Most Amusing	2000-06-27	8	4	4

NOTHING is more visually striking, involving and fast-paced.  It may be 139 minutes,  but it has so much to say, that it goes by quickly.  It has ideas and talks  about them.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A15CHA93SCKL34	Stephen Gunn	"It is seldom that a movie comes along that leaves such an impact. This is why I believe that ""Fight Club"" is one of the best movies ever. It is a movie that lays out some philisophical ideas about life, yet the audience doesn't have to believe in them in order to see what the writer and director are trying to say. But the movie isn't just that. The story is layered, and all elements to the story hold significance. The character named Marla (unlike in most movies) is not a love interest that is only used to increase running time nor to add spice. Marla plays a much bigger part in the story than even Marla (and the audience) knows. At the beginning of the movie Edward Norton says, ""thats when I realized, the bomb, the gun, the revolution, had something to do with a woman named Marla Singer"". Most audience members forget these lines the first time around, that's why audience members may think that its all about Tyler Durtent's philosophy. Tyler Durdent's philosophy is unique, truthfull, but flawed at times. The movie takes note of this when Edward (""Jack"") is caught as the only guy with common sence. So you can't say it's a movie that pushes a belief. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions and begs to be viewed many times. Audience members may draw their own conclusion on ""Fight Club"". Yet in the end one thing is certain, all ""Jack"" wants is Marla, and that has nothing to do with Tyler. Ebert thought this movie was ""silly"", Berardenelli called it a modern day ""Clockwork Orange"". Not everyone will understand, but the ones that do will love this movie."	5.0	Mischief. Mayhem.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ACXQKQ2U86QLE	Stephen	Fight Club is one of the most important movies ever made. Film-making wise, it is brilliant: Sharp slick camera work, well controlled computer effects, an original plot and most importantly, beautiful performances from a perfect cast. Life-wise, the movie touched on the very basis of modern human existence. We do not need this movie to tell us that humans are a pile of crap. For every micro-chip that we make work faster, we shoot another point up in the moron meter. Those who bash this film for it's violence doesn't see that the fighting was therapy for these guys, the same as those ridiculous groups were for Norton's character in the beginning. Those who bash the film for Tyler's project mayhem missed the point that his idea did not work out. One of the main themes that evolved during the film was that cults do not work, the space monkeys became morons. Tyler became a Hitler. Fight club was a beautiful dream that was filled with so much promise,but it went wrong and the ending showed it's result. At the end of the day, the one word used to coin this film would be controversial. Anything that causes such applause and condemnation is glorious in my opinion.	5.0	A Slap in the Face, you little girl	2001-09-19	22	11	11

The technical achievements are first-rate (imaginative use of cgi to illustrate the contents of a trash can seemed highly appropriate for the themes explored in this story!)  The action sequences are exciting and cringe-inducing at the same time.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Fight Club (1999)Drama, 139 minutesDirected by David FincherStarring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham CarterWhy do I like Fight Club? It seems to suggest that violence and anarchy are good things, but that's certainly not something I believe. I think it comes down to the dark comedy and the strong script, coupled with excellent performances from Norton and Pitt. This is a cool world to experience, but I wouldn't want to live in it.The story seems perfectly traditional at first. We see Norton on a plane. He's referred to as The Narrator in the credits and seems to think of himself as Jack. He encounters Tyler Durden (Pitt) and takes his business card. Jack returns home to find that there's been an explosion in his apartment, so he calls Durden and eventually asks to stay at his house for a while. Durden is a cheerful, carefree lunatic who wants Jack to punch him. The two fight on the street and decide to recruit members and form Fight Club, believing that it's an expression of freedom.Jack spends his free time visiting support groups. We see him hugging people with testicular cancer and all manner of diseases. He enjoys letting his inhibitions go and listening to the members speak about their illnesses. After a while, he becomes aware of Marla (Helena Bonham Carter). Like him, she's a tourist visiting the various support groups. He confronts her and they agree to attend different classes.Durden encourages Jack to stop trying to live up to the expectations of other people. As a result, Jack becomes more assertive. He challenges the authority of his boss and stops worrying about his appearance and the latest IKEA catalog. He regularly shows up for work with fresh cuts and bruises. Jack finds that he enjoys his new image. One thing he doesn't like is Durden forming a relationship with Marla.Fight Club is set in a gritty world and makes the viewer feel unclean while watching it. Fincher is good at creating unsettling worlds and this one is similar to those found in The Game and Se7en. Durden's house appears derelict and the neighborhood is seedy. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Durden has a purpose for starting Fight Club. The recruits are assigned tasks to disrupt society and members can come from any occupational background. It's like a secret society.Fight Club contains a major twist and I won't reveal it for those who haven't ever seen the movie. The twist elevates the movie to a different level. Subsequent viewings are enhanced because you'll notice little details you may have missed the first time. It's clever how everything ties together. The ending annoys some viewers, but it works perfectly for me. The final sequence is set to one of my favorite Pixies' songs and is probably my favorite scene in the entire movie.Although it's not an action movie, Fight Club is a pure adrenaline rush. From the opening credits set to the pounding beat of the Dust Brothers, it rarely lets up until the relative calm of the closing scene.I'm enjoying this project and got more out of Fight Club on yesterday's viewing than I ever have before. Just don't go out and copy the behavior it depicts.	5.0	Sorry, but I have to break rule No. 1	2012-02-29	2	1	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3B7D01DZTF2H8	"Steven G. Milam ""ZurichIs5tained"""	"Above all things, it must be said that Fight Club is a very fun movie.  It will probably be noted as an important cult film in the future, although I have to disagree with anyone who is predicting ""classic"" status.  Director David Fincher has given us an effective thrill ride, to the point where approximately no one will care that the material could have risen to much greater heights.  He has sacrificed the potentially fascinating nature of this story to the gods of MTV-generation sex-crazed macho teenagers.  If VH1 had broadened their parameters for their Top 100 Music Videos feature only slightly, it could have been the most notable Top-10 list that this cult fad would ever see.Unfortunately, as it stands, Fight Club is not a very good movie.  Viewers far too hormonal to be bothered with the paltry development of thematic elements and weakness of characterization were quick to jump on their handy buzzwords for movies that they like - ""cinematography"", ""editing"", or even ""directing"", all of which are very easy to confuse with a movie looking cool and moving quickly.  Nobody seemed to mind that all three of those artistic elements are tools of filmmaking which, by definition, cannot be successful on their own.  All of the exuberant camera work and tricky shots that Fincher pulled off, while entertaining, do not amount to good directing because they are essentially meant to hide the film's material, not strengthen it.  The film's cuts are moving so quickly and with such a breathless gusto that Tyler Durden's catchy quotes sound prophetic and brilliant, simply because our minds do not have the time to process them.  It takes multiple viewings to realize how clich&eacute; and nave Durden's wisdom actually is.  Nuggets like ""You're not your ****in' khakis"" and ""Our Great Depression is our lives"" may be penciled across thousands of high school bathroom stalls, but the overbearing cynicism comes up empty when applied to real life.The real problem with the film is that it blatantly supplements the fantasy of thousands of bored faux-Gen-X'ers; the fantasy that your life is a lot more empty and depressing than it is.  It delivers this message in the only language that these people understand: overwrought cinematography and sound bites.  Its proposed escape from this invented world of hollowness is (what else?) violence.  But the movie is not concerned with the psychology or the implications of violence nearly as much as it is with the visuals.  When the movie is over, those who were unfazed by the final act's messy attempt at mind-screwery are so amped up by grandiose visions of bloodied faces and swinging fists that they barely care to figure out the movie's convoluted philosophy.  Which is for the better, given that the concept isn't all that fundamentally interesting to begin with.A masterpiece adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel would have been a simultaneous ironic endorsement and searing indictment of the characters' ideals - it could have been the most scathing commentary about our fictionally alienated generation yet put to film.  Instead, the film operates as a triumphant rallying cry to its own specific audience, without leaving much of interest for those who are either outside the age/gender range or never had enough unfocused angst to feel the way that these characters do.  The best way to treat this movie is to let the MTV-bred fanboys have their fun and just let it go - they may never realize it's a poor movie, but since life is apparently so much meaningless trash, who cares anyway?"	2.0	A mindless amphetamine rush of severely flawed filmmaking	2005-06-25	40	18	22
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A35C9LTFSL274I	Steven Grogan	Okay, I was 15 years old when NEVERMIND hit record stores, and like it or not that makes me a Nirvana kid (although I always found the Smashing Pumpkins more interesting, exhilarating, and musically talented but anyway). The sad thing is, the poor sap labelled spokesmodel for my generation killed himself...so what does that say about us? And as if that blow doesn't still sting, we have a movie like FIGHT CLUB...a movie that I admire (even though it pisses me off) because, like Tyler Durden, it speaks the truth. &quot;We are the middle children of history...no purpose.&quot; I am not sure if that is exactly how the quote goes, but you get the point...&quot;We have no great war, no great depression. Our war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives.&quot; How true. I have wandered throughout my teenage years feeling I had no purpose, nothing to struggle for. I thought it was just adolescence, but I still feel that way at 24. What are we doing in this life? Okay, the stock market crashes every few years. Murder and other violent crimes are on the rise. The federal government has pretty much waved the white flag on the war against drugs...but do I care? Not when I am bombarded by DVD ads, Playstation 2, weight loss programs, ab machines...superficial things. America's soul has died but we are trying to save our bodies (to paraphrase George Carlin), and it just doesn't work that way (the &quot;spiritual war&quot; of which Tyler speaks). And with the increase in multiple technologies we have everything at our fingertips these days...nothing to struggle for. I believe many of the violent crimes out there are indeed happening for the same reason Fight Club was created: there is no battle in our lives, and we actually have to go out of our way to CAUSE ourselves struggle. Violence for the sake of feeling like life has a challenge. Raised with the wool over our eyes by a society that would have us believe owning a yin yang coffee table makes you one step closer to perfection...and how are we to handle the truth once we finally find it? We can either bend over and take it as we have all our lives, we can take Tyler's solution of Project Mayhem, or we can strive to find some  middle ground.  Finding that happy medium is a difficult task, but it is one we should all take up, instead of resorting to madness that lies on the opposite extreme and thus bringing more chaos into our already-uncertain lives.	5.0	Forgive the expression &quot;Generation X&quot; movie	2001-01-24	3	1	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A27IRTZMV0LW45	Steve Sensoli	Fight Club is a excellent movie, with great acting, great effects and most important of all, a great story. Fincher shows how great movies are made. This is Finchers best movie by far and is very UNDERATED! People who don't get the story automatically say its a stupid depressing movie. To tell you the truth, I didn't get it to much when I first saw it, but then I saw it again and again and again. Its one of those movies that doesn't get old after you watch 10 times! It also shows the talent in Norton and Pitt. Its Edward Nortons 2nd best performance(American History X being 1st). I think that Everyone should see this movie more than once to actually get the story! Also, the dvd is EXCELLENT and has great sound, picture and extras!

This is like no other movie you have seen, and it really takes a different look at things in life.If you have ever watched the matrix, this would be about its equilivant in mind blowing. After the movie there is that chat of what really happened, and understanding it is what the fun part is.To watch this movie, you need to listen carefully. Words and sayings used in this movie are very clever and complex, but very intresting and fun. If you are looking for a movie to mess with the mind, but still entertain you and a few of your guests, this is the movie to choose. The ideas and thoughts put behind this movie keeps it very intresting to watch. If you have the time, watch the commentary, it will help it make more sense.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A8QCB68UL50NX	Subterranean	"""Fight Club"" has many naysayers.  They call it plotless, they call it pointless, some even call it fascist.  They complain about the amazing amount of graphic violence, the plot's twists, and the film's lack of intelligence.These people need to take a deep breath, count to three, and watch the movie over again.  If they still can find nothing to like, they need to have their head checked.""Fight Club"" is one of the best films I've ever seen.  Beyond it being one of the finest novel-to-screen adaptations ever, it is simply an astounding film.  Everything about it is designed to shock the viewer out of complacency: the subliminals, the fantasy cutaways, even the brutal violence are really just punctuation marks, underscoring the movie's actual statements.  Beneath the action movie facade, ""Fight Club"" is really an intellectual film.""Fight Club"" is about the modern American male, and the state of permanent angst and adolescence they've been forced into by a society which raises them without fathers, force-feeding them dead-end jobs, consumerist garbage and idiotic ""everyone-is-special-in-their-own-way"" psychology.  What's interesting is that the film not only provides a counter-argument, but an argument against its own argument.  It suggests a parallel extreme, wherein we would be forced back into another Dark Age, would be wrong as well.The narrator in ""Fight Club"", who is nameless throughout the film, seeks to escape from the urban nightmare his life has become, as it causes him terrible insomnia.  First, he tries attending support groups for people with lethal illnesses, despite his lack of any.  This helps him to confront death and despair in a tangible way, and appreciate the fact that he's alive, curing his insomnia.  That is, until he meets Marla Singer, a fellow faker who makes him unable to find the release he so desperately needs.  Marla and the Narrator manage to come to an agreement about who can attend which group, but the damage has been done.A little later, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man who is the polar opposite of him.  Tyler lives on the edge, making soap, being a waiter at fancy buffets (where he does various obscene things to the food), and changing reels at the movie theater (where he splices frames of dirty movies into kiddie pics).  Something about Tyler is magnetic to the Narrator, and through a series of events the two come to live together, and create the eponymous Fight Clubs.To tell anymore would spoil the movie's many delights; it's subversive, funny, thought-provoking, thrilling and consistantly entertaining.  Fincher's direction takes major risks and constantly manages to succeed, and the thought that's been put into every frame is evident.  The cinematography is excellent, the Dust Brothers music hip and appropriate, the writing stylized and snappy, capturing the novel's tone without being overly derivative.  ""Fight Club"" is a masterpiece, the best Hollywood film in a very long time.  Enter with an open mind, and you'll come out singing its praises."	5.0	An Excellent, And Unfortunately Misunderstood Film	2005-08-10	11	8	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AW9E6WAUADBH9	sundancekid_22	"One part scathing social commentary, one part intro to abnormal psychology and throughout a work of genius, ""Fight Club"" is a must-see for anyone who is, ever has been, or is acquainted with a disaffected youth. Why do people who have everything seemingly hate everything and everyone?What is ""Fight Club""? Think Holden Caulfied on crystal meth... one hell of a mind trip, but just as thought-provoking. Why is everyone so mad? Why do young men want to beat and be beaten? What is the source of our self-destructive impulses?The psychological turmoil that lies beneath the thin veneer of civilization covering most men is explored in this film. ""Fight Club"" is about the two sides of human nature: reason and animal violence. Or reason vs. animal violence? Why do we value material possessions, ""Fight Club"" asks us. ""Why do I know what a duvet is? Its just a blanket,"" said Brad Pitt's character. And so we are asked to confront our acquisitiveness, acquisitiveness being the clearest sign of our phoniness. ""Fight Club"" is about the split that occurs in each of us when faced with the choice-- to be driven by your heart, and inner compass or to be herded along with the rest of the sheep? In many ways ""Fight Club"" was the light at the end of a tunnel for many disaffected post-adoloescent, post-collegiate professionals who were sick of the herd mentality that suffused their environment. It made them know their dissatisfaction was not unique. That is why the phrase ""I am Jack's Smirking Revenge"" became almost a mantra. I don't want to be one of the sheep and be herded along to the slaughter. ""Fight Club"" hones into this feeling and the fears that produce it, as a result the film, while geared towards a cult audience is a modern classic.I give the ""Fight Club"" DVD five stars for being an accurate interpretation and distillation of Chuck Pahlaniuk's novel. In many ways the film is more effective than the novel. The casting choices, set design and cinematography were all stellar and the DVD comes with great extra features."	5.0	I am Jack's Smirking Revenge...	2003-06-03	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3OPVL13MYGPEJ	"""superchikin"""	A lot of people don't like Fincher's films because he refuses to compromise the inherently difficult nature of the scripts he directs. Fight Club is weirdly the first time that he bottled out, and so despite the  daring of the first half of the movie, it unravels into a confused  mess.The story of The Narrator in the film's first act is hugely  compelling, an involving and eye-popping introduction into a properly  original film world. It's a total mind's-eye point of view - the leaps in  time and space are dazzling and allow for the creation of an unsettling and  vaguley surreal comic-book atmosphere. Someone accused Fincher's bold  visual style of being &quot;bleak chic&quot;, but the jumpy and neon-bathed  images underpin the gradual unraveling of the protagonist's identity in a  unique way. There is so much visual information, in fact, that it is  impossible to take it all in. And then the fights start.It's not always  useful to compare a film to its source material, but in this case it is.  The novel he made this film from is stuffed with ideas and is structured  around a dizzy pin-ball point of view. The filmmakers, in finding a  solution to translating visually what seems an unfilmable book, thus had  the potential to construct a grenade out of laser-cut diamonds. But they  sold out, maybe inevitably, by turning it into a chase film. I read that  Fincher said that at the end of the book it was a disappointment that the  buildings didn't blow up; instead, the Narrator ends up in a mental home  with the Space Monkeys waiting for him in the background. It's disquieting,  and a true psychological portrait of the protagonist in his delerium; and  Fincher didn't see it? He blew everything up instead, and you find yourself  thinking, is this a different film? The ruthless exposition of the  Narrator's psychology from the first half goes to pot. Ach.This is a  confused film that didn't have the courage of its convictions. Anything  you've read about &quot;fascism&quot; or &quot;sadism&quot; or  &quot;glorifaction of masculine rage&quot; says nothing about the movie;  those are confused rants by critics who want to understand the film as some  weird spontaneous product of ideology, which it isn't. If anything, it  tries to unveil mainstream AMERICAN late capitalism as the ideology it  really is. Thus, people got angry and threw epithets at it to hide their  own nakedness. Cowards!See the film anyway, because the technical  achievement of the film is enourmous; the storytelling is superb; and  there's really been no other film out there quite like this for a while.	4.0	Visionary or goat?	2000-02-29	0	0	0

For taking us off the repeditive path of human existance and giving us another view of our  monotony.  We sell ourselves every day to images, attitudes, and worst of  all our posessions.  This movie is incredible from opening to credits.  The  one last thing I must include is that every time I have been to the theater  to see Fight Club, the hipocritical audiance has laughed and very obviously  loved the honest humor in the begining of the film.(especially the fight  with the priest)  However as soon as the movie reaches climax the brutal  truth behind the movie is revealed and it leaves the audiance naked and not  laughing.  The simple realization that this movie is making fun of everone  in the audiance. This is pure Genius.  This movie might not be considered  at the Oscars, but not because it is bad.  It is because we all know how  much truth it holds and that particular academy is too fake to give credit  where it is due.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE..with an open mind.  It is not about  fighing like the commercials and half brained humas think.  Look deeper and  see the self realization we all need.  STOP buying brand label clothes and  expensive furiture.  Make a list of everything you have ever wanted to do  and everything you are scared to death of and do everything on both lists.  Once you truely understand fear, you will never fear anything again.  Everything you love dies.  Dealing with death is the core to all our  doughts, self hate, lonliness.  Live life how you want.  Just do it for  you!

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1T97UX78CZXS8	S. Voss	I thought It was a great movie probably the best of 1999. The anti-materialist message came at just the right time. I think though the reviewers mistunderstand the characters politics. Jerry Browns review  completely misunderstands the nature of Project Mayhem element.Just  because an organization is paramilitary does NOT make it fascist. Despite  claimed reviews of the so-called &quot;fascist&quot; nature of Project  Mayhem, youll notice there are no ranks in project mayhem. There is no  glorification of a state which is a key required element of fascism,in fact  Project Mayhem is against the state and corporate power. Tyler Durden  explicitly seeks the absence of a state(whether this is different in the  novel I dont know, and it doesnt really matter). The Project Mayhem group  in this film may be considered &quot;Paramilitary Anarchists&quot; but  certainly not fascists.About the violence...there is FAR less violence  in &quot;Fight Club&quot; than in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Silence  of the Lambs&quot; both of which got oscar attention. Only 1 person died in  this film and it wasnt the fight club who killed him.The main difference  between these films is that Fight Club didnt show the fighting in a  negative light, its message is politically incorrect. The reason  conventional Hollywood hates it so much is that it attacks the values  Hollywood espouses and doesnt apologize for men beating the crap out of  each other as a catharsis.	5.0	A Great Misunderstood Movie!	2000-05-11	14	11	3

Unfortunately, the majority of opinions vocalized for &quot;Fight Club&quot; have completely misinterpreted David Fincher's and Chuck Palahniuk's message. This is not a pro-fascist, a pro-violent or a pro-nihilist film whatsoever. Toss whatever you heard from Rosie O'Donnell out the window. What Fincher has crafted here is a brilliant and witty contemporary masterpiece using stunning visuals and hilarious irony. However, be warned: this is no humble &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; and it's far darker than &quot;American Beauty&quot;, nonetheless Fincher always includes a dose of comic relief from the film's darkest moments.If your are used to typical, uninspired, formulaic, Hollywood films, the method in which &quot;Fight Club&quot;'s message is delivered may disturb you. However, by the end of &quot;Fight Club&quot;, I guarantee you will be convinced of the directorial talent of David Fincher and the outstanding, acting, ability of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.A note for those of you purchasing the DVD. Without question, it is definitely worth it.

Two, you're one of those overly cynicall people who pretend to be superior by hating what a lot of people like for a good reason. Because to you anything with violence or anything slightly off the norm is shallow and trying to be hip. or three, you just didn't get it, oh well, you'll always have American Pie to entertain your feeble mind. The bottom line is that this movie has a lot to say about every aspect of life, spirituality, politics (and not &quot;what should we do with HMO's?&quot; politics, we're talking real political theory here), identity, individuality, relationships, and more are all covered in this masterpiece. you can write it off as tragically hip or overly violent any day, but the truth is you found this movie hard to swallow in one gulp.	5.0	Possibly the most important movie of our generation	2000-10-24	5	4	1

You can say all you want about the likeability of the characters.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3DT3LOBEI9FU0	"T. Engle ""trengle"""	I am surprised by the number of reviews here that seem to take this movie seriously.  While watching, I continually wondered if the director was attempting to be profound or ironic.  This movie is not deep, or disturbing, or thought-provoking.  It is, in fact, totally ridiculous.  As far as &quot;making a statement,&quot; I give it no stars, but for entertainment value, it's a five-star treat.  When Jennifer Aniston hosted SNL, she and the female cast members did a satire of &quot;Fight Club&quot; that was exactly like the original movie.  Every time I see it (three so far) I am equally amazed and amused.  It's really over the top.  Oh, and Brad Pitt shows mucho skin.	3.0	Hilarious, the epitome of &quot;so bad it's good.&quot;	2001-08-01	5	2	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1YMEGXGTB3W6Z	Terri	"My husband got this movie for us to watch shortly after it came out on DVD.  I did not want to watch it because I thought it would just be a bunch of violence.  However, I watched it anyway because I figured I'd give it a chance and I'd still be spending time with the hubby.  By the end of the movie, I was in tears.  To this day, my husband still makes fun of me for crying at a movie that's not supposed to be a tear-jerker.  But, I was so knocked off my feet by it.  The next week, I checked the book out of the library and read it, too.  If you have any brain cells at all, it's easy to look past the violence and fighting and read between the lines.  The commentary it makes about modern society is powerful and real.  All the visual effects, sound, etc. of the movie are awesome as well.  This is one of my favorite movies, and I'm a ""chick.""  It's not one to watch if you're in the mood for something light-hearted, though.  Save it for when you're in a more philosophical state of mind."	5.0	This movie is incredible	2006-03-04	12	9	3
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3JLKDUV0B6O5U	TFR	"If you were a guy, you hated ""Girl Interrupted"".  ""Fight Club"" is the male equivalent of ""Girl Interrupted"":  Both films were based on a novel by a popular writer, and both are films most members of the opposite sex seem to really hate.I don't know anything about Chuck Palahniuk or his novels, but after seeing ""Fight Club"", I would say that he was very successful in communicating to his target audience the idea that he had something to say.  Now, it's my turn.To be blunt, I thought that everything about ""Fight Club"" was predictable.  However, a film with a cult following this big has to be taken seriously.On the surface, ""Fight Club"" is about what happens to the male psyche when things break down.  That's the synopsis, which gradually proceeds to a plot twist about  of the way into the film.On another level, ""Fight Club"" is only going to appeal to males who are attempting to establish an identity for themselves.  That's the underlying theme. Not that many guys over the age of thirty are going to be able to relate to this stuff.  This film is strictly for the ""X box"" generation.It used to be worth it to want acceptance from your peers.  Now, it's seen as a sign of weakness. At the beginning of ""Fight Club"", the Edward Norton character hangs out in 12 Step groups and cancer survivor groups in an attempt to be noticed.  (Dude! I can relate!) Eventually, the Edward Norton character gravitates towards self-actualization, culminating in ultrareality, or proximity thereof.At almost two and a half hours, ""Fight Club"" was way too long.  It should have been abbreviated to about an hour and a half. Also, it would actually have made more sense to truncate and manipulate the sequence of scenes (i.e., show the ending near the middle of the film, the beginning at the end, etc.), much like ""Pulp Fiction"".I was also disappointed in the story's deadpan ending and was half expecting a more bizarre twist:  Either Chuck Norris or Gina Gershon appearing in an onscreen cameo to announce, ""It blowed up real good.""John Hinkley thought that by killing Ronald Reagan, he would eventually be able to fall in love and achieve orgasm with Jodi Foster.  At one time, I never would have been able to believe that ""Taxi Driver"" would inspired anyone to blow their nose.  Or that ""The Basketball Diaries"" would be the inspiration for a massacre in Colorado.  Hey, it's supposed to be entertainment, right?I don't know about ""Fight Club"" the novel, but I would imagine that probably a half-dozen (at least) new John Hinkleys and Timothy McVeighs are - right now, as you read this - being inspired by this film.  Which is ironic because it would appear to me that the only inspiration anyone had in the conception of ""Fight Club"" (the novel and film) was to get a decent paycheck by pandering to the readership of ""MAXIM"" magazine.In 1999, when this film was released, the white, male, under 25 target audience for this film understood that ""Fight Club"" was a guy film from beginning to end, not a dinner and a date movie. It was sort of a male religious experience.  At that point in time, the war in Iraq and 9/11 was still a glint in someone's eye.  Then, after 9/11, this film became less relevant.Groucho Marx once said, ""I'll never watch a film where the man's t*ts are bigger that the woman's.""  Now that's advice worth taking.I rate ""Fight Club"" an A+ for effort, but a B- for content."	4.0	A Predictable B- flick...	2008-07-20	4	1	3

The problem with reveiwing this film is it appeals to you on many levels. To strip away the veneer.  Bored insomniac meets wild charismatic salesman.  Neither have been in a fight before so they fight.  It gives them both a high they have never experienced.  Soon others are involved and it spirals out of control. The film then becomes more deep as it explores the fears and thoughts and indeed the personas of the main characters.  Many people have blasted the film for it's violence, but more people are wasted in the first few frames of your average Arnie or Bruce flick.  It's funny, but not a comedy, it's unsettling but not scary.  However when you have watched it two things will happen. You will want to watch it again and you will want to talk about it to someone irrespective of whether you think it is clever or peurile.

Beyond the film itself the 2 Disc set has 3 commentaries and several special features.The film is a strange buddy/action/comedy-drama.  The film's stars are Brad Pitt and Edward Norton who come together, they are both disenchanted with society and decide to vent their frustrations by beating eachother up.  Soon this catches on with other people and they soon form a &quot;fight club&quot; where men who are really unhappy grown boys get a chance to let the world know how unfair the world has been to them.The performances by Pitt and Norton are Oscar worthy as is the film itself.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1WPYY2XLOKAT8	The Completist	"Instead of trying to inflate my self-importance by pretending to be an amateur movie critic and arguing the good/bad aspects of FIGHT CLUB, I'm going to review the actual BLU-RAY DISC for the people who may want to buy it.  I will say this: I didn't like this movie at first because I didn't know it was supposed to be satire, and I didn't know what to look for; watching it on DVD changed my mind.  There.DON'T THROW OUT YOUR 2-DISC DVD JUST YET.  Except for HOT FUZZ and SERENITY, I've never seen a perfect DVD-Blu-ray conversion, and this is why FIGHT CLUB only gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Most of the important production materials from the 2-Disc Special Edition are here (titles, location footage, deleted scenes, etc.) but some of the footage from the DVD didn't make it (like the BTS fight choreography training); the fact that this has been replaced by a perfunctory Spike TV awards show clip (probably chosen because it was in HD) isn't much consolation.  There's also no retrospective documentary, which a film like this probably deserves.The special features menus is a little hard to navigate because there's no color highlighting on the titles, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be okay.  Probably the most irritating thing is the chapter selection only offers one chapter at a time instead of a full screen of choices.The film transfer itself is pretty sweet: the grain from the film stock is visible (very nice), but it tends to clash slightly with the compression leaving the grain looking a little bit ""sparky"" but not enough to be distracting (I noticed because I was deliberately scrutinizing the image, not casually watching it).  There does seem to be some inconsistency in the blacks from shot to shot, and you can also see some pixellation in said blacks at certain times.  Again, keep in mind I was LOOKING for this stuff, it didn't just jump out at me; although you might notice it a little more if your TV is about 46"" or more.But all this only takes 1 star off the review; nothing omitted was terribly important and the transfer is pretty great.  The movie itself looks as new as the day it was made and it thankfully hasn't been altered from its original aspect ratio for 16:9 TVs.  I think the $15.99 price tag on it currently makes up for any flaws."	3.0	Excellent Blu-Ray....Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut...	2009-11-18	21	17	4

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A140VX27RA19KT	"""thegame222"""	This movie has an awesome premise and simply has a very surreal and eerie atmosphere to it. Its the story of a man who is ruled by his own posestions and must have everything perfect. He attends meetings every night so he has somewhere to go. He eventually meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt (who I might add does an awesome job of portraying this strange character). They create the &quot;Fight Club&quot; where people join and fight bare fisted for fun, not to the death. The Fight Club gets out out of hand and the world starts crashing down around the main character played by Edward Norton. The final twist is gonna make you simply drop your jaw and stare at the screen, then after the movie back in the box youll sit there for about 20 minutes thinking &quot;How was that possible....&quot; or &quot;He was there but who was the other guy then...&quot; Itll boggle your mind.

This is by far Fincher's best work, ever better than seven, which was also a great film. Brad Pitt, who I  despise, was really great as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter was  totally cool as Marla. Edward Norton, who made the poor &quot;American  History X&quot; film, truly redeems himself in a fantastic starring role.  The film also boasts a PHENOMENAL soundtrack by The Dust Brothers, and I  highly recommend that you pick it up if you liked the film. As for the  movie, it was quite entertaing, and not at all what i had expected. I was  surprised that there were very little fights. The plot truly carries the  movie, not the brief, and bloody fights. I think that fans of the movies  &quot;Roadhouse&quot;, and &quot;Lionheart&quot; will enjoy this, but be  aware that this film is ten times more complicated than those two put  together.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ANYAO2HIXD43D	Theodore C Nicholas	Fight Club, directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game), is a visually stunning film with an incredible beginning and a wonderful cast. Too bad the film went downhill. Based on an insanse book by a writer who never believed in paragraphs, the movie is filled with darkness, chaos, and mayhem. Edward Norton plays an unidentified narrator, who has an equally anonymous life. It's so anonymous that even he doesn't know what his life consists of. He meets a manic-depressive named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), the greatest character of the film, who graces the screen in dollar dresses that were once worn at funerals and weddings. Then, our hero meets Tyler Durden, and the film makes a huge mistake. Tyler encompasses everything that one should not aspire to be. He's a terrorist/philosopher/maniac/megalomaniac who preaches to the X-generation, making soap and bombs and telling everyone that they are worthless and meaningless. Fincher shouldn't have taken this route, it's teenaged, unbelievable, and uninteresting. And it's a shame too. The beginning so is amazing, that if Tyler Durden were not in the film, this could have been an incredible film.Anyway, Durden, played by Brad Pitt, convinces insecure men that they can find a zen like state by beating each other up. The idea is funny, but the reality isn't, and the film devotes an hour to this concept. Then, things get worse... as does the film. Just watch the first twenty minutes, then turn it off. Or skip through the film and watch the scenes with Marla.	2.0	Whiny Man, No Sanity	2000-06-05	10	2	8

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A19Y4W9RZDRNF4	Theo Logos	It is no surprise that so many reviewers have gushed with superlatives about this movie being the greatest ever made, etc. Director David Fincher uses boldly creative filming techniques that produce an innovative, flashy movie that has the adrenaline rush of skydiving on speed. Add to that the movie's grab-bag anti-establishment philosophy of Buddhist non-attachment and anarchist smash the system direct action, fuel it all with rage, and you have a truly heady mix, particularly for the young who are experiencing their first exposure to these ideas.The problem that I have with Fight Club is that it is the poster child of sophomoric movies. It combines valuable philosophical insights about our consumer society and its ills with outrageous foolishness about both the extent of those ills and the solutions to them. Though it sets up a conflict between Ed Norton's nameless protagonist and his alter ego and nemesis Tyler (played in his trademark over the top style by Brad Pitt) even in its ultimate resolution it still comes down to simplistic, foolish wish fulfillment. It is completely normal to find this profound at twenty, but if at forty you still find it profound, you should seriously question your maturity level.The other great sin of this movie is its ridiculous plot twist. It is the worst example of a violation of internal logic in any movie that I have watched in recent memory. This cheap, ill-conceived twist hurts the credibility of what is otherwise a bold and daring cinematic creation. Even given the movie's sophomoric philosophy, I would have still given it four stars had this silly twist not totally ruined the movie's credibility for me.Cinematically, Fight Club is bold, flashy, and innovative. Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and even Meat Loaf contribute performances worth watching. If you don't mind brutal, testosterone soaked screeds, I would recommend that you rent it. But if you are past your early twenties, you don't want to buy this one.Theo Logos	3.0	Innovative, Savage, & Sophomoric	2005-02-09	11	5	6
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AU030W57J4BM5	the one who knows all	It would be easy to say that all Fight Club is is a place where men can act on their anger. It would be easy to say this, but it it would not be true. Fight Club is whatever you want it to be.  Meet Edward Norton. We are not told his character's name in this movie. The reason for this might be that he is a representative of all the men like him. He is stuck in a job he hates, and goes to 12- step meetings in order to make himself feel better. Whenever he is seated on a plane, he has sadistic images in his head of the plane going down, and he hopes that it will, but it doesn't. It is on a plane that he meets Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who tells him that the only use of the oxygen masks are to give the passengers a high so that they will accept their fate. He seems to see right through Norton in a way that is very strange. The only thing that we find out about Durden is that he likes to play pranks such as changing the chemical content of a customer's soup(You get what I mean) and snipping a frame of adult film into a children's movie. Norton stays with Durden in a run down house because his apartment blew up and then Marla(Helena Bonham Carter) comes into the picture. She is an angry chain smoker who seems to dislike all of the men that she's with. Norton recognizes her from one of his self help groups.  One night Durden wants to fight with Norton just to get him to loosen up and so they fight. They continue to fight every night or so for a while and then they get noticed. More people want to join them and eventually they have a large following. They then fight in a basement under a bar and the group gets more organized. Durden then thinks up homework assignments so to speak for the members to complete. The homework assignments consist of vandalization and getting into a fight with someone. This is all in their benefit because it will set them free from their sad lives. The Fight Club seems to change from a group which causes small time mahem to a blown out terrorist organization. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a dark film with the violence that is evident in many of David Fincher films such as &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. The screenplay was written by Jim Uhls which was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. This is definitely not a movie for everyone. Some people may walk out of this one feeling like they have to vomit while some may feel different in a way that cannot be explained. They may want to see this one again because it is impossible to analyze &quot;Fight Club&quot; in one viewing.	5.0	&quot;Fight Club&quot; opens the mind	2001-06-23	1	0	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A53JCF7EA3BC5	"""the_ram"""	&quot;A viewer from Irvington-on-Hudson, NY&quot; asked and shall receive. The question is: &quot;What does Fight Club make you think about?&quot;Could be different things to different people, but here's a few definites to enlighten Mr(s). A. Viewer.We are emerging from an incredibly politically correct time, and the biggest victims of that period are the very people whose fathers victimised others: men in general, white men in particular. Slowly we've been learning/forced to change our ways, to act in defiance of our basic animal urges. We have become less promiscuous as a whole, and more tolerant of others. Our hunting/fighting/mating urges are partially fulfilled and partially replaced by consumerism and the media. We started to become everything that everyone (including ourselves) think we should be.But it's not going to work. We're fed up now of being told what to do, what to wear, what to buy and how to behave. We're fed up of double standards, of being told what's wrong with us but being unable to retort without fear of persecution. We're no longer so eager to please. We've tested the water and it's warm.The main thrust of Fight Club is to turn our backs on the fabricated consumer-machines we've become, to stop worrying about everyone else, and start forging our own future. Fight Club states this as a challenge, though deliberately supplies a wrong answer. As well as a rant about subscription to material hunger, Fight Club also works as a warning against subscription to political ideology (though it could apply to any religion or cult). In Brad Pitt, Norton finds a charasmatic figure worth following into sociopolitical terrorist activity, but when he finds out that Pitt is not quite the person he thinks he is (watch it and you'll find out), he discovers that it is himself, not Pitt, who is responsible, and without that ready-made package to subscribe to he is quick to see the error of his ways.After the initial excitement of seeing this ultimate consumer begin to break the rules and tap into his more instinctive characteristics, we are dismayed to learn that he has merely replaced one type of subscription (to the Ikea catalogue, for instance) with another (the titular organisation, and it's later incarnation).However, Fight Club is optimistic. Though Tyler Durden's &quot;answer&quot; to modern man's problems suddenly collapses under its own paradoxes (which should clear up those accusations of fascism), Norton comes to a happy comprimise that can include being yourself and being someone to someone else (which should clear up those accusations of misogyny). The initial principal of ignoring women and focusing on the future of the male animal cannot be upheld: to succeed in the end Norton has to make room for everyone, most of all the woman he loves. So a third point the film makes is a valid criticism of the feminist discipline, and that of past political figures such as Malcom X.So in summary: be careful which leaders you follow, don't drink at Starbucks, and don't try to forge a future for one subset of the population alone. In short, be an individual, not a subscriber.	5.0	Retort to &quot;A viewer from Irvington-on-Hudson, NY&quot;	2003-12-31	8	4	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A108T72L8PVAKY	The Sine Qua Non	The DVD has all sorts of excellent features and bonuses, but they can only eclipse the movie Fight Club for so long.Fight Club is neck and neck with my favorite movie The Matrix, which are too much to compare, so I'll forget about that. More importantly, this movie about men seeking a purpose to life through fighting and non-violent revolution (they only fight friendily amongst themselves =). Many questions arise from the narrator (the most versatile Edward Norton) about what he really wants: To continue leading Fight Club after establishment? To participate in worldwide revolution? Can I stop it? This leads to plenty of plot development and twists, in addition to...The philosophy and the assumed answers make this movie a pleasure especially for those searching for answers. In particular, I believe teenagers like me would enjoy this movie immensely if they can understand a plot. Besides the violence you see in the title and advertisements, Fight Club is an insanely intelligent movie. Even my violence-makes-nauseous aunt thought it was great. Ugh, I dunno what more I should say because you need to see it too. I don't see how anyone can dislike or deny its look, feel, or ideas.	5.0	My Second Favorite Movie, A Thorough DVD Package	2000-10-02	0	0	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A17QAS8K17V9EC	"Thor Vader ""Herr Director"""	Fight club gets off the ground brilliantly with Ed Norton playing a severely lonely man that finds companionship through support groups ranging from people with TB to testicular cancer.  It is funny, and initially feels  like it could be the smash breakthrough brilliant film of 1999.  It  continues strong through the 2/3 mark, at which time audience members are  on their seats with excitement at just how well done everything is. . . and  then comes the crash.  The &quot;reveal&quot; of Norton's psychiatry is  insulting to the intelligent viewer and the film cannot deliver on the  &quot;6th Sense&quot; verses &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; approach that it  tries.  As we say in Hollywood, and audience can always forgive a poor  start with a great end. . . but a fantastic start with a terrible end will  leave the audience hollow.  This is the answer to why people hate the film.  Truly disappointing given how awesome it is initially.	3.0	First 2/3 is 5 Star last 1/3 is a solid 1	2000-06-12	6	2	4

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1997C46112EKH	Tiffany Bell	"Considering this is the 10th Anniversary Edition of the movie, you've probably already seen it. But, a basic rundown of the film is this:A man (who remains unnamed through the film, and played by Edward Norton) is an insomniac. In order to deal with this issue, he attends support groups for people with diseases/problems in order to make himself feel better and sleep at night. He meets up with Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) and eventually ends up staying with him due to the circumstances of the loss of his own apartment. Together, they make their own 'help group' called Fight Club. While it helps this group of men feel better and take back their lives, it eventually gets out of control and becomes something that Tyler calls ""Project Mayhem"". Edward Norton's character feels the need to stop Tyler once one of the members of the group is killed. And... then there's the surprise ending that you don't expect at all.This synopsis makes a very outstanding movie sound extremely dull, and I apologize for it. I just didn't want to spoil anything if you happen to have been in a cave for the last 10 years. Anyway, onto the BLU-RAY!The menus on the Blu-Ray are great. I genuinely feel that they put all the effort they could into this release. Everything looks fantastic. And there's even a prank on it when you first turn on the movie--which I won't spoil if you don't already know it.The sound and video are great. This is about as near to perfect as you can get.I'm not one to double-dip on movies if I already have the DVD, but this is actually worth picking up on Blu-Ray as well."	5.0	Great Quality Blu-Ray Transfer	2010-01-03	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AV9MSJHAD3HS8	"""tilc"""	When I first heard about Fight Club it was through the soundtrack, and eventually the website.  I walked into the theater knowing full well what it was about, but at the end I was blown away.  They may have insulted the  Gap, Starbucks, IKEA, etc. , but the point was to put an emphasis on making  your life worth something other than materials.  It showed how a  psychological glitch can also send your life spiraling out of control as we  find out by the end of the film.  As for each of the elements: the actors  are done very well, the music is absolutely perfect for this film..and  perfect by itself on the soundtrack.  Many critics have said that this is  unrealistic in the sense that monotonous lives spawn violent attitudes.  But quite the contrary is true.  Although this was one of the ten best  films of the year, there is no way it will be acknowledged by the Academy.  The subject matter, and specifically the explicit sex and violence is too  objectionable for the Academy to advocate, which  is quite a shame.	5.0	Top 10 of the year, one of the most influential ever.	1999-12-23	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AWYSPFD7XNPYL	Tim Burns	"Wow! That is all I can say about this one. This movie has so many different levels to it that after buying it 2 years ago, I am still seeing different things! I can not believe how much substances there really is to this flick and I recommend that everyone see this moive. Let's get down to it...THE GOOD: 1) GROUND BREAKING. In a time when so many movies are watered down, can anyone say Scary Movie?, it is nice to see some work that has substance. Everything about this movie is new, from camera work to the plot, this movie rocks! 2) ACTING. I knew that Edward Norton could act, but who would have thought that Brad Pitt could? I never believed in his acting ability until now. The chemistry that these two have on screen is amazing and makes for an entirely enjoyable movie. 3) PLOT. One of the most original I have seen in a long time. You will not be disappointed in this department my friends, nor will you be able to guess the ending.THE BAD: 1) VIOLENCE. Now, I am never one to not see a flick because it has a huge amount of violence (I used to watch Terminator and Predator all the time when I was young), but this one has a ton. WHile this does not turn me off, other viewers might not be able to see past this level and get to the good stuff underneith. 2) SUBSTANCE. I think that this movie should be seen by everyone, but since the substance is so graphic the younger viewers are going to have a hard time getting their hands on this one. I have to put this under the catagorie of ""bad"" because it seems to me like a level of censorship and I can not stand that.THE BOTTOM LINE: This moive is no ALMOST FAMOUS, but it will change your life in some way. I recommend this moive to all people, but only if you can get past the level of violence that it contains. This moive is a MUST SEE for everyone and a MUST OWN as well."	5.0	A Great Movie....	2002-01-24	1	0	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3MUGXA5CR02G4	Tim C.	I had heard that Fight Club was an awesome movie and had a huge fan base, but I never seen it. So I ordered it and I was expecting a rock em sock em non-stop violent fighting movie, little did I know this movie was so much deeper than that. It takes you through the life of average white-collar worker(Edward Norton)who has insomnia and pretty much is troubled in life. Things change for him when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)as they begin a strange friendship and then they end up starting Fight Club as a therapy for excess stress and anxiety, but it ends up much more and deeper than that.Fight Club is now in my Top 5 favorite movies of all time. It really is a great movie for anyone troubled, or just looking for a funny, bruising, life-contemplating, movie that will have you in it.

How everyone is so obsessed with the newest gaget that makes them even lazier than they previously were. I know that critics are supposed to be great at what they do. They missed the mark when rating this film. If you just focus on the violence, you will miss the rest of the movie. There is actually some humor in it. You Know? Comedy? It is really funny.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3I2GBE2KGQV1U	"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley"""	It is far too easy for the general populace to misunderstand this movie, I guess.  So many people seem to be missing the point - indeed, *any* point - that this movie could be making, instead complaining about the violence and nihilism.  Could it be that the message actually *did* hit home, but most people were so let down - or ticked off - by it, that they decided it wasn't there?This movie is the flipside of &quot;American Beauty,&quot; another great film in which anarchy is used as an escape from the drudgery of life.  &quot;Beauty,&quot; though, was praised and celebrated, while &quot;Fight Club&quot; shunned.  Why?  The answer may be quite simple:  &quot;Beauty&quot; actually encouraged such behavior, appealing to the modern mantra &quot;if it feels good, do it.&quot;  Consequences were ignored, leaving one feeling that this was the right thing to do.  &quot;Fight Club,&quot; on the other hand, took that mantra to it's natural, disturbing end.  As Edward Norton yells late in the movie &quot;You morons!  You're running around in ski masks, blowing stuff up!  What did you expect?&quot;  While &quot;Beauty&quot; was a call to freedom, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was a call to moderation.  People are afraid to deal with consequences, though, therefore they focus on everything else.As for the violence, this is no worse than any boxing movie I've ever seen, with the exception of two gun-related wounds and one severe beating.  And from &quot;Raging Bull&quot; to &quot;Rocky,&quot; not a complaint has arisen.  Why now?  Because there's a message involved.  What I don't understand is how a film like Kubrick's &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; is considered a challenging, thought-provoking classic, when it's even *more* disturbing and over the top.  At least &quot;Fight Club&quot; doesn't feature any giant genetalia.Everything involved in this movie is top notch, from Edward Norton's bored, cynical narration to David Fincher's visually stunning direction.  Indeed, this film has such a bizzarre energy, warping in and out of speed and giving new meaning to the phrase &quot;extreme close-up.&quot;  There's enough here to please most people looking for something new in film.The most wonderful thing about this movie is the witty, literate screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the equally stunning novel by the Vonnegut-like Chuck Pahlnuiuhk.  Mixing humor, action, and subtle (and not-so-subtle) philosophy, this just might be the most quotable movie of the year.Now, for the DVD.  When a movie is the reason you buy a DVD player, that says something.  When said movie is actually *worth* the DVD player, that says even more.  Wonderful for fans, this movie gives some wonderful behind the scenes material and stories.  Especially fun is the alternate audio track with Fincher, Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter (though her track was recorded seperately).  It's obvious the bond Fincher, Norton, and Pitt made during the shooting, given the relaxed atmosphere of this audio.  More than once a story is told about a botched take, and like kids in a candy shop, Norton and Pitt beg Fincher to put it on the DVD.  Jokes fly, complaints about the negative reviews, thoughts on the movies themes, and this is never dull to listen to.  This is far more then can be said about some other movies (&quot;Hollow Man,&quot; for instance; could anyone take such a fluff movie more seriously?)  Personally, I can't wait to get back and listen to screenwriter Uhls and author Pahluniuhk duke it out!Much like &quot;Clockwork Orange,&quot; this movie disturbed me, entertained me, made me laugh and think.  Unlike that classic, though, this is one I feel I can show my little brother, or my parents, and watch numerous times myself.Check it out.	5.0	I am Jack's Rave Review	2001-05-17	3	2	1
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1LZVU5SRRM3VX	Timothy Michael Resh	Viewed under the right conditions by the right person, this movie is an absolute treat.  Viewed by the wrong person or by someone not in the right frame of mind, the movie's darkly comedic undertones can easily be missed amidst the brutal violence and coarse language.  That said, I viewed this movie under optimal conditions and with an open mind.  As a result, I stumbled upon one of my favorite films of all-time.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton really strut their comedic stuff in this movie, as both are brilliant in their roles.  Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf also manage to steal scenes throughout this perfectly cast film.  The entire cast walks the comedic line brilliantly without ever becoming campy, a feat for which David Fincher can take a significant amount of the credit.In Fight Club, Fincher truly shows his directorial genius in distilling Chuck Palahniuk's great but somewhat disjointed novel into a compelling, hilarious, and coherent storyline.  Although Fincher's version neglects some of Palahniuk's fundamental vision (the ultimate futility of nihilism, in particular), he captures the overall spirit of the noval and makes the story linear enough that movie audiences can follow the character from IKEA-loving corporate drone to anarchistic mastermind.  With the blackest of humor, Fincher decries everything that is wrong with modern society, from corporate America's cornflower-blue ties and action items to the emasculation and isolation of the American male to the evils of consumerism.  All important messages for people in the oft targeted 18-49 demographic.I have viewed the film with a number of other people, and my observation has been that people under 40 tend to view the film as brilliant and visionary, while people over 40 tend to take it too literally.  That is why I titled this review: the first rule of fight club is, don't take Fight Club too seriously.  Revel in the main character's insomnia and schizophrenia, and try to get Palahniuk &amp; Fincher's serious messages at the same time, understanding that those messages are conveyed through extreme hyperbole.Finally, if you have the opportunity, be sure to listen to the Fincher commentary on the film, as it is probably one of the most insightful commentary tracks on any DVD currently on the market.  Fincher gives tremendous insight into the details of making this film that are interesting and pertinent enough to captivate anyone, from the most serious film student to the most casual viewer of films.  Watch this and enjoy!	5.0	The First Rule of Fight Club is: Don't Take It Too Seriously	2004-01-13	12	10	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AJYGQV81FSFE2	Timothy P. Scanlon	I didn't know what to expect with this. Pitt's one of Hollywood's golden boys and Edward Norton has always impressed me.About the first two thirds of the film had me laughing. It was a brilliant satire, of self-help mania, of meaningless materialism, maybe even of violence. The characters are bizarre,for example one guy with a formidable set of breasts brought on by hormone injections to make up for his testicular cancer (He was a member of one of the 12-step groups), and Norton himself leads a pretty meaningless life, a leading point of the film.The story takes a turn when Norton, who reflects that he doesn't really belong in the 12-step groups he's attending, runs into a young woman who uses the meetings in the same way, i.e., something to do. Their fun began with her convoluted interaction with Norton and took off after Norton moved in with Brad Pitt's character; she and Pitt shook the whole neighborhood with their earthquake sex.To that point it made me laugh several times.The fight club itself began with a challenge of Pitt to Norton. It developoed as a caricature of consermerism, sort of fraternity. It was super-violent,clandestine, etc. I needn't repeat what countless other reviewers--most of whom have love  it--said.Up to this point, one of the funniest, and most worthwhile portions of the film was to see Edward Norton beat himself up! It was hysterical, and got him out of his work with benefits, a little like Kevin Spacey's character getting out of his job in &quot;American Beauty.&quot;After it was about 2/3 over, however, the film took a turn to I don't know where. It seems to want to become a psycho-drama. People see Norton and say that he's Pitt. Is he one person who's created the identity that he wishes he were? After the scene in which Norton blew his brains out to eliminate that alter ego--and lived!--it ends.I wouldn't discourage people from seeing this, if for no other reason, the first over half of the film made me laugh. But I don't see a classic here, as some critics have called it.	3.0	Starts as black comedy/satire and goes....where?	2001-03-30	4	2	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2TQUOY06TN83A	Tom Doherty	fight club. what can i say? a brilliant, hyperadrenal shotgun blast into the face of dead end, ant farm, postmodern american pseudo-culure that  never forgets to satirize when it proselitizes. this film puts the black  into black comedy with some of the most mean spirited and hilarious comic  touches of all time. seamlessly directed and flawlessly acted, fight club  is a movie everyone should see. and this includes women. most of the women  i know who've seen it didn't care for it, and i don't feel particularly  surprised by this, since the film is overbearingly testosterone edged. it  most certainly is told from the perspective of the immasculated male, and  is clearly targeted towards same. however, at the same time the film deftly  pokes fun at just that kind of mentality, sometimes with subtlety,  sometimes, quite frankly, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer  (including an undeniable and roaringly funny homoerotic subtext that made  me laugh so hard i very nearly vomited). many will tell you that, contrary  to what you may have heard or gleaned about this movie, it does not glorify  violence. well, actually, this is a half-truth. the film neither glorifies  nor condemns violence but simply approaches it with an intelligence and a  simpathetically honest eye toward the impulse to destroy, and be destroyed,  that you almost never, ever see in movies anywhere; rather than getting its  rocks off with it or, conversely, succumbing to the pressures to indulge in  a sappy, saccharine, PSA mentality that tries only to deny the violent  impulses within us all. i am jack's renewed faith in cinema.	5.0	Best of '99	2000-08-10	6	5	1

Even Brad Pitt rises to the occasion.Unfortunately, all the gorgeous cinematography, brilliant editing,  fabulous production, and splendid acting cannot disguise the essential  emptiness and dreariness of a movie that has absolutely nothing to  say.What I found most disturbing about the film, ultimately, was the  fact that it seemed so completely certain that it had some kind of serious  message to impart, something about masculinity and power and fascism.  The  fact that the film fails so spectacularly to add up to anything other than  a well-brought-off music video is the most telling thing about it.	3.0	Beautifully Made But...	2000-05-30	14	3	11
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3V7LSMJ4K1POS	Tom Helleberg	Fight Club is a movie that I very much wanted to like without reservation. There was so much going for it: Every actor fit their role; the script was an almost perfect transliteration of Palahniuk's novel, in that it  maintained his dark comedy and retained the book's best lines (like a good  adapted screenplay should, Fight Club distilled the source novel: The  visuals seemed the ideal extension of Palahnuik's words, as though the  viewer might be imagining the images on their own); plus the Dust Brothers'  score was energetic and the editing and lighting so appropriate to the  film's tone that they seemed to tie everything up into a neat and seamless  bundle. Combine this with the overall intensity of the movie and a handful  of ingenious and clever effects and there doesn't seem to be much wrong  with Fight Club.But it stumbled for me. Just about precisely at the  midpoint of the movie, everything fell apart. The personal  anti-consumerist, self-discovery-through-descent focus of the first half  (&quot;self-improvement is masturbation&quot;) gives way to a more overtly  philosophical assault on the world at large. The most inventive angle of  the movie (and the book) was the internal focus of Fight Club: How people  (men) fight to define themselves given a lack of wars or depressions or  other external stimuli. When this gives way to the more cliched &quot;man  against the machine&quot; (or guerrilla cell against the machine) plot of  Operation Mayhem, the movie loses it's real edge.But in spite of this,  it still manages one of the best twists of the year.All in all, Fight  Club remains a very very good movie, but not a great movie.	4.0	A Bipolar Film	2000-06-07	3	1	2

Brad  Pitt stars alongside Edward Norton, Jared Leto, and Meatloaf.  Edward  Norton's obsession with his possesions and sick desire to attend group  sessions for men suffering with testicular cancer provide the background  for him to base his life... until he meets Tyler (Brad Pitt).  Fight Club  ensues from their interesting relationship and life has taken on an  entirely different meaning for our anti-hero.  Tyler's desire for power and  domination leads to a switch in pace for the film and also slows down the  pace for a dissapionting second half.  When Norton turns on Pitt the story  begins to lose focus.  Hold on to this film in the end it's a keeper.	4.0	A new wave of violence in &quot;Fight Club&quot;	2000-06-02	4	0	4
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1N1LSJRKHTCGZ	Tommy Paine	WAY too much gratuitous violence - no wait - please let me revise that: the violence is excessive but not gratuitous - it seems to be the whole purpose of the movie - its theme may be &#34;how much violence and human physical abuse can we get an audience to swallow?&#34; That's 1/2 of my objection to Fight Club. &#60;mini spoiler alert:&#62; The other half is that the 'unexpected' intellectual climax makes absolutely no sense. I'm not saying 'don't see it.' I'm just saying I hated it, primarily for those 2 reasons. And I consistently like Brad Pitt's work. Helena Bonham Carter's performance was masterful, in an over-the-top Tim Burtonesque direction. I've never been a Norton fan (except for in The Honeymooners) but I do respect his talent, and it shows here. Creepy Movie. Waste of time. Waste of storage. Waste of makeup. Irony Dept: I watched the movie at the insistence of a woman who is a fighter against domestic violence perpetrated on women. Go figure.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A18645F3IFEP3G	Tonya Chapin	This movie is very unique, from the characters to the plot twist. It includes a man who goes to support groups for entertainment, a soap making business, interesting characters  and lots of fighting. The fighting is graphic and it seems to be the main focus of the movie, until you get to the end and you really understand what's going on. Won't spoil that for you.  Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do an excellent job with their characters. Definitely worth watching.	4.0	A very strange movie with an interesting plot twist	2014-05-30	0	0	0

Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness,  it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe!Here is a film  that almost cries out, &quot;HATE ME! DESPISE ME!&quot; An occasional film  gingerly will step on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop  kicks them! Yet, it is so unrelentlessly and quirkily original, so  pathologically tantilizing..you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for  it! (If you're skeptical, just look at that slick DVD packaging!)Make no  mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It  never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic  Hollywood film.The term &quot;Ride&quot; is employed so freely to  movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents  the word! Literally, from the DNA Rollercoaster opening Credits  (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical eqivalent of a sustained  amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailings(&quot;We're still  men!&quot;) of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and  deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton- Bonham Carter-Pitt, to  the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise-control,  hyper-consumeristic lifestyles...Fight Club synthesizes both our pent-up  frustration and our self-induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE  #1...&quot;You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!&quot;This, Ladies &amp;  Gentlemen, is one &quot;RIDE&quot; you DO NOT want to miss!	5.0	Surrender to Fight Club.....A no-holds-barred Knockout!	2000-08-27	6	5	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI	"Travis Newman ""-Producer, CPP"""	The first time that I saw Fight Club, I was not impressed. I missed the beginning of the film and I came to realize after viewing the movie for a second time, Fight Club is a pretty neat movie. I think I was anticipating more &quot;Fight Club&quot; fight scenes rather than a very involved plot that really leaves you amazed at the end.What makes Fight Club a decent movie is the fact that whether you know it or not, you are partially clueless as to what is really going on throughout the movie. Masking this cluelessness was done very well and explained properly in the end. The two main characters were first rate and I really came to appreciate Brad Pitt for more than just a pretty boy after seeing this as well as 7. The whole cast was exellent and between the different action scenes, dialogue sequences and crazy stunts, there was more than enough going on to keep your attention even while clueless. The climax, conclusion and summary of everything leaves you feeling mildly shocked, enlightened and even a bit confused though you think you understand finally; one of your first reactions is &quot;I should watch that again&quot;.Fight Club is an atypical movie that gets the brain to function more than the average flick. The movie is a superb piece in itself and the amount of effort that went into creating the final product is evident. I suggest that the viewer be ready for anything, open-minded, and has time to watch it again. It is a great dvd to get and an interesting experience.	4.0	Creative, Intriguing, Twisted and Enlightening	2002-11-06	3	1	2

He does get some sleep, but his conditions rebounds back into it's original state when he meets a lovely young woman, whose name is Marla.

While touring, he meets an enigmatic young man named Tyler and after a short conversation both become fast friends. Both like to relieve their inner tensions by hitting each other.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A39ARXI1SQXNTQ	Trey	The key to watching this movie is to realize that it not only suggests an aggressive and destructive nihilism but also, in many ways, refutes it by the end of the movie.  The plot is stretched and distorted so many ways that you'll still be picking out new things the third and fourth time that you watch it.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3E6U1839D1TK4	Tristan	Fight Club is one of those movies where if you explain the plot to anyone before they've seen it, it will ruin some of the surprise.  So do avoid summaries and definitely avoid spoilers.  This is a movie that will keep you interested and invested from start to finish.  Tyler Durden will make you question your life and wonder what it is you really want to achieve before you quickly decompose.  Many cult films are followed for different reasons; cheesy dialogue, goofy dance routines, but Fight Club is famous because of how eye-opening and different it is.  Do not go in expecting anything you've seen before.  This is not a boxing movie.  This is not a comedy.  This is not a straight-forward drama.  This is a cocktail of it all and you're in for one hell of a hangover.	5.0	One day you're going to die.  You better watch this film first!	2012-06-25	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A39UKBJJXJ82FO	Tristan	Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club explores the darker side of mental instability in the form of a dark comedy. The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. I know that a lot of moviegoers hate narration, but trust me when I say that it is put to good use here. The sarcastic, bitter, angry voice of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? I'd go onto say that it is as much a satire as South Park is. So then why the slick visuals? Why the sly, cool tone? Why the clever dialogue? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film knows this. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that it is Edward Norton's character who is doing the narration and so therefor we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. Much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Fight Club shows a world devoid of any sort of normal thoughts of any kind, whether independent or not. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. However, this is also how the film's humor comes through. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around his grow more self-aware, more open-minded, and more like he was at one time. What makes this so funny is the fact that acts and methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous that only a fool could ever take it seriously. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. I definitely wouldn't call this his best performance. He is required to act in a sub-conscious way that feels full of self-deprecation, and this shouldn't be all that hard for any good actor as long as they are a good sport and they aren't afraid of looking stupid. I prefer his roles in films like 12 Monkeys in which he plays much more deeply troubling and complicated characters. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. However, it is, at times, heavy to the point of absurdity, so it also helps with the humor of the film too. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, though it doesn't exactly have a high bodycount. It's often very ugly to look at, which I don't mind except when it gets to the point where it makes the film feel a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homoerotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. Their mannerisms, as well as their quick little quirks and playful flirtations, get pretty weird after a while. It's about as homoerotic a film as Interview With the Vampire. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. None of these things where what I originally loved about this film, however, and the film itself still works great as a comedy. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. Would I recommend it to everyone? Definitely not. I will say that it's most worthwhile audience would be people who are interested in films about insanity. It's one of the best ones you'll find, or at least one of the best ones that was released in the past couple of decades. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. Sure, there's a lot going on in both of these films, and the characters may have a fascinating level of detail to them, but that does not mean that these films don't offer more than good entertainment and some ideas to think about. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.	4.0	Incredibly dark and very funny	2010-06-20	2	1	1

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A11P6I1BB5FY7W	"""tubesteaknyouri"""	In its most condensed form, Fight Club is about the confliction between conformity--the pressure to conform to a material addicted society -- and nonconformity--the defiant nature of the inner and much suppressed anarchist within all of us.  The movie is a tour guide through the darkest aspects of nature. It has a dismal overtone throughout that is distrusting and depressing at times but all the while, brutally true. It is witty and cynical in a way that you will find yourself laughing at things that should never be humorous. Palahniuk has a artistic way of nearly overdoing things at times.  He sure likes to beat the dog well after its dead when, with each blow, maggots are expelled from each and every orifice. But thats the beauty of it all.Jack is the epidome of all that is mundane, average and, well, a white-collar slave. During his breakdown he becomes aquainted with his previously dormant alter-ego, Tyler, who is the absolute opposite of himself. As Jack decends into madness, his vulnerability allows his alter-ego to slowly consume him. By the time Tyler becomes the prevalent personality, Jack emerges only from time-to-time to find himself feeling confused and abandoned. He discovers that Tyler has underhandedly formed a militia of renegades to overthrow the consumerism manifestation.  Eventually, the escalating chaos steers him to his consequential demise.The captivating directing is raw and graphic but necessary to the film's charisma. The dialog is interesting, fluid, witty and intellectually stimulating.  All in all, its master piece. When you think it can't possibly get more weird, suddenly there is a twist of a twist of a twist and you find your brain in a knot of perplexity. It masterfully sustains suspense till the very end. And when the end comes, every uncertainty and mystery is uncovered and the whole movie makes sense. This definately not a movie for Puritians, children, the weak-minded, persons with a high gag reflex or somebody who has yet to be weaned from his mother's nipple.	5.0	Mental LSD.	2003-06-22	0	0	0

And that confrontation reminded me how great this film is, and I went online and bought it with my babysitting  money. My friend, he argued that the multiple references to IKEA and cults within the same film was condemning against the Swedish furniture exporter. But clearly my grey-bearded friend was wrong, and nothing could be further from the truth of the matter, in my humble opinion. Even going back to the Homeric epics, discontinuity has long been a serious theme in literature and film, and Fight Club is a Pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of this line of thought.Shirtlessness aside, Fight Club is the type of film that burrows deep into one's soul and wrenches out the Babylon-like demons of the modern capitalistic society. Brad Pitt is the type of character that makes me want to be a better person and purge my living room of matching furniture.Unlike most films, Fight Club asks the important questions, such as: what does it mean to be a stranger to others? to yourself? what does it mean for something to be soap and not something more? what would have become of the bronze god-man Frank Black if ""where is my mind?"" was not played during the closing credits?

I don't really pay much attention to how movies are filmed (and get bored when it's pointed out), but the camera zooms in this  movie thrilled me; with a brilliant opening credits sequence to a shot  where the camera plummets about thirty storeys and then through a  road!Brad Pitt puts in a great performance as a likable character who  does horrible things, Edward Norton (who incidentally I hadn't seen before,  apart from trailers for other movies) is also great as  office-nerd-turned-hero. The fight sequences are gritty and at times  gruesome. But the movie will start taking a dark turn (I remember thinking  &quot;I don't like where this is going&quot;), but then it doesn't quite go  where you fear. And the plot revelation in the last half hour is  brilliant!Unfortunately, there are a bumps in the road that let down the  ride. Helena Bonham Carter basically ruins every scene she's in (just when  you're getting into a scene, she pops up just in time to make sure you  don't enjoy it too much), the endless orgasm scenes get boring and annoying  fast, and I found myself cringing at some of the acts of vandalism  (although most of it is quite amusing).Otherwise, an entertaining and  well-crafted film.	3.0	Well, 3 and a half stars	2000-06-21	5	0	5

This  was Brad Pitt's Edward Norton's best performance ever. David Fincher has  never been so perfect. It became an obsession. I read the book, bought the  poster, read the websites, and took up smoking. Ever since the day I saw  Fight Club, I have lived and breathed Tyler Durden. I even induced insomnia  on myself.

The film is about the society we live in, the society that tells us to spend our money until we are happy, to gain as much as possible to be succesful.  It is also about how society has certain guidelines for the sexes, ex. men shouldn't cry or show their feelings in a  public setting. Fight Club is about men who see these  aspects of society  and choose to not buy into the false ideas of it.  They decide to start  fight clubs were they will be able to fight eachother in order to feel that  they are &quot;real&quot;.  They do this because in a fight you are the  focus of the attention and you are in control of your life. There are no  bosses telling you what to do, you make the descisions. The men in this  movie want to feel they have worth, that they have a power that can't be  taken away. Unfortunetly, as the movie shows, violence is not the answer to  freeing yourself from negative surroundings.  I don't see how people can  say this movie encourages violence. Look at what happens to Bob and the  blonde haired man among others. And if these images weren't  enough the ending shows that the actions that take place were done by  someone totally insane, a person unable to deal with what was around him.  Do these events sound like they encourage violence?  Fight Club shows the  horrible physical and mental damage that can occur when people try to do  good, but focus their anger and energy in the wrong place.  What may have  thrown people off is the dark humor placed throughout the movie. People  didn't realize that certain scenes could be dark and funny while others  could just be dark and violent without the humor, showing the chaos that  results from the descions made. Fight Club is a very fun interesting movie  that is nowhere near as violent as people make it out to be. There is  actually very little fighting in the entire movie. Do yourself a favor,  check it out, and you will see what an amazing movie it is.	5.0	Best of 1999	2000-04-23	1	1	0

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AGLMZJVUGSOD5	urbanlegend23	Fight Club is a movie I didn't expect to be totally awesome, but I was wrong, again. The film shows true potential and is one of a kind. The acting is awesome, the direction is marvellous, the screenplay is ingenius  and the editing is pefection. This film is a big hit with the critics and  one of the few films that deserves all the praise it gets.Edward Norton  deserves praise for his role as a young man who is continously attending  'groups' at different countries. When he meets a soap maker on his plane  called Tyler Durdon (the marvellous Brad Pitt) they start up a fight club,  which is successful, but turns dangerous and dirty.Fight Club is so  awesome and so breathtaking that it is now ranking at #20 in my top films.

This film is not at all what the trailer  would have you believe. It is so much more. It is a journey into the human  mind as well as the social mind.

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AU5SQBPSNOIM	"Vanissa W. Chan ""vandelist"""	This film attacks our capitalist culture, our obsessive materialistic individualistic mindsets, this film mocks our &quot;dreamer-couch-potato&quot; generation.  And it shines while it moons us with its smart remarks and its egotystical masturbation.  This film is a satirical masterpiece.I'll have to admit, I'm biased.  I love Fincher.  Se7en is by far my most-adored film.  Although I can talk forever about Se7en, I can probably talk more than forever about Fight Club, because the various themes incorporated in the film seem endless.To summarize without giving too much away, this film, adopted from Chuck Palahniuk's underground novel, is about the postmodern world, where children are raised by their television sitcoms and commercials.  Where children no longer look to their deadbeat fathers as role-models for God.  Where children abandon unfollowed dreams because their goals were &quot;too hard&quot; and they couldn't cut the slack while they were privileged enough to be in college but too busy pissing their money away and having promiscuous sex.  Where everyone has a of mental disorder of some kind and instead of accepting responsibility for their problems, continuously victimize themselves while receiving &quot;inner-child&quot; embraces from their local support group.  This film mocks and tackles all these issues, and more.It raises questions for our overstimulated lifestyles.  It questions us about our directions, our goals, our passions.  It asks us what we are really made of.  If we have all these dreams to become so great, to impact the world, to make a difference, than why don't we?  Why do we continue to rot in front of our t.v., picking our noses, and denying the most fulfilling activity in the world, self-transcendance?It admonishes us.  It threatens us.  Because living in a society where our immaterial needs are no longer met, where we are overwhelmed with our trivial material decisions and activities, there becomes a void inside of all of us.  All of a sudden, we are faced with the questions like, What is it like to feel pain?  What is it like to feel joy?  What is it like to feel exhilerating?  What is it like to live?From a more sociological perspective, the film's theme of the postmodern brainchild is a direct result of what social prophets, including Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Aldous Huxley, and the controversial Karl Marx have long predicted.  The film wreaks of Marx philosophy with its show of disgust for what the commodification of life has done to our humanity.  All four social prophets agreed that the deterioration of the immaterial life would lead to the self-destruction of the human race, essentially what this apocalyptic story leads to.With performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter, who play the roles they were &quot;born&quot; for, this film will, in the least, with no question, provoke you.The DVD itself:  A very honestly and tastefully done collection.  Included is a supplemental cd including several commentaries, deleted scenes, and &quot;the making of&quot; clips.  Also included is a hilarious compilation of quotes from both opposers and likers of the film.  You seriously can't expect more from the makers - it doesn't get any better than this.	5.0	Not Your Typical Yuppie Entertainment.	2000-12-08	3	2	1

As does  Edward Norton. Helena Bonham Carter, who made some really boring Merchant  Ivory movies in the past, holds her won with Pitt &amp; Norton.

The spiral is an essential part of the story &#8211; critical in every way.  The violence is not gratuitous whatsoever.  In fact, it is one of the rare instances where violence was in no way gratuitous, but completely essential to the plot.As far as the violence, it certainly could have been far more graphic than it was.  I think the balance was beautifully done.  One of the things that made the movie truly great was the balance of violence to the tender message of the human condition in this era of history.	5.0	The Best available on DVD.

Sadly, in light of 9/11 and the subsequent recession and Iraq War, it now seems a bit dated (Tyler Durden's claim that ""we grew up in a time without war"" where men are suffering a spiritual emptiness borne of too much prosperity and self-indulgent consumerism (the Clinton years) is just a distant memory now but the film's anti-consumerist rant still remains relevant in debt-ridden, underwater mortgage America. The last shot of the buildings being blown up (and collapsing in a pancake-like fashion, in the same manner as the World Trade Center towers) continues to chill me to the bone every time I see it.

Brad Pitt does a fairly good job with his masculine violence but Edward Norton has to the most  talented actor in Hollywood right now. Since his stint in Rounders, no one  can duplicate his ironic voice and low-key acting which is quite  naturalistic. Edward Norton deserved an Oscar nomination.Bonham-Carter  is quite aloof in this movie. This could be good or bad depending on how  you want to look at it.Fight Club is a great film which I will admit is  a lovely satire on American values.

"Don't talk about ""Fight Club"" watch it first otherwise the film will be lose it's meaning and clever sense of surprise. Edward Norton plays a brand obsessed insomaniac who feels overwhelmed by society in David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" adapted from the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton meets a soap salesman (Brad Pitt) on a bad plane ride home after who takes him in when Norton loses his home. This begins an odyssey for both where they found a fight club allowing men to reestablish their masculity that ultimately morphs into a militia type movement swallowing both.Don't be fooled by tne opening menu--Fincher has cleverly use the DVD menu for ""Never Been Kissed"" which makes it appear as if the Blu-ray might be the wrong one--it represents the themes of the film quite well about the deceptive surfaces that we perceive all around us.""Fight Club"" like a lot of Fincher's movies is an acquired taste but for those willing to join in and watch this combination of drama, action and satire, it's a worthwhile but bloody journey. Although not often discussed Fincher along with Chris Nolan is one of the few filmmakers who routinely challenges our assumptions about storytelling in films tackling a number of difficult stories, themes and manages to combine the artiness of someone like David Lynch into structured storytelling.The Blu-ray for ""Fight Club"" looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed presentation dominated by the yellow/brown color scheme and lighting of neon that has dominated his films since ""Se7en"". Blacks anre colors are solid throughout with nice skin tones that fit within the color scheme of the film. Audio sounds terrific with an immersively 5.1 lossless presentation.The extras include Blu exclusive featurettes on the sound design, ""Flogging Fight Club"" about the making of the movie and a ""bonus view"" ""Insomnaic Mode: I Am Jack's Search Mode"". Fincher provides both a solo and second informative commentary track joined by Norton, Pitt and Carter carried over from the DVD. Also carried over from the original DVD is Palahnick's ""Writer's Commentary"" with screenwriter Jim Uhls and a third commentary ""technical"" commentary with DP Jeff Cronenweth, costume designer Michael Kaplan and Kevin Haug. We also get multiple angle behind-the-scenes vignettes with commentary, deleted/alternate scenes, trailers/TV spots, PSA's, a music video, promotional and art galleries making this, perhaps, the ultimate edition of the film on home video.Join ""Fight Club"" and you might find your mind stretched and bloodied.

It had an extremely orignal plot, incredible acting, and a script that made you think if you really did have another side to yourself. The peope that gave this movie a bad review most likely didnt see past the violence. Maybe its just me but i like it when movies are violent to the point where they make you feel kind of uncomfortable. It gave the movie a certain grittiness that was needed to enhance the story and make it such a masterpiece. The underlying mesage in this movie is great.

An adaptation of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club shows up the ludicrous extremes of the male psyche in a brutal and adolescently honest way.  Our unnamed protagonist narrator (Edward Norton), slogging through life in the corporate world meets up with a hedonistic anarchist named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a plane.  And that's when the world gets turned on its head.  His condo destroyed in a mysterious explosion, our protagonist finds himself living with Durden in a ruined house in ""a toxic waste part of town"".  Lashing out at the frustrating impotence they feel as unwanted members of a lost generation, they begin fighting; first each other, in the parking lot of a local bar, and then other lost men who feel themselves unwanted and angry.  Throw in Helena Bonham Carter as Marla, the waifish and junkie-pale love interest for Tyler Durden, and you've got a tough combo to not pay rapt attention to.As an adaptation of Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club fits the bill in a first rate way.  The script remains entirely faithful to the novel (To an embarrassing extent:  Lines of dialog from the novel shoved into the actor's mouths in places they simply don't fit.

The stink was awful."" as Norton hauls her down the street springs to mind.), both in content and, mostly, theme.The sheer anger of Palahnuik's characters shines through under director David Fincher's careful hand, as does Tyler Durden's grinning braggadocio, Marla's sighing disdain for the world, and the narrator's mix of latent anger and sheer wimpiness.  What's not played up in the script, however, is the novel's vision of the narrator, Tyler Durden, and Marla as existing in a love triangle in which Marla wants the narrator, the narrator wants Tyler, and Tyler wants Marla.  It may simply have been too much for scriptwriter Jim Ohls to fit into the movie, or, and this seems more likely, far too homoerotic for a Hollywood blockbuster.  If the latter is the case, however, Fincher managed to work around it by filming the fight scenes, in the dark and damp basement of the local bar whose parking lot provided the original arena, in deep intimate closeups showing the writhing bodies of half-naked men grappling, groping and twisting together.  The feeling is that of extreme intimacy, which, thematically, works well, but also lends itself to more alternative lifestyle explanations.  Conversly, the sex scenes in the movie, between Bonham Carter and Pitt, are shot in an exaggerated still frame, with a soundtrack of echoing moans laid overtop.  The mood is more that of posing, of reaching for an esthetic perfection rather than feeling any true passion.To me, the movie works better, in most ways, than the book.  The book's premise of men fighting in basements and on street corners works better as a visual than as described actions, and, really, Palahniuk's extremely spare writing style lends itself better to the narrator's constant internal questioning than it does to adequately describing the look on his face when Tyler Durden has him in a headlock and is ready to knock out half his teeth.What the movie lacks, though, is the novel's ability to give us nothing but our narrator's thoughts, which play a huge part in the narrative.  His feelings about his job, his boss, his parents, Marla, and the support groups he regularly attends are given lip service in the movie through extensive voiceovers, but mostly as a way to move the plot along.  In the novel, these are essential to the development of his character, and I feel that we get to know him in a considerably less intimate way in the film than in the book.But, as stated earlier, this is a top notch adaptation of a mostly cerebral novel, and the cast and crew should pat themselves on the back in congratulations of a job well done.  A movie that I've watched dozens of times, and expect to watch dozens of times more, Fight Club makes me cheer, makes me laugh, makes me cringe, and makes me almost like Brad Pitt."	5.0	Yes, Okay, it's a guy movie....	2001-11-20	3	0	3

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"If you have any doubts about whether you should see this film, put them aside, buy it, and watch it. Then come back and read the reviews.I first saw ""Fight Club"" on DVD about eight years ago. It made perfect sense. I immediately ""got"" what it was about, unlike some reviewers I have great respect for (Ebert, Turan). Then came The Great Reveal at one hour and fifty-three minutes. I sat there blindsided, my jaw open, wondering ""What the hell is going on here? What is the point of this, as the story has already made its point?"".One might still raise that obejction, but a second viewing (on Blu-ray) reveals that Fincher drops subtle hints as to what is really going on. Further, what is hidden up to that point is thematically and psychologically consistent with the rest of the story.This is a film you have to experience and absorb on your own. But... it is absolutely /not/ about the (presumed) pleasure men take in beating up each other (though the title unfortunately suggests that). If you don't understand /why/ they fight, then you've missed one of the story's basic points. (Hint: It's not to affirm their masculinity in a feminized world.) This is not a story about sado-masochism or fascism. It is, as most great American films, an attack on American society and values.""Fight Club"" will someday be recognized as one of /the/ great American films. Why it's taking so long, I don't know.PS: Blu-ray navigation is occasionally confusing, but ""Fight Club"" is the hardest-to-navigate BD I've yet viewed. It's difficult to make exactly the selections you want among the options. And there are points in the selection process where everything seems to have locked up, and you have to press Play to get it to continue.

This DVD has so many extras, which probably took a whole  separate talented production team aside from the film's crew.  Deleted  scenes and funny commentary by the Fincher, Pitt and Norton are my  favorites.That's just what's great about the &quot;DVD,&quot; so what  about the actual film?  In a nutshell (I can't even mention the word  &quot;nutshell&quot; without thinking of Austin Powers, but I digress...),  the movie is visual perfection.  Fincher films this creative and intriguing  story in a such a way that it combines biting narrative and chaos-driven  imagery seamlessly.  You hear Edward Norton talk about his  &quot;single-serving&quot;-packed life (single-serving sugar,  single-serving friends...) and you see his life, almost too-normal life  that is, and the message is clear: we all live single-serving lives.  Well,  this is how ONE guy chose to deal with it.I won't get into the storyline  (you can read a summary somewhere else), but if you indulge in great acting  (Norton is phenomenal), inappropriate humor (which just makes it more  hilarious), and filmmaking that is just hands-down beautiful, Fight Club,  regardless of all the invalids that didn't like the movie because they  &quot;didn't get it,&quot; is one of the best films you can ever  experience.	5.0	A DVD that you MUST have!	2000-08-04	23	16	7

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1COQ2DOO1O9HD	Wing J. Flanagan	"I am a member of Generation X.  This film was made for me.  I understand it.  Those much older and much younger do not.  But I do.  It is, in some ways, a metaphorical call to arms; a call to fight complacency and find meaning, rather than continue to trudge through the screaming pit of shallow, celebrity-driven consumerism that, until recently, seemed the primary arena of our existence.The story finds an unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton) at the end of his rope.  He's about my age; has a job and an office about like mine.  Like me, he's still single - the product of divorce, he doesn't trust marriage or committed relationships.  Like me, he buys stuff in an attempt to fill the void.  Like me, he wonders if it all means anything.  He's approaching a point of crisis - a crisis of nothing.  A big blank, where life has become a pretty but empty package.  He can't sleep.  To find some emotional catharsis, he goes to 12-step meetings, pretending to have a variety of diseases.  He finds understanding.  He finds release.Enter Marla Singer (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  They upset the applecart, and together, all three end up forming a strange triangle that will lead to a darkly comedic world of mischief, mayhem, and - of all things - soap.The titular concept is that of the ""Fight Club"" - a loosely organized group of Gen-Xers (started by Durden and Narrator) who meet periodically to test their mettle by beating the stuffing out of each other.  ""How can you know anything about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"" asks Durden, and he's right.  How do we know anything about the strength of our own character - how, in fact, can we even build character - without a struggle or fight of some kind to temper us?  Something that our generation has utterly lacked?""We are the middle children of history, man,"" says Durden, in the film's most important scene, ""No purpose or place.  We have no great war.  No great depression.  Our great war is a spiritual war.  Our great depression is our lives.""  And that's what Fight Club is all about.  It is a means of providing that great test of character in miniature.  Until, of course, it gets out of hand in the film's nihilistic second half.  In it, Fight Club evolves into a full-blown movement, turning outward to soft-core domestic terrorism, and the film becomes a bleak, Strangelovian meditation on Fascism.Even people who did not understand Fight Club could sense something powerful in it. One thinks of Roger Eberts' completely off-base and largely negative review that at least grudgingly acknowledges the film's solid cinematic technique.  Eberts' mistake is in thinking Fight Club attempts to be a morality tale of sorts; a simple-minded polemic.  By that standard, it certainly fails.  But Ebert is not Gen-X.  He's a Boomer, and Fight Club sails right past him.  Put simply, he doesn't get it, and probably never will.The DVD is a two-disc set, with lots of goodies - at least the equal of New Line's excellent Platinum Series release of Se7en.  The package is well-designed, the extras plentiful.  The picture and sound quality are simply exquisite.But what I want to end with - and this is by far the most important point - is not how good the DVD packaging is, but how relevant the film is, especially in light of recent events, when our world was changed forever by real terrorism, rather than the tongue-in-cheek icon-smashing variety depicted in Fight Club.The film was right in its central thesis - we needed something to give us direction, to unite us in a common cause, to develop our character as a generation.  Tragically, and in the most horrible possible way, we got exactly that."	5.0	&#65533;We are the middle children of history&#65533;&#65533;	2001-10-05	5	3	2

B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1SIKR1LWVAV	W. Parrish	I don't really plan on joining the intense debate surrounding this film about it's value,because I think that the debate itself is the greatest testament there is.I can't think of a film in recent memory that has stirred up opinins with more ferocity(except perhaps South Park),and I think that is just as important as the film itself.Great art can,and should be provocative,and challenge our views on things,and in these homogenized,P.C. times films like &quot;Fight Club&quot; that come out swinging and go out on a very long limb in the spirit of free thought are of tremendous significance.Social commentary aside,my take on the film itself is that it's a supurbly executed extended metaphor on one man's epic struggle with his own psyche,ego-vs.altar-ego,conciousness vs.id,what have you.It has a stellar cast:Brad Pitt,rugged anti-hero charisma personified,Ed Norton,the best pure actor of his time,and Helena Bonham Carter,blasting free of her Merchant/Ivory corset with abrasive vigor.Director David Fincher,the visionary wunderkind behind Alien 3 and Seven presents the hallucinatory smart-bomb of a film with an elegently decaying grandure,all damp,sultry atmosphere and paranoid,edge-of-(in)sanity jump cuts.The DVD is impressively mounted,with a unique slip-case and two discs full of goodies,including special effects sequences,art work,tv spots and illuminating commentary by the director and cast.Highly recommended to fans of the film,and those who like to watch something that actually makes them think and feel.	5.0	Great?-Horrible?

Those were not themes but merely  mediums of the message. Nor was this movie about being violent. It was  about allowing YOURSELF to take the hits. It was about allowing life to  maul you, being willing to bleed freely. To feel, to flow, to live, to  change, to die. This is the timeless, universal challenge of every human  who ever lived, spirit trapped in flesh, learning to ride rather than fight  the suffering and thus to live exuberantly every moment.	5.0	In my personal top five	2000-08-06	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A3I92PEEL1B62O	"wysewomon ""wysewomon"""	"_Fight Club_ is not the movie you might think from the trailers and previews. It *is* a movie about a lot of the stuff that often makes American Society of the late 20th century so brutally depressing and unfulfilling, particularly from the point of view of lower working-class men. As such, it has a lot of interesting things to say about bonding, identity and social standards. Because of this, I found the first half of the movie absorbing and witty in a dark kind of way, full of grim humour and cutting observations. After that, however, it really lost its grip on me.The narrator (Edward Norton) is a literally anonymous corporate drone whose only pleasure in life is ordering kitchsy items from catalogues.  A period of insomnia sends him in search of emotional catharsis at various support groups for the terminally ill where he meets Myra (Helena Bonham Carter), another ""voyeur.""  Shortly thereafter, he meets travelling soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a virtual human phrasebook of ""radical"" thought and recipes for making explosives from household products.  The two men discover the dubious transcendent experience of pummelling each other into oblivion and decide that this is what's missing from men's lives.  Thus the Fight Club is born.And that's where the movie lost me.  From that point onward, the cutting, and often humourous, observations about society were too much replaced by scenes of bare-chested men knocking each other about interspersed with Tyler Durden's pseudo-anarchistic dogma.  For someone who's never thought much about society's self-sustaining and materialistic hierarchy, Durden's observations might sound enlightened, but for me it got old really fast.  After about fifteen minutes, I felt as bludgeoned as the men in the club and it was all I could do not to turn the movie off.I was also disappointed in the way the Fight Club itself mutated from a place for men to find themselves and discover their power (however dubiously) into a kind of miltary organization that dehumanized the participants every bit as much as the society they were trying to combat.  Although this is pretty standard cult development, I found it depressing.  I look for movies of this sort to push the boundaries in new and different ways and offer new ideas, if not solutions.  _Fight Club_ didn't do that. It fell back on the same old revolutionary script and became just another movie about guys blowing things up while becoming the thing that they hate.  Was that the point?  I didn't know, and I got the impression that the movie didn't know, either.  It left me with a real feeling of futility.The acting is actually quite good, and a _Sixth Sense_ type plot twist towards the end goes a long way towards redeeming the middle portions of the film but doesn't quite manage it. _Fight Club_ is probably a good movie to see if you're feeling angry with the world and need to have your anger validated.

At the end of the scene, Tyler seems to make the point: Real men don't always beat the crap out of other men, Real Men laugh silly at other men who try their best to make them feel pain, but only fail repeatedly. How would you feel if you sucked in all the power you had, landed a blow on a dude, and he laughed in your face as if to say, ""That's your best shot?"" Not very good, I think.Tyler Durden [Brad Pitt] is the manifestation of every man's fantasy. Good-looking, brash, arrogant, fights like a tank, takes a beating like a tank, ****s like a machine and doesn't do any REAL work.The Narrator [Ed Norton] is the manifestation of most modern men's reality. Plain-looking, dead-end job, no stable relationship, a decent collection of lifestyle accessories and sheer boredom.When the two meet, you might expect the movie takes the usual route where the two men get to learn from each other, and find that each person's life has as many highs as pitfalls, and that your life is what you make of it. Err...no. Tyler is an enigma. A revolutionary of sorts. Hell, he isn't here to ""learn"" about the Narrator. He's here to ""Jack"" his life!!! Tyler Durden is a bigger, larger-than-life figure than James Bond, the Terminator or even Neo. He could easily steal any one of Bond's potential bed-mates from right under his nose. He could easily program the Terminator to believe its existence was useless and that it should self-terminate. He might even make Neo give-up and dump the whole ""Because I choose to.."" talk.This movie may not ""change"" your life, but it will affect it. You will develop a liking for red leather. You will start working on a new walk. You will start sizing people up everywhere you go. You will stop caring about the fact that you're a 6-foot 120-lbs weakling with 13"" biceps. You will start to think, ""I'm sure I could throw ONE good dislocating punch at a 220lbs biker even after I take 4 punches to my face"". You will want to be in better shape. You will cringe at the idea of a woman having any kind of control over your life. You will want to learn the art of dead-pan sarcasm that scares your boss out of his/her wits.

What they think of the movie after all these years and how it's affected them and their careers. Stuff like that.**Spoiler (Kinda)**That menu trick at the beginning was good for a laugh the first time around, but it gets annoying because I have to wait through it to start the movie.	3.0	Tyler Burden Delivers	2011-02-01	3	1	2
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"I am not usually a fan of ""weird"" movies, and ""Fight Club"" definitely qualifies under that distinction.  I'm also not overly fond of movies that throw out sociological themes by the dozen just to ""see what sticks"", which ""Fight Club"" also does quite a bit of.  Yet, in an exception to my personal ""rule"", this movie is so incredibly well-made that it easily vaults onto my ""favorite movies ever"" list.For a basic plot summary, ""Fight Club"" sees a down-and-out business man (Edward Norton) who is completely burnt out emotional, to the point where he actually goes to support groups for diseases he does not have just so he can emote.  One day, however, this man meets the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who takes charge of his life and completely transforms his personality from utterly passive to overly aggressive.  When things get out of hand, however, the pair are at odds over which way their future is headed.Minor Spoiler Alert: This is a movie with a ""twist"" ending.  As such, I won't really say anything more about the plot.  Suffice it to say, though, that ""Fight Club"" covers so much ground that it will feel like you've watched five movies in its time-span.  If you have seen ""The Mechanic"" with Christian Bale, this is a very similar experience.The hallmark of the whole ""Fight Club"" experience, though, is how director David Fincher seamlessly weaves the movie's far-reaching plot themes into something coherent, surprising, & exciting.  At no point in the experience will you feel as if you have this movie ""figured out""...but in this case that is a good thing!  The film is so deep on a sociological, physical, and emotional level that you'll almost feel a little ""wiped off"" from thought after viewing.The acting in ""Fight Club"" also very much suits the overall ""weird"" tone of the movie.  Norton & Pitt provide a nice compliment to each other, while Helena Bonham Carter is interesting in a role that actually has much more significance to the film than one might originally perceive.Simply put, the first time I saw ""Fight Club"" I was completely blown away by the whole concept.  Years later, I watched it again (this time from the ""knowing"" perspective) and was still blown away by its deep themes and interesting concepts.  I could probably watch it again and still catch new things.  So, no matter how weird this movie gets, please DO NOT bail out before the end, where everything finally comes together and begins to make a bit more sense.  Fincher will not fail you if you stick with him!"	5.0	No Matter How Weird It Gets, Don't Bail Before The Conclusion!	2012-03-24	0	0	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1TOML01ZYPUFR	"Zachary S. Houp ""RAREfiend"""	"There might be no rational way to describe this movie, nor the style, nor the story, nor the characters.  It is, in fact, by far one of the most unique and eccentric films that I have ever had the pleasure to witness.  And a true pleasure it undoubtedly was.  In fact, I wish that I could make this a well-rounded review with adequate portions of praises and criticisms, but it is just too well-done, too visually appealing, too imaginative of a film to be attributed with any minute, negative traits.  This is a film that sets about redefining the style of filmmaking; the fact that it succeeds establishes this film as one of the all-time greatest.  Every moment, visual, line, and character is a forward leap in filmmaking that never fails to inspire and impress.First of all, before you ever realize how psychologically deep it is, you'll find it hilarious.  With great attention to the idiosyncratic clash between ""civilized"" culture and the counterculture that opposes it, Fight Club satirizes every institution to great depth.  Nothing is sacred; nothing is revered.  Moreover, visual effects are utilized to a new end, not simply as a device to convey plot, but also to expand the mood, the momentum, and the character psychology.  But as the film continues, as the characters grow and the situation becomes increasingly dire, one can't help but be pulled into this neurotic visualization of criminal life.  It is a story and a set of characters that pulls you into a new world and makes you seriously question the one that you have lived in for all of your life.And all of this couldn't have happened without truly magnificent performances.  Edward Norton is always great, but offers a multi-faceted performance that rivals his more appreciated works.  Brad Pitt is perfect for the role; no one else could have played it as effectively.  And then there is Helena Bonham Carter who is...Weird--and that's what makes her great.  The direction is ambitious and enthusiastic, both heavily to the film's credit.  By being so eccentric, the direction obviously sets and then expands upon the mood from the opening credits to the very last shot--arguably one of the greatest concluding shots in film history.  But none of this would have had any great impact without the clever and meticulous script that always offers a surprise and maintains the momentum during every scene.And so all of this culminates into what has now become one of my all-time favorite films.  There are just so many great ideas offered, so many interesting characters and perversely fascinating images, and moreover such a psychologically profound story that one cannot help but become enthralled with this masterwork of new age filmmaking.  But beyond that, it sets a style that people will be mimicking for some time, but with lesser success.  Fight Club stands as one of the most unique and inspiring films of the 90's.  It certainly deserves your attention and respect."	5.0	Revolutionizing Filmmaking--And I Like Where It Is Taking It	2002-02-15	3	2	1

I found the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt to be nothing less than what I anticipated they would be: outstanding. My favorite scene was the one where Norton beats up himself in order to make his boss give him paychecks without working. If you like movies that will mess with your mind, then I recommend you check out ""Fight Club."""	5.0	Fight Club	2005-05-05	8	4	4

Fight Club is really a simple, albeit captivating, story of one man's journey to  find himself. In the process, he has to fight a lot of demons - internally  and externally. Next to the Matirix, this DVD is one of the best available.  With tons of extras it is a must buy for anybody who liked the movie.	5.0	Powerful, disturbing, very funny	2000-06-23	1	1	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A2IBS27RBKV3LJ	"Zorikh Lequidre ""Zorikh"""	It's a manifesto of facist overthrow! It's a battle cry against complacent consumerism! It's an indulgent work of beautifully shot violence! It's a work showing great promise and brilliance with a cop-out ending! It's a  floor wax! It's a breakfast cereal! Just scan through a few of the reviews  and you'll see these and many other opinions and interpretations of this  movie, all of them strong in their conviction that they are right. Some of  the greatest works of art inspire this sort of reaction.I am willing to  weigh in on the side of this being a great work. I found it captivating,  inspiring, and chock full of personal significance. For me it was a movie  about beating complacency and finding how you are most alive, not sweating  irrelevancies and getting to the heart of what you find fulfilling. It  makes a case for breaking free of what could be called a &quot;comfort  zone&quot; and scraping off the barnacles of a meaningless existence. It  did not promote total revolution, nihilism, or anarchy, but did speak to me  to encourage focus and &quot;letting slide that which does not truly  matter.&quot; I found personal significance because I had been letting my  life get pointless for the past few years, aimlessly stagnating in a dumb  office job and going through a series of predictably limited relationships.  My latest girlfriend had been getting on my case to clear out my room and  get a better job. So my next gig was with a show that toured for three  months, and while on the road I saw this. Meanwhile, she moved into my  building and then broke up with me and soon was dating one of my roomates.  This really helped me relate to the message that no one's just gonna give  you something, you gotta do something yourself. Live to the fullest. I  contemplated this as I lived a life of &quot;single-serving&quot; homes (a  different motel every night) and sought meaning in a life where my love had  left me for a so-called friend.To me, the story was about someone who  had fallen into an unsatisfyingly complacent existence and then discovered  something new that intrigued him. When his old life is irreparably  shattered, he turns to that intriguing new thing and finds that it empowers  him to take what he wants, even if he doesn't realize it. Of course there  are many levels to this, and many interpretations, but this is what it said  to me.I didn't get an urge to tear down society, but the movie did give  me a look at living life more fully and going for what you deserve,  whatever it is.	4.0	ONE BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFAUL, INTENSE RORSHARCH BLOT!	2000-06-14	5	5	0
B00003CWQ2	Fight Club	A1ES633H01ZDHF	Zubbero	With Fight Club, David Fincher was able to put on screen what is probably the most powerful and hypnotic social satire of the 90s.  In the recent years I have often found myself complaining about the level of Hollywood's productions: I feel there's too much dumbed-down, thought-killing stuff around today. Fight Club is a noteworthy exception to this. There's no hero and there's no villain; despite the deep, layered psychological and social analysis, there's no clear message that the viewer can't help but agreeing with. As a matter of fact, this movie asks the viewer to think. Capitalism gives us comforts, but it destroys the environment and, when pushed to the wildest level, is source of alienation or power abuse. Revolution sets us free, but revolution can go too far and can lead to power abuse as well. The sincerity of the movie is in this; you won't find any message that will tell you this is evil and this is good: you have to decide by yourself where the boundaries have to be set.  Fight Club is not about starting underground boxing matches or cults, and it certainly is not a movie that glorifies violence. I can't stress that enough.  Shockingly bizarre at a first look, Fight Club pulls plot twists that every time make you think about previous statements in a totally different light and, like some masterpieces from the past, in the end the whole movie can be analyzed both on a social and a psychological layer that mix together entirely. Brad Pitt gives a somewhat surprisingly excellent performance, and Edward Norton is absolutely fantastic, proving again he's probably the best young American actor today. More, Fight Club throws in some new ideas and concepts, like an inventive use of special effects, and a bizarre timeline (that will be later used at its full extension in the recent Memento).  On top of all that, add that the DVD is easily one of the best you can find around today, full of commentary and extras. Don't miss it.	5.0	Excellent	2001-06-12	2	1	1
