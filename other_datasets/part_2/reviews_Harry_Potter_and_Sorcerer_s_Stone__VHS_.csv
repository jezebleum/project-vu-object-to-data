B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AXJTNYD3UK1BP	"1smileycat ""1smileycat"""	My then 4 & 5 yr old girls and I stumbled upon this on TV one day - and watched intently to the end!  It captivated all of us!Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is the son of 2 wizards and has powers of his own.  Harry sets off for Hogwart's, a school where young witches and wizards learn witchcraft and wizardry.  There he meets and befriends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson).  The three of them are great together!  We watch their adventures as the 3 of them learn different spells and how to use their wands and broomsticks.  Some of the rest of the cast; Alan Rickman as Snape, the Potions Master, the late Richard Harris as Dumbledoor, the Dean of the school, Maggie Smith as Macgonagall, and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, the friendly, giant like, lover of strange animals who also befriends the kids.Harry learns how his parents died and then faces the very evil Valdemort, who tried to kill Harry when he was a baby, leaving a scar on his forehead.  Harry and his friends keep the Sorcerer's Stone safe from evil and the ride along the way is brilliantly done with special effects!  There is one VERY real game of chess played - magnificently orchestrated and will keep you on the edge of your seat!I don't want to give it all away!  This is an excellent movie for kids and adults alike!  I recommend it fully!1smileycat :-)	5.0	Excellent!	2005-01-31	24	20	4
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2Q4NN103KKTUG	"2crowded ""crowded2"""	My 11-year old daughter and I both have been reading the series of Harry Potter books. We saw this movie in the theaters and we both loved it. It was one of those movies that we just had to keep talking about long after it was over. Of course, as soon as the DVD came out, we had to have it!It is, in my opinion, one of the very few movies that actually holds true to the book. The cast and movie direction - it's look and feel - are right on! Everything in the movie is how we imagined it while reading the book. An excellent movie for kids and adults alike.	5.0	Classic for a new generation	2003-01-24	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1PIGCPED659KW	Aaron Oppliger	We had the original DVD set, but decided to upgrade to the blu-ray Ultimate Edition to get the extended cut (and make the jump to HD).  The purchase was well worth it, with the additional scenes making an already great movie even more fun for fans of the books - or just fans of the movie who want to see more.  The image quality is great, and the Ultimate Edition extras have a little something for everyone.  Although I'm not usually a big fan of all the little things that come with a collector's set, the book and behind the scenes material here is fun, and worth diving in to if you have the time.  As for the rest of the Ultimate Edition collection, I'd say that Chamber of Secrets is also worth the Ultimate Treatment (since it also includes an extended cut), but 3-7 are worth skipping in their ultimate formats unless you absolutely need every special feature.	5.0	Ultmate Indeed	2013-12-05	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	I'm one of those adults who's read the books but missed seeing the movie in the theatres and tried the DVD instead. I found the casting to be very good, although Emma Watson as Hermione is too pretty. The story was amazingly faithful to the book, which is very unusual for any book/ movie adaptation with just a few things edited out or rearranged (I believe Hagrid's gift of the photo album to Harry was a Christmas present, not a going home from school gift). It was certainly close enough that a movie viewer could probably get away with claiming to have read the book. I found the 2nd disc to be infuriatingly difficult to get through, most kids won't like to try that stuff. If , as at least one reviewer says, the seven deleted scenes are that hard to find (why doesn't something tell you they exist and how to look for them?)they'd better be good to put up with that run around.	3.0	3 1/2 stars, more faithful to book than most movies	2002-06-20	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1B9UU4O3SZ7C6	A Customer	"When the Harry Potter books came out, I was not one of the ones who rushed to the bookstores to read it.  In fact, I didn't even bother.  A fantasy story about child magicians?  Pish posh, I'm more into books on the level of Tolkien, I thought to myself oh-so-proudly.  I'm a decade too old to read children's fiction, I also thought to myself.When the movie came out, I was one of the ones who didn't feel the slightest inkling to go see it.But while I browsed through the shelves of the local video store looking for a light movie to watch, I decided to give Harry Potter a try.I was impressed, as was my husband.  Halfway through the video we were cheering Harry on and were absolutely glued to the screen.  The next day we went to the video store, this time to buy the DVD.I was pleasantly surprised at how a story, geared for children, could hold and capture my attention.  It was absolutely delightful.  I think ""delightful"" is the best word to describe this movie.  The special effects don't detract from the plot, but help to further move it along.  The effects do their job and suck you into the world of Harry Potter.  This is truly a rare kind of movie, the kind that adults and children alike can enjoy watching together.  There is nothing too deep that children can't understand and there is nothing trite or painfully childish that adults will get bored of.  The thought and imagination that went into the story is brilliant.The innocence of this film is something children will appeal to and adults can appreciate.  People of all ages will find entertainment in this film.Watching this film was a lovely experience for me.  I relived sparks of childhood wonder I felt years ago from reading and watching books and films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Absolutely refreshing and delightful."	5.0	Pleasantly Surprised	2002-07-12	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A29QS888W4AXN7	A Customer	I admit, I watched this movie because of the hype surrounding the nerdy little orphan boy with wizard powers.  Although &quot;Harry Potter&quot; was somewhat engaging, I am uncertain about how much it parallels with the book, and also, who the target audience is.  Some scenes may seem too frightening for younger ones, but the plot itself is a little juvenile for adults.  Some ideas are clever and original, but Rowling instead should be credited.  The movie was not as great as I had expected, and the hype it receives is questionable.  Not bad for rental though.	3.0	needs a little push	2002-07-12	1	0	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3DN4XF7RS53A	A Customer	"First off, if you have a DVD player, then you *must* get this movie. This is by far the best DVD I've ever, and will ever, see. Hands down. This is loaded, I mean, loaded with extras. You can have a 3D tour of Hogwards, Hagrid's home, and you get to cast spells, and much, much more. One of the best things about this disk is that if you want to see the 7 deleted scenes, you have to work for them. You have to find some keys, get your money, get your wand, go to school, and do spells. If you do all of this correctly, you get the honor of seeing the extra scenes.Besdies this being a outstanding DVD, this is a wonderful movie! Join Harry as he learns on his 11th birthday that he's a wizard. ""Yer a wizard Harry"". Harry's life is changed for the better when he goes to Hogwarts to learn magic. The Special effects are impressive. The Quidditch match is worth the pice of the DVD. I highly suggest you get this movie.I'm a big fan of this books. I have just 3 small complaints. And I mean these are small. I'd like to have seen the Weasley twins used more. They were so funny in the book. I also thought that Snape should have been a bit meaner, like he was in the book. In the book, Herimonie used logic in one scene, not magic.I highly suggest that you get this moive. If you do, I promise you won't be sorry."	5.0	The DVD you have to own!!!	2002-06-18	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A170JSRHD87YNV	A Customer	"Unlike some people who complained about Chris Columbus' so closely following the book in his adaptation of JK Rowling's first book in the HARRY POTTER series, I LOVED the fact that all the sights and sounds I had pictured in my mind came so wonderfully to life in this film.Outstanding acting by the 3 juvenile leads, a wonderful supporting cast of Britain's best character actors (a stand-out is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid), fantastic special effects, and a true sense of wonder--something not often found in ""kid"" flicks these days (look at what else passes for a kid flick: Max Keeble's Big Move, Snow Dogs, etc.).The DVD is wonderfully presented, although I must confess that it took me longer than I thought it would to crack the codes to find the deleted scenes.  Beautifully packaged, nicely put together (although it could have used a sneak peek at HP & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS), totally enjoyable.My wife, who did not see the film in the theaters or read the books, became a Harry Potter fan after watching this movie.  Now we are both waiting for the next film--and praying that JK Rowling doesn't off poor Ron."	5.0	A Wonderful Movie--A Great DVD	2002-06-27	5	5	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AA5YETOW434W8	A Customer	The movie is a well-done attempt to condense the book into a watchable, visual version. However, much of the magic is convoluted and the many of the characters are made stale and wooden, partly because it is so difficult to condense this huge and irreplaceable book into a movie. One associate of mine described the acting as &quot;psychotic.&quot; I give the girl who played Hermione Granger a thumbs-up and if you need to know the story for class, watching the movie is a good way to get it fast. But it won't be nearly as enjoyable as reading the book itself.	2.0	Interesting, But Not the Book	2003-12-26	8	6	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	Harry Potter is an orphan who was adopted by his maternal aunt and who is unhappy at home. Then a giant shows up to take him away to a new school and promised happiness (the daydreams of many young teenagers?). This film shows 'Warthogs' as another English Public School, but one that trains wizards instead of future civil servants and management (a parody?). The special effects used here are more advanced than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Would this work be successful without these tricks? Do children benefit from this fantasy or other ersatz fairy tales? Are they a juvenile version of Romance novels?The teacher of &quot;Potions&quot; promises the skill of changing people's minds. Is this a parody of Advertising or Public Relations? The Flying lesson shows interpersonality conflicts, and how disobedience creates a problem for one student. The appearance of the threatening troll creates a diversion (a symbol for &quot;townies&quot;?). The special effects are best in the game of quiddich, much better than in the much older &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Harry captures the gold flying ball and wins the game. [Was the fix in?] The Cloak of Invisibility reminds me of &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (which warned against experimenting with drugs). There is a magic mirror which shows people what they want; the old white-bearded wizard correctly warns against indulging in fantasy! When Harry is threatened in the Dark Forest, a centaur shows up to save him, and warns him to stay away (certain places are not safe for teenagers even if they have magic powers). Harry and his friends learn of a plot to steal the Sorcerer's Stone! This can change lead into gold, and give eternal life (not the same thing as eternal youth!).The chess game with life-size figures is another diversion. Finally the real villain is found; Harry discovers you can't judge by appearances. The villain is killed by the unsuspected magic of Harry. The story ends with Harry celebrating with his friends, an obligatory happy ending for commercially successful films. [Why do the students wear dunce caps?] But what happens after they graduate? I haven't seen too many want-ads for &quot;Wizards&quot;; were these jobs all out-sourced to Romanian? There isn't much of a plot, just loosely connected scenes. But I shouldn't have told you that.	3.0	Diversionary Entertainment	2004-05-21	2	0	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A34VV92TSLC37R	Adam Craig	I first watched this movie about 3 years ago when it premiered on HBO.  I never read the books,  so I didn't really have a reason to go see it in theaters, and I didn't even want to see it enough to go out and rent it once it was on video.  So, one Saturday night when I had nothing better to do, I sat down and watched this movie, and I didn't really like it that much.  I thought it was a little too long, and the plot wasn't really that solid throughout the movie.However, after reading the novel, and now watching it again (after purchasing it), I must say that I have a newfound appreciation for the quality of this film, and the amazing job it does of realizing Harry Potter's world.  The casting is pretty much perfect.  For being first time actors, all the kids are well-spoken, and very believable.  Richard Harris makes a perfect Dumbledore.  But the best casting job was Alan Rickman to play Professor Snape.  Rickman just has the perfect look and body language that I imagined Snape to be like while reading the book.  He gives off a very evil vibe.I was able to forgive what I thought were the film's shortcomings on the second viewing because I now understood that the filmmakers were trying to be as faithful to the book as possible.  The truth is, the story about the Sorcerer's Stone was really a secondary plot in the book, too.  The main point is Harry and his experience at Hogwart's, and now I can see that in the film, as well.  Also, the length is now forgivable, because I felt like it was just long enough to include everything from the book that needed to be included, but still keep it at a manageable runtime, where people who hadn't read the books could still be interested.I never thought I'd be saying this about myself, but I know that I'll be at a midnight screening when Order of the Phoenix comes out.	5.0	Faithful adaptation	2006-02-11	5	4	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	While making any movie based on a popular book (Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings), the movie makers have a major conflict on their hands: should they remain loyal to the fans, and make a movie which is almost identical to the book, or try and adapt it as much as possible to the screen, and make it more available for the general crowd, even though this might require compromises to the original story.LOTR's crew has decided to go with the later - changing the facts of the story, while keeping its spirit. This has made some of the more dedicated fans angry, but has exposed many non - fans to the story. Harry Potter 1, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have decided between the options - some parts of the story were cut for timing or because of their small significance, but nothing was added or changed to clarify the story to the non fans. So the fans weren't happy with the cuts, but anyone else could never understand the story without reading the book first.Another problem with this DVD set is the fact the the special features revolve around games, as if someone forgot that many grownups are also fans of the film.	4.0	Conflicted movie...	2003-11-07	3	3	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1JES038J8GH21	A. Drinkwater	Harry in the book is the modern day Cinderella. He was a reviled slave in the Dursleys' home and getting the tar whipped out of him on the playground, but he wasn't submissive to the abuse. And his parents were murdered for god sakes on top of that. He fought for his own freedoms but took the punishment as well as anybody, in other words exactly the kind of rebel who always gets the short end of the stick and you want to fight for in any sort of a brawl. This version of Harry, the everyman, strong, independent hero kid didn't exactly come accross in the first half hour of the movie. That means that people who haven't read the book can't really get into the movie because they can't root for Harry, and that's what the whole series is about, and that's why you'd sit down for two and a half hours of kiddy fantasy. The same thing that happens when you've read the book in Harry's case occurs with practically every other character. Everyone just blossoms, and you notice nice details that fly completely under the radar when you haven't read the books.One thing that fans may notice is that the literary HP series has more jilted visual style than the movies do, but I say you've got to let that go. Just because Hermione isn't in dire need of braces, and you can actually see Hagrid's face, doesn't diminish the good realization of each characters' personalities.In conclusion, if you're willing to spend the two and a half hours watching the movie, you can afford to spend one night sitting down to read the book, it reads a lot faster than it's couple of hundred pages might indicate.	4.0	A good movie, but read the book	2003-06-10	1	1	0

The casting, especially Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, was dead on; the characters were presented almost exactly as I'd imagined.  The film stuck religiously to the book, which I appreciated, but it did seem to run a little long.  Still, it was quite fun, especially the Quidditch match and the invisibility cloak.  &quot;Harry Potter&quot; made me wish I was a little kid again, with an active imagination and a heart full of wonder.*Note - too scary for little kids	4.0	Hollywood At Its Most Fun	2002-06-30	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2I8L9LTD1LQHX	A. E Rothert	"When I read HP & the Sorcerer's Stone, I visualized, as best I could, many of the magical moments experienced by Harry. And I was eager to see what I had imagined on a big screen. For the most part, I was not disappointed.Chris Columbus -- of Home Alone fame -- directs an all-star cast of British greats, mixed with a load of cute kids who, though not perfect, are creditable in sharing their awe and excitement at the magical world unfolding before them. I especially enjoyed Maggie Smith as one of Harry's teachers at Hogwarts, a part that is anti-thetical to her role the same year in Gosford Park. It is fun to watch seasoned, serious Brits acting in roles less serious and stiff than their norm.What makes this film quite good is how well it was imagined. I am glad that the movie stays faithful to the book. What was in the book is what I wanted to see. Being able to WATCH a Quiddich match is itself worth the purchase price. Likewise for the life-sized-plus chess board. The visuals in the film are invigorating for someone who has read the book and dreamed about how these things would look.The movie's weakness, albeit minor, is the same as its strength. It moves rapidly from one important scene to the next. So much happens so quickly that if one is not familiar with the book and the extensive background it provides, there is a great chance he or she will not ""get"" this movie. For those who already know the story, the movie shows all the parts we wanted to see without spending much time explaining what is going on in Harry's head or flashing back to the past.Finally, I am still flabbergasted that people consider it necessarily to condemn this movie from a religious perspective. Apparently, this movie isn't for people who are too uptight, or those who take all literature too literally."	4.0	A mix of great actors and newbies brings Harry to life	2002-03-30	4	4	0

Like another reviewer, I too saw the ABC Family showing last December (and taped it on my DVR). So when I finally borke down and got the box-set last month, I was shocked that these important scenes were missing! Granted they are in the extra-dvd, but certainly would have been best to keep them in. This was also true for Chamber of Secrets (deleted scenes on extra dvd). Still, as a devoted 40-something fan of all that is HP, I would still recommend the movies (Azcaban is the best in the series of the films).

Not only does the film ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" not let viewers know why the villains are evil (see Boo Radley), but it also finds a way to make the heroes take their place.  Now I know your saying to yourself, ""Hey Alex, it made sense in the book.""  I know, but this is the movie.  Look at ""Lord Of The Rings""!  For gosh sakes, look at Ramona the TV series!  The last scene in HP1 is the most terrible thing I've ever seen in childrens cinema.  For no reason at all, the school takes an award away from the ""bad guys"" and gives it to the ""good guys"".  Of course, everyone rejoices in the film, but are we really trying to teach our children these values?  What happened to being humble?  What happened to likable heroes?  How come video games have better special effects than this big budget movie?  These are all questions you should ponder after the viewing of this truly dreadful film."	1.0	Dumb down your kids with Harry Potter.	2003-04-25	15	2	13

I had read the books (like almost everyone else in the world). *Haha* I knew it was going to be a hit as soon as I sat down in the theatre. It was captivating.(I mean there (or course) were kids all over the place. They were regular kids, noisey, loud, full of energy but, as soon as the movie started it went dead silence. I've never seen a theatre go so quiet so soon. There was one little 6 year old boy that was sitting in front of me. He was really wild. But, I noticed that when the movie started he stopped almost imediatly. I glanced at him a couple times through the movie...he never moved. I'd never seen a 6 year old sit still so long.)The special effect in this movie were great. Chris Columbus did an awesome job.(Thank you, J.K.

In fact, I own two copies of the DVD, and I just ordered this to watch via Amazon Prime for the convenience of turning on my TV to see it... without having to load the DVD player.Yes, I'm that much of a fan.I felt kind of guilty ordering it on Prime, since the DVDs are in a bookcase less than three feet from the TV.  However, when I'm taking a break -- or at the end of the day -- it's pretty darned nice to just fall onto the sofa, turn on the TV, and be able to relax with Harry Potter on the screen, effortlessly.Yep, it's worth every cent, and then some.

I liked the part when Ron says, ""She needs to sort out her priorities."" Filch, Snape, and Malfoy were all ugly, creepy, and sinister enough. It's a three-way tie when it comes to who was creepier. If I had to pick one, I would say Snape gets first, with Malfoy running a close second. If that creepy little kid was Malfoy, I shudder to think what Mr. Malfoy is going to look like in the next movie. Two words, MUST SEE! Harry and Ron were both good actors, not to mention CUTE! The part with the sweets on the train was hilarious, I just love the look on Ron's face when Harry says, ""We'll take the lot.""

Directed by Chris Columbus and starring Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes DVD a magical experience.  It is a 2 disc DVD set.  The movie is wonderful and rated PG for scary moments and some course language.  This film has it all, action, mystery, fantasy, and suspense!  The DVD package even has ""Year one"" on its side, just like the books!DVD number 1 includes the complete movie with Scene access, English and Spanish subtitles, plus the teaser and theatrical trailers!  The opening intro to the DVD menu is spectacular with scenes from the movie and the popular Hedwig's Theme music!  Disc 1's menu has 4 options to choose from: Play Movie, Special Features, Scene Selection, and Language!  The background of the menu is the beautiful enchanting Hogwarts Castle!DVD number 2 has just special features.  The menu opens up to a small intro and you see Hogwarts school get closer and it zooms in, then you're in the Great Hall, and finally the you're at the Teacher's table (The menu).  You can choose from options like a 360 degree tour of Hogwarts (You tour the Great Hall and the Gryffindor common room).  Other options include:*Diagon Alley-Visit Gringotts, Eeylops owl Emporium, or Ollivanders.*Classrooms-go to class to mix potions, and cast spells.*Interviews-Watch interviews with the director and producer themselves, plus get info on the next Harry Potter movie.*Plus you can tour Hagrid's hut at Hogwarts grounds, check out the Library, and even see the extra credit, but you need a PC DVD-Rom drive to access the extra credit features.Then there is the highly anticipated 7 deleted, never-before-seen clips.  Only problem is that they are hidden in disc 2.  To get them you have to got through the Forbidden Corridor, sneak past Fluffy, get the correct winged key and potion, and you'll end up at the Mirror of Erised to get the Sorcerer's Stone and your hearts desirer...The deleted scenes!  They are a reward.  The clips don't come out in the full movie, which many probably expected like I did.  The 7 scenes are: Dudley's uniform, Cracking eggs, Tube ride, After troll, Harry's meditation, Finding Flamel, and Snape's class.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ASC5CH6RALOHL	"Alden Utter ""nedlum"""	I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone between the publications of the second and third books, and have enjoyed them all. When I saw the trailer for the film, I was intriquged. Alright: I wanted to see the movie. A great book, and the trailer was good (although I know well that modern trailers are no indicator of quality). What's not to like?In fact, even watching the movie, I had difficulty finding the flaws. Most of the scenes worked quite well. A violent chess match towards the end of the film was probably the best moment of the film. And none of the acting is really at fault. Richard Harris, how we will miss you, come the third film (note: Harris, who died recently, played Professor Dumbledore). However, although the parts have no major flaws, (forgive the clech&eacute;) sometimes the whole is less then the sum of the parts: for whatever reason, the Sorcerer's Stone is flawed.If I were to hazzard a guess, I'd say the editing is to blame. The movie seems badly paced, with too much time before school starts, cramming the rest of the plot into too small a time period. And some information is given in a far more forced way then it is in the book. There are a few other facets that could have use some major improvements.However, Chris Coloumbus may do right by the second book. The stakes are lower (The Chamber of Secrets is, so far, the low point of the series), as are (my) expectations. He could make it a much better movie then it's precessor. If not, there's a new director for the third. I, with reservations, anticipate the sequal.	3.0	The problem exists, somewhere	2002-11-05	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A9UU8OR0TBMHE	Alexander Nordquist	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was, in my opinion better than the chamber of secrets. I saw the chamber of secrets in the theater but it didn't seem like it was very good and I hope that if they make a movie for all of the books, they will all be worth watching.I'm pretty sure most of yyou reading my review will already know the story but I'll mention it anyway. The story is about a boy named Harry Potter[Daniel Radcliffe] who lives with his evil step-parents, the Dursleys. Untill, one day he gets a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry since he is a wizard even though he doesn't know it. The whole story talks about how he finds out about the Sorcerer's stone which is a stone that can make anyone immortal.I thought that the movie was good except some parts weren't in the movie that were in the book, but there were very few. This is not one of the best movies in the world but it is still funto watch at times. I thought that all of the books were good but my only complaint was that sometimes the plot got a little confusing. The only person I recognize from the making of this movie was Chris Columbus. He was the directer of Home Alone which is also a good movie.The special features include: never before-seen footage, self guided tour of Hogwarts, theatrical trailer and you can perform certain activities. I tried a few of these features but I think they're more for kids.If you are a fan of Harry Potter then you should see this movie. I also think that the chamber of secrets is also worth a try.	5.0	My Favorite Harry Potter movie	2004-01-25	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AHLR77IWR5CMU	Alexandra	Harry Potter is a great series. It pulled out my imagination and captivated it.  I was very gald to hear they were making a movie but i wondered how they would find things that stayed true to reader's images. Well, Harry didnt look like Harry. his hair was too neat and he looked, and was, too shy. But i can deal with that.  Ron wasn't a hot-head either. Hermione-she was cast very well. Draco wasn't mean enough, though.  The picked out a very nice Castle.  it  was how i pictured it. Hagrid's hut wasn't, or the dorms. They skipped a few scenes, and made other things drawn out or happen too quickly.  Though it sounds like im complaing, i love the books so im an awful critic. But, I do think the movie is very good. I do reccomend the book. I'm reserving a copy.	4.0	Pretty good	2002-05-12	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"You have to have a heart of stone - or be a Dursley - to NOT like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I say this not from the perspective of a child, nor the parent of a child, nor even a voracious reader of the J.K. Rowling novels about the boy with glasses and that lightning-shaped star.  Indeed, I only have the first of the five books and that, dear readers, only because my former neighbor and computer troubleshooter gave it to me before he moved to South Carolina.  My taste in movies rarely goes into the realm of ""family fare,"" even though some of my favorite films (E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Star Wars series, among others)  are geared for young and old alike.I must also admit that I only started reading Harry Potter when I had just about gone through most of my Tom Clancy novels, Star Wars tomes, and history books.  I was not sure if I would like it as much as I do, say, Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ms. Rowling's tale is appealing not only to the young but to the young-at-heart.The 2001 film version, adapted by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris (Gremlins) Columbus, is an above-average family film.  While warm and whimsical in places, Rowling's tale is not exactly all syrupy and bright, either.  For the story of Harry Potter, wizard in training, is also a story which deals with fate, losses, fear, courage, friendship, and the struggle between the forces of light and darkness.Sorcerer's Stone follows the plot of its source novel faithfully (some have said ""too faithfully""): an orphaned Harry Potter is left to be cared by his maternal aunt Petunia and her husband Vernon, the terrible Dursleys, after his parents' tragic demise at the hands of Lord Voldemort, a dark and deadly wizard.  For most of his 12 years, Harry lives in a cupboard under the stairs.  When strange things start happening on his cousin Dudley's birthday outing and owls start flooding the house on Privet Drive with letters from Hogwart's School of Wizardry, the Dursleys try to hide Harry in a remote shack out in the boonies.  But Harry's destiny is not to be denied, and he is whisked away by Hogwart's trusted groundskeeper Hagrid.Kloves and Columbus recreate Rowling's novel almost perfectly, catching all the nuances and details just right.  Though this makes for a running time of 152 minutes, Sorcerer's Stone never drags or brings on snores...at least not for older kids and young-hearted adults.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grant and Emma Watson are excellent in their roles as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger; their camaraderie and pluck is convincing, and the supporting cast, which includes John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, is an exciting and talented ensemble.  Adding his usual musical magic to Harry's adventures is none other than composer/conductor John Williams, whose soaring themes and gentle underscores give extra excitement to the Quidditch match and dark menace to those dark passages within the walls of Hogwarts.The  Special Widescreen Edition DVD consists of one disc that contains the film itself (with English and Spanish audio tracks, plus subtitles in both languages) and a few extra features, plus a second disc with DVD-ROM features, games, puzzles, interviews, and links to the Web.The sound and picture are excellent, and the movie itself seems destined to be a family classic along the lines of The Wizard of Oz and the great films of Walt Disney."	5.0	Harry Goes To Hogwarts!	2003-07-03	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1JHQT5ZS4JDCC	Alex	For those who doesn't know (a think there will be very few people) Harry potter tells the story about a boy ,who lives with his uncles and at his 11 birthday, is told that he will become a great wizard just as his parents were. From that point and on, the adventure begins....We are witness of the magical enviroment harry is living. As he said, he's home. And that home involves 3 head dogs, owls who deliver the post, moving newspaper pictures, a football-kindof game on brooms, and on and on...It contains all the elments from the book! Even most of the dialogs are loyal to the book.This may not be the best movie ever, but for those who enjoys a great movie with a lot of innocence and adventure, without any war , disasters, or any other sad event, this is a must buy.One fact that i find very interesting is that the harry potter book series had brought back the reading habit for a lot of people , especially the youngs. In a world where Playstation and nintendo rules, it's grateful to know that a story so simple and entertain could steal some fans from the tv screen's. That could fight any bad review from any critic.... besides, is a great DVD: the movie has excelent john williams' music, great performances from british actors who portrays the teachers, a lot of features, deleted scenes, a tour to howarts school, etc.One thing is for sure, you won't regret buy this one.

(The Philosopher's stone is a real medieval legend. The title of the book and movie were changed for American audiences. British and Canadian versions have slightly different scenes were the characters say the proper name of the stone.)I have to admit, as I saw the movie I had a big smile on my face. I particularly like Ron &amp; Hermione and Hagrid, although Daniel Radcliffe makes a good Harry. Maybe a little too good. In the book, Harry is not perfect. His mistakes have been sanitized in the film.I found most of the joy I had in watching this film came straight from the book. And overall, the movie is fairly faithful. Maybe a little too much. Peter Jackson's LOTR re-imagined the novel to make it work better on film. At times, the Harry Potter film just seems like a plot summary of the book. Good -- but it doesn't quite sparkle. There is magic in the film, but it is borrowed from JK Rowling's book. LOTR creates its own magic.I also didn't like the Quidditch effect as it seemed confusing and the characters didn't mesh with the background.As for the DVD, it's nice looking. The special features -- well, I've seen discs with a lot more, but there's a good assortment here. Kids might have a lot of fun trying to find the stone and Deleted Scenes. Adults might want to just cut to the chase.Nice that the DVD has the sorting hat song. I wish the film had kept it.All in all, it's an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.

I'm not saying it didn't captivate me the first time I saw it, my face had a permenant smile on it the whole time.... I'm just saying.I recently rented the DVD and it is wonderful. To get to the extra scenes is a bit annoying but if you just remember to get your wand and then click on the collum in the classroom place you'll be fine. :)If you saw this movie in the theaters and you weren't to thrild with it, I ask you to please try it again. It really keeps on getting better and better each time, and the kids make the movie.Daneil Radcliffe as Harry is perfect. He embodies everthing Harry is and how he looks in my mind (and many others at that),on his preformance i give you a quote from Ron(Harry's friend)..."" That was bloody brilliant!"" Ron in the film is played by Rupert Grint, who is adorable as well as a source of hummor. And we must not forget that little clever witch Hermione, who is played perfectly by Emma Watson.Also if you are a fan of any of the following actors this film is worth a shot: Dame Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Richard Griffiths, Alan Rickman, Ian Hart, or Robbie Coletrain. All do a wonderful job and Robbie as Hagrid adds a hole lot of hummor to the film with his abbsent mindedness and odd tastes for pets. :)I look forward to the other films and hope that they keep the amazing cast that they have now, especially the kids!Bottom line: Great film, Great fun, After you watch it, read the book(s), you'll love it even more. :)p.s.

Sure, it's not as good, but movies never are.The DVD is very well presented, the tabs that hold the discs in are too stiff for my liking, it's just a matter of time until it breaks. The discs are very well laid out. Disc 1, just the movie, language selections and cast list. Disc 2 is enormous, you can't just browse either, you have to play around, catch the snitch, tap the wall @ Diagon Alley, etc, in order to see more stuff. I would say that this presentation has been designed to enhance the whole experience for the Potter die hard.If you are looking for 'making of featurette's' and director's commentry, wait for the next version of the DVD (not that I know anything, I'm just guessing)	4.0	Don't be put off	2002-05-31	0	0	0

Rowling knows how to spin a scene from the pages of a book right into your imagination, without you lifting a finger. In the same way, the movie takes you into a delightful version of Harry's world.The adult actors are quite good - all known to be solid performers. Alan Rickman as Snape is perfect, as is Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid. The kids are noticeably new to this (they improve with each successive movie), but fortunately, the roles aren't all that demanding.  The kids play kids.  The three leads playing Harry, Hermione, and Ron are warm and appealing.What limits the movie isn't the bringing a fantasy world to life (the special effects are marvelous), but adhering so closely to a literal interpretation bypasses all those subtle hints of things to come that Rowling slips into all her books. So Malfoy is *only* a bully and Hermione is *only* a brain - there is little texture to their characters.I like the fact that the actors are all British. It makes it feel more authentic and less forced. That being said, it's another thing to look at the scenery. The London scenes and the interiors of Hogwarts looked wonderful. The Quidditch scenes themselves were fine, but the backdrop - ugh! It's too bold, flat, and not realistic enough. Instead of creating it all digitally, as it appears, they should have just shot a real location and put it into the scene.So, all in all, it's a good movie that can be rewatched when you're in the mood for something charming and adventurous.	4.0	Kid-tested, mother-approved fun	2002-09-05	0	0	0

I am referring to the believability of the Wizarding world, which is the very heart of this movie. It is what Rowling was going for in her first novel and was beautifully conceived by Columbus and his Visual Effects wizards.Even the cast was perfect, the trifecta playing Harry, Ron and Hermione was key through the whole movie. The movie virtually has no supporting cast because every actor on screen plays nicely into their roles. Especially the late Sir Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith who play their roles with such fervor that no one else could do it better (As Gambon is learning now playing Dumbledore)Overall a fine movie with, given a few years, classic movie status.	5.0	A Pleasing First Entry	2007-04-22	3	3	0

Sometimes a good book is made into a great movie (Wizard of Oz), and sometimes a great book is made into a good movie (Black Stallion)- this was a great book made into a great movie. There is nothing significant added to the movie as it is very true to the book, but there is an amazing reproduction of what most of us would have thought was our individual vision of Rowling's world.I was thrilled with the movie in the theater, I was just as enthralled with this DVD at home.  For those of you who haven't read the book - watching the DVD will give you an excellent feel for the world within Rowlings magical books.  Owning this DVD will allow you to revisit the original story, or allow a younger child to `catch up' to the series.  Rowling's world is a world of Light and Darkness, good verse evil, magic and bravery and plenty of adventure.  The lessons taught are lessons in surviving hard times, making the right choice (not the easy choice), putting the wellbeing of others before your own, and standing up for what you believe in.As a Christian I have great difficulty believing that letting children turn their imaginations lose into this magical fantasy will somehow take them to the dark side. I grew up reading about Casper the friendly ghost and his friend Wendy the witch, and I have yet to practice any kind of black magic or voodoo - but it did help to develop a lifetime love for reading.Adding this movie to your home collection will be a good investment.

However, for those who have I think many will be disappointed.  The movie lacks the sparkle of the first novel since many of the humorous vignettes that make the book special have been deleted for lack of time.  I would have gladly spared some compression of the plot to spend more time with the Weasleys and other important though not large characters.The main players are fine in their roles.

I am addicted to Harry Potter. The books have a magical quality that I did not expect the movie to convey, but I didn't really expect the movie to be awful. It was awful. Wretched, in fact.The acting was just terrible and the casting... My lord, who came up with these actors? Aside from Hermione, Professor McGonigal, Professor Snape (and in the later movie, Lucius Malfoy), this movie was just terribly cast. Who decided that Ron was a bumbling idiot? What happened to Harry's relentlessly messy hair and, when exactly was it, that the moviemakers decided he should be a cocky little snot? Hermione was both well-cast and well-portrayed, but sadly they took out her best scenes.The story was choppy and so badly cut that the movie made no sense - why did Harry suspect Snape of trying to steal the Stone? Snape hadn't done anything yet! I am filled with sorrow that something with so much potential was so badly mishandled.Fortunately, Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets was a bit better. The terrible casting persists, of course - as it must - but the story held together and the special effects were dramatic without being overdone.

For instance the loathing of the Dursley's that Harry feels, why the Dursley's hate magical people so much, how extensive Harrys fame is in the magical world.  But the thing that great fantasy movies have which this film lacks is a narative at the begining.  like the scrolling script at the start of Star Wars, or the spoken narative at the start of the Highlander.

I have to say I'm glad the directors didn't stray from the book, the film is supposed to be the book in an alternate form...NOT rewriting of the work set on film. I do wish the directors hadn't hacked out so much of the funny stuff (i.e. most of Dean Thomas' and Fred &amp; George's comments) but the film was getting rather long as is. The DVD is essentially what a DVD should be...it has the film and a few extras. I have to say I LOATHE the second disc. It's a pain to go through so many steps to view the deleted scenes (and after you go through the effort you wonder why you bothered, they're nearly all from the same sequence), a majority of the &quot;tours&quot; are pointless, and the &quot;games&quot; are mind numbing. The makers could have spent a bit more on the package itself, cardboard breaks much more easily then the plastic alternative. Also the &quot;locks&quot; which hold the DVDs in place are too small and too tight, you nearly have to wrench the poor DVD out of its casing.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A37RJ8A8G3BZJC	AmyofOK	While the Harry Potter books are undisputably fantastic, it is widly agreed that the movie is, well, good.  J.K.Rowlings has the humor of Roald Dahl and the magic of J. R. Tolkien.  That being said, any attempt to transform the books into movie form would be incrediably difficult, at best.  Director Chis Columbus did an acceptable (not wonderful) job.  But the makers of this DVD redeemed the movie's shortcomings.This movie is true to the book regarding plot and events.  However, by skimming over the details - like all the magic Harry learns in school, Nevile's trials, compacting time, Harry's nightmares, etc.- much of the magic and charm was lost.(I should mention that my love of the books most certainly jaded the movie for me.  For example, my new boyfriend - in what was most certainly an attempt to win my affection - took me to see this in the theatre.  He -a grown man and a fan of NASCAR and baseball- thought it was a great movie.  We've been dating for a while now so I would know if it really bored him)The DVD restores much of the magic from the book in what is the most interactive, creative and fun DVD I have ever seen.Most DVDs have &quot;special features&quot; consisting of bland mini-documentaries, cast lists and, occasionally, an intersting cut sceen or two.  This DVD has truly SPECIAL special features.  There is a game, a really cool guided 3-D tour of the grounds and of the dorm - you can choose which way to go, look at details - it is really neat.  You can make potions in class, go to Digon Alley and buy an owl, take money from Gringott's bank,and try out wands.  It is very imaginative.There is also a cd-rom game which I have yet to play (because it might make it obvious to my co-workers that I'm goofing off).This gets my stamp of approval.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AX2SQL63A5CMV	"Andrew Dobson ""AKA 'Tom Preston"""	The long awaited Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone movie was well worth the wait. Sad to say, however, that the long awaited DVD was not. The Special Features amount to &quot;theatrical trailers.&quot; Which is sad for a 2 disk set. I personally found the 2nd disk's &quot;game&quot; (which is what Disk 2 is) annoying. Unless you did everything right, you would not be allowed to advance. I can understand that the filmakers wanted to &quot;expand&quot; the harry potter world, and let kids roam freely. In which case why not make a PC game instead? why waste your money on making a DVD game, instead of providing the special features we have all come to expect and enjoy from DVD's? The only good thing about it is a 15min Interview with the filmakers which provides very little into the making of the movie. If you ask me, you're better off buying the Widescreen VHS or something than to waste your money on a 2 disk set with no features.	2.0	No Features Here Folks	2002-06-04	5	3	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing."	4.0	it's the first one.  what do you expect?	2006-10-17	3	3	0

Daniel Radcliffe plays a good Harry Potter, but he's too cute to be as dorky as Harry Potter is supposed to be!  Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) is well-played and she suits the part.  Rupert Grint does an amazing job as Ron Weasley, looking and acting the part perfectly.  Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid) also looks and acts the part well.  Most of the characters are well-played, but the book is something else and the movie is something else.  You just can't get the magic of the book with the movie.  My advice is see it once at the movie theatre, but don't buy the DVD.  Watch it for Harry's sake only.	3.0	Entertaining, but the book is better	2002-03-23	2	0	2

I'm not rating it against every other movie I've seen in the past year, I'm rating it within it's class.  It is simply a great film for your family to enjoy all together.  I have kids that are several years apart (3 and 9), and, having been exposed to years and years of the same old kids movies, have been longing for new live-action G/PG movies that we can ALL watch and enjoy.  My recommendation -- get it and watch it with your family.  But be sure to share and enjoy the books, too!Note, though, that though I've nearly had my fill of animated kid's movies over the past 10 years, the one this year that really stole my heart -- and was in fact my favorite movie of the year hands down -- was Monsters, Inc.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3A4E4BNCRLLS	Anne Orsi	"Closely following the plot of the book, this is a truly wonderful children's movie.  I don't know of any adults who have disliked it, either.Harry Potter is an abused child who suddenly finds he is heir to a wondrous fortune -- not necessarily in money, but in his invitation to escape his misery by attending the most famous magic school in the world: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Hogwarts is a great relief for Harry, who had no way out of his horrible predicament before.  He makes friends of adults and peers, learns the ethics of using his incredible talent, and even learns that among persons of magic he is quite famous and respected, even at the tender age of eleven.Unfortunately, Harry also has enemies.  The fame and respect came at an enormous cost: the lives of his parents and the permanent scar on Harry's forehead.  He knows none of this until he is told about it by one of his new friends.Enemies are lurking all around Harry.  There is Snape, the potions teacher who appears to be the living manifestation of nastiness.  There is Drake Malfoy: snob, rich kid, powerful and known wizard in his own right, and Harry's nemesis from their first meeting.  And there is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named: Voldemort, the great evil wizard who killed Harry's parents, tried to kill baby Harry, and who was nearly destroyed by baby Harry in the process.  His reappearance in the wizarding world coincidentally coincides with Harry's matriculation at Hogwarts.  Voldemort is an invisible enemy who is always present.  He is terrifying, vindictive, and apparently single-minded in his efforts to destroy Harry completely.Harry and his best friend Ron together with Hermione Granger, the smart girl who can research and answer most of the questions the less-studious boys present, make it their goal to prevent any harm to anyone by Voldemort and his minions, while dodging the immediate threat of Malfoy and his minions.  Their efforts result in a number of broken school rules, use of their newly-acquired magical abilities in creative ways, and of course a battle for the school title against Malfoy's dorm and a battle to the death against Voldemort.Yes, there are bad guys who can do nasty magic.  Before the Christian Right gets bent out of shape about it, they should know that more important are the good guys who use that magical talent for only good things: to heal injuries, to right wrongs, to defend their friends.  Children are not meant to believe HP is a true story.  Because they are better able to suspend their disbelief, they are much more able than their rigid parents to enjoy the film for what it is.  It is a made-up story full of make-believe people with make-believe abilities.  Anyone afraid that kids will attempt to ""try this at home"" needs to get a grip on reality and permit imaginations to explore the limits, removal of those limits, and their consequences.  While Harry's magic gets him away from an abusive home, it thrusts him into a sometimes worse situation:  his safety and life are threatened.Don't worry, kids: Nobody really gets hurt in the movies.  Sometimes they get really big ouchies, though.  And HP is full of suspense, excitement, thrills, and adventure.  Never fear!  The school nurse can painlessly cure anything from multiple broken bones to major head injuries in practically no time at all.The movie hit most of the important parts and the story line was very cohesive.  In my opinion, the only thing missing is the development of Harry & Ron's friend Neville.  There is a little at the beginning of the Hogwarts segment about him and his pet frog, but the interplay that causes him to try to stop the three main heroes from going after the Sorcerer's Stone is sadly missing.  Thus, even those of us who know the book well are startled that Neville suddenly reappears toward the end of the movie.  Those who haven't read the book just don't get why Neville bothers to take it upon himself to try to stop Harry and his two best friends from their last effort to protect the Sorcerer's stone from the most evil wizard of all.The actors chosen to play each of the parts were perfect.  Snape is truly wicked and makes a fabulous villan.  The Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Quirrell, is deceptively silly and nice, and brutally evil.  Dumbledore is wonderfully wise and his eyes sparkle just as they should.  Hagrid is exactly the way he should be -- fun, protective, fascinating, kind, gruff, innocent yet knowledgeable about so many things.  I cried during Harry's performance before the Mirror of Frised.  (No, fellas, this is NOT a ""chick flick."")Errant viewers expect every scene and conversation from the book to be in the movie.  It can't be done, guys!  At least not unless the book could have been read aloud with passion in less than 2 hours.I recommend this DVD for children over seven.  The suspense may be too much for them, and some of the scary characters may be too frightening for them.  Eights and over, including teenagers and adults, will find the movie spellbinding."	4.0	HP is a Wonderful Cinematic Experience	2002-07-26	7	7	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2QH42LDUZHO	Anonymous	"Having read the books multiple times (I re-read the 1st ones every time a new one came out) I was very psyched to see the film.  The sets, casting, screenplay, acting, etc was superb... every little detail of the world of Harry Potter was marvelously captured on screen with intelligence, humor, and love of all those involved.  Every scene was straight from the 1st book, even though not the entire book was within the film.  Sigh, this is a child's film & therefore I understand that they couldn't have everything from the book in the film because that would have made it 3+ hours long.The only major drawback was the very badly done CGI during the Quidditch games.  They did so well with every other scene in the film, but abruptly threw the games together.  Every single time they shifted from live action to CGI it was painfully noticeable.  When I see a film I like to lose myself within it, and the 2nd rate work they did with the CGI during the Quidditch matches threw me right back into reality.  Because of this I would have given it 4  stars, but Amazon likes whole numbers.As for the DVD... there is no ""real"" making of Harry to mention, or for that matter any special features at all... AND THEN I had to go here to Amazon to find out that you MUST play the game on disc two to be able to see the deleted scenes.  I never play the games held in the DVD's because they always are too easy, or poorly done to even bother.  Sometimes they are also hard to control with the remote (which is really bad being that I watch my DVD's on a PS2!) I have to tell TM & Warner Bros. Shame on you for ripping off the fans, for the extra money spent for a DVD, one should get more extras.  For example, ""Lord of the Rings"" gives you all the special features you expect in a DVD & a 10-15 minute sneak peak of the next film...  I would have given this DVD 3 stars, but the film is still so good I averaged the ranks together and gave it 4 stars."	4.0	Harry 5 stars, but the DVD only 4 stars, here's why...	2002-06-06	1	1	0

Of course, by that time, why someone like me would have heard something about this 11 year old boy, or maybe about his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger? I was sure getting away from something I couldn't skip, and that is the much-hyped media phenomenom Harry Potter.After being harrassed by my own sister and bored as hell in one rainy day, I finally decided to read the first pages of this book called ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", the first of four books available at the moment. I was caught by the magic of the book and read it within two days. I couldn't stop looking at it! it was like an obsession, thiking 24/7 about what would that package at Gringotts have inside and things like that. It was then when I started to follow the new trend, the Harry Potter one.It was finally time to go and watch the movie at the theater. After a superlong line, I got the enter the theater and I could watch the most faithful adaptation of the book to the screen that could have been done. The movie itself is a really well-done picture, where all the characters look exactly as you pictured them when you read the book and re-created the scenes in your mind...you could have swore someone read your mind and put what you thought on film!!Although the movie has countless magnificent special effects, and some breath-taking scenes such as the impopular Quidditch match, I definetely prefer the book, which in my opinion is 10x better then the movie. But at the end it's not so bad, that's why it will get 4 stars ...If you haven't seen this movie yet, it's something I recommend!!!

Many of the parts of the book have been completely eliminated. The action night adventure entitled ""The Midnight Duel"" in the book was completely eliminated, and actually ruins the whole point of them being afraid of Filch. The scene with them rescuing the dragon was also completely eliminated. The scene in the Forbidden Forest was also  shortened. Basically, once Harry reaches Hogwarts, there are very few BIG action scenes until the end. (I'll also add that that has less action than in the book.) Nothing has been done to the action scenes to make them acceptable movie action scenes. Many of the effects are completely unbelieveable. It is almost impossible to look at that Centaur, Voldemort, or that Quidditch match and not notice how fake everything looks. Nobody acting in this movie was doing their best, espechily Harris, who's performance lacked any of the humor described in the book, but I guess the director is more to blame for that. Columbus does such a better job in Chamber that this movie looks like a complete joke in comparrison. But it was cool to watch, to see the things come to life, the wizarding world come to life, so 3 stars. I received this DVD for free.

I was so enormously charmend by the fantastic visual effects (they surpass STAR WARS EPISODE II), the screenplay and the wonderful cast. You need not be a fan nor read any of the books to understand what's happening. There are little hints and explanations (for both Children and Adults) that guide you through the film.One reviewer had wrote something like ""The Next Wizard of Oz"", despite it's time and the technicol beauty of ""OZ"" there always seemed something missing from it. POTTER brings it all back.There are a few scenes that maybe a little scary for the little one's and there are some crazy religious fanatics out there that have chastised the film for what they call evil, however, the film is pruely innocent. It demenstrates true friendship, understanding of other people's differences and the beauty of once being a child.You really must see this film.As for the DVD, it could be a little better on the second disc. The menus are quite annoying and I still can't seem to find the ""deleted scenes"". The talent bios could have been detailed and it's really not necessary to make supplemental material somewhat of a game.The sound and transfer on the other hand is magnificant, colors are vivid and the soundtrack shines! The only reccomendation, if you do have small children that have tendency to get a little scared easily, turn the volume down."	5.0	Without Question - The Best Children's Film I've Seen	2002-06-13	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AXSH6O4OP5L4M	"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen"""	"Okay, I admit it, I got the Harry Potter film.  No kids in the family except me, my husband and a Great Dane, but that's kids enough.  Although I was rather disappointed with the film when I saw it in the theater, I decided to purchase it anyway.  For some reason, it's a better TV sized product than it was a large screen film.  Chris Columbus has directed a number of kid type movies, including Home Alone,  Mrs. Doubtfire, and Stepmom, but I think his concept of kids and family, although wacky enough, is not quite sinister enough to put the bite into the Harry Potter stories that exists in the books.  Harry deals with some pretty heavy duty facts of life, including the death--which he later discovers was murder--of his parents, the active dislike and abuse of his caretakers, the dislocation of going away to a school where he knows no one and must discover for himself whom to trust, and so on.  Although arrayed in the majesty and mystery of an ancient and occult world, Hogwarts becomes home and family to Harry.  It is, however, not a home and family free of conflict and danger, as Harry soon discovers.  Columbus follows the book closely,  almost slavishly, but little of that sense of suspense and threat seems to exist despite a lavish set and wonderful performances by all of the cast.  One almost has a feel of ""holding back"" on the part of the director, as though children can't handle the grit of a truly ""scary"" movie.  I mean, get real.  Like who went/goes to all those monster movies that have been shown at Saturday matinees for generations!  I know a six year old whose favorite film is Jurassic Park.  There were several episodes that could have scared the socks off of us, but although they were wonderful visually, they were a great disappointment as a scary experience.  Maybe it's just that ones imagination can create scarier monsters than the screen can, but I doubt it.  There's always Alien to disprove that theory!  I had heard that Steven Spielberg had requested to make the film.  I can't help but think that someone who gave us both Jaws and ET could have given us a better, more intense and more meaningful film.  The movie as it is does better on a smaller screen, however.  Maybe it's just that we've come to expect less from a made for TV movie.  As it goes, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has such a magnificent set, costuming and special effects, that it shines on the small screen which seems to be its natural home.  Perhaps that's what was planned all along.  Marketing is a powerful force."	4.0	Better on a small screen	2002-06-12	3	3	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1IOOXZNLHDB6C	avid reader	"The movie of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was, without a doubt, quite overrated. The book allowed one to reach into their minds and imagine the school and the setting, but the movie showed it to you and made you think less of the great excitement and more of the ""cool special effects."" This is a problem because in the book there were no special effects- just excitement, creativity, and MAGIC.On the other hand, that's how movies are. If they didn't come out and show you the setting they may as well have photocopied the book and recorded it. The movie can't be really blamed for that. Although it seemed like the movie creators were showing off at some parts (like when Harry, the main character, was so modestly lost and how poor he was at his old home) the special effects and ideas of the story were pretty good.They could have chosen a wider variety of music- it got a little annoying, and, as many of our young viewers would point out, ""corny."" But it was nice music- there isn't really much more to say. Anyway, if you were thinking about getting this movie, you'd be better off waiting for Star Wars: Episode 2 or The Lord of the Rings to come out. Or you could read the books- they are much better than the movie."	2.0	It could have been better	2002-07-09	3	0	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1TD3MUVZXMSDB	"""a_yeloo_zar"""	It's one thing to say that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone didn't align directly with the book.. However, for a movie with a target audience of children it's not possible to incorporate every single part of the original storyline unless you wanted a 5 hour epic.  Credit must go both to JK Rowling and Chris Columbus for this project which capitivated almost all sectors of it's audience.The performance of Tom Felden as Draco Malfoy seems to have gone largely un-noticed...  I believe that he equals if not out-doing Daniel Radcliffe.  Also, the all-British casting of the show worked to great effect as it kept a sense of continuity in the  accents and subtle nuances of the character.This movie is amazing.. sure! buy it for your children (but get a second copy for yourself while you're at it) You'll be swept away by the amazing characterisations, the music, the cinematography and the pure magic which goes to make up &quot;Harry's Wonderful World&quot;	5.0	Everything and more...	2002-06-03	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"I didn't review the Potter movies when I first got them, because they were at the height of their popularity, and I figured everyone already knew as much as they wanted to about them.Having seen the later ones, it's refreshing to go back and see our favorites, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) looking so young and innocent. And downright cute! They are supposed to be 11 years old, and I think they were about that, but they seem so incredibly young.This is also one that has Richard Harris as Dumbledore. I loved him as Dumbledore. Did he do just one movie or two? [Two.]Anyway, the story is very well known by now. Harry was one year old when the evil wizard Voldemort (""He Who Must Not Be Named"") killed his parents but failed to kill him, leaving him with a lightening-shaped scar on his forehead instead. Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the only person You-Know-Who ever feared, decides to place the orphaned Harry with his aunt and her husband, the ""worst kind of muggles,"" the Dursleys.Sure enough, they are indeed pretty impossible people. Their piggish son Dudley is spoiled completely rotten, Uncle Vernon is an ass and heartless toward Harry, and Aunt Petunia has always thought of her witch sister, Harry's mother Lily, as a freak. They never told Harry about his parents, but instead claimed they had been killed in a car accident.But on Harry's 11th birthday, he receives mail addressed to him from Hogwarts which Uncle Vernon destroys before he can read it. Finally, Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts, shows up to take Harry to get ready for his first year, and off they go to London, to Diagon Alley. From there, Harry rides the Hogwarts Express, where he meets Ron and Hermione.The plot is complex and detailed, despite it having been simplified considerably from what the book includes. Much of the charm is the setting of Hogwarts itself, an ancient castle with wonderful magical properties, including all sorts of charming special effects.Without going into too much detail, Harry is chosen as the youngest seeker on the Quidditch team (a sport played on broomsticks that slightly resembles basketball, hockey, and several other team sports that chase balls), and of course is brilliant in it. But the movie only includes one game, although there are several in the book. Just as well, I say; I'm not a sports fan.The sorcerer's stone in the title is what traditional alchemy calls the philosopher's stone. It has many magical powers, including the ability to formulate an elixir of life that grants immortality. The story of the stone, how it is guarded at Hogwarts, who is trying to steal it, and what Harry, Ron and Hermione have to do to foil the plot, is the basis of the story I won't spoil for those who have not yet seen it. Since it's perfectly obvious, I don't suppose there's any harm in saying they succeed.There are terrific special effects in this movie, my favorite being a bigger than life wizard chess set. Wizard chess is played just like Muggle chess, except that the pieces are enchanted and smash each other instead of merely capturing. Fortunately, Ron is good at chess, or all would have been lost. He plays a knight, Harry a bishop, and Hermione a rook/castle. When Harry successfully checkmates, the king throws down his sword.I've seen the movie about as often as I've read the book, which is quite a few times each. I used to chafe at the number of elements that were in the book but left out of the movie, or shortened to the point of being barely mentioned. But I have long since accepted that these are two different media, and have different needs. The books are excellent books, and the movies are excellent movies. They don't need to match.I give the whole series five stars."	5.0	I Loved the Entire Series	2012-05-14	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ALR35EFI69S5R	"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman"""	Approaching this film as an entity separate and apart from its fabulous reputation as the first in a series of books that have broken all records for children's literature, one must still stand in awe at the finished work in terms of its storyline, special effects, and splendid performance by an ensemble cast that transforms the beautifully articulated words from the books' author to a literal vision capable of transporting the viewer into the magical world of Harry Potter.  While I have read the books, I must admit to being less of a fan of them than many, for reasons I won't belabor here. Yet even I have to admit that this film constitutes a wonderful object lesson that the supernatural world of youthful magician's apprentices can in fact be faithfully and artfully depicted by a director who also happens to be singularly capable of envisioning the world of special effects and wonder described in the novels. This is great stuff! And as far as entertainment goes, this is an overwhelming success.From the depiction of Harry Potter himself and his own native sense of wonder and mischief, to the motley crew of sidekicks, assorted hangers-on, and fellow craftsmen to be, the movie works as a vehicle for exploring the alternative world of possibilities such activities portend. From beginning to end, this is a kind of busman's tour of the world of the Brother Grimm turned upside down, falling over into wild adventures and merry childlike fantasies. None of it is substantial, however, and while I can readily applaud the skill and craft that went into making such a faithful production of this first of many novels about Harry Potter, I would also like to mention that this is all really just frosting, none of it very educational or useful for anything other than entertainment. And while the reading of the books at least fosters an appreciation for the possibilities of stretching the imagination and reading skills of the reader, the film version does nothing but push forward a solipsistic view of the world as a dominion best left to wizards and hobgoblins to worry about.  It is a sort of slap-happy fairy tale, but is one that is cleverly disguised as a youthful adventure. Enjoy it as entertainment. That's all it really is.	5.0	Wonderful Fantasy Adventure Fro Children &amp; Adults!	2002-06-19	6	5	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"I have to say right at the get go that I know absolutely nothing about Harry Potter. Zilch. Nada. Never read any of the books or heard anything about them. I had no idea what the blazes a hogwart or muggle was. But, I have to admit that I was a wee bit curious. What was all the fuss about?. I went into this film stone cold and was very surprised. First of all, you don't need to be a Harry encyclopedia. Things are pretty well explained to you. You won't be lost. I was expecting it. Daniel Radcliffe plays 11 year old Harry Potter, who is dropped on his aunt and uncle's doorstep as a baby. Flash forward 11 years later and Harry is living a most miserable life. His relatives are the most horrid bunch. They make Harry sleep under the stairs. Then, Harry begins to get letters from Hogwarts School. A large giant of a man named Hagrid(played by the loveable Robbie Coltrane)comes and tells Harry that he is a wizard and takes him to Hogwarts school for Wizardry. There, Harry befriends Ron(Rupert Gint), and Hermione(exceptionally played by the drop dead adorable Emma Watson). While learning his abilities at the school, Harry and his new friends discover that the sorcerer's stone is hidden under the school and that someone is trying to get to it. Who is it?. Why do they want it?. These are questions you will have to see the movie to find out. The supporting cast is the best of the best. These people include Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the great Richard Harris. Keep your eyes open for cameos by John Cleese, John Hurt, and Julie Walters. They are all teriffic. Next up is the score. You can always count on John Williams to deliver the goods. He is a god. His musical score really catches that right whimsical fairy tale sound that is dead on perfect. Haunting and beautiful at the same time. The outfits were outstanding, as was the scenery and sets. Many sets were absolutely breathtaking. The castle itself is a wonderous piece of beauty in itself. I will say that the movie did seem a tad long. Then again, so are the books. The long running time did hurt it a tad bit. Daniel Radcliffe is exceptionally good as young Harry. He has wonderful charm and a great smile. But, I was in awe of little Emma Watson as Hermione. This young girl is wonderful. A star in the making. Director Chris Columbus(""Home Alone"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"")really knows his stuff. The cast is great and he keeps the film tight and sharp looking. Kudoes to you Mr. Columbus. As for how faithful the movie is from J.K. Rowling's book, I can't say. I haven't read them. But from what I hear from everyone else, the movie was very faithful to the book. Maybe I should read them?. There are a number of whiners commenting on the movie being long and boring. If you are interested in quality than quantity, then this shouldn't be a problem at all. If you have short attention spans and have a hard time staying focused for a three minute video on MTV, then this is not for you. Critics have hailed this film as ""The Wizard Of Oz Of Today"".

My first exposure to the books was at a &quot;writer's workshop&quot; that turned out to be run by old ladies in a church hall. They were offended by the &quot;witchcraft&quot; (booga booga!) and thought it was &quot;violent&quot;. Woo hoo, so's the bible. So I think you can understand my aversion to them.But when I bunged the tape in my VCR I was pleasantly surprised. This is a bit slow at times, and very long (2 and a half hours); but the visual effects are excellent and it features a very good supporting cast including Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and Richard Harris.

Harry is a young boy living in a cabinet under the stairs at his Aunt and Uncle's house when the film begins.

Fantastic special effects and a long journey into the magical world of wizardry combine to make an extra special film for all ages.

Within the movie, there are characters you will find your heart warming to, such as Hagrid, a loveable old thing, and Professor Dumbledorf, a wise wizard with a soft spot, and there are enough villains (or suspected villains) to keep you guessing until the end.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A82MLYSUUU3CF	"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!"""	Spirited adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's phenomenally successful children's books is so keen on being faithful to its original source that it loses a bit of its magic but is marvelous entertainment nonetheless (particularly for the kiddies). Harry Potter is a young orphan boy raised by his meany uncle and aunt who one day learns from a gruff giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) that he is a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwart's, a school of sorcery for the magically-abled. Once there he experiences all sorts of adventures with new best friends Ron and Hermione, many of them to the chagrin of the school's kindly headmaster Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and the sharp-as-tacks Professor McGonagall (a wickedly zesty Maggie Smith). Perfect casting all around is a plus, not to mention state-of-the-art visual effects, a boisterous score by John Williams and inspired production design by Academy Award winner Stuart Craig (The Last Emperor, Dangerous Liaisons, The English Patient). Fans of the book will delight in seeing all their favourite aspects of Hogwarts brought to life so accurately, but those less familiar with the world of Harry Potter will lose their patience by the time they get to the anticlimactic last third. It's not as winsomely funny as the book, but it's still quite the charmer. Title in America is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	4.0	Good for the fans	2003-01-06	16	15	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AREYMJ0BWVIAE	Bill	"When I first picked up the book ""Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone"" in 8th grade, I wanted to see what all the hub-bub was about. I had heard that it was ""great"" and ""excellent,"" and I wasn't dissapointed. Then, when I heard that a movie was being made out of the bestseller, I hopped right on the fan train and waited anxiously. When I finally saw the movie for the first time, I was blown away by how good it was.Daniel Raddcliffe plays the young wizard Harry Potter, who, due to the death of his parents, has to stay to live with his unbarable aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon and not to mention their freakishly overwieght son Dudley. While on a trip to the zoo on Dudley's birthday, Harry makes a pane of glass dissapear and subsuqently Dudley falls right in.Later on that week, mail starts coming; not just any mail though, the owl post. Letters adressed to ""Mr. H Potter Cupboard Under The Stairs"" start arriving on a frequent basis, until Vernon gets so uspet that he takes the family onto an island shack.While there, at the strok of midnight on Harry's birthday, a great large bangs rash the door of the shack until it falls down and in comes Reubeus Hagrid, keeper of keys and games at Hogwarts. Hogwarts, to those who haven't read any of the books or been under a rock for the last 5 years is ""the greatest school of wizardry and witchcraft and is headed by the finest headmaster...Albus Dumbledore.""  So, ""reluctantly"" Vernon lets Harry go to Hogwarts.Harry doesn't know, though, that he has to get rather odd supplies for school, like a cauldron and a wand. Hadgrid brings him to a bar called the Leaky Cauldron, where everybody inside knows who mister Potter is, which makes him very uncomfortable. Outside though, Harry gets his first glimpse at the wizard shopping mall persay, Diagon Alley. While there, he gets all of his supplies for his first year.Even though he has a time trying to get on to Platfrom 9 3/4 (yes 9 3/4) at Kings Cross Station, he meets who will soon become his best friends: Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint). He also meets his arch-ememy Draco Malfoy.The staff of Hogwarts reads like a whos who of English actors: Richard Harris (Unforgiven) as the wise old Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman (Die Hard) plays vindictive Professer Snape, Maggie Smith (Gosford Park) plays the by the book Professer McGonnegal and Robbie Coltrane plays the forementioned Reubeus Hagrid.The highlight of the movie is the Qudditch game. Qudditch is like the wizard hybrid of basketball and soccer, only it has three types of balls and is played on broomsticks.All and all this movie is great fun to watch, and the special features are excellent, expecially the deleated sense. One of them has the funny voiced Seamus Finnigan talking, which gave me quit the chuckle."	5.0	10 Times as good as LOTR!	2002-06-30	4	1	3

I couldn't imagine the possibility of a decent film version of such a great book. I was gladly wrong! HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE translates perfectly to the screen. The story is faithfully engaging and the characters are played as if they walked off the pages of the book. When I first saw Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I was amazed at how much they WERE the characters! Harry himself (Daniel Radcliffe) is perfectly cast, as are his friends, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is captured in all his warm, grizzly bear-sized glory! The story is well known: Harry grows up with his dastardly mean muggle (non-magical folk) aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley, not knowing that all along, he's the legendary hero of the entire wizarding world! One day, Harry begins to find out who / what he really is. An entirely new universe opens up before him, leading him into the great adventure that is his true destiny. A riveting tale of discovery, courage, and friendship. HPATSS is very well-written fantasy fiction, turned into a wonderful family movie.

Rowling herself. Columbus, thankfully, proved me wrong. He delivered a great film that was faithful to the book and found three enormously talented young actors to guide this project.I only wish Warner Bros. had put as much effort into this DVD set as the filmmakers obviously did into their movie.Don't get me wrong, it's an okay DVD, and certainly worth getting if you're a fan of the film, but as far as extras go, there's not much to recommend it for the grown-up audience. There are some nice deleted scenes and a few games that the kids will enjoy, but that's about it...I still recommend the DVD, because the movie is absolutely fantastic, but don't expect much else to hold your attention if you're over the age of 11.	4.0	Could have used a better DVD	2002-10-30	0	0	0

If I could give a 2.5 star rating I would.First let me start off with the good things...the film itself.  This was one of the best adaptations of novel that I have seen (the best being The Green Mile).  I thought that the characters came to life and that the images and effects were wonderful.  It really transports the viewer to Hogwarts.  The DVD captures the film beautifully and I thought the picture quality was very good.Now on the other hand, disk 2, the Extras.  Well, I guess they would be great if you could figure out how to see them.  I read that it is like a game where you are a student at Hogwarts and need to get all of the things for school prior to going and exploring the grounds to find the deleted scenes.  Well, if you are an adult have fun because it is near impossible to figure out.  I guess it would be fun for the children and I guess I should face the fact that this movie and DVD was intended for children.All in all Great Movie, and DVD, just not such great extras.

We watched this together and I was immediately struck by the sound design, which is superior to the previous blu-ray release. The video seems about the same. The extra scenes in the extended edition were interesting and did not take away from the film. In fact, I thought they provided more depth and I found myself enjoying the film more than previous viewings. It's nice that you are given the option of choosing between the two versions of the film. The other added benefit of this ultimate edition release is the documentary. The first part is interesting, but not quite as in depth as I was hoping. That changes though in the second part which is included in the Chamber of Secrets release. That section of the documentary is fantastic and more than what I was expecting.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1IYFTKUGM3YI	"""bloodknight"""	I saw this film with a lot of skepticism, not because I was worried about whether it is a good representation of the book, but rather because I had never really seen what the big deal about Harry Potter was. However 20 minutes in and I was hooked, getting a drink, or a bag of popcorn be damned, I wanted to watch every moment of the film and was deeply interested.Having gotten interested in the film I checked out the book, and found the film was incredibly close to the book which is always a feat. While having dropped a little bit here and a little bit there Chris Columbus faithfully adapted this beloved children's book. Parents should be warned that the movie contains scenes that might be scary to a young child, but that should not stop you from showing this to your child, or them from enjoying it.The film transfer on the DVD is great, with no problems. The sound is more than adequate, and the overall presentation of the DVD is quite good.Despite being on 2 discs the extras are the let-down here, but they are not horrible, what there is is quite nice but could have been better. The way they could have been better is by adding more extras, and making some difficulty levels so that adults who buy this film can enjoy it every bit as much as children.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's, depending on where you live in the world) Stone is definitely a film that will go down as a classic and will be enjoyed for generations to come, it is now and will be for a long time: simply magical.	5.0	Truly Magical	2003-02-13	3	2	1

A great deal of money was spent on the production, leading to impressive sets (although more resembling a Polo-Ralph Lauren ad, rather than a medieval school) and decent special effects, but the main problem is that no matter how good the books are, this was not a good movie in terms of screenplay, editing and acting.The result of too much deference to the Author and a promise to ""bring the book alive"" was a scene for every chapter and a rushed plot. The viewer could not warm to the characters, particulary Harry (who is one of the most loved literary chaacters ever) and the casting seemed to be on looks alone, rather than acting ability. The performances from the child actors were school pantomime-quality. I was also surprised at how wooden the likes of Richard Harris were.That the movie was a box-office success was never in doubt, thanks to the fans of the book and the marketing hype. However, Warner brothers risk the entire seven-book series if the sequal turns out like the first one - especially as the second book does not have the strongest storyline.My advice:..., get the young actors some lessons, get a proper screenplay writer to adapt subsequent books and make the next one stand up as movies in their own rights, rather than the ""film of the storytape of the book"". Alas, I fear it may be too late as filming has already well underway for the sequel... should be exactly like the book. but, they could have done a lot better job with it. there is a special feeling that goes with the harry potter books... they are fun, comical, mysterious, daring, and adventureous... that whole feeling that makes the books sooo wonderful was lost completely in the movie. i about cried when i saw it. lets hope they do a better job with the second one."	1.0	Will the full series be made?!!!	2002-03-25	20	4	16
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1YSQMDKH0RX8L	"""bobo_the_chimp"""	"I admit it, I was a naysayer when the Harry Potter first came out.  Being a fan the classic forms of fantasy novels, I wrote it off as a literary Pokemon.  A fad that would burn itself out in a few months.I am one, though, that believes the old addage of ""Don't knock it until you've tried it"", so I did.I was drawn in the books from the start.  They seemed so compelling and enthralling, that I read all 4 books in the course of a week.  With that under my belt by the end of October of 2001, I found myself waiting for the movie somewhat a kin to a young child waiting for Christmas.  My friends and I went to the movie and were surpised by the number of adults(without children) that were in attendence.  I enjoyed every moment of the movie.  From the amok troll to the breathtaking Qudditch match it was quite entertaining.The acting wasn't the best from the children, but what can you expect, they are kids, give them a break.  But what really gets to me, is the fact that people are writting reviews about how the movie wasn't as good as the book.  Movies are rarely (almost safe to say NEVER) better than the book.  As far as the adaptation goes, I give it a thumbs up.  With all that goes on in the movie, I was suprised that they pulled it off as well as they did.  If you look at other movies that came out,(Lord of the Rings) major plot points were changed.  Not the case with Harry Potter.  Only minor settings were changed.  If anything, the movie gives a doorway into the world of Harry Potter to those that have not experienced it.  It leads them to the books and a greater love of a young, boy hero that has captured the hearts and imaginations of millions of loyal fans.  Don't put the movie down for what it doesn't have, enjoy what it does have, a sense of adventure and childhood excitement not seen since the first Star Wars movie in 1977.

Instead of trying to create a movie, the director devided instead to try to film the book.  The result is a movie that is very choppy, akward, and in some places seems altogether too long.Had the filmmakers attmepted to pull the main story elements from the book and create a movie surrounding them, this could have been one of the best movies of the year.  Instead this movie can be hard to follow for those who've not read the book (although, by this point who hasn't read the book?).Watching this movie for the first time was an interesting experience.  Watching it for the second time almost put me to sleep.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1ARQYFYXAL4I	bonsai chicken	Harry Potter is a young boy with magical powers.  He lives with his nasty foster family until the age of 11 when he is taken away to Hogwarts, a school of wizardry, for training.  It is here that he discovers his true heritage.  Much like at the Boston pub Cheers, everybody knows his name.  Turns out Harry's family has made quite a name for themselves in the land of wizards and witches.  Eventually he and his two new friends - awkward, put-upon Ron Weasley and snotty know-it-all Hermione Grainger - come to believe that one of their professors is up to some shady business, and venture out on their own to uncover the plot.What follows is an overlong, disjointed picture in which we are shown the many wonders of Hogwarts and occasionally, bits of an actual story.  Shifting staircases and talking hats may amuse the younger ones, but I found it all rather tedious.  The thrust of the story itself doesn't have much logic to it; if the sorcerer's stone is so precious and dangerous, why is it removed from the vault and placed in the care of an inept guard dog (and its equally inept master) to begin with?  The surprise villain isn't clever and serves only to trick the viewer.  Again, kids won't care, but adults will shake their heads in exasperation.I liked the critters.  There are numerous owls of various types, a talking boa constrictor, a shape-shifting cat, and briefly, a large iguana.  And Alan Rickman (not a critter) is wonderful as always.HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a juvenile film that I wouldn't recommend for anyone that is older than its main characters.	2.0	All flash and no substance	2005-09-04	22	4	18
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1HBC0NBQJHT7X	Bookphile	I will always think fondly of this movie because it inspired me to pick up the first Harry Potter book and I've been a rabid fan ever since.  I'm one of those book before movie people so I had to read the novel in order to go see this movie and I was pleased to see that it was such a faithful adaptation to Rowling's wonderful tale.This movie did a wonderful job of capturing the wonder and awe of the first HP novel.  Hogwarts was an especially lovely effect and when Harry first walks into the Great Hall and all the candles are floating overhead, I felt all the magic I felt when reading those words on the page.  I think Columbus and crew captured the essence of the castle and somehow managed to create a visual of something so fantastical.The casting of the movie was also extremely well done.  I adore Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Richard Harris captures the mischievous and wise nature of Dumbledore.  Perhaps best of all the adult casting is that of Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid.  He looks exactly as I pictured the character but, more importantly, he captures Hagrid's rather childlike nature and the accent is wonderful.  Coltrane doesn't just portray Hagrid, he is Hagrid.I also thought the children were wonderfully cast.  Daniel Radcliffe looks like Harry and I fought back tears when his earnest young face first looked into the Mirror of Erised.  Rupert Grint looks just as I pictured Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is wonderfully bossy and a fantastic know-it-all as Hermione Granger.  The casting of the Phelps brothers as the Weasley twins was absolutely brilliant and I think they were dead on in their interpretation of the lovable scoundrels.Yet in spite of its fantastical nature, this film, like the book, feels as though it is something like our own reality.  There are many wonderful things in Harry's world but it's not that different from our own.  The same prejudices and the same human frailties that exist in our world exist in Harry's.  Though being a wizard is pretty darn cool, it's not the answer to Harry's problems and the film makes clear that he has some difficult challenges ahead of him.I think the central theme of this movie is one that is invaluable for both children and adults alike: that love is the most powerful magic that exists.  Even with all the wand waving and fantastical creatures, it is love that is Harry's salvation.	4.0	A faithful adaptation	2007-08-17	6	6	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ALDNAWMNBQPKH	"Bookworm ""Jerry"""	"I wonder if the author of ""The Trouble with HARRY"", an Amazon review of this movie, was talking of the movie or the books, or both. He/She says ""classic is not a word"" to be used when discussing or reviewing the Potter series of books or movies.I must respectuflly disagree. While C.S. Lewis' novels of Narnia are widely purchased and presumptively read, they are a bit too moralistic for my taste. Lewis has a well-grounded Christian basis, but I prefer my moralizing more from the pulpit than from supposedly secular fiction.As to Frank L. Baum's books on Oz. . .the first three or four were realitively imaginative and entertaining. After that, it was clear Baum, like his contemporary Edgar Rice Burroughs of ""Tarzan"" fame, was milking the series for every dime it could produce!Rowling, on the other hand, has reconstructed a macro-cosmology, seated fully in her own unique imagination, and populated same with characters and events to serve her own literary &lt;you read it correctly, ""literary""> aims. All I mean is that Ms. Rowling is telling her own story in her own way. She has no theological, philosophical, or even teleogical axe to grind that I can discover &lt;when asked what she based her ""magic"" on in the novels in a televised interview, Ms. Rowling looked both amused and somewhat confused! Her forthright answer was that she had simply ""made it up!"">The movie version does the book proud! It essentially sticks to the book's plot, events, and sequence without losing the sense of innocence of childhood poised on the threshhold of adolescence while being faced with problems and situations of adult &lt;and beyond> proportions. Harry must make choices, and Ms. Rowling does not allow her creation to get away with making wrong choices without the accompanying consequences and results of such choices. Harry must study hard, work hard, choose correctly, and be true to himself and his friends, and his beliefs. Such sad, tramautic events, to be sure. . .but at least Harry ACTS. . .unlike Dorothy in Oz who simpers and whimpers her disire to go home.Harry has friends, yes. But Dorothy has a deus-ex-machina to rescue her. Harry has to think and act for himself.I love Dorothy and Toto. I don't care much for Lewis &lt;only because I find him preachy>. But I ADMIRE Harry, Ron, and Hemione. That trio has to get it right. Dorothy has Glinda and the Scarecrow, Lion, and Tinman to help when Dorothy is hopelessly confused and lost. Harry and company have to get it on their own. . . .Well, there it is. The basic conflict. Get it on your own, or wait for the miracle. . .Miracles do happen, I admit, but sometimes we must make our own. And that's what Harry Potter does, that Dorothy in Oz, and NEVER happens in Narnia.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1HNSBO5PS4AQW	"""bpwhittaker"""	I just bought the DVD yesterday after renting it the other day and found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.  I haven't read the books (though that ought to change soon now that I'm a new father!) and I didn't see the film in theaters.  But I was captivated from the start by the story, the charactors, and the wonderful sets.  It's interesting to note that the CGI is toned down a bit compared to the eye candy that's being passed off as movies these days.  Most of the animals (including the owls) are real, as are most of the sets (real stone floors, tables, etc.), thereby making the story much more believable than Star Wars II.From such young actors, the acting is superb, and the adults do a good job as well (some of those british accents seem a bit forced, though).  Some (adult)reviewers have noted that some scenes (the chess scene, for example) failed to instill fear in thier minds.  I think that they were executed perfectly, keep in mind that this movie is aimed at pre-teens.  If you'd like to see children getting their heads blown off, then you won't enjoy this film.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this refreshing fantasy that's should be in anyone's collection.A last note:  I give the movie 5 stars, but the DVD does lack some of the features you might expect from such a film.  The interface is cumbersome (for an adult, anyway), and the interviews are limited.  I would have enjoyed seeing more on how the film was made.	4.0	The Wizard of OZ of our Time	2002-06-07	2	1	1

Then They said a movie about the first book was in production. I saw the trailers, didn't need spoilers, I read the book. I couldn't see it in theatures. It came out on video and I saw it. I was thouroghly disappointed that they left Peeves out, and made Hermione a smart-@$$ know-it-all. But don't let that remark fool you, I was making a statment. Anyway Quiddich was awesome, Snapes acting sucked, he sounded like some 60's hippe who just discovered crack... The end was also a downer when there was only 2 things protecting the stone, not 4. Well maybe the rest won't be not-so-good. Avereage movie, not aweful.	2.0	""" turn this stupid fat rat yellow"""	2002-06-24	9	4	5

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3KHO7K21MS7RL	"Braulio Cruz ""Braulio"""	It is an ok movie to watch but if you read the books it's not that great. I'm okay about leaving little things out of the book, but this is too much. Because they cut out all the enjoyable parts of the book, like the midnight duel, when Harry and Hermione take Baby Norbert to the north tower, the potions logic challenge, etc. And where has Neville gone, he was very present in the book but not in this movie. The special affects are very bad compared to other movies too. What I'm trying to say is if you have never read the book you will probably find this enjoyable (because even with some of the most enjoyable scenes missing it is still has got some enjoyable parts) but if you read the book you will always prefer the book than this movie, it will still be enjoyable for you but you will always prefer reading the books. This is also not the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. It can get boring in a few times of watching.	3.0	Not as good as the book	2005-01-17	5	4	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AKOQ2U5KUVSN2	Brian Duffy	Let me start by saying that Harry Potter is a fantastic movie and will make you want to dive into its incredible world. Great characterization, dialogue, sets, and cinematography. I highly reccomend it, for anyone, not just kids. The only special features that are really worth it are the deleted scenesNow, about the difference between the two versions. I accidentally got the full-screen version and was rather upset with myself, being a widescreen advocate. Then I came across a particular website. I can't post the URL but, search on google for harry potter dvd comparison and it'll be the first hit. Anyway, it turns out that Harry Potter was filmed in super35 film. That means that both the widescreen and fullscreen editions are &quot;crops&quot; of the actual original footage which is a larger area of view than either format. So, what all this means is there are things you can see in the fullscreen version that you cant in the widescreen and vice versa. You'll need to decide for yourself.	5.0	a note about the difference between widescreen and full	2002-08-31	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2B2QQ05PHVRKT	Brian Himes	By the time that Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone hit DVD, I was probably the last person on the planet that hadn't seen the movie or even read any of the four books that were out by that time. I finally watched the first movie when I was house sitting for a friend. I'll admit I watched just to see what all the fuss was about. Two and a half hours later I was hooked. The movie captivated me from the very first scene. In fact, the next day I went out and bought all four of the books and eagerly started reading them. I wanted to have them finished before the second movie came out which (at the time) was going to be in theaters that November.Quite simply this movie is just pure magic. It is still my favorite of the movies. John Williams' score really pulls you right into the movie. Each actor delivers believable performances. Even the kids. I've heard people say that the kids just weren't all that great in the acting department, but I have to disagree. I had no trouble believing that Daniel Radcliffe was Harry Potter or Rupert was Ron or Emma was Hermione. In fact, Hermione is my favorite character and Emma Watson captured her perfectly. Then there was Maggie Smith as McGonagall. Loved her.Christopher Columbus really did a brilliant job in bringing the first book to the screen. I can't give this movie enough praise. I haven't been as captivated by a movie since the first time I saw the original Star Wars back in 77. This is pure movie magic at it's best. I just wish that I like all of the other films as much as I like this one.	5.0	Hooked Me From The First Scene	2006-11-17	5	5	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AJ8TWISPEJ6GP	Bronwen DuHadaway	The movie adaptation of JK Rowling's wonderful Harry Potter books was wonderful.  Yes, there were some deleted scenes, but overall, their absence did not detract from the plot.  Books will always be better than their movie adaptations, regardless of who wrote them.  I have yet to see a 100% true adaptation that was entertaining.One of my favorite parts of owning a DVD player is seeing the deleted scenes.  In order to get the scenes for the Sorcerer's stone, though, you had to go through a series of &quot;visits&quot; to Diagon Alley, Hogwarts grounds, &amp; classrooms.  While, theoretically, this would be fun, in reality, it was way too much to go through in order to get a paltry extra 10 minutes of footage.It was a worthwhile buy, though, and I'll watch &amp; rewatch it for years to come.	4.0	Great movie!

The film was excellent though there were a few flaws mos of them dealing witht the special effects in the film (which I think were improved in the second film). The forbidden forest is totally bare and would never work for some of the things that are written in the books (especially in book five). Then although the other effects in the film get by they do not look very real, particularly in the troll and the quiditch sequences. Other than that: excellent book and excellent film!

And the first time I saw the movie, I was very impressed with it and I was ecstatic that they kept true to the book. But then I saw it a second time....It's not that it's a bad movie, but, like someone else said, it DID feel rushed. They tried to hurry along scenes that should have been way more drawn out. I know it's a movie aimed at kids, but it could have been longer and people would not have minded if the movie had just gone at an even pace. But it was rushed and it skipped over important scenes and rushed on to the next one. And, although the kids were cute, their acting was not top-notch. I know, I know, I can't demand Oscar-winning acting from kids, but their expressions of fright were so fake and they just didn't act natural. Seriously, when you are scared, do you slowly back away with your eyebrows up and your mouth open and your eyes bugged out??? They were just trying too hard.Nevertheless, I gave the film 4 stars because it was very faithful to the book which I appreciated and it was a good movie.	4.0	Pretty good	2002-03-17	50	38	12

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A259WQAGSXB6EC	Caracarn	While I liked the film, I thought it could have been made better.  As a matter of fact, I was glad it did not stray at all from the book except with Quirrell dying like that . . .? That was kind of stupid.  First off, the movie was too long for the length of the book.  152 minutes is quite long for a 90,000 word novel.  Secondly they tried too many scenes in, then they widdled it down too short.  Now I understand.  With a book like Harry Potter, there is so much that you want to see made into a movie, but cutting them down so small took a lot of magic from the movie.  Before Academy Awards night, I never saw the movie, but I thought, going only by what other people said that it deserved all of the nominations even if it did not deserve winning anything.  Now since I have seen it, I would say it got more than it deserved and Harry Potter fans should be pleased.  It deserved nominations for costumes, special effects and music score.  No more, no less.  And yes, I probably would have given the movie an extra star if I never read the book, but I have so I am more informed to make decisions about it.	3.0	Good movie, but no where near close to being the greatest	2002-06-06	1	0	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2GLN2XGQ5JNWQ	Carol Abbott	I saw this movie twice on the big screen and I'd have to say that I enjoyed it even more when I viewed it on the small screen.  The home theatre feels more cosy somehow.It is a beautifully rendered version of a wonderful book.  With incredible detail added to build up the world Harry inhabits.  Most cast members seem tailor-made for their parts.  Unlike at the theatre, it's relatively long running time was no hardship with the option of &quot;pause&quot; and as a great admirer of the book, I couldn't help but wish for even MORE SCENES to expand on the story.  The only &quot;flaw&quot; in this version for some reviewers was a lack of major, earthmoving plot points, but for this fan of the Harry Potter series of books, it was a faithful, loving and respectful telling of the story.  And a movie that I think I will enjoy viewing many times.The second disk which offers additions is much, much less than I had hoped for and a serious disappointment.  The tour of Hogwarts and Hagrid's cottage is cheesy graphics, fuzzy and just not up to any respectable standards.  The 'games' are simplistic and pointless.  And once played, never a challenge again, even for little kids.  In a movie offering such beautiful attention to detail, I would have expected more (from the extras) and would rather had have more out-takes from the film than just the seven scenes offered.  The only worthwhile part of this disk is the rather extensive interviews with Chris Columbus and several of the other artists responsible for making this movie.  I understand that there are more features available with a CD ROM, but we were not able to view those, so I don't have any comments on what they might add to this disk.So 5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the extras from this reviewer.	4.0	Charming Movie!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AV8VLS7ZPUPUQ	Carol Tessen	Two of my co-workers talked me into reading the Harry Potter books.  From the first three paragraphs in the first book, I was hooked.  At first I was a bit embarrassed about being so caught up in what was supposedly a children's book, but I quickly learned that Harry Potter is for young and old alike.  In fact, I have talked to many adults who have read this series of books and are anxiously awaiting the next (me included).  I was very curious to see if the movie would follow the book and it does.  Obviously they had to condense the book or else the movie would be hours long.  But the screen writers did an admirable job and this movie absolutely lives up to the hype!The movie is 2 hours long but it will have you spellbound the whole way through.  The actors are superb and the special effects are outstanding.  It's rated PG for `scary moments and mild language.'  I believe that only very young children might be frightened by a few of the scenes, they just aren't that bad.  One scene, as an example, shows a dead unicorn with the villain, Voldemort, bent over the unicorn's neck, drinking it's blood.  Voldemort has to do this in order to continue his evil existence.  There is no closeup, nothing graphic, no gore in this scene; it was done as mildly as possible.  The director gets the point across without the `blood and guts.'  It is also stressed about what an evil and cowardly act it is to kill an innocent animal and that the person who does it must pay the price.  Still, you do see a dead unicorn with the knowledge that the bad guy killed it.  A very young child may have difficulties with it.  As for the language, it is very mild, nothing to worry about.I have heard about many people wanting the Harry Potter books and movie banned because they say it's about witchcraft and the dark arts.  Harry Potter is indeed a wizard, as are his friends, Hermione and Ron.  But the books and movie stress that wizards only use their special powers for good, not evil, intentions.  The power of love, strong moral values, courage to stand up for your convictions, the value of friendship, sports etiquette, and perseverance are some things that J.K. Rowling addresses in her books.  In Harry Potter's world, good always conquers evil.I recommend the DVD version of Harry Potter because of the added features of the 2nd disc.  I tried it on my computer and did enjoy the tours and game that were included.  I have not been able to view the never-before-seen-footage however.  They should have made that more accessible.	5.0	Enchanting!	2002-06-01	1	1	0

I realize that you either hear really good reviews of Harry Potter or really bad reviews...there really isn't much of an in-between.  I am a Harry Potter lover turned into one from one who wouldn't even touch the books.  But before this movie came out I decided to go into the hype and was happy when I saw this movie!Harry is living with his Aunt and Uncle Dursley...and it is now time for Harry to start wizard school so Hogwarts sends Harry letters but Uncle Vernon doesn't want any of it!  So he keeps destroying the letters but in the end Hogwarts wins and Hagrid comes and takes Harry with him.  When he goes to school he is introduced to Hermione and Ron and they all become best friends.  They are also introduced to many of the other characters who will play a role in the movie and book.  Harry is always in trouble but rarely causes the trouble.  It tends to follow him.  He is also fighting to keep away from Lord Voldemort because he is the one who killed his parents.  But he can not stay alone for long.  Also some of the professors are fishy acting (watch to find out!)  and in the end the professor who is after the Sorcerer's Stone is not who you think!This movie is great for young and old and is a movie that will keep you intrigued from beginning until the end!	5.0	Harry Soars...	2005-02-07	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1O11XSJFQ1GO8	"C. Cloutier ""Cameron Cloutier"""	This movie is truly wonderful and anyone who disagrees with it on religious grounds is fooling themselves. This movie has as much to do with magic as Mary Poppins, and that is a classic. In time, this film will be right up there with the best. The performances are great across the board and the three main children hold up the almost three hour film with impeccable force. The movie is scary at times, like all the great children stories and movies (remember Willy Wonka and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang), but it is kept at a family level. The dvd is really cool but it could use alot more behind the scenes, although of course, a little of the magic would be gone if I knew how they did everything.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AGOTQ7VEQ5IML	"cdkscully ""cdkscully"""	I'm a little new to the Harry Potter fandom.  After seeing this movie on cable for the 900th time, I decided to buy the DVD. I was not sorry for the purchase! I purchased the widescreen edition and found it much more enjoyable than the pan and scan. There are parts that you miss with the pan and scan version like what is happening off to the side of the action.I can't compare this movie to the book...yet...because I haven't in fact read the books but am working on it now.  :)  I did notice in the first two chapters of the book already that it is in fact different from the movie. The reader sees a bit more into the Dursleys's life than we do in the film. The film picks up when Harry is delivered to his Aunt and Uncle instead of before that when we learn of the fate of Lily and James Potter and baby Harry.What I did find annoying was that the deleted scenes are so well hidden that without help from an instruction manual online, you can't find them.  For those of you who need help, as I did, this is how you get to the deleted scenes (I'm sure there are different ways, but this is how I was told to find them.) Insert the second disc and using your remote, you must do all of the following:Hit &quot;Diagon Alley&quot; and enter on your remote.Next is finding the correct bricks.hit:left, up, up, enterup, enterup, enterdown, down, enterdown, enterNext you need to go to the bank.Highlight the sign &quot;Gringotts&quot; and hit the down arrow key on the remote to highlight the key. You will need that for the bank.Hit right and then enter on the remote. The vault is now open and you can exit.Next you need school supplies.  Highlight &quot;Ollivanders&quot; and enter. This is where you purchase your wand. Eventually you will get the wand upon trying each box.  Once you find it, you can leave the store.Go to the main menu and hit &quot;classrooms&quot; and from the next screen choose &quot;Potions.&quot;  Then highlight the mortar and pestle and hit enter.There are three potions you will need to make when asked.Sleeping Potion: Asphodel and WormwoodAlternative Name for Aconite: Monkshood and WolfsbaneCure for a boil: Snake Fangs and Porcupine QuillsNext you need to get the right key for the door. This is the room with the flying keys. You need to hit:right, up, up, right, enterThis will have you select the small key with the broken wing.Next you have to choose the right potion from seven of them.Choose the yellow bottle (right, right enter).From that point, you will get to the mirror of Erised and the Sorcerer's Stone. Highlight the stone and hit enter. Now you can see the hidden clips! There are tons of other hidden things on this disc. You just have to play around with finding the items.There is also another hidden part on Disc 1.When you get to the main menu, hit right arrow on the remote to highlight the owl and enter. This gives you your own invitation to go to Hogwarts!	5.0	Excellent movie on DVD; extras are hard to find	2003-01-05	8	8	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A34JGR3LMV1I64	ceffalo	I don't know what the other fellow is on about but there is nothing wrong with a special edition of Harry Potter, especially if you don't already have a copy of the Sorcerer's Stone.  There's not really much that the studio can do to this movie to change it one way or another.  If it is a two-sided single disc, so what?  I have other movies on a two-sided disc and I find it to be very convenient.  If you don't already own this movie then I suggest you buy it.  Unless you desire heavy themes and truly terrible scenes then perhaps Harry Potter is for you.  Most kids will love the show.	5.0	Harry Potter is greatness.	2007-11-27	3	2	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A7SEG1JOWY9HQ	celandine	I was relieved that the movie was almost completely true to the book-- or at least much moreso than other books-made-movies.For at least a year after the movie was released, I adamantly refused to watch it; far too many good books had been spoiled in my imagination by their movies.  With this one, I was very attached to my imagined-version, and wasn't about to take any chances of getting it permanantly changed to who-knows-what.  Well, finally about two weeks ago, I gave in, and I suppose I'm glad I did.  It was interesting to get an idea of how other people invisioned Harry Potter. Most of the characters were very true and tastefully-chose, in my opinion.  The movie was about as wonderful as I think they could have made it, taking into account considerable limitations and the obstacle of transforming imagination to film-- voila!  (Bummer Peeves was too hard to include!!)I'm sure it is rather rude in saying so, but however wonderful the movie was, I did enjoy my imagination more.  It was scarred a bit after having the movie characters molded in, too, but is beginning to come back.  I don't know; everyone will have different opinions as far as that goes!All in all, it is definitely worth seeing to view another full-blown and exciting interpretation, but one word of warning: PLEASE, READ THE BOOK FIRST!  It is amazing; and as with all good movies, they must have a solid foundation.	4.0	An exciting/different point of view	2002-07-06	1	1	0

My kids have watched it a couple dozen times and I see it being watched another couple dozen more.  Great story about friendship and magic.

However, I thought that the movie was well made.From reading the reviews, it sounds like a number of people are dissapointed in the movie and prefer the books.  However, no movie (not even Lord of the Rings, fellow reviewers) that is based on a book will ever follow the book exactly.I think that if you buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A28SJBJ0EGQPPW	Charles Clark	To start off this isn't a review of the movie itself, by now you should have already formed an opinion of the movie for yourself or from other reviews of just the film.  This is a review for the Ultimate Edition.Two words:  Absolutely Amazing!This isn't just some scam from Warner Bros to get a few more dollars squeezed out of the Harry Potter movies, this is brand new and refreshing.  Warner Bros packaged this set to be (or what appears to be) the last Harry Potter set to be had.  Everything that you could want in a collectors set it included here.The booklet included is surprisingly well done.  The book keeps with the theme of the special feature exclusive to the ultimate edition.  For example, in the Chamber of Secrets edition the booklet is all about the characters and their development, both at the beginning of the series and how they have evolved through the years.  Included are stills from the movie, pictures of the theme (ie. characters, buildings, sets), and my favorite... concept art.As for the character cards that are included they aren't anything super special but at the same time they aren't cheaply done.  The cards are solid and printed well.  I could see where some people will find them very satisfying and a highlight of the edition.The thing that I was most impressed with, however, was the presentation.  Finally someone released a special edition of a film and made it presentable and convenient.  The boxes are made to look like books that fold open and are neatly packed on the inside.  Also on the inside of the book there are images from the film, making it look very much like a collector's item.  Warner Bros has really set themselves up nicely for the release of the next six of these.Overall I was extremely pleased with this edition of the movie and cannot wait for the rest to be released.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ULTIMATE EDITION Blu-ray	2009-12-10	69	60	9
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A10AR04MESISNL	Charles luxembugh	The scorcerers stone has been stolen! that's what the book said and that's what this movie said. I really didn't actually enjoy this movie but it was still quite entertaining. It is a fantasy about a boy wizard who goes to school to learn magic. Based on Rowlings bestselling books Harry potter's first adventure reaches sky high. When I had read the book but hadn't seen the movie I didn't know how Warner bothers were going to create an actual Quiddich match but they still did it with prestige effort. the movie had no romanical aspects and the comedy was escruciatingly dry. I think Warner bros. should have put even more effort into the acting in the movie but the special effects were pleasing.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A31G2A4K3G7P2M	Chelsea	First of all, if I had never read the books I probably would have liked the movie, but because I have there is only one thing that can be said.  This movie is pathetic.  The books are fantastic and the descriptions are vivid and everything seems real.  Dudley was supposed to be a real jerk and someone who made Harry's life dreadful, but the movie turned him into a pansy.  Same with the Dursleys, they were supposed to be awful too, and they were not scary at all.  The casting in this movie is dreadful with the exception of Severus Snape who truly could not have been better cast.  Even if I could forgive Hollywood for messing up The Dursleys, their interpretation of Dumbledore and Voldemort is unforgivable.  Dumbledore was a feeble old man with no mystery, no sparkle, none of the charm Rowling gave him.  Pathetic, yet again.  HORRIBLY DONE!  Voldemort, geez, I could have drawn him better when I was five.  They lead you up to this big unveiling of the fearsome Lord Voldemort, the ruthless killer of hundreds of people, and he looks like a mushroom.  That is dreadful...  I mean that would strike fear into the hearts of gee.  No one?  The characters are poorly cast, the plot is weak, and the special effects are in a word: AWFUL.  I couldn't have been more disappointed with this.  Honestly, J.K. Rowling hands Warner Brothers a best selling book, and THIS is what they came up with???  Utter garbage.  Want to see a real movie, watch Lord of the Rings because at the very least it did not disgrace Tolkien.  If you haven't read the books and don't intend to prior to watching this movie, well then, you'd enjoy it.  But if you have read the books, Stay away from this trash because it is not worth your money.  Not a cent.	1.0	PATHETIC!!!!	2006-01-04	18	6	12

When everyone one you know eats those crappy Cheerios as if they were sweet, sweet candy. Or you know... uncrapped in Cheerios. Right, well I'm getting side tracked. Okay, my point is Harry Potter was my Cheerios (I shudder to admit this now, but I was young and needed the money) and the crap is the movies. They made what were good books, the first three the last three sucked, into pale shadows of their former selves. And yet people just keep lapping it up. The best example I can give to illustrate my disgust is as follows...I have this Great Dane, Tigger (I didn't name him), and if any of you have ever had a great dane or any big dog you'll know what I mean when I say that he had this very large, and quite disgusting loogy (I don't think that's how that's spelled) hanging from his lips. So Mutie 2, another dog (hideously ugly, thus the name Mutant 2) slurped it up like a very gnarly spaghetti noodle.I think that describes my feelings for Harry Potter. A big, slimy loogy that people can't resist eating. So instead of spending money money or time on crapped-upon Cheerios or loogies, you could slowly drive a rusty nail through your forehead for much the same effect.P.S. The casting is very bad. You'd think they'd cast at least one hot guy by mistake, but alas. And where did they find that many red-headed people without freckles?*note: this applies to all editions not just this one*	1.0	Crappy Cheerios, Loogies, and Rusty Nails....	2006-02-11	24	2	22
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AKVU4HUG6AN1U	"""chick_flick"""	&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is the first installment to the Harry Potter film series, based on the wonderful novels by J.K. Rowling. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, we get introduced to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), a young British boy of eleven who lives with his mean Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys try to be a perfectly normal family--they despise everything that seems out of the ordinary--but they also have a secret which Harry will soon learn. Harry is actually a wizard! He's just been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and this is where the adventure begins. Harry learns the truth about his past from the friendly Hogwarts Games Keeper named Hagrid, and during his first year at the magical school, Harry makes friends, arch rivals, and even mortal enemies as he starts his training in the magical arts.For anyone who loves the books, you must see this film. The acting is outstanding by the entire cast...most of the actors fit right into their roles. The special effects are superb and engaging. The storyline follows the first book pretty well, though they had to take out some of the book. The film is just about how I imagined it would be as I read the book. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter! The DVD is OK with seven deleted scenes, a self-guided tour of Hogwarts, interviews with the filmmakers, behind-the-scenes look at the making of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, DVD-ROM extras, and more. The bad thing about the DVD extras is that, to get to the deleted scenes, you have to play a game every time and it gets a little annoying after a while. All in all, amazing film and I can't wait for the next one.I highly recommend &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.Score:100/100A+	5.0	Magical and enchanting just like the books!	2002-10-09	9	7	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	I ought to say, &quot;wows 'em for the first time&quot;--you don't need to have read the books to enjoy the film (I hadn't, though after seeing it I went out and bought #1 and #3 (#2 being OS at my bookstore)). I haven't been so caught up in a movie's world since the first STAR WARS of venerable memory. The cast, except *just per-haps* for the theatrically glowering Rickman, is splendid, the settings are gorgeous, and oh, the SFX! The quidditch match alone is worth the price.Some reviewers take Columbus and his screenwriters to task for not following the book exactly, but I think they've improved upon it. The means by which Harry and his pals first happen upon Fluffy the three-headed dog, for example: instead of a mischievous poltergeist, it's moving stairways that land them in the forbidden corridor--visually far more delightful. And the scene in which Harry and Ron play &quot;wizard chess&quot; with pieces that bash each other foreshadows the full-size game perfectly. On the other hand, where they *have* remained faithful to the original, they've done so, for the most part, with exactitude. My gripes are very minor: for example, I would have liked a brief scene in which the several Weasley brothers were formally introduced to Harry (there is one in the book, but in the movie I didn't realize Ron had brothers till I saw their names in the cast roll).This is definitely a movie for the whole family, though the smallest ones *may* find Fluffy, Hagrid, Lord Voldemort, and the chess game scary. And having been through a rather stressful three weeks the first time I saw it (in the theater), I found it to be just the remedy I needed. For a couple of hours I could completely forget what had been turning my life upside down, and worry about whether Harry was going to fall off his broom when *it* did! If I could give this video *ten* stars, I would.  It belongs in every family collection.	5.0	Harry Wows 'Em Again	2002-11-30	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2ZDGC1S2QZFU0	Chris Jothi	"The first Harry Potter film sold over 1.5 million videos and DVDs in its first day of release in the UK, breaking the previous impressive record held by Titanic. Now of course all these people, and their families, would have seen the film in the cinema and have enjoyed Christopher Columbus's excellent adaptation of one of the most succesfful books of the last century. They would have been gripped to the screen, just like myself, as we saw JK Rowling's incredible imagination come to life. The film is, in my humble opinion, a revelation. An example of how the medium of film can awe an audience, transport them to another world and entertain them for a few hours. It is escapism in the truest form. There's only one problem. The DVD [is bad].The film has now surpassed The Phantom Menace as the second most successful film of all time. Warner have therefore spent an awful lot of money on this DVD production (and it shows). They clearly want to give us fans something to sink our teeth into, a DVD like no other, and one that would simply put to shame the conventional DVDs we have now grown accustomed to. But as they dived into complicated navigations and interactive menus they forgot about the elementary yet effective delights of Making Of Documentaries and commentaries. I cannot find a valid excuse why Warner would want to deprive us of a filmmakers commentary. The sets, effects, casting, direction, music, sound etc are of the highest quality and no doubt the people who contributed to this film would have been proud to share with us how the production was made. Commentaries are the most popular & SIGNIFICANT features on DVDs, and probably one of the cheaper features to make, so not even seeing ONE present on this 2 Disc ""Special Edition"" package is a disappointment to say the least.The interviews with the director and producer are very good but are too brief. Why have the people who made this DVD been so slack with the basics? There must be hundreds of hours worth of Making Of footage lying around in the Warner vaults. An inch of it barely makes it onto these discs.Of course there is the much talked about guided tour of Hogwarts, and this is where the DVD gets really messy. You get to direct yourself around certain sets. Using the arrows on your DVD's remote you can go left, right and forward at certain moments, and you can select objects on the screen to activate a voiceover which gives us a description. For instance, if you click on Hagrid's large cloak whilst in his hut the voiceover says what it contains and so on. I have to say that the idea is excellent. The intentions were in the right place but the tour becomes boring. It is not like a video game either where you can go wherever you want. You navigate yourself according to arrows, which restrict you to a certain area, and once you have completed the tour I guarantee you that it will not be half as interesting the second time round. It is quite laborious. And this is why I am calling this the first DVD flop. Sure, it will make millions, but only because of the film itself. The features are simply pointless. An experiment that went wrong. And to compund how poorly the navigation is I have yet to even see the deleted scenes. I can't find them. There isn't a simply button that says ""Deleted scenes - click here"" but different rooms and tests that I mast trawl through to access them.This said I would still recommend you buy it. Why? Because the film has never looked or sounded this good. The picture quality is perfect, and as the film is such a visual feast the picture transfer is actually important. The plus $120 million spent on the film is justified when you see Hogwarts for the first time. It is a glorious sight and I will be the first to say far better than what I imagined it to be. Now when I read the Potter books I often substitute the film's interpretations for my own because they are more vivid. Then you have the glorious digital 5.1 soundtrack. The atmosphere created makes your hairs stand on end, and when the Quidditch game takes place you hear sounds whizzing by your ears. Great stuff!I was expecting a DVD similar to The Phantom Menace. Instead it is second rate, trying to pass itself off as a CD-ROM. Thinking about it why didn't they just do that! The kids will like it, but will grow bored very quickly. Over $20 million was spent on the production of this DVD, making it one of, if not the most expensive DVD ever made. It is a disappointment. That my friends is what I call a flop. The irony, considering what the film went on to do at the box office. Now lets hope Warner will consider making a more conventional, but EFFECTIVE and INFORMATIVE DVD in the near future, maybe in time for Christmas. Well what do you know, maybe Warner wanted it to be like this all along!"	2.0	The first DVD flop?	2002-05-23	2	1	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3SQPT6EI5O5F9	Chrispy Rice	To start I would like to say that this movie had the posibility of being a clasic, with such a fantastic script, and nearly universaly popular subject matter, Warner Bros. can't go wrong. Right? HA! Anticipation of this movie was palpable among Harry Potter readers. Fanatics stood in lines for hours (I regret to say I was among them). Once the movie started cheers arose from the crowd, oh so eagarly awaiting thier magical fix. But like many others I was forced to cringe, gasp and groan at the attrosities and aborations that was inflicted upon this posible gem. I am shocked by their casting choises. I'm sorry Danniel Radcliffe, but you suck deary. He was posibly the worst actor on the screen I have ever had the dismay of being subjected to. Radcliffe's monotonous, dry and juvinile acting skills litteraly murdered the character of Harry.  Not to leave out Chris Colombus's directing. *shudder* But not all the charecters were as terrifyingly terrible as poor Harry. Maggie Smith's portrayal of Minerva McGonnagal was a pure delight, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly was exceptional (especialy next to his counterpart). Believe me I had the biggest expectations for this movie *sigh* but, there are some things in life one simply can't deny.	2.0	Daniel Radcliffe killed Harry Potter!	2002-03-06	18	7	11
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1J6WQF5OY4DIV	"Christian Puzder ""C. Puzder"""	The Harry Potter series is made for the HD DVD format. Although not as audio intense as Transformers or Star Wars, the aural impact of this movie was impressive nonetheless. Any Move with TrueHD that takes advantage of it gets points in my book!I am not going to go into plot, because if you dont know what the Harry Potter series is about, you probably have been living in a cabin writing your manifesto in squirrel blood on toilet paper. Just understand that any movie where kids are casting spells, riding broomsticks and fighting three-headed dogs, the audio better be up to the task, like this HD DVD.The Picture was more than aceptable. Like King Kong, however, some of the CGI special effects were apparent at the high HD DVD resolution. Unfortunately this HD DVD lacks the wow factor of a helicoptor tuning into a robot or Megan Fox bending over a Camaro.The extra features on the first disc are astounding. You get about 7 deleted scenes in HD, background information into production - which is usually available on SD DVDs. The difference here is that it appears the studio tried to fill the disc with as much data as possible. If you like Harry Potter you will love how much deeper this HD DVD takes you.	4.0	A top notch HD DVD	2008-01-01	4	3	1

But for someone like me whose read the first book at least 10 times, it's a bit of a disappointment.  There are so many scenes that are left completly unexplained in the movie that would not have taken any longer to explain.  The transitions from one part to the next are very crisp and dry.  I was hoping that this 2 disc dvd would include all the scenes that were cut from the movie due to it's length.  However, once you find the deleted scenes, there's not much special about them.  There's parts that are explained without the questions being asked.  The characters do play the parts well, and the essence is there, but the film just doesn't flow.  Spend your money on tickets to The Chamber of Secrets instead.	3.0	Good adaptation, but not good enough	2002-12-26	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AU503HFYAB0IG	"Christopher J. Benz ""CJB"""	Apparently, on agreeing to sell the Harry Potter film franchise, one of J K Rowling's conditions was that the cast had to be predominantly British. This request proved to have been one of the fundamental keys to the success of the movie version of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. At the risk of being contentious, fine as his work on the film is, I think the choice of Chris Columbus as director ensures a well made, slick product but also just that bit of blandness that prevents the film from being an absolute classic. Having said that, the casting is phenomenal, especially Radcliff and Watson, and the choice of remaining true to the novel rather than condensing and combining Rowling's work is at once inspired and obvious. Compared to the 'Lord of the Rings' saga released at the same time, it's a little bit too shiny, a bit too mainstream in it's style, but it's certainly a success because it gets all of the big things right, principally the characters. One wonders if Terry Gilliam (Rowling's first choice for director) had helmed the film, it might have been more unique, but could easily have become a mess too. Ultimately, the reason this film is so superb is because of Rowling's imagination and her good judgment in balancing plot with unforgettable characters.	4.0	Classic book, almost classic film	2009-07-20	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AYXZU81PMZBKC	"Christopher Wood ""anima300"""	THIS REVIEW WILL ONLY BE BASED ON THE MOVIE, AND ITS RELATION TO THE NOVEL.So this is the beginning, isn't it?  JK Rowling's incredible world of magic, that started in 1998 in America started on the movie screen in 2001.  So how good was this movie?  It was definitely very good.  Quite roughly it's about a boy who nearly died by the most dangerous dark wizard to ever step foot in the world, and ends up living with a muggle family related to his mother who treat him like an outcast and a bad seed, feeling disgraced and embarrassed that any family member could be magical.  But Harry receives a letter to go to one of the best magic schools, called Hogwarts, and he begins to learn about his unavoidable wizard heritage.You have to start with the acting, because starting with this film for the series, there has been a healthy mix of young new talent, and veteran talent throughout, and this film is no different.  The whole cast is virtually British with a few Irish exceptions.  You have Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris as McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore respectively anchoring the wonderful young talents of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy).  The acting is simply great in my opinion, considering they were enlisting child talent throughout the country.The important part of a film adaptation of a novel is bringing forward the spirit the novel creates.  The nice thing is that Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest of all the Harry Potters, so it makes it relatively easy to stay faithful with a 2 hour 20 minute film.  Chris Columbus and his people did a great job of this.  Nearly all of the important pieces are there for the adaptation to make sense, and for all the pieces to fit together as well as they did in the novel.Now, Harry Potter is obviously geared to young adults, so why should someone in their 20s or 30s get into Harry Potter?  First off, the film IS visually stimulating.  The special effects aren't overdone, nor is it the focus, but it's done perfectly to give what it has to give to the film.  Also, the children playing the roles really bring out what these characters are all about in the novel, as do the adult cast.  Their personalities are effectively evoked through their incredible performances, and although the concept of magic spells and high fantasy are more indicative of your stereotypical middle school nerd, it has a lot to offer about adolescence and self-doubt, even at the tender age of 11.  Perhaps JK Rowling didn't envision her saga would reach the adult demographic, but it did, and that's kind of what makes these stories amazing.So what was great about this film for it to deserve 4 out of 5 stars?  The acting was phenomenal, but the important thing when a series such as Harry Potter has so much popular culture buzz is to stay faithful so the bookworms can respect it, but so newbies can get into it and follow the films much like people would follow the novels, and Sorcerer's Stone definitely achieves this effectively.  The special effects were great when they were necessary, and the character introductions were well-played.  Enough things were changed around, such as the order of things, and certain settings, but the important parts were there, and the actions that occurred were evoked, even though something may have taken place on Hogwarts footsteps, as opposed to the Hogwarts train as it was in the novel (Harry's first confrontation with Malfoy, for example).What was negative for the film to not deserve five stars?  Well, it was what it was.  Most introductory novels to a fantasy series has to spend a significant amount of time introducing the characters and future plotlines, and Sorcerer's Stone is really no different.  The film isn't all that exciting, and there really isn't a ton of action.  I found the ending a little bit anti-climactic, although the twist was rather nice, but it really wasn't a battle.  Given what would go forward with the series, but if one was grading this movie in and of itself, it is a bit of an anti-climactic end.  There was also one omittance that was a bit irritating whichy was the end sequence (SPOILER ALERT) when Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the chamber to retrieve the Sorcerer's Stone before Professor Snape does (or so they believed anyway).  You had the Devil's Snare, the Flying Keys, and the Chess Match.  The film omitted the logic puzzle that Hermione figures out which is why in the novel she gets Gryffendor bonus points.  In the film she gets them through figuring out the Devil's Snare.  I wasn't really sure why this was omitted, probably for action continuity, but, I would have liked to have seen Hermione be her brainiac self for that portion.All-in-all, for introductory purposes, and its ability to ensnare filmgoers into coming to the movie theater to see the next segment, it succeeds admirably.  There really is nothing wrong with the film at all, but the four out of five stars comes down to taste, and as most of us know, soon the series begins to take a darker tone, which is when it really finds its stride.  But JK Rowling really does create a great world with this story, and the film more or less does a very good job in being able to evoke her incredible vision.	4.0	Fantastically Faithful, but it IS only introductory...	2010-04-17	2	1	1

For the most part, people seem to be most impressed with the fact that movie remained faithful to the book.  I agree, that impressed me as well.  But what really impressed me about this film are the excellent performances of the younger members of the cast.  Yes, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, and Alan Rickman were superb during their limited screen time.  But that was expected.  Radcliffe was perfect for the role.  His low-key acting is refreshing to watch compared to the epidemic of overacting we see in contemporary young actors.  He conveyed so much with his eyes, facial expressions, and body language.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also excellent in their roles, although Emma Watson did have a tendency to overact at times.  But then again, the character of Hermione is a bit intense to begin with.	5.0	Impressive Acting	2003-02-13	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AUE1NVVQGS816	CK	I think Most Harry Potter fans will enjoy this collection.  Extended version makes you feel like you're getting every morsel of (to me) the most endearing of the HP films because it's the first one when Harry, Hermione & Ron were at their cutest and most innocent.  For non book readers, it's the wondrous first introduction to the magical world of Hogwarts after all.  The rest of the bonus features are satisfyingly interesting, informative & entertaining although the self-guided tours are sort of lame & I'm not sure what I'll do w/ all the extra versions (in addn to the extended version, comes w/ the reg theatrical release plus a digital copy).  The rest of the bonus featurettes, although not as elaborate as the ones Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings, are still worth the few extra bucks if you're a fan of movie 'extras' of your favorite flicks.  I don't think I'll admit to owning the trading cards (LOL) but they ARE very nice - super heavy & larger than baseball trading cards.  The photo book is actually quite beautiful.  If the box/case weren't so nice (has an elegant magnetic closure) it would make a nice mini coffee table book.  At less than $20, I found this collection enjoyable enough to want to continue on to the Ultimate Collection as the prices go down.  I just ordered #2 (Chamber) at $19.48 incl shpg.  But the prices will no doubt go lower if you can wait another several months and don't mind continuing to watch the TV reruns for now when they have Harry Potter weekends.	5.0	Enjoyable enough to continue & order the Ultimate Edition #2	2010-10-05	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2112A5O4073WT	C. M. Kimball	"For a lot of reasons, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably a tempting movie to criticize.  After all, there is almost nothing a critic hates more than a film that is practically - baring some unforgivable act of gross incompetence - a guaranteed success, despite anything he or she might happen to write about it.At any rate, while some may quibble with the notion that Sorcerer's Stone is too much like the book that inspired it, the upside for moviegoers is that neither Rowling nor director Christopher Columbus have forgotten the film's primary audience: young readers between the ages of 12 - 16.  For those whose parents read the book to them, the age may actually drop a bit below that.For the most part, as every parent knows, it is an audience frequently patronized with the worst sort of infantile pap imaginable, inundated with coarse language and gratuitous violence, or simply ignored altogether.  Columbus, to his credit, does none of the above.  In remaining true to his audience, Columbus has, in fact, delivered a film for all of us.It is obvious Columbus knows, for instance, that a young audience wants to see on the screen what it read in the book.  In pursuit of this goal, Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned characters and settings true to the letter and the spirit of the novel. The characters, especially, strike just the right chord of familiarity.  Certainly, we all know that familiarity can wander over the line into disinterested comfort. Remarkably, the characters in Sorcerer's Stone never do.  Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, for instance, looks just as we expect him to.  More important, he radiates a warmth and trust that serves as a secure anchor in those moments when events seem to be spinning out of control.  As good as Hagrid is in the book, Coltrane's Hagrid is more vivid on the screen.Which brings us to the performance of Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter.  At first glance, Radcliffe seems reticent and withdrawn, hidden behind a gauze curtain, an uncertain hero. Yet we cannot forget that Harry Potter is an eleven year-old orphan whose parents have been murdered. He is a foundling whose caretakers resent his existence and actively disapprove of everything he is and, worse, in their own eyes, everything he will become. He is forced to sleep in a closet under the stairs and absorb a constant stream of verbal and physical abuse from his malevolent aunt and uncle and their overindulged son, Dudley.Yes, of course Harry is withdrawn.  Small wonder. Or, as my daughter would say, ""Duh!""In fact, Radcliffe's performance is entirely consistent with Harry's history and upbringing, and Columbus has wisely ensured that, as the chronicle of films progresses, the character of Harry has somewhere to go. There are, after all, six movies still to come. Columbus has clearly determined that, unlike some other celluloid heroes of recent memory (Indiana Jones springs to mind), the character of Harry Potter should have some room to develop, otherwise both the young wizard and his friends would grow quickly stagnant.Another notable attribute of the film is that the atmosphere and setting, through the more subtle elements of special effects, are beautifully realized. As the first-years are journeying across the lake, their - and our - first view of Hogwarts Castle is absolutely breathtaking, a spectacular, gothic memory from a medieval dream.  Inside the castle are stairways that move, pictures that talk and go about their daily routines, and a splendid dining hall that evokes the grandeur of a cathedral.  When the Sorting Hat pronounces ""GRIFFINDORE"" on this opulent stage, Harry's adventures officially begin.Yes, the adventure has its obvious, special effects masterpieces. The Quidditch match is a high-flying, fast-paced extravaganza of soccer, polo, and basketball on broomsticks. The chess match is the high point of the film.  At the same time, there are special effects so well done that they don't draw attention to themselves. The messenger owls flying gracefully into the dining hall to deliver envelopes and parcels is a brief, finely structured, aerial ballet that is easy to take for granted because we are momentarily suspended in the world of Hogwarts and have willingly cast aside our powers of disbelief.  When Hedwig flies above Hogwarts Castle, our spirits and our sense of wonder soar with him. It is an impressive accomplishment.Because it is true to itself and never panders to its audience, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is both exciting and entertaining, an escape to a world where magical things can still happen. It is, in short, a film for the child in all of us."	5.0	THE  WONDER  OF  ENCHANTMENT	2003-05-09	10	10	0

This movie lives up to the book, and even a little more. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with the Dursleys, mean spirited people who hate having Harry around. After much plot development, Harry finaly gets his letter to Hogwarts. There he meets his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). These little actors (and actress) are spectacular, Radcliffe and Grint are two very cute little boys, and Watson shines as the book smart Hermione. Ron and Hermione help Harry solve the mystery surrounding the ledgendary Sorcerer's Stone. I would give this movie ten stars, if I could, and I have both soundtracks, to the first and second films, and they are wonderful. The actors and actresses in this movie are to be aplauded.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1D1UXSNFBHOJH	Colin	"I enjoyed the film a lot and I expected a lot from the DVD (also considering the fact that WB boasts that the DVD will be unlike any other), but, I have to say, I was a bit disappointed with it. The film was fine, except, of course, the lack of audio commentary by the Director/Producer or the actors themselves. It was the second disc that bugged me a lot.I was lead to believe that there are tons of behind-the-scene flicks and production notes on the bonus disc but, to my horror, there weren't many. Oh, sure, there are the deleted scenes (which they didn't even incorporate to the film, unlike what Star Wars the Phantom Menace did) and an interview with the Director, Producer and Script Writer, but aside from those, the extras were really lame. You have to ""play"" your way around the disc in order for you to view the deleted scenes which is an original concept, but, quite frustrating after several turns. There are your screensaver, game demos, remembrall, potion-challenge and your virtual tour of Hogwarts (which was quite good but still lacking).Anyway, I was hoping to get a glimpse of the usual stuff--production notes, behind-the-scenes, interview with the actor, audition clips, costume design, creature design, the CG of Harry Potter, outtakes, etc. Stuff that really mattered. I wanted to get a glimpse of what it was to be on the set of Harry Potter, the opinion of the actors, anything about the MOVIE ITSELF. But what I got is a compilation of flash-type games that are not only annoying, but quite a nuance as well. One word summary: gimmicky.Sorry Harry. The only reason I gave it three stars is that I'm a big HP fan. If not for that, I'd probably give it a 2 or a 1."	3.0	Style over Substance?	2002-05-14	5	3	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3NE5Q4948G1TI	Coolcat441	... As are all movies that are based on a book. There are no exceptions to that. You *cannot* take a movie, and make it exactly like the book. You can try, but probably will not succeed. The book creates its own little world, which is unique to only itself. You can take a movie and make it close to the book, but it will never be exactly the same. That's what I needed to get out of the way. Now, onto business.I am as much of a Harry Potter fan as anybody, perhaps even more. I have read the books dozens of times each, and am anxiously awaiting the 5th one, as is the rest of the world. I believe J.K. Rowling to be one of the greatest authors that ever lived, as do the tens of millions of people that have read her books.I was thrilled when I learned that my favorite series of all time was going to be up on the big screen. Absolutely thrilled. But at the same time I was a bit paranoid. I knew that you cannot make the movie exactly like the book, even with great casting and wicked special effects. I also knew that since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a mildly long book, that the director would have to cut quite a few things out.And I was right. They did. You have to understand that thousands of kids love the books, and if the movie would have included everything that was in the books, the kids would not have been able to sit that long. What the movie did do, though, was take all of the important scenes that were in the book. Yes, I was ticked off when I heard that Peeves wouldn't be in the movie because of time reasons, and of course the missing potions scene was a bit disappointing. But they got all of the good aspects of the book in the movie, which is more important then a mischievous poltergeist and a silly logic sequence.I thought the acting was wonderful, and that the special effects were great *as expected*. Turning a movie into a book is extremely hard work, especially if the movie you're trying to make was one of the most successful book series in all time. I think that they did a splendid job, and I cannot wait for the second one to come out.	4.0	Not as good as the book...	2002-07-30	3	3	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AKHBXKC2MNN5L	"""cori_r_g"""	Kids, Adults, everyone everywhere! Harry Potter was an amazing movie! The Book was absolutely amazing, and the movie was a brilliant adaption!It is about an orphan named Harry Potter, who unknowingly ruined a horrible and powerful wizard named Voldemort as a baby. He was celebrated and known all over the wizarding world! Harry's only living relatives were his aunt and uncle who were muggles (non-wizrds) and Harry is forced to live with them, though they hate him for being a wizard. Harry knows nothing of being a wizard until a messanger from the wizarding world shows up at Harry's doorstep and tells him he was accpeted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is faced with problems when he comes to Hogwarts. Harry and his two best friends, Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger find out that a teacher is trying to steal something that may bring Voldemort back to life! It is up to them to find out who, when no teacher or the head of The Gryffindors (a class)believes them, and the only person who would listen is the man who isn't there: the Headmaster Dumbledore.Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) plays his part quite well, and has brang an image of Harry Potter to life. The roles of Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) were so fantastically played! I felt as if I personally knew them by the end of the movie! They were convincing and displayed their roles with enthusiasm. Maggie Smith played the head of the Gryffindor house, and Alan Rickman who played Head of the Slytherin house, were great! They are amazing actors in an amazing movie! The movie would not be the same without their performance! Richard Harris, played Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He was perfectly suited for the role! After reading all the books, i had a clear image of what Dumbledore would look like, and Richard Harris could have convinced me he was the real Dumbledore! Unfortunately, he passed away during the summer and the third film forwards will be played by a different actor, but Richard Harris will live on in our hearts.	5.0	LOVED IT!	2004-02-15	2	2	0

The only reason I can see to make the film they made is to make money. Doesn't anyone care about making a good movie? There is absolutely no artisitc talent in here besides J.K. Rowlings. Someone just read the book, typed in the dialogue, and found some rich millionaire to fund their movie. I see these people gushing over how Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition) stayed so close to the book. This movie didn't deserve to be made. I read the books, I liked them, but what I was really hoping for was something different, someone's else's interpretation of the book. But that wouldn't make money, would it? Three-fourths of the country would attack Chris Columbus whining and complaining that they have read each of the books 10 million times backwards and that the movie should have beem EXACTLY like the book because these people have the IQ of a microwave and can't handle new plot lines. A note to the country: grow up. If anyone tries to give me this DVD, i'm burning  it.	1.0	It's the book....	2002-07-07	8	1	7
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	In 1997, unknown author J.K. Rowling had her first novel published. Not only was it an intelligent and highly imaginative fantasy story, but it also served as the first book in a seven-part series.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone(later renamedHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stonefor American readers) renewed children's interest in reading and became an international bestseller, receiving high acclaim and multiple awards. The book became a cultural phenomenon and after the publication of its sequel,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, a film adaptation was inevitable. Harry Potter was one of the most sought after properties in cinematic history, and attracted the attention of Hollywood's biggest names. Ultimately, Chris Columbus directed the film, from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.When Harry Potter was only a year old, his parents were mysteriously killed and he was sent to live with his mother's sister's family, the extremely unpleasant Dursleys. From an early age, young Harry Potter proved to be an unusual child. Once while on a visit to the zoo, Harry accidentally made a pane of glass disappear letting loose a python, which scared his obnoxious cousin Dudley half to death.On Harry's eleventh birthday, a half-giant named Hagrid explains that Harry's mother was a witch and his father was a wizard and that Harry's been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns that his parents did not die in a mysterious car crash as he had been told, but rather they had been killed by the notorious Dark Lord, Voldemort, often referred to as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Hagrid accompanies Harry to London and from there to Diagon Alley, where magical supplies can be bought. Harry buys his first wand, his spellbooks, and Hagrid even gives him a snowy white owl named Hedwig. From there he's off to Hogwarts by way of the Hogwarts Express, a bright red train, which leaves from Platform 9 at King's Cross Station. While waiting for the train Harry meets a large wizarding family, the Weasleys, and befriends their youngest son Ron while on the train. Harry and Ron also meet Hermione, a clever but often snobby young girl.After arriving at Hogwarts Castle, Harry and the other first year students are sorted into one of four houses. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are placed into Gryffindor, a house that is renowned for having courageous and loyal students. Harry meets the different teachers: the kind yet stern Professor MacGonagall, the malicious Professor Snape, twitchy and nervous Professor Quirrell, and the wizened and eccentric headmaster Dumbledore. Harry soon learns that each teacher treats him differently. MacGonagall, despite her chilly demeanor is very clearly fond of Harry, but Snape on the other hand seems to have a vendetta against Harry. Harry also learns of a rivalry between the school houses of Gryffindor and Slytherin, and this rivalry is exemplified by an arrogant bully named Draco Malfoy.One day Harry, Ron, and Hermione get lost in the castle and come across a room that's being guarded by a three-headed dog. Harry, Ron, and Hermione soon learn that the dog is guarding a series of hidden passageways and rooms, where something called the Sorcerer's Stone is being stored. The Sorcerer's Stone has the power to make whoever possesses it immortal. After a bit of late night investigating, Harry comes to believe that someone, probably Snape, is trying to steal the stone for Lord Voldemort. With the stone, Voldemort would be restored to his full power and he would again terrorize the world of magic. Can Harry, Ron, and Hermione prevent Voldemort's return and who can Harry trust in this world full of magic and intrigue?Adapting such an inventive and detailed story would prove difficult, and yet the film is successful as it manages to include almost all of the important characters and events from Rowling's novel.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone became a worldwide blockbuster and set Box Office records. There are a number of reasons for the film's colossal success. One of those reasons is the group of highly talented special effects artists that were gathered in order to create the style and look of the film. Also making a huge contribution were the experts who designed the costumes, the props, the sets, and the general atmosphere of the film. But the person who deserves the most credit is Rowling herself, who created an immaculate fantasy world that holds a universal appeal for both children and adults.The extraordinary cast includes veteran British actors, as well as some talented young unknowns (who aren't unknown anymore). The cast features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore.Though the film is a marvelous attempt at turning Rowling's novel into a physical reality, it does have its flaws. Much of the time the special effects are unconvincing, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't used as the centerpiece of almost every scene. Another problem, and this is a very minor problem, is that some of the younger cast members under emote, or give stiff and forced performances. However, the acting will improve with each successive Harry potter film.Ultimately, Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts will be remembered and treasured by fans of all ages for many years to come.I also recommendthe spectacular soundtrack by John Williams.	4.0	Year One at Hogwarts	2008-10-16	1	0	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	For those of you that have been living in a cave for the last several years, Harry Potter is a boy-wizard, raised by &quot;Muggles&quot; (non-magical people) who is taken away to a private school for wizards and witches when he turns 11.  The success of J.K. Rowling's books made a film version inevitable, but also a risky venture (2nd only to Lord of the Rings).  Chris Columbus's film stands up well on the surface.  Unfortunately, in a more in-depth analysis, it's not much more than a kiddie movie.In defense of the filmakers, they saw the challenge of this first Harry Potter film as faithfully reproducing the atmosphere and magic of Hogwarts, the school.  This they did admirably well with fantastic sets and a liberal helping of computer-generated images.  Some of the CGI looks cartoony, but I suspect it is to prevent younger viewers from being scared.  Likewise, the characters are faithfully reproduced by the actors - I was especially impressed with Smith as Prof. McGonagall, the teacher who demands a lot, is a strict disciplinarian, but still admired.  We've all known teachers like that, but the performance generates such respect that you totally believe in McGonagall (rather than the screenplay dictating it), even in her rediculous witch hat.  Likewise, Rickman and Harris as Snape and Dumbledore are pretty much exactly as you would picture them from reading the book.However, I have to question the interpretation in places.  The two main misteps (the blame for which I place on director Columbus) are:  1. Harry is far too rebellious and confident in some scenes - to the point of arrogance - which was not Rowling's intention.  2. In filming most of the events of the book, the running time blew up to 150 minutes.  This is not an adaptation so much as a photocopy!  However, if interest was more in the environment than the story, future films will be better (especially as each book gets longer, it will be impossible to film all the events).  All things considered, it's an enjoyable movie, although with limited replay enjoyment.As a special edition 2-DVD set, I was disappointed by the lack of material.  The entire 2nd disc is devoted to little games that are annoying to adults and not fun enough to hold a child's interest.  Especially annoying is the fact that to access the deleted scenes, you have to navigate through many games that give you little direction to solving the puzzles, and that kick you back to the beginning if you choose wrong.  ARGH!  Also, the &quot;making-of&quot; featurette is quite short (16 minutes).  There is no commentary or other extras - why not bring in Rowling for a commentary on how things were adapted?  Therefore, it's a disappointing DVD version of an enjoyable film.	3.0	Very good try, but doesn'te make it to the &quot;great DVD&quot; level	2003-02-12	11	9	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2W0SHGPT7O0OI	"""critic_2000"""	"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was definitely one of the best films of the year and one of the best fantasy films of all time. I was not disappointed at all, unlike some fans of Harry Potter. I thought Chris Columbus did a great adaptation of the book and I couldn't have asked for better. The film was very faithful, only leaving out some small scenes because you honestly could never fit the entire book into the movie...I mean, just look at ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring""! Some people claim that a movie can never live up to the book it is based on, but in some cases that is not always true. Sometimes, the movie is actually BETTER than the book--so give the movie a chance! And also, I hate it when people say that, if a movie is apart of a series, since the first movie was bad then they do not want to see the other movies. Well, if you've read all four Harry Potter books then you know the better, more interesting stuff comes later...so just stick around and see the other movies before you judge even if you thought ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was boring and/or disappointing.I thought the casting was absolutely perfect! Daniel Radcliffe doesn't just PLAY the role of Harry Potter...he IS Harry Potter! Rupert Grint is funny and witty as Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson is smart and charming as Harry's other best friend, Hermione Granger. Tom Felton is really great as Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch rival at Hogwarts, Alan Rickman is creepy as Professor Snape. Richard Harris is mezmorising as Professor Dumbledore. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and wonderful as Hagrid, the half friendly giant. And Maggie Smith is superb as Professor McGonagall. The rest of the cast are really good, too. In another review down below, I read that they are going to replace Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint (probably along with the rest of the child actors) for the ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" film and the rest of the Harry Potter films. I really hope they do not do that...these child actors are perfect! I thought they were going to do a film each year because each year these child actors will be a year older, like they are in the books. So they really do not need to replace them. So please do not replace any of these actors, because that will only ruin the movies!!Did I mention the special effects? Because the special effects are truly amazing!! I especially loved the big chess board scene and the Quidditch match, though in the book, they have two Quidditch matches. Hogwarts castle is truly spectacular! John Williams' score is haunting and breathtaking. The dialouge is OK, but it's really a children's fantasy film...it's not supposed to be another ""A Beautiful Mind"". For those who say ""The Lord of the Rings"" is better, get over it! They are two totally different movies! I really wish people would stop trying to compare movies like ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Spider-Man"", and ""Star Wars"" because they are all different. Why do we have to choose between them? Can't we like them all?!The DVD includes the following special features:*Never-before-seen footage*Deleted Scenes*Self-guided tour of Hogwarts*A game where you can mix potions, perform transfigurations, explore Diagon Alley, catch a snitch, explore the library, and ""attend"" classes (you actually have to play this game in order to get to the bonus footage and deleted scenes...I didn't know this until after I bought the DVD and it's kind of tricky)*Theatrical trailers*DVD-ROM PC Extras*Selected Scenes*Languages & Subtitles in English and Spanish*Top picture quality*Top audio quality*Two discs--first disc plays full-length film; second disc plays special features""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is a wonderful film! It's rated 'PG' for some scary scenes and mild language. As for all this religious stuff against Harry Potter, I'd say that the story of Harry Potter doesn't teach your children to learn black magic...if anything, it teaches them good friendship and what good verses evil means.Film Grade: A+DVD Grade: A-"	5.0	"Really and truly is the ""Wizard of Oz"" of its time!"	2002-06-13	1	1	0

I do wish that interviews with the cast had been included.I was delighted that the movie followed so closely to the book.  There were a few scenes that were different (students sent to the Forbiden Forest, Norbert, Harry and Draco's meeting, etc.) but that did not detract from the movie.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A854E5FCL8X1I	customer	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) introduces audiences to the imaginative world created by JK Rowling through the eyes of Hollywood filmmakers, and it is truly fantastic!The story presented in the book is timeless, but what makes the Harry Potter series so appealing (in my opinion) is how cleverly Rowling describes Hogwarts and the rest of the magical world. It translates wonderfully to the big screen and really brings the book to life.Speaking of the book, the film is quite faithful to the original story. I think that it is the most accurate of any film in the series to date. Although staying strictly by the book doesn't guarantee a great movie, this film has no problems.It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. Their acting isn't quite brilliant, but they are cute in the roles. Other actors such as Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Alan Rickman have supporting roles.The first Harry Potter film is splendid entertainment! 5 stars.	5.0	Hugely Entertaining!	2009-07-10	0	0	0

Gorgeous color, dense black, magnificent Dolby Surround sound track that grows on you, I swear, the more times I see the film, the more I like John Williams scoring..it was kinda fomrula in the theater, but it really is an enjoyable  set of notes.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A9V06G9SIID08	Dafydd Mac an Leigh	When &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; hit the bookstores in 1997, it quickly established the kind of popularity which makes a film version all but inevitable. For four years straight, J.K. Rowling churned out books in what has become one of the most popular contemporary children's book series. Now, of course, attention has been turned to adapting them for film.If they can't even get the title right, what hope does the rest of the movie have?The cast is a mixed bag. Harry himself is played very well by Daniel Radcliffe, best known (before this) for his portrayal of David Copperfield for the BBC. Alan Rickman is brilliant as Prof. Snape; Dame Maggie Smith would have been better as Prof. McGonagall if she dropped the &quot;Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; accent. Richard Harris an Robbie Coltraine look their roles as Dumbledore and Hagrid respectively, but seem incapable of acting them. As for Harry's classmates, well, Rupert Grint, as Ron, gets little to do but react facially, Emma Watson is insufferable as Hermione, Tom Felton fails to exude any malice as Malfoy, and the rest are just there.The filmmakers went out of their way to make the film look as good as possible, which I can greatly appreciate. Unfortunately, that care didn't extend to anything else. Screenwriter Steven Kloves seems completely ignorant of the basic rules for adapting a book to screen; he retains extraneous bits while cutting vital plot progressions. Moreover, he gives thoroughly English characters thoroughly American turns of phrase. Director Chris Columbus does a very shoddy job of pacing; he could have kept in all seven of those deleted scenes and still come out with a shorter movie if he'd just kept things moving.  The flavor and the magic of the book are just drained out of this movie.And now we have the DVD. There are one or two interesting bits to it, like the deleted scenes, the trivia, and a short amalgam of behind-the-scenes interviews, but the rest is convoluted nonsense that - rather like the movie, actually - takes much longer than it needs to and is wholly unsatisfying by the end.I say forget about this cinematic mediocrity and settle down for a good read.	1.0	Very poor adaptation	2002-06-12	35	6	29

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A169I83JL8QJGN	Daniel A Moir	"I must admit that I am biased toward material specifically geared toward children. Very seldomly does a childrens movie contain material that is enjoyable for adults as well. When Harry Potter began to get popular I just ignored it, something I had learned to do when I got sick of the Pokemon mania that was ending just around that time. I had no desire to get involved with the Harry Potter franchise.I was suprised that this movie seemed to begin planning and wrap shooting in six months. Two months later the movie was in theaters. When a movie is done in that short of time I tend to really doubt its ability to be a good movie. My parents begged and pleaded with me to visit them one night, and they had planned a trip to see this movie for a family activity. I didn't really want to go but I'm glad I did.The movie was far from unenjoyable, and while the CGI effects were not spectacular the story was innovative, and fun despite being childish. The movie manages to be childish, but not immature, which makes it one of the most enjoyable kiddie flicks to date. I'm actually looking forward to the sequel.The acting in this movie is spectacular. I have not seen such talent in youth since Haley Joel Osment. The actors were also well cast as far as appearances because the actors resemble the characters they are portraying more so than any other movie of its kind. I am very pleased with the way this movie was done. If the special effects were better it would have otten five stars from me.I have not had time to check out the DVD extras yet, however just reading the back of the box has me itching for the time to do just that. I also must stress the importance of getting this movie in Widescreen I have seen both the Widescreen and Pan & [Scan] (Full screen) editions of this movie. You loose a lot of picture on the Pan & [Scan] version as the movie was presented in a 2:35:1 ratio, more than half of the picture is lost in the transition to ""Full Screen""."	4.0	The best kiddie movie I've seen so far...	2002-06-25	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2PDC6SESC021Q	Daniel	This movie version of the first volume of Harry Potter.  It is a wonderful movie.  It closely, very closely follows the plot of the book.  First I will rate the movie part then the special features.Harry potter is has alot going for it.  it has an amazing storyline, and amazing special effects.  The story is about a young boy named Harry Potter.  As a baby he was dropped off at his aunt and uncles house.  He was abused, then hagrid, a wizard came and told him he was excepted to Hogwarts school of wichchraft and wizardry.  The acting is probably the best I've seen in children actors.  The chemistry between the trio is amazing.  it adds a whole lot of enjoyment.  And the special effects, they are amazing.  The best special effects I've seen in a movie.  This movie blends modern technology and a great story, to make one of the best movies of 2001.Next I will review the special features disk.The special features are great.  They include a tour of Hogwarts, puzzles and games, and a commentary.  The point of the game is to get to the end, witch has many deleted scenes.  The tour of Hogwarts is also pretty cool.  It can't go through the whole of Hogwarts, but it does go through quite a bit.  The commentary is about the making of the movie, which is quite interesting.  Basically the special features are great.  This has better special features even than Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace.  The special features are very unique, quite like the movie.Overall this is the DVD of the year, and definetly worth buying.	5.0	A wonderful DVD and movie.	2002-09-02	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"In 2001, two fall blockbusters involving witchcraft and wizards reached the theatres.  Unfortunately, I don't have a wand with which to say ""Review autoscriptus!"" or some snowy owls on one-day delivery standby so I have to do this with my fingers (sigh) and create words of wonder on the movie I liked better.While I haven't read J.K. Rowling's books, it must have been chock full of detail  I don't know of the movie:book accuracy ratio, but for director Chris Columbus to fit it in two and-a-half hours, it must have been a book spectacularis.Witches and wizards were persecuted throughout the ages, regarded as threats more than freaks as Harry's aunt did her sister, and more often than not, burned at the stake.  With Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the song remains the same, only this time, his uncle, aunt, and obnoxious cousin treat him contemptuously, as if he's an unwanted burden.  Who knows how his life would have been without the flurry of invitations to Hogwarts School courtesy of one-day owl delivery?  Fortunately, giant Rubeas Hagrid comes crashing to the rescue.  The real adventure begins from there.Daniel Radcliffe gives a performance competentus and credibilis as the totally likeable title character.  Of the troika of main characters, he's the most human.  However, Emma Watson as the resourceful and well-read Hermione Granger steals the show wands aloft.  Despite being snooty and knowing who she is, she proves herself to be a cut above others in classes (see her frantically waving on Professor Snape to call on her, and her proficient wand handling).  She does have feelings, though, as she angrily stomps past through Weasley, who fed up with her conceit, was verbally cutting her down a peg to Harry, finishing with ""No wonder she doesn't have any friends.""  If Hermione's character leads more children to flip pages instead of flipping bad guys on their PS2's or X-Box's, so much the better.  Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, makes a good foil for both his counterparts, being a fellow explorer and Christmas holiday companion with Harry or someone for Hermione to impart knowledge.The other performer to whom this show belongs to is veteran actor Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant gameskeeper Rubeas Hagrid.  After Krull, Nuns On The Run, two James Bond movies, and From Hell among others, he has finally become a recognizable face on American shores.  American audiences should have warmed up to this talented performer earlier, and that's something I should've said.As for other veteran actors, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Zoe Wanamaker do wonders as the professors of Hogwarts, but Alan Rickman turns in a solid performance as the sinister Professor Snape, who doesn't seem to like Harry all that much.People, (or should that be muggles?) this is one movie specialus.  The special effects, while spectacular, do not detract from the character development or dialogue, like certain films I'm not going to name.  They merely support the magic whether it's the entrance to the square or the action scenes, such as the Quidditch match.Well, review terminatus, and see you at the theatres for the Chamber of Secrets"	5.0	Video Excellentus!	2002-06-25	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	It is really quite amazing that a major motion picture not only remained very faithful indeed to Rowling's original novel but actually succeeded very well in recreating the magical scenery and extraordinary environment of Hogwarts. The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen.Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwarts, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus. I've watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone several times now, and I have enjoyed it greatly each and every time.	5.0	A faithful, bedazzling adaptation of Rowling's novel	2003-06-19	1	1	0

Harry Potter is not profound.Unlike classics of children's literature, the Harry Potter books show us what happens to Harry, but we never get to know who Harry is.  The books read like screenplays, one event after another.  Things happen to Harry, but we never get to climb inside Harry's head and find out what he thinks about them.  All we see is what he does.The movie is just as surface-level.

I feel the Special Effects were weak given the time and budget.  That said, it's still a good film and I like the main characters - Harry, Ron, Hagrid and Dumbledore (no, I'm not a big Hermione nor McGonagoll fan.)

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1X73UKO4S8EPV	"Dan Tate ""Father, husband, son"""	This movie had it been released at a different time during the year, or a different year it would have been much better and recieved a much higher rating. So let me explain myself. The director's adaptation was weak at best, and left the true Harry Potter fans wishing for more.  Who is Hermione Granger, where does she come from, how about Draco Malfoy,  all we know is that Hermione and Harry are friends and Draco and Harry are not.  Why does Draco hate Hermione and Ron so much?  There are so many plot holes you could drive a fleet of Mack trucks through them.  Yes I know that there are going to be a lot more movies coming out and they have to introduce the characters slower than in the books, but still they should have provided a background of some of the students.With that said the acting was only ok.  Very rarely could I even sense the hatred that Draco Malfoy has for Hermione and Ron, and feelings that Harry, Ron, and Harry have for Snape and Malfoy.  Granted the acting is done primarily by children, so hopefully with time they will become better at staying in character and following character true to the books. Stone is so recent that the majority of moviegoers have read the book, and Stone leaves out quite a bit of information and skips very good scenes. Because of this Harry Potter die hard fans did not like the movie.  Also the special effects team had a great opportunity to impress the audience through the Quidditch matches, however it was too short, and in all honestly didn't look real.  My desire and the desire of many is to actually feel what it would be like to ride a broomstick and dive for the golden snitch!  Luckily they now have opportunities to make the effects better and develop the characters more in Chamber.	3.0	Sorry wrong year	2002-08-12	1	0	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A175USUF78NLR5	"Dan T. Duong ""HUNG DUONG"""	"""Harry Potter and SS"" is the best fantastic movies I have watched so far. Together with the excellent skills of director Christ Columbus and well-done acting of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as three main characters, and other stellar casts,  ""Harry Potter and SS"" has becomes one of the most-watched movies once it's first released in the threater. The plot mainly focuses on the friendship between Harry and his two best friends, Hermione and Ron, and how they struggle throughout the movie to make the stone protected from the Lord Voldermore, an evil darkwizard. As the movie begins, Harry Potter, portraits by Daniel Radcliffe, a 10-years-old wizard is being treated so badly by his mean uncle and aunt. The Dursley's family has been concealing the fact that Harry doesn't belong in this Muggle world, and try all attempts to block all the invited letters from Hogward, a magical school where all young wizards go. It all changes, however, until his eleventh birthday when Hagrid, a giantkeykeeper of Hogward, comes and directly give him a letter, which simply says that Harry has been acccepted to attend to Hogward. Leaving the Dursley's family to go to Howard, Harry learns all about the death of his parents and begins to feel himself important as every wizard eagerly wants to shake his hands wherever he passes by. He also learns that the scar on his forhead, which makes him invulnerable from LV when he was a little baby, has made him the most famous wizard in the Wizard World. Once Harry sets foot on Hogward, a school full of matric spells, he struggles to make himself adjusted to the new World; he befriends with Ron and Hermione and other young wizards as well. Ron, who is Harry's closest companion, keeps Harry reasonable at all times and is willing to risk his life and everything he could for friendship. In the movie, you will witness how he sacrifies himself in the magnificently dangerous chessmatch in order for Harry to keep going. On the other hand, Hermione is a sensitive and very intelligent girl who really helpful throughout the movie. Thanks to her knowledgable tips, Harry could be able to choose the right potion and move on to the next door.  Perhaps, that is their friendship which makes the movie go smoothly and held my interest and curiosity 'til the end, when Harry is face-to-face with LV.......This movie is highly recommended for all, especially for youths who are searching for adventure and fantastic movies.Hung Duong"	5.0	Great movie for all!	2007-06-22	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	The first film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's popular books. I like it but it feels overly long. In one of the few movies with a primarily young cast that actually have brilliant performances, each capturing the essence of the characters from the books. The leads are definitely the highlights of the film and have continued to get better. What helps I think is that they're surrounded by vetern actors Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters etc. much like Christopher Reeve was in the first Superman. My main complaint on what keeps this from getting a full five stars is that the director is trying to literally adapt the book. True there are sections and characters missing like Peeves the Poltergeist, the sub-plot of Ron (or someone else, I can't remember exactly who right now) telling Neville to stand up for himself (which would explain why he stands up to the threesome near the end but I guess not wanting his house to lose anymore points is a good enough reason) and the midnight duel with Malfoy, which in the book, leads Harry and the others to Fluffy, not walking in there by mistake after the staircase changes. But some scenes could've been trimmed. The Quidditch scene, Harry and Ron being late for Transfiguration and the goblins scene in Gringotts. I think they could've just cut to Harry and Hagrid arriving at his vault after Hagrid points and tells Harry about the wizarding bank but then again that's just my opinion. John Williams provides the music again and its good but I think its not up to his usual quality like the other films of his I've reviewed. I know he's going for the fantasy aspect in some cues but I just don't like it. Even the actions sequences feel boring. And is it just me or, besides the scene in the reptile house, does Harry not perform any magic in this movie?	4.0	I'm Not One To Complain About A Long Movie But Man This Was Long	2009-10-22	0	0	0

If you loved reading ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", you'll love this movie.  I think Daniel Radcliffe is charming as the loveable Harry and Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione.  That being said, I have to say that the second disc of this 2 dvd set is a nightmare.  Whoever thought that fans would love being tortured with extremely vague directions and almost non existent clues to finding the deleted scenes, etc., should be fired.  I hope Warner Brothers will think over their concept for the dvd for the second movie.  My roommates and I have tried to find all the supposed options and haven't yet been able to decipher any clues.  A friend rented the VHS version and it had two of the deleted scenes.  We were hoping all the deleted scenes would be on the VHS but even it is a disappointment.  One would think that Warner Brothers would have rewarded the fans of this phenomenonally popular series with a dvd that would be fun and easy---especially since kids are gonna be wanting this dvd.  If adults can't figure out the annoyingly hidden clues, I doubt very serious if young Harry Potter fans will be able to either.  Buy the dvd for the movie, which as I have said before, is fun and charming.  But if you are looking for all the extras, be prepared to be extremely frustrated.  I would love to have given the dvd 5 stars---as far as I'm concerned, the movie is 5 stars.  However, given the jumbled mess of the second dvd, I'm only giving it 3 stars.

I think of this movie as Lord of the Rings for kids, perhaps a more serious Wizard of Oz. The special effects make the physics defying wizardry very realistic, and the kids love it.Unfortunately, evil is portrayed darker than I like my kids to watch. [I'll be a bit vague here to error on the side of not spoiling the movie for you.] The evil wizard (whose name escapes me now) drinks unicorn blood, and the scene with the two-faced man is intense -- based on my parental standards.Nevertheless, a good movie, that for now, will remain well supervised.	4.0	Great movie...some scenes and topics not for small children.	2002-08-15	2	1	1

From the first glimpse Diagon Alley, on through to the walls of Hogwarts and out, finally, to the vibrant Quidditch field...this movie is pure magic.  The film also carries today's audiences into what will certainly be an entirely new genre of theater entertainment.  The special effects are amazing.  The original John Williams score is a perfect match.  The casting,(no, it could never quite capture the exact book!), was thoroughly effective.  This movie is end to end fun, adventure, and, well, magic.  Perfect for all ages, save a little violence and Fluffy (cover the kids eyes), this movie gets about as high and honor as I can offer.

As such, I found I didn't particularly care about what happened to them.  The actors did a fine job (given the material they had to work with), but it just seemed empty to me.Movies based on books always have to omit huge amounts of material but it seems like the characters suffered the most in this adaptation.  I'd much rather have had less of the sportplayed with flying broomsticks (and the giant chess game) and much more characterization.	2.0	What the...?	2002-11-18	3	0	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2NIGI5371S5U6	David Khaindrava	It is very seldom that an adaptation of a book as good as Harry Potter turns out to be such an excellent movie.Thanks to exceptional writing and directing movie is very close to the book. Even though I am a strong believer in reading a book before watching a movie, I must admit that this movie can be an exception. The story is untouched, casting is brilliant, visual effects are amazing. Real characters and scenery are perfectly blended with computer-generated graphics.  I watched the movie twice in the theater and could not wait to get the DVD. You can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it.Definitely worth buying.	5.0	A Perfect Movie	2002-09-06	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A214HWAW1PYWO8	"David Schoenmann ""strideknight"""	This movie, while yes it had magnificent visual effects and stunning imagery, relied solely upon that.  The acting was horrible, particularly by the boy playing Harry Potter himself.  The entire time he didn't show any resemblance of emotion and entirely lacked dimension.  Not to mention that with all the cuts and edits of the book there is next to no character development for anyone but Potter himself.  Furthermore, in comparison to the book, they cut and rewrote sequences, vital to the story that ultimately resulted in the book and movie versions being to completely different stories.  Instead of developing Dumbledore, Hagrid, or any number of the supporting characters, or ACCURATELY portraying their forray into the Forbidden Forest, or accurately portraying the ending itself, or the sequence with Fluffy, they made 15-20 minute sequences of lone visual effects for the quidditch match.  Not even all of the quidditch matches, just one.Overall, this movie was just an asinine insult to any true Harry Potter fans.  I would've gladly traded the entirety of the visual effects for an accurate storyline.  They chopped, sliced, and diced the book to death, entirely rewriting sequences that leaves you wondering why something is happening, and why it's not even SIMILAR to the book.  The only reason it got 2 stars from me is the visual effects.If you're looking for a true life version of the book, hope that the second movie is better.	2.0	Oh come on	2002-04-02	4	2	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3P6F06EZC7PM1	David Wimmer	"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" may be best summed up as a hearty, destiny-driven quest. The costume design, art direction, and score by the invincible John Williams are among the best of the year, but it is the film's strict adherence to J.K. Rowling's engrossing tale that makes it worthy of its record setting box office numbers. A far more centralized and child friendly flick than ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", Harry Potter fans could not ask for anything more than what fluidly caresses the movie screen. I don't imagine that the movie is any less fun on the small screen, either. The only measurable flaw with ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" is Chris Columbus' failure to bust out the magic of child actor directing he showed in deserving family films like the ""Home Alone"" series. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who play the popular triumvirate of Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, often seem delayed in their reactions and pretty stiff in their dialogue. Radcliffe redeems himself when it counts, though, in a cliffhanging ending that pits him against his worst enemy and unescapable destiny. Alan Rickman's strong but underused performance as nasty Severus Snape made us hate his role all the more. My verdict: A film worthy of family time and enjoyment that children and, yes, even teens like myself deserve to see when they go to the movie theater. David's Favorites: Best actor or actress: Alan RickmanBest scene: Quidditch game.Comparable to: ""The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"""	4.0	A hearty, destiny-driven quest	2002-05-22	6	6	0

I cant wait for the next book and for chamber to be released on film.

None of this material is in the least bit original.  It's just given a new hair cut and presented to an audience of children who are unaware of how much is borrowed from C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien and a slew of other authors.The film is overly long and doggedly loyal to the book, which offers up no surprises.  I had hoped that more children would have looked at this movie and realized it could have been much, much better.  As it is, there are some fun scenes, but they are hidden among more boring scenes.  I felt as though the movie was always building up to something that never arrived and then the credits rolled.	3.0	Succeeds in being not lousy...but is boring in parts.	2002-05-30	2	0	2

In order to do the book justice the film would be 5 hours long!  With that in mind, can this 2 1/5 hour film due justice to this highly anticipated film?  The answer is a resounding yes.  Tickets sales proved that. Of course knowing the book, the viewer understands and appreciates more of the movie.  Having read the book, you subconsciously fill in the blanks.  For those who haven't read the book, the film does a good job carrying the story as reasonable as possible.  It's no different than reading a Steven King or Clancy novel and expecting the film to be as detailed.  Give credit where credit is due.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Under Chris Columbus' masterful direction, with an appropriate score by John Williams--the theme song being a creeping waltz that has that ""once upon a time in a haunted castle"" expression about it, the inaugural film of J.K. Rowling's beloved young wizard--vividly brought to life by the perfectly cast 11-year-old Daniel Radcliffe--takes flight.I fondly recall the initial photo of the trio of the film's young leads when they were first introduced to the world, and how everyone cooed over them. They did not fail to live up to expectations, and in fact surpassed them!The story begins one evening in the fictional English neighborhood of Little Whinging in the town of Surrey, where a wizened old wizard named Albus Dumbledore(the incomparable Richard Harris, fulfilling his granddaughter's wish that he play the role)uses a magical device called a deluminator to draw light from the area's streetlamps as he waits with anticipation an arrival of great significance. He pauses to acknowledge the presence of another professor of their school--the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--named Minerva McGonagall (the equally incomparable Dame Maggie Smith)who transfigures from cat to human, and consults Dumbledore about a recent tragic event.Coming forth from catastrophy, bundled in the flying motorcycle of a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)is a sleeping one-year-old infant with a jagged scar on his forehead, whom the three deposit on a residential doorstep despite McGonagall's misgivings.Ten years later, we find the young Harry Potter, an orphaned ward of his abusive and neglectful Aunt Petunia(Fiona Shaw), and Uncle Vernon Dursley( Richard Griffiths), and their spoiled, ill-bred son Dudley(Harry Melling)on Dudley's birthday. Relegated to a room in a cupboard under the stairs of his guardians' home on Privet Drive, as well as to cast-off and ill-fitting clothing, Harry is the servant of the family who prepares and serves the meals while Dudley has no responsibilities, all the priviledges, and mistreats his cousin, who has remained sweet, self effacing,polite, and unbroken, just as his parents do.But this boy's version of a Cinderella story begins to take an unusual turn when the family visit the zoo on Dudley's birthday, and Harry personally empathizes with the confinement of the zoo's boa constrictor, beginning to chat with the snake, who understands him, and mysteriously escapes from his glass enclosure, while, to Harry's amusement, Dudley ends up trapped in the enclosure.It is one of many moments when the crinkled bright-eyed beam of the tremulous and beautiful youngster lights up the screen.Shoved back into the cupboard as punishment for Dudley's humiliation after coming home,  Harry is soon deprived even of a mysterious piece of mail that arrives for him, when his uncle cruelly burns it in front of him.But even on Sunday, the letters keep coming as mysterious owls congregate on the Dursley's front lawn. Letters for Harry flood the house, and the Dursleys vainly attempt to evade them by fleeing to an island lighthouse.But Harry's call of destiny will not go unanswered.Hagrid confronts the Dursleys there on Harry's eleventh birthday, and the boy learns the truth about his background as a wizard, as well as the reasons why his aunt, who was jealous of her dead sister, could never love him.Gradually he learns the truth of his parents' death as well. For commandeering the birthday cake Hagrid brought for Harry, Hagrid gives Dudley a pig's tail.The journey towards a new life begins under Hagrid's supervision.Harry leaves with the formidable stranger who delivered him to the Dursleys as an infant, and the two travel to Diagon Alley, where they shop for Harry's school supplies, unlike any in the Muggle world. The go to Gringott's Bank where Harry learns of the vast wealth his parents left him.In a pub, Hagrid introduces the boy to many who know him and are glad to meet him, including the turbaned Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Quirrel(Ian Hart), who will prove to be two-faced in more ways than one.After Mr. Ollivander( John Hurt) sells Harry a wand, Hagrid reveals why Harry is famous, and the details of his parents' deaths at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort, whose name wizards avoid speaking.Soon Hagrid leaves Harry, his luggage, including his new pet owl, Hedwig, at the King's Cross Train Station, emphasizing the importance of sticking to his ticket.Unable to get Muggle assistance in finding Platform 9 3/4,  a chance encounter with a family of redheads, namely the Weasleys, helps him transport through the barrier.Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) tells Harry her son Ron( 12-year old Rupert Grint),is a first-year student as well.Soon Harry celebrates his new life by entertaining his new friend, buying all the magical candy on the cart offered to them, which is enjoyed by Ron's rat Scabbers as well.An imperious young girl, assisting in the search for a missing frog comes by.She is the Muggle-born intellectual, Hermione Granger(10-year-old Emma Watson with a face full of baby fat),who critiques Ron's unsuccessful attempt at casting a spell, but is more impressed by Harry.Clad in robes and uniforms, the first-year students disembark, and are guided to the boats by Hagrid, which sail magically to the castle that is Hogwarts.Professor McGonagall leads the newcomers to the great hall. As they wait to enter, Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton), introduces himself to Harry, but fails to secure his friendship due to his slighting of Ron.The other fateful decison Harry faces is which of the four houses in which to be sorted: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Learning  that Voldemort was a Slytherin alumnus, and seeing Malfoy sorted in to that house, Harry successfully pleads with the Sorting Hat(Leslie Phillips) to placed anyhwhere but Slytherin, and he joins Hermione and the Weasleys in Gryffindor, where his parents were also placed.After dinner(during which John Cleese cameos as Gryffindor House Ghost, Nearly Headless Nick), the students are led amid paintings with moving figures, and changing staircases to their respective houses.While his roomates sleep, including Seamus Finnegan(Devon Murray), Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis, who found his  missing frog, Trevor), as well as Ron, Harry contemplates his new life,  the suddenness of  change, and of experiencing more wonders in a day than a boy's imagination can hold.Together, he and Ron face a reprimand for being late to McGonagall's class and witness her tranfiguration  in the process,they take flying lessons from Madame Hooch(Zoe Wanamaker), resulting in Harry's being placed on the Quidditch team as his father once was for an unexpected display of skill, and along with Hermione, have that now iconic moment of encountering a three-headed dog named Fluffy.Perturbed by Hermione's besting everyone in Flitwick's(Warwick Davis) Levitation class, Ron expresses his annoyance with Hermione. But when the three take on a mountain troll in the girl's bathroom in one hilarious scene, the friendship is permanently sealed.We will watch Harry develop as a wizard with the help of his knowledgable young friends, finding encouragement from other mentors including Quidditch captain, Oliver Ward (Sean Biggerstaff), under whose guidance he triumphs in his first match.The three wizard detectives will see Harry saved from Voldemort by the Centaur, Firenze(Ray Fearon) in the Forbidden Forest, and gain clues about the Sorcerer's stone, which they discover Fluffy to be guarding, its maker, the actual historical figure Nicholas Flamel, and what the mysterious Professor Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) is trying to do with it.Intellect counts greatly with these three, and it is moving to see the once neglected orphan find joy in the recipience of a Christmas present, albeit the unusual Invisibility Cloak, and to be in a place where he is better clad in beautifully vibrant and complimentary monochromatic knits, better fed, and cared for than he has been in ten years.An encounter with the Mirror of Eiresed gives him a chance to confront his longing for his dead parents.In addition to capturing the vibrant colors for which frequently rain soaked Britain is known,Director of Photography John Seal sharply flatters his beautiful young subjects, notably in one scene where the warmly clad hero walks across a snowy courtyard with his feathery friend and lets her fly into spring.In due time, Hagrid unintentionally drops enough clues about the Sorcerer's Stone, and how to get past Fluffy.The three are very much up to the challenge of preventing the stone's theft, although they have to get past Neville to do so.Using previously, as well as newly acquired skills, they work their way down until it is Harry who confronts the villian , and is made aware of the influence of Voldemort in a dangerous and dramatic encounter, after which Dumbledore explains to the boy how his mother's sacrificial love for him continues to protect him.Harry will now probably better endure his homelife because from here on in, he will spend most of his life in a place where although quite perilous,he is loved, admired,and validated.Despite some inconsistancies with the book,great justice has been done to Rowling's modern epic tale that will have everyone cheering for the young musketeers with wands, the triumph of courage and virtue, and for the scarlet and the gold for generations to come!"	5.0	A Place of Validation	2012-10-01	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AZ8GHANBO6XIK	Debra J. Hiltner	This Movie is a wonderful movie for kids and adults alike. There are great special effects and spectacular acting. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are delightful as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Among the adult actors, my favorite ones are Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Snape, and John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander. Chris Columbus did an excellent job directing this movie and John Williams composed an excellent score. On the DVD, there are many different things to do like there is a self-guided tour of Hogwarts and there are interviews with the crew. My favorite scenes in this movie are Quidditch and the gigantic wizard chess match. VERY COOL! As this is a wonderful movie, I would not recommend this movie for very small children, as there are some scary parts in this movie. All in all, this is a great movie to purchase.	5.0	A Spectacular Movie!!!!!	2002-06-21	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AZEL9GCJ02WJS	Debra L. Mallon	"Wands at the ready! Daniel Radcliffe takes up the role of mysterious boy wizard Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling's epic seven part fantasy series. Fans of all ages have been going crazy ever since they heard that Rowling's popular series was going to be transfigured, so to speak, into a film to be showed on movie screens around the world. Yet what makes this movie so unique is that it was not derived from a modern video game or television series, that the younger generation seems to enjoy, but from an ancient form of entertainment. A book! Just what is the magic that is held within those pages, that seemed to have hooked readers into its compelling storyline around the world?Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled with plenty of excitement. The screenplay is wonderfully interpreted from Rowling's complex storyline that introduces the Harry Potter realm; actors and actresses portray believable, memorable characters, and every scene is filled spectacular special effects. I find it only fair that this movie is truly a piece of magic itself.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first in a compelling seven-story adventure where one night living with his aunt and uncle in a somewhat abused life, eleven-year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is a wizard and gets shipped off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the art of magic. At his arrival he befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the insufferable know it all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and of course there's the deadly enemy the main character always makes, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).Harry Potter is brought about many trials and cloisters in learning the art of magic with his many teachers like Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and ""greasy git"" Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), all while being praised highly by the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and taken under the large wing of the half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). What makes this story more compelling is that Harry Potter himself is a hero, a hero for defeating a dark wizard by the name of Lord Voldemort (craftily done by computer generation). Now Lord Voldemort is after a precious stone that will make him immortal, and Harry and his friends are the only ones who can stop him.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, is filled with action packed scenes that have been digitally enhanced with the wonders of technology from a three-headed dog to a miniature dragon. Some of the best scenes include the Quidditch scene where Harry partakes in his first Quidditch match, the devil's snare scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves being choked by a plant, and finally the troll scene where Harry and Ron save Hermione from a ghastly looking, mold covered troll. These digital enhancements polish the gems of the movie perfectly and make them shine with outstanding brightness, for they really give the movie that magical aspect.The setting is also another strong point found within the movie. Most of the places match the ones described in the book perfectly. They create such a vivid image in the mind, that it almost makes you think that it what you are seeing is real. The Hogwarts castle is depicted almost perfectly with it's towering roofs and warmly lit windows. The corridors are lit with torches and floating candles while the potions classroom looks dark and grimy. The grounds are beautiful, flourishing with a spring of magic. Every aspect was craftily done to make the movie as real to the book as possible.The movie also has some shortcomings as well. For it being two and a half hours long, you figure they'd put the important parts in. However, this is not the case. Most of the time, the important parts that lead to the next event were cut out and rearranged to make the story better for a movie audience.  In other aspects of the film, Harry is portrayed unrealistically as a boy wizard who defeated a dark lord at the age of six months is now the greatest wizard of all time? From the moment Harry enters Hogwarts he becomes a hero even though he didn't do anything. For most of Harry's life he didn't even know of his great feat against the dark lord, and within days at Hogwarts he is flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew that one day he would become a hero.  He then takes on the responsibility of saving the entire school from dark powers without question. I'd expect that an eleven-year-old boy would be scared just like every other young kid who was threatened with death.Harry Potter, for all the glory it received, does have some competition. I firmly believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone fell directly between fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, both of which came out with their own movie. Firm Christians sought out Narnia, while hardcore fantasy fans fled to Lord of the Rings, leaving Harry Potter in the middle. However there are some hardcore Harry Potter fans as well, but when Rowling's epic story ends, will this brilliant story just fade or fall into the shadows of films that have become classics.Even though the movie had both very strong points and it's shortcomings, it was still overall a great film. As the first of an epic seven part series, this movie ends with a happy ending, but a lot of questions unanswered. There can be both a good and bad side to this. Many fans can't stand the waiting for the next film to be produced in a year or so, but if you get them hooked enough, you can guarantee that they'll be back for the next one. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie made for family viewing. It depicts the life of a wizard and how he copes with being in a new world. It also firmly implies on the important lessons in courage and loyalty to those you care for.As of now, there are total of six books and four Harry Potter movies, all of which have hit record amounts. Fans of J.K. Rowling's masterpiece are anxiously awaiting the closure of her series with the final book. I suggest until that happens, fans can occupy themselves with watching the magic of the Harry Potter films and the majestic moral themes they present.This is a Reveiw by Katelynn MallonRabbid Harry Potter fangirl"	5.0	Amazing film that gets you hooked from the first minute it begins	2006-07-26	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AFEOC3D8WKN1D	Deirdre	Ah yes, the well acclaimed and expensive first part of the Harry Potter saga. Ah yes, you might be wondering why this is so critically acclaimed?! Well that's just it, I havn't got the faintest idea. The visual effects were nice to look at at points, but the children's acting is simply put, atrocious. Every other line the kids spoke was either a stupid line to begin with or it was delivered horribly, seriously people, this is supposed to be an adventure fantasy not a school play. I actually don't hold the children (who are in truth good actors) at fault for this film, I hold mostly the director responsible, he didn't push the actors like he should have, he took a decent screenplay and truned into childish mush, he took a good concept and made one of the corniest films possible out of it.The single thing Chris Columbus did right on this film was the cinematography, there were beautiful shots of the school of magic it was all simply put, gorgeous (which is the only reason I didn't give this film one star).I first saw this film when I was in the hospital after having my appendix taken out, I sat back and I breathed in, I WAS FINALLY GOING TO SEE THE WORLD RENOUNED HARRY POTTER (yippie)!......... (oh no), I must say I was forgiving of the film when I first saw it, but then again I had just had a ton of morphine pumped into me. Let it be known, after this I decided to read the book, I decided to give this film another fighting chance, ........ (OH NO) It was even worse when you read the book beforehand! The book, which I could take seriously, had been destroyed by super corny directing! Super stupid bad guys! Super over-acting. UrghLet's face it, Harry Potter is a fairly easy film to pull off, I meanc ome on. The book doesn't go into Harry's inner thoughts at all, the story has a fairly typical (and hideous) villains, the story is the same as always with the things (The main adventurous male character, the super smart female, and the not so smart bumble secondary male character). Yet Coloumbus couldn't even pull those super simple characters off right, Harry himself was virtually emotionless the entire film!As a whole, disappointing, but don't let that get you down, some the future installments aint half bad.......	2.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	2007-11-25	6	1	5

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A57AI85N9Q9TU	"Denis Cronin ""'Donnacha'"""	I thought that this film was pretty loyal to the harry potter book although in some cases I think it really missed out on some important parts.  The special effects were pretty good overall, except for the quiddich match which was, in my opinion, a big disappointment.  Daniel Radcliffe didn't do too badly for his role at potter but i'm sure he will get better as the movies progress.  You might think that with these comments that I disliked the movie, but you couldn't be more wrong.  There are definitely more good points than bad.  The whole castle layout was perfect in my eye; from the great hall with its floating candles and pumpkins at halloween, to the Griffindor common room.  Watching the movie made me love the books all the more as I was able to see the characters come to life in exactly the way I imagined them (all except for Dumbledore who I felt was a bit boring compared to the Rowling character, and the Weasly twins could do with a bit of liveing up).  Overall, a brilliant film and one that I would watch over and over again.	4.0	good	2003-04-13	1	1	0

I bought the DVD when it was first released and never got around to watching it so when it came on a HBO Saturday night I watched it and I enjoyed the film. Chris Columbous has made his best film since the oringial Home Alone, a film that everyone can enjoy. The film is great on the acting and the special effects.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1V080PJOAU1S	Dezaraye London	Harry Potter is, as we will all know if viewing this, quite the phenomenon, and the film did absolutely nothing to downplay it.  Not that it should have!  It was a positively brilliant adaptation to the book [Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone/Philosopher's Stone], and as one person said, it went quickly enough not to bore those of us who have read the book.  [For me that would be around 17 times].  The Quidditch match was...well...the most BRILLIANT bit of screenplay I have seen, EVER, I couldn't BELIEVE how cool that was!  :]  The Giant Chess Game was spectacular as well!  Everything really was, in essence, positively marvellous, and those that DIDN'T enjoy it probably haven't read the books or don't really have a hankering for Harry Potter like us hopeless HP Fans do.  :]  I cannot WAIT until the release of the DVD/Video, I saw the film seven times in the cinema and look forward with great gusto to the release of the film.  Especially the extra added features!!  The kids, yea, they did great, especially considering it was basically their first time really having a main role [the exception being Daniel Radcliffe; he played David Copperfield when he was a good deal younger, but really, it doesn't carry over if you know what I mean, as for Emma Watson (III) and Rupert Grint, it was their first time EVER acting in a film and if you ask me they did absolutely SMASHINGLY well].  Anyway, I would COMPLETELY recommend the film to ANYONE, of ANY age, ANY race, etc etc, because the magic of Harry Potter isn't just for a certain age group...it's for everyone...and gives us all a bit of hope, it really, truly does.  :]	5.0	Harry Potter - Always The Best	2002-04-16	2	1	1

My 12 yr old daughter would probably agree. But when one analyses it, it would have been impossible to incorporate so much from the book into the movie and keep it to a reasonable length. This must have been a huge dilemma for the directors and producers, ""what to put in the movie"". When one accepts this and focuses on the content of the movie, I don't think you can help but be pretty impressed with it.  Bringing to life Harry Potter and his world was accomplished very well in my opinion. I found the movie atmospheric and I was drawn into his world.  This to me is the mark of a good movie.  I loved the settings and the overall colour of the movie.  I thought the acting was okay, nothing to rave about, but adequate.  I have seen the movie twice with my kids and I enjoyed it both times.

HPATSS is a movie of pure magic.The story tells of a young boy whose parents were killed by an evil wizard and that Harry would become an admired magician. He wouldn't know anything about his parents until he was 11.The school in the movie with the awesome special effects and magic wands makes me wish that school in real life was like that. Many school would've been so much more interesting than it is in real life.The movie would retain the top spot as the number one movie only briefly before the Earth-shattering masterpiece Lord Of The Rings overtook it.Harry Potter is a movie for all ages to enjoy. Even my 83 year old grandmother loved it. Guess it shows that this movie was made for all ages although it might spook the very young.I,m not going to tell everything about this movie.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3QUH7GRAWGVAW	Diya Koshy	I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have read each of the books four times...so when I went to see the movie it was with a lot of expectations...and yes I do agree with a lot of the reviewers that the movie did not capture all the magic of the book and the axing of characters like Peeves the Poltergeist was dissapointing. But that being said, the sheer thrill of walking a while in Diagon Alley and seeing Hogwarts loom large and clapping and screaming through the Quidditch match was something that made every minute in that dark hall worth it.Most people go to the movies expecting the film to live up to the book in every way. But that is rarely if ever going to happen. Harry Potter has excited the imagination of a generation and the images we conjur up in our mind's eye are ours alone...just because Chris Columbus could not translate a million fantasies exactly the way we want it does not make this a bad movie...we must remeber that JK Rowling was with him on this film every step of the way...and however much you find fault with it you are touched by the magic of Harry Potter and his motley band of friends...I would definitely reccomend the DVD...and let a little of the magic touch you too.	4.0	A magical experience	2002-02-13	8	8	0

In this case, the new edition ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is nothing more than scam compared to its first issue dvd.

Here is some help: For the most part in any DVD, the Wide Screen or ""Letterbox"" version is supposed to ""PRESERVE"" the aspect version that you saw at the movies. ""Harry Potter"" versions were probably filmed using 1.18:1 aspect ratio, but Warner Bros Pictures used a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to transfer to the widescreen DVD.  This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrity; whereas it deletes both the top and bottom portions of the original film. Some movies are SHOT in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and you usually do not lose anything with those - (why couldn't they just do the 1.18:1 aspect ratio as it was meant to be seen?) For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements.The TV or the ""Full Screen"" version, (Still not 1.18:1 aspect ratio but shows the bowl being pushed on the table by Hagrid), was meant to fit on a regular TV screen. Here, little portions are lost in the left side of the film. I prefer to take the little loss on the sides versus losing the top and bottom, showing clapping, wand holding, etc to be seen, so skip the widescreen and purchase the ""Full Screen"" version if that is what you want.  Either way, the movie is a PIP! I thought that the essence of mystery mixed with human emotion is nicely portrayed.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	I've never read the Harry Potter books, nor ever had an urge too upon their popular release.  I gave the films a try and I must say that this is far better than I expected.  I can now see why the series is so popular.  I still haven't read the books only becuase I don't want it to ruin the movies that I love so much, casue there is bound to be continuity issues, common with most novel to film releases.  Though the Sorcerer's Stone is a great film, it is very mild for where the series is headed.  Each Potter adventure grows darker and more dangerous, but the first film is rather easy going overall.  Indeed, this is a fun film that people of all ages will enjoy, and is great for the kids.After seeing the latest Potter film - Order of the Phoenix - it is quite a surprise to come back to see where it all began.  Naturally, the young actors look so much younger, and its fun to see where they had come from, both in terms of age as actors and their characters - specifically referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermoine.  As with most series, the first is an introduction.  Since the Potter films were already pre-written into glorious novels, each book carried its own story.  So yes, this is an introduction to the Potter series, but at the same time it is a story about the Sorcerer's Stone, just like the next film is a tale about the Chamber of Secrets and the next etc.  Though entertaining and enjoyable, I did not find the Sorcerer's Stone to be the most intriguing story thus far in the series, in fact, its more likely the least favorite of mine, but that's ok.  Its still good, but the stories get better in each new film.Sorcerer's Stone is very well made, complete with great sets, amazing costumes, lovebale and admirable characters, and plenty of good ol magic and flying brooms to go around.  If you are at all familiar with the game of Quidditch, it is not only introduced here, but a game is focused on more than any of the films thus far - complete with intense scenes of action and sport.If you are still one of the few who have not seen Harry Potter, go ahead and give it a try - chances are you are bound to find something that holds you're interest.  It is a great tale of suspense and adventure with a variety of great characters.  If you've seen all the films, I will remind you how much fun it is to go back and start all over again just to see how far we've come.Acting - 4.5Action - 3.5Characters - 5Story - 4Overall - 4.5	4.0	[4.5] Come and see where it all began	2008-01-03	2	1	1

An hour into the movie I began to wonder when the really spellbinding stuff was going to come into play.  Unfortunately, it never did.  Here are some of the things I did find interesting in HP:The CG special effects were actually quite good.  However, that alone does not make a movie a good, or even a great, movie.  The quality of the CG merits the two star rating.Harry turns out to be the ""chosen one"" so to speak.  In the world of wizards, he alone has survived an attack by the ""evil one.""  Therefore, he is imminently popular upon arrival at Hogwart's.  In fact, Harry is the teacher's pet of most of the faculty at Hogwart's - in an obvious kind of way.  Everyone knows that teachers have pets, but good teachers keep their pets secret.  When a teacher makes it known who is/are the favorite student(s), those who are not the favorites become alienated.  Not so at Hogwart's.  Harry is the favorite of many teachers, but manages to maintain popularity with most of the other budding mages as well.Throughout the course of the movie, Harry receives gifts and favors from his teachers that give him an advantage over the other students.  Thus, he is the hero of the day in the sports world of the school, though he was given the best broom on which to fly.  This aspect of the story is atrocious because few are given the finest things in life with which to excel.  A movie of the highest caliber would give us a hero who achieves against all odds without the best the world has to offer.Virtually everything in the movie was predictable.  I cannot recall one thing that surprised me.Overall, I consider HP to be a sad commentary on the priorities and fantasies of our culture.  At the end of the movie, I realized I had wasted 2 1/2 perfectly good hours."	2.0	A sad commentary...	2002-09-06	4	1	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book and the beginning to a truly magical series by J.K. Rowling. Any person of any age is highly encouraged to give these books a read--the only danger is that you'll likely get hooked on them.Of course, this review is about the movie, not about the book... and the movie is... decent. It is a fairly faithful adaptation, but doesn't quite capture the charm or depth of the novel. It feels as though two mistakes were made: 1) They tried to put everything in; 2) They tried to make it a kid's movie.The first mistake was in trying to put everything that occurs in the book in the movie. In the first place, it was an impossible task--you can't fit a book that size completely into a movie, and you shouldn't try anyways because books and movies are different media with different strengths and weaknesses. In the second place, it makes the movie feel incredibly rushed. In the book, we eventually come to know and love a great many of these characters, such as Harry, Ron and Hermione. In the movie (unless you've already read the book), you'll know them a little bit, but you never get to spend the time with them necessary to really bond, because we need to save space for the next sequence of events. Things happen with little context, rhyme or reason, but just because ""it happened that way in the book."" It would have been better to cut out some of the events, and spent a little more time developing characters.The second mistake was in trying to make this a children's film. Now, I know what you're saying: ""But *isn't* Harry Potter a children's book?"" And yes, it is. And no, it isn't. Harry Potter is a book that can appeal to any age. It does not read like ""kid's lit""--the writing is intelligent and clever, and the plotlines fairly adult and complicated. Children were going to love this movie no matter how it was directed; it should have been done more seriously, because it would have been more true to the tone of the novel and more rewarding for adult fans.On the other side, this movie is still enjoyable, and all signs seem to suggest that the series of films is going to get better over time. The casting is absolutely brilliant--the kids are all spot on, and nothing brings more delight than Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.Being a lover of the books, I say that this film is a decent interpretation but no substitute for reading the novels. Adults especially who haven't read them, and watch this movie instead, are apt to scratch their heads in wonder a little bit at the popularity of Harry Potter."	3.0	Three Stars for Adults, Four for Kids (Five for the Book, for Anyone)	2005-11-14	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3D550GH0U6T5C	Dorian M.	I admit, I had a very difficult time reading the J.K. Rowling books, for some odd reason.  I attempted to read the first Harry Potter book several times, but each time it seemed to serve better as a dose of valium than as an interesting read.  That's a first for me, esp. with a book of this genre. However, while I still struggle to get through the reading, I must give the movie version 5 stars, as I'm completely fascinated and impressed with the amount of work put into its making.  From what I hear (from those who've finished the books), the movie has it's differences in certain plot parts, or has omitted parts that die-hard fans are up-in-arms about...but isn't the usually the case when a book goes to film?  That difference aside, if you want a magical, fast-moving film that's suitable for children and adults alike, get this one.  I own it and have watched it at least 4 times (and it's a long movie!).

Kids enjoy this movie quite a bit.  I enjoyed the movie, but was not enamored with it.  I almost feel as if I am missing something because the J.K. Rowling books are unbridled smash hits by any measure.The movie is well done, acting is good (for child actors), the script is well written and maintains good cohesion, and the story line is solid with a lot of good imagination, the music is interesting, etc., etc.  But, it isn't the incredible movie I expected.DVD Value:The DVD was ok.  It has an interesting self guided tour of Hogwarts Castle, but it sorely lacks the Director's Commentary and didn't really have much in the way of games and other extras for the kids. (which I believe is essential for a DVD).Scare Factor:It isn't scary, except for two scenes towards the end. These two scenes warrant concern for the young viewers (under 7 or 8);Also, the beginning of the movie shows Harry Potter being abused by his ""adopted parents"" (his aunt and uncle who force him to sleep locked in a closet under their stairs) and I really didn't like my young kids seeing that. This should not be shown to very young or very sensitive viewers."	4.0	Interesting, but not &#65533;Stunning&#65533;	2002-09-04	7	2	5

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1EZMV5DSWU8TU	Draconis Blackthorne	"The wonderous world of Harry Potter opens up through the enchanted pages of J.K. Rowling's books, as veritable grimoires masked in fictional charicatures, but demonstrating subtle magical principles. The books come to life in a veritable bibliomancy - the words vibrate, a Magical glow emminates therefrom, & the pictures come to brilliant life, jumping forth from the pages in dynamic enchanted exhuberance. And thus it has been for those who have enjoyed these wonderful works.These have served to stimulate, & sometimes even enhance the child-like Magic residing within - that charm personafied in animals & children, & preserved by The Magician.I have found this film a marvel to behold, although I feel it could have been twice the production had it been a tad darker, as the books have tended to be. Unfortunately, producers felt that the initial more gothicesque aesthetics would frighten children, to whom the film is primarily directed towards. But I question the excessive over-sheltering of children would only raise a populace of mollycoddles. Speaking for Myself on the left hand, I have always been attracted to the darkest subject matter since I was a very young child. The pervasive fascination for blood & gore in western society is due to the lack of real-life bloodletting spectacles, practices, & traditions in modern culture. In many societies, a boy was not considered a man until until he had killed his first prey in the hunt, or slain an enemy. Western Society compensates for this natural bloodlust with horror movies & documentaries, to stimulate that latently essential primal part of the psyche which remains far too under-stimulated.The first half of the movie seemed aesthetically darker, whereas the second half was a bit 'lighter', probably as a result of the puscillanimousness of Chris Columbus {who also directed ""Home Alone"" as an indication}. I believe a film of this callibre would have been better directed by the likes of Tim Burton, who has consistently brought forth the dark sides of the characters he has worked with, & created films of magnificent & gloriously gothic proportions, as Batman would be a major example; with a musickal score conducted instead by Danny Elfman, considering the current score unfortunately sounds rather tired & redundant - not one of John William's better works. It just seemed that he did not place too much effort into it, yet it still remains memorable, but so much more could have been done with it.I found the effects to be quite well done, concurrent with the descriptions in the book. There were several scnes which were curtailed for time, but I have a feeling the release of the video / DVD wil divulge many deleted scenes.A most poignant scene was towards the end, whcen Potter comes face to face with Voldemort, in which he states, ""There is no good or evil, only Power & those who seek it. Those who do not, are weak."" Quite a Satanic statement!The release of this movie will probably inspire some children to gain an interest in The Occult, & will create A.C.I.'s in many, & just may serve to open the door to self-realization in true infernal progeny yet unknown. A movie of this type I feel is timely, & necessitates ""popularity"" in this select case, to help contribute to that societal shift in the Satanic direction.Besides that one moment of the stating of Satanic fact, there is no weakan sactimony, no xian drivel, just plain fun ""witchcraft"" for the whole family.The idea of a ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" does sound rather appealing {notice the distinction between the genders} - the closest thing we have to that is the homeschooling initiative which is espoused by most Satanists. Speaking for Myself, I have schooled Myself in The Dark Arts, incorperating & experimenting with what I will to determine My own personal philosophies & rites {Draconian Satanism}, & I do consider Dr. LaVey My Daemon-Mentor. And now, as ""grownup"" Witches & Warlocks, Our Infernal Progeny may have the benefit of Our tutoring.Overall, I found the film to be visually stunning, relevant to the book, & it displayed a higher class of diction & politeness, serving as a good example to the more bereft & vulgar infesting the current populace.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1TJIJKKN15KR9	drqshadow	Undoubtedly targeted at a very young audience, there's a certain degree of magic dancing around this picture that makes it easily-accessible to adults as well. Although my own childhood was long gone by the time this hit theaters, watching it today was like leaping back through time to an age filled with innocence and wonder. That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.	4.0	A Cheery, if Inconsequential, Foray That Merely Scratches the Surface of Harry's World	2013-07-08	1	1	0

It's a prime example of how blue screen digital derring-do can fall flat on its face. The computer backgrounds were uneven, at times almost cartoonish, and the special effects weren't always that special, from the first look at the outside of Hogwarts to the fake-n-bake Quidditch match. Not seeing some of the best parts of the book was a bit disappointing, but that wasn't the main problem with the movie. It's almost always necessary to eliminate some book episodes to keep the cinema pace moving. What grated the most was the ineptness of the not-so-special effects crew.

Was it worth seven bucks? Not to me...I needn't go over the plot--even I knew what the film was about after having so many strangers gush to me about the book like it gifted readers with magical abilities itself. The story was okay--a bit predictable, but it is a kid's book after all. The special effects were sometimes almost cool, often somewhat primitive compared with other fx-filled forms (for example, any scene where a kid gets shaken by broom or beast makes the kid look as loose as wet laundry and not very life-like at all...not to mention the rather poorly animated snake at the beginning, etc...) I was able to see where some religious groups could take offense to a few of the references, and though I found the picture quaint at best, I'll admit I probably would have loved this film if I'd seen it at age seven. This generation's Wizard Of Oz? Hardly. A bit scary for younger viewers, a bit boring for older, the only thing I really took a liking to was the real-live Wizard's Chess scene. Buy this movie if you're a true fan, otherwise you may soon get sick of your youngster quoting from it.

Harry however, learns about his past and discovers the ability to create magic with the use of a wand and goes to a magic school called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a whole new world awaits him.Harry learns that his parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort and now that he's returning, Voldemort is after a legendary artifact called the Sorcerer's Stone to give him eternal life.

Some of the cinematics, such as when they first arrive at Diagon Alley, are almost  breathtaking, at least IMO.Book purists may not be quite so fond of the film but if you love watching a good film, I recommend it.I remember thinking, the first time I saw it, that we had another holiday classic on our hands. ;-) This film takes us through Harry's adventures during his first year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We get to meet Albus Dumbledore, the Dean of the school, very reminiscent in some ways of Gandalf the White but with more of a sense of humor; Rubeus Hagrid, the half-giant, great big teddy bear (with a fondness and a blind spot towards dangerous magical creatures such as dragons); and the dark and mysterious Severus Snape, Potions Master at the school.Harry Potter, raised by muggles (non-wizarding folk) known as the Dursleys -- Vernon, Petunia and their son, Harry's cousin, Dudley, finds himself drawninto this adventure when he receives an acceptance letter from Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns things about himself, The Boy Who Lived, the only one to survive the dread Dark Lord Voldemort whose power was broken and who vanished with no trace on the night he tried to use a killing curse on Harry Potter. He learns that his parents did not die in an automobile accident, which is what Mr. and Mrs. Dursley had always told him.The school year is full of adventure and wonder and a quest to find and keep the Wizard's Stone (called 'Philosopher's Stone' in the book's British edition) from someone who's trying to steal it in order to gain the Elixir of Life. In this quest Harry and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, wrack their brains trying to figure out, with little information, how they can manage to help protect the stone from whoever's trying to steal it.Definitely worth the watch.	5.0	Another Children's Classic	2004-12-09	4	4	0

I just started reading book 1 this month, because I wanted to know what was going on in the movies, but they were really magnificent and I must say, reading the books helps you understand the movie. Nothing is explained in the much anticipated second movie, so you'll need some background knowledge. The second movie, which I saw on the Opening Night, was SO much fun that I even saw it again! The actors and filmmakers had more experience, and therefore resulted in a better movie than the first, in my opinion. Seeing the movie on opening night was a plus, because all the fans attended, clapping, cheering, gasping, and providing enthusiatic responses to the movie. If you didn't like the movie, then it was probably a dull crowd that influenced you. I think you should see it ASAP, because when I saw it the second time (a week later), there were parents and toddlers who really didn't try to enjoy the movie. Anyway, great movie; I was amazed at the special effects and how well the characters were portrayed in the movie. If you didn't like either movie, then you're just being rash, because about 20 songs each were composed by the famous John Williams, and 16,000 kids auditioned for Harry Potter. Not to mention that the 9 minutes of Quidditch took 3 months to plan and 6 months to film!	5.0	Magical! (A Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets Review)	2002-11-27	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A16P8MKQ8SC3CQ	Eliza	"As a prof. of mine says, ""you can always tell what's good about somehting so there's no need to discuss that"" so I'll just address the parts that were a bit of a disappointment.I first picked up a Harry Potter book for a course I was taking on the role of the adolescent in literature, in which I was supposed to do an annotated bib of modern YA novels. I begrudged Harry all the hype surrounding him, assuming that I would never fall for somehting so publicized. I was wrong. I read all four books back to back in two monthes and this was with a 15 credit course load at the same time, so enough said.So in terms of the film, you can only imagind my excitement over its release on video (I'd been interested in it in the theaters just based on the adverts but couldn't get anyone too see it with me, at the time).I preordered the DVD from Amazon.co.uk and when it arrived my family insisted on my waiting for them to watch it, since my interest in the books had spread to them like wildfire by then (My fifty-one year old dad is just about to finish his turn through them all).The movie was so much like the book with the exception of the end that it left little for me to see new - that is I had already watched it as such in my mind and so if felt like nothing I was seeing was anything different.I enjoyed being introduced to the characters for the first time, but I was surprised to find Harry the tallest of the group, when in the books Ron calls him a midget. Also, I personally thought Herminoe was almost too cute, since I always pictured her as being a bit homely - although my dad had a fit over how well she was cast, so I suppose good protrayal is a bit subjective.That aside, I liked the characters. I didn't even mind Daniel Radcliffe being the tallest eleven-year-old I've seen to date, he did such a nice job - exactly as I pictured Harry, aside from the height.While a lot of reviews criticized Rupert Grint for not being sarcastic enough in his role as Ron, I was pleasantly surprised after reading them, to find that I enjoyed him.I think there were essentially three drawbacks to the movie that promtped me to give it four stars instead of five:The movie, prbably due to time constraints, had almost none of the satire that I loved so much in the book - it was like all the Harry Potter story with very little of the heart. I think this was not so much a fault of the actors, but that they just tried to fit too much else in. I would have preferred more good dialogue, even if it meant lengthening it or cutting out something. It was just lacking in this dept, which kept me from being completely ""into"" it so I felt very little empathy with the movie, unlike the book. The one exception was in the ""Mirror or Erised"" scene, which I thought was touching.The other thing that I thought caused the movie to suffer was that they had Harry being much sharper and more sure of himself than in the books. Hermione was really the one who solved most of the mystery and the way they discovered Flamel on screen threw me a bit. Also, the entire encounter with Voldemort was changed. That bit felt more like ""Harry Potter meets the Mummy,"" which was a letdown. I thought it odd that they would be so careful about detail and yet alter the most important scene so dramatically.Lastly, although I enjoyed the Quidditch scene, it too fast moving and at times, hard to follw, and looked a bit fake, especially when people got knocked askew on their broomsticks - more like puppets than people, really.Although I outlined primarily what I considered to be flaws, I did enjoy the movie as a whole and am looking forward to the sequal. I was not thrilled with it, but pleasantly surprised, especially with the performances of the children, since child actors usually have a tendency to act too young or old instead of their supposed age level.I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether they read the books or not, but would say to read them first, anyway. I think it was better for me that I did.I'll probably end up buying the American version as well, and go to the Borders midnight Harry Potter party to do it, too.I am a loyal fan, so although I'm a little bit let down, I have faith in the future releases, and will be fairly content, as long as they're as good as the first."	4.0	Not Too Shabby...but	2002-05-20	11	7	4

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AC9B29BXXWJHD	Ellis Bell	"Let me say quickly that I loved the book. And that I love the movie just as much, which is a lot from me considering that I often find movie adaptations to be inferior to the books they were taken from. Emma Watson is an amazing actress; and Daniel Radcliffe looks the part of Harry. But there were also some longtime screen favorites who did an excellent job as well, particularly Alan Rickman as the creepy Professor Snape, Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagal.The scene that sticks out in my mind is the scene towards the end when Harry and Ron have to play chess in order to make it through. Its tense and scary, but I always wonder, ""Are they going to make it out in the end?"" Of course they do, but thats what this movie is about: suspense. The special effects in this movie are spectacular.I don't agree with those who say that the Harry Potter books are an instrument of Satan. Its really a harmless movie which encourages people (kids and adults) to have imaginations- not commit violent acts."	5.0	A wonderful movie based on a wonderful book	2004-07-29	2	1	1

I had read the book twice before seeing this movie, and they are both really good. I would totally reccomend the book, too, but for people (like me) that don't really like spending their free time reading, the movie gives you a good idea of the story. This is a really awesome movie. The special effects are way cool, and the casting is totally perfect! This is a great movie to see. And, on this DVD, you could watch it again and again! Even if you're an adult, you should still see this movie. People who say Harry Potter is for kids must have never actually seen or read Harry Potter. Some of the stuff in this movie MIGHT scare kids, but, hey, it just makes the movie more exciting to have some action in it.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	In some ways, this is the best Harry Potter movie. It's light enough for kids, but the story is engaging enough for adults. The beginning of the film really captures the magical world of wizardry, from the goblins to the first quidditch game. It stands well enough alone as a movie - you don't really need to know much about Harry Potter before watching it.The kids are excellent actors. Rewatching it again after many, many years, I was impressed with the range of young Ron's emotions (by contrast, I find his later character a bit boring and pouty). They're adorable and frankly well cast.Some of the later Harry Potter films are better produced and have better special effects, but few are so satisfying.	5.0	A fun intro to Harry Potter	2010-01-21	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1TBY60T5EASC0	Erena Maeda	HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a well-known movie in the world now. This is the story of a young boy named Harry Potter, who is a wizard. When he was a baby, Voldemort killed his parents. So, he was living at his uncle's house. His uncle and aunt are very bad people. Harry is a kind of Cinderella. At first, he didn't know that he was a wizard. But he went to Hogwarts, a magical school, by a strange coincidence. That day was his 11th birthday. He has some friends there. Their names are Hermione and Ron.At the end of the movie, they had to play chess. They each took the part of chessmen. Ron was injured so Harry could get the sorcerer's stone. After that, Voldemort wanted to kill Harry and take the sorcerer's stone. So, they fought each other. Harry won the battle. But he was injured, too. After he recovered, he returned to his uncle's house.I didn't learn anything from this movie. I was just excited when I watched it. But I love this story because I have never watched magical stories before. This story is very interesting! Now we can watch Harry Potter's second story in the theater.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1SXS2P1B80I82	"Erik Aleksander Moe ""riddion"""	I loved this movie when I saw it in the theaters and still do when I see it again on DVD. But.There is still but about this DVD. I was eager to get this and was delighted to read that it would be on 2 DVDs. I thought that the first disc would have a magnificent picture with Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS ES tracks. It was a disappointment that it didn't include a DTS track, even though there seem to be space for it, since there are no audio commentary or other special features on the first disc. The picture was good with vibrant colors and the sound track was good too, but it lacked that extra dynamic sound that SO many DVDs lack, that almost all newer laserdiscs had (even on movies in mono sound).But I bought this movie mainly for the movie itself. The movie is magical in every way, with a virtually perfect cast. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has just right amount of charm and charisma to make the character work on the big screen. Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are just a few of the great English actors who star in this movie. I think this movie will endure for many years to come.Now for the negative side, the special features disc. It is true what other reviewers have said that it is made like a kid's game. I wanted to see the documentaries about the different aspects of the book to film process, but all it contained (or at least what I have found) was a 15 minute documentary that reminds me of the bad 'behind the scenes' programs on E! or other entertainment TV stations, that are shown when the movie is in the theaters and don't really say much. The documentary did say some, but it was all in bits and pieces. There should just have been a link to a game version of the features for kids and a normal features menu for adults.The movie, though, is worth the movie I paid for the entire release, but I don't think I'll be watching the features disc much at all.	5.0	A glorious engrossing fantasy film	2002-06-04	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AC2MOT86Y1RL7	"""erin-from-iowa"""	I looked forward to this movie so much and when I saw it it made me very angry. For one the begining was a disappointment when they left out the part before Harry came to Privet Drive. Nothing was right at the Dursley's. When they went to the zoo Dudleys friend was supposed to go. When Harry started getting letters they should have had Harry move upstairs. Hagrid is supposed to tell Harry about his parents at the little cabin not at Diagon Alley. When Harry meets Ron that is all wrong. Also Ron is supposed to be almost as tall as the Weasley twins and Percy doesn't look right. When Harry meets Draco is wrong too, they are supposed to first meet at a robe shop and then indroduced on the train not at Hogwarts! There is no Peeves in the movie. I have to admit the Quiditich match is exciting, but aren't there supposed to be two matches. When the see Fluffy Neville is supposed to be with them and its supposed to happen at night.  When Norbet the dragon gets into the picture, the dragon stays with Hagrid awhile and Hermione and Harry take it to the Astrmony tower so Charlie Weasley can take it  to Romania. They, Draco, and Neville get in trouble, but Ron is not with them.  And when they are getting to the stone Hermione solves an important part  of getting there. And Quirrel does not crumble, it was so lame.  I think that all of you who say that the movie goes along with the book so well, I think you need to read the book a little closer. The book is so much better!!!!!!! 5 stars for the Harry Potter books!!!!	2.0	What happened to the story of Harry Potter that I loved?	2002-06-20	5	2	3

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AXVZMMR357W	"""evadcasey"""	"The Harry Potter series is a wonderfull epic for kids and adults alike. Those who consider these books ""controversial"" because of the use of witchcraft in a light and entertaining manor need to take a hard look at the other influencing factors seeping into childrens lives. Overtly sexual and violent radio and TV don't seem to irk these folks, nor does rampant commerciallism turning kids into Nike wearing automatons. But a little magic makes them foam at the mouth. I'd say the priorities of the content critics are askew.But this isn't my main point. The movie is something of a dud. I don't recommend it. Unless you're a hard core Harry fan, it'll make little sense and be a tad boring. I was terribly dissappointed at the film given the amount of talent behind it. I came away only appreciating the production design and the score.The DVD is a poorly produced product as well. The transfer looks overbright and contrasty with the colors washed out. And the second disc which contains all the supplementary material is a collection of confusing and rediculous puzzles that must be solved before you can access anything of interest. I gave up looking for the deleted scenes because they simply aren't labeled anywhere and I've got no time to go hunting for them. That which I could find were just rehashed scenes from the movie and some crooked unlabeled drawings.Perhaps a child with time on there hands and interest may find this more engaging but it annoyed me and I wondered why the option of skipping the games wasn't included. It really just seems thrown together. And poor Jim Dale is given the worst lines to read as the DVD MC.This could have been the saving grace for this production had they created really informative and interesting disc set.

Hearing that the DVD of Harry Potter featured bonus scenes and additional insight into the making of the film, I chose to splurge on the DVD over the VHS version. Mind you, I did not own a DVD player when I ordered this film. The morning after my shipment arrived, I went to the store to purchase a DVD player and that night, we watched the movie. The quality of the DVD is wonderful and the sound is amazing (we hooked it up to our stereo speakers). The bonus features include a tour of Hogwarts as well as &quot;skits&quot; with the sorting hat and even web-interactive activities in which I have not yet particpated. All-in-all, this is a great way to watch the movie though the widescreen viewing makes my 20&quot; television seem even smaller. I suppose that is the only downside, now I need a TV that can hold its own with Harry Potter's DVD quality.	4.0	Magically Entertaining	2002-06-08	1	1	0

My only upset, when Dumbledore was later replaced by a new actor.  I am loyal.  This change upset me.  I do not know why the change in actor was necessary and I did accept the new actor who was exceptional in every form of his work, however, I personally feel directors should maintain consistency amoung the character stream so prevent viewer memory as this one.  This is my only complaint.  The change in actor of Dumbledore, even though both actors were exceptional.  I simply appreciate consistency when in today's time, there is so little of it.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Full Screen Edition) (Harry Potter.	2013-04-17	0	0	0

The acting was great (especially Snape and Dumbledore), and the so were the special effects.  There was just one problem.  It stayed wayyy too close to the story.  I've read the books and I love them, but I still think they should have made it somewhat original.  I'm sure some people like it completely accurate, but I found it became boring, epecially since most of the dialogue came directly from the book.  Still, it was a good movie, even for people who haven't read the book, and I think if you have the time it's worth watching.	4.0	Good, but could have been better	2002-09-12	2	0	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A26Q94ZP8U3KMD	FJLeon	Choose &quot;Wide Screen&quot; or the &quot;Pan and Scan&quot; version?  Here is some help: For the most part in any DVD, the Wide Screen or &quot;Letterbox&quot; version is supposed to &quot;PRESERVE&quot; the aspect version that you saw at the movies. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; versions were probably filmed using 1.18:1 aspect ratio, but Warner Bros Pictures used a 2.35:1 aspect ratio to transfer to the widescreen DVD.  This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrety; whereas it deletes both the top and bottom portions of the original film. Some movies are SHOT in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and you usually do not lose anything with those - (why couldn't they just do the 1.18:1 aspect ratio as it was meant to be seen?) For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements.The TV or the &quot;Full Screen&quot; version, (Still not 1.18:1 aspect ratio), was meant to fit on a regular TV screen. Here, little portions are lost in the left side of the film. I prefer to take the little loss on the sides versus losing the top and bottom, showing clapping, wand holding, etc to be seen, so skip the widescreen and purchase the &quot;Full Screen&quot; version if that is what you want.  Either way, the movie is a PIP! I thought that the essence of mystery mixed with human emotion is nicely portrayed.  Nothing is as good as the book, (your own imagination is used there), but the movie does give some nice escape in imagination with some excellent acting and computer gra-fix!	4.0	DVD Widescreen or Full Screen	2004-04-19	3	3	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	"This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen.  After that, its appeal drops off dramatically.  Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film.  The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books.  Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned).  That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing.  So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.From a technical perspective the film is marvelous.  The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match.  The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets.  Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.The acting is fabulous.  Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry.  He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part.  He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type.  This is exactly the right balance.  Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film.  Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous.  Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.The adult actors also represent themselves admirably.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable.  Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position.  But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (""I shouldn't have said that.  I should NOT have said that."")  Coltrane makes Hagrid as lovable as he is bumbling; a kid in a grown-up's body that is clearly on the kids' side.This is a delightful film for middle school kids, a segment that has fewer film choices than toddlers and teens.  I'd rate it a 9/10, shaving a point for excessive workup that slowed down the story a bit.  However, for Harry Potter fans, this is a perfect ten."	5.0	Outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids	2002-06-21	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Dark, lengthy and full of whispers, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" makes for a curious kids film. But wannabe wizards and other fans of the century's first boxoffice phenomenon will find the DVD transfigures theatrical drawbacks into delights. While some multiplexes were incapable of delivering ""Potter's"" visual subtleties, the wand wavers at Warner conjure up a two-disc DVD set in which magical images replace most of the murk. Flesh tones that threatened to wash out hold their detail nicely, even by candlelight. Down-in-the-dungeon scenes exhibit an artful but still clammy blend of pale blues and blacks. The outdoors quiddich match scores with a handsome 3-D illusion. Royal reds, golds and Augusta greens saturate the screen throughout. Whites still seem unnatural at times. The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX audio (in English and Spanish) brings out the many muted lines of dialogue, allowing listeners to catch all of Headmaster Dumbledore's admonitions. (There is no DTS option.) The children's voices are clear; John Williams' signature score enjoys a sweeping soundstage. Rear effects seem like they could do a lot more - especially in the frenzied quiddich game. But there are snitches of inspired surround in the air. The games are OK, some are frustratingly simple but addictive."	4.0	Magical for the home	2002-05-26	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A38JWSLCF9AYOZ	Fluffy's Owner	"I first saw this film when I was but 7 years old. Since then, I have watched the film many times, particularly during the last few years. Now I am 12, and still love it. I would rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. Since I (and know many people who agree with me) find there's nothing more irritating than a review that says, ""I love this item!"" without saying why, I'll try to explain why I would rate Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 5 stars. One reason (and a strong one, in my opinion) is the acting. I think they chose the perfect actors for the roles. For instance, Harry on screen looks exactly like I thought he would in the book. He also sounds like him exactly and says lines that are word for word from the book. I just think he's extremely ... Harry like. Hermione is first shown as a bossy know-it-all. Everyone I've met who's seen the film agrees that it's exactly like the book counterpart, but through perfect acting that doesn't grow stiff, we're shown that Hermione has a kinder, less bossy side to her. Ron and the whole Weasley family just ""seem"" like the Weasleys, for the same reasons I gave for Hermione and Harry. I don't know anyone who disagrees when I say that Snape was flawlessly cast and acted. The same is true for everyone else in the film. It all just feels very Harry Potter like. Another reason was that the film was extremely faithful to the book. It didn't try to improve on the book or have a completely different feel to it, therefore making it a much better film for that. It treated the book with respect. Another reason I can think of that this film merits 5 stars is that the film never drags. There is not a single moment that is too long in the film, in my opinion. For instance, how many people would guess that the Quidditch match in the middle of the film was 8 minutes long? Also, the whole 40 minutes until Harry gets to Hogwarts are fast but don't leave out anything. Once Harry's at Hogwarts, we spend our time taking in all the events that happen, making it seem like 10 minutes long instead of 150 minutes. Finally, the visuals are stunning. The castle looked exactly like Hogwarts was described in the book. The Forbidden Forest was menacing. The Hogwarts Express looked like a very comfortable train to be in. The ending is stupendous, as well, and very satisfying. Who doesn't cheer when Dumbledore awards the points taken away from Harry, Ron, and Hermione and even gives some to Neville. Those are some of the reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone earns its 5-star rating from me."	5.0	A 12-year-old's review	2010-12-04	2	2	0

Instead, the director seems to have placed wierd emphases on the smallest things and dropped others that made more sense.  Rowling is a great storyteller with a fine sense of pace and a great way of letting us see through Harry's eyes as he discovers the rich world of his birthright that he's just being exposed to.  The film gives very little sense. of that.  If they'd been more faithful to Rowling's pacing, things would have worked out a lot better.  The wild ride through Gringotts would have been great fun.

Where he movie clearly surpasses the book itself is the visualisation: Ms Rowling has no outstandin talent for -or is just not interested in- the settings while the scenographers of the movie clearly have, plenty of... Hogwarts and the other minor locations, which are so very much alive and impressive in the movies, are rather dim in the first book.If the scenes are outright beautiful they are also the main asset of the film. Acting is fine, of course, there being so many competent British actors; the children are convincing too but this too, one has begun to take for granted.Direction and screenplay are not up to this level and this nearly spoils the fun: the movie is slow, and the dialogues put in the mouths of the actors really put their talent to test. Maggie Smith in particular has been given lines so silly I really hope she has been well paid to pronounce them.	3.0	enjoyable	2007-01-16	1	1	0

But, as far as this one goes.  I think it's an excellent adaption and a wonderful story with stunning visual effects and some great music.10-year-old Harry Potter is leading a difficult life.  His parents died when he was a baby and his only remaining family members (Unlce Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley) treat him liek some cockroach that's wandered into their house.  1 day, on Harry's 11th birthday, he recieve a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Well, of course he goes to find out that he's famous for the defeat of a dark wizard, Voldemort.  Voldemort came to their houser, killed Harry's parents and tried to kill Harry too.  But, Harry destroyed his powers and Voldemort (unintentionally, of course) transferred some of his powers to Harry.  On his way to Hogwarts, he meets Romn Weasly and Hermione Granger.  They all have the displeasure to be associated with Dracoy Malfoy and his two henchmen, Crabbe and Goyle.  Then, on top of that, he shows extrordinary talent on a broomstick and becomes the youngest seeker for any Quidditch team in centuries.  He also learns that not everybody at Hogwarts worshops him day and night.  Severus Snape, Argus Filch, and his cat Mrs. Norris all take a disliking to him.  It's not really just Harry with Filch and Mrs. Norris, they just like to wage war with the students and the poltergeist, Peeves.  Harry begins to ponder over Snape and Quirrel's (the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher) strange behavior.  A strong desikre to see his parents again is finally manifested in Harry and he gets his wish when he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows the deepest and darkest desires of our heart.  Later on, he discovers that Hogwarts is hiding the Sorcerer's Stone which contains the Elixer of Life.  So, when he Ron, and Hermione, go down there... well I won't tell you that.The books are much more detailed and describe much more.  These movies are great and all, but they sometimes feels rushed and this one is no exception.  The scene where they arrive at Hogwarts is so d**n rushed it feels like a time warp.  In addition to that, Dumbledore slows things down to the point of feeling like you've gone back to the day you were born.  I liked the way Dumbledore was potrayed though.  Quirrel and Voldemort were also wonderfully acted out.  Alan Rickman was a great choice for Snape.  Danial Radcillfe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Wattson are the perfect people for the job.  Richard Harris plays a fabulous Dumbledore except for how slow he is.	4.0	Fabulous Movie	2006-03-09	2	2	0

I wouldn't say that it is amazing, but it does appeal to all ages. The story is really good, but the CGI used in the movie is a little dated. There are scenes when you can tell that it is computer animated because the characters look like something from a video game. Not really used to seeing a movie when they use CG for the actors and it is slowed down enough where you get a good look and are able to tell the actor fake.

After all, there is almost nothing a critic hates more than a film that is practically - baring some unforgivable act of gross incompetence - a guaranteed success, despite anything he or she might happen to write about it.At any rate, while some may quibble with the notion that Sorcerer's Stone is too much like the book that inspired it, the upside for moviegoers is that neither Rowling nor director Christopher Columbus have forgotten the film's primary audience: young readers between the ages of 12 - 16. For those whose parents read the book to them, the age may actually drop a bit below that.For the most part, as every parent knows, it is an audience frequently patronized with the worst sort of infantile pap imaginable, sometimes inundated with coarse language and gratuitous violence, or simply ignored altogether. Columbus, to his credit, does none of the above. In remaining true to his audience, Columbus has, in fact, delivered a film for all of us.It is obvious Columbus knows, for instance, that a young audience wants to see on the screen what it read in the book. In pursuit of this goal, Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned characters and settings true to the letter and the spirit of the novel. The characters, especially, strike just the right chord of familiarity. Certainly, we all know that familiarity can wander over the line into disinterested comfort. Remarkably, the characters in Sorcerer's Stone never do. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, for instance, looks just as we expect him to. More important, he radiates a warmth and trust that serves as a secure anchor in those moments when events seem to be spinning out of control. As good as Hagrid is in the book, Coltrane's Hagrid is more vivid on the screen.Which brings us to the performance of Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter. At first glance, Radcliffe seems reticent and withdrawn, hidden behind a gauze curtain, an uncertain hero. Yet we cannot forget that Harry Potter is an eleven year-old orphan whose parents have been murdered. He is a foundling whose caretakers resent his existence and actively disapprove of everything he is and, worse, in their own eyes, everything he will become. He is forced to sleep in a closet under the stairs and absorb a constant stream of verbal and physical abuse from his malevolent aunt and uncle and their overindulged son, Dudley.Yes, of course Harry is withdrawn. Small wonder. Or, as my daughter would say, ""Duh!""In fact, Radcliffe's performance is entirely consistent with Harry's history and upbringing, and Columbus has wisely ensured that, as the chronicle of films progresses, the character of Harry has somewhere to go. There are, after all, six movies still to come. Columbus has clearly determined that, unlike some other celluloid heroes of recent memory (Indiana Jones springs to mind), the character of Harry Potter should have some room to develop, otherwise both the young wizard and his friends would grow quickly stagnant.Another notable attribute of the film is that the atmosphere and setting, through the more subtle elements of special effects, are beautifully realized. As the first-years are journeying across the lake, their - and our - first view of Hogwarts Castle is absolutely breathtaking, a spectacular, gothic memory from a medieval dream. Inside the castle are stairways that move, pictures that talk and go about their daily routines, and a splendid dining hall that evokes the grandeur of a cathedral. When the Sorting Hat pronounces ""GRIFFINDORE"" on this opulent stage, Harry's adventures officially begin.Yes, the adventure has its obvious, special effects masterpieces. The Quidditch match is a high-flying, fast-paced extravaganza of soccer, polo, and basketball on broomsticks. The chess match is the high point of the film. At the same time, there are special effects so well done that they don't draw attention to themselves. The messenger owls flying gracefully into the dining hall to deliver envelopes and parcels is a brief, finely structured, aerial ballet that is easy to take for granted because we are momentarily suspended in the world of Hogwarts and have willingly cast aside our powers of disbelief. When Hedwig flies above Hogwarts Castle, our spirits and our sense of wonder soar with him. It is an impressive accomplishment.Because it is true to itself and never panders to its audience, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is both exciting and entertaining, an escape to a world where magical things can still happen. It is, in short, a film for the child in all of us."	5.0	A MARVELOUS BEGINNING	2008-08-24	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV	"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT"""	J.K. Rowling's novels have been such a phenomenal success that the film version of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE had a built-in audience that had to be pleased--and director Chris Columbus set out to do precisely that by cramming as much of the book as possible onto the screen.  The result is a fast-paced film with arresting visuals and plenty of special effects.  But while it looks magnificent, it doesn't really capture the novel upon which it is based.The problem, of course, is that Columbus and company have crammed so many of the book's details into the film that there's not much time for either story or character development: we're too busy looking at owls, shifting stairs, and the like, and it becomes somewhat difficult to keep track of the main story line and the numerous characters who support it.  Fortunately, the cast is strong enough to carry it off--the young Emma Watson is particularly enjoyable, and the main characters are supported by a host of distinctive actors whose memorable faces help keep us more or less on track.Ultimately... it is a fun film, very enjoyable for adults as well as children, and you'll probably watch it several times over and enjoy it each time.  But it does not live up to its billing as &quot;the event film that doesn't disappoint,&quot; nor is it really imaginative enough to be considered &quot;the Wizard of Oz of this generation.&quot;  The second DVD has a number of add-ons designed largely for the younger set (some of them require a computer) that they will enjoy; there is little in the way of special material for the grown-ups.  Recommended nonetheless.	4.0	Extremely Enjoyable But Excessively Literal	2002-06-03	17	14	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3HBS25SWNAB7H	Gary	. . . who disliked the DVD as much as he did the film.A bit of history: when I first heard that J.K. Rowling's series had been optioned for the silver screen, I was ecstatic . . . for about a minute.  Then the sensible, cautious moviegoer's instincts about big-budget blockbusters kicked in.  &quot;Oh no,&quot; I said to myself.  &quot;Harry is doomed!&quot;If you've already seen the movie and loved it, you can stop right here.  If you've read the series and haven't seen the movie (I don't know, maybe you live in a cave or were hiking the AT or deeply involved with your bedbug collection and missed it) I'll tell you this: Don't expect the fey, smart-alecky, tongue-trippingly fun-to-read prose to translate at all.  It doesn't.  It's a worse book-to-film transfer than any Stephen King movie you care to name--and that's sayin' summat!It begins with the actor portraying Harry Potter.  He redefines minimalist performance, using approximately three facial expressions throughout the film: slightly startled, mildly pleased, and semi-awestruck.  Moving on to the horribly miscast Richard Harris--Oh Caesar, how thou hast fallen.  I expected Dumbledore to be a little more sprightly, and act a little less like he was just bumped off by Joaquin Phoenix.  Of all the actors I expected to play McGonagall, Maggie Smith was the last.  Want to see Maggie Smith in her element?  Try &quot;Gosford Park&quot; or &quot;Room With a View.&quot;  Alan Rickman as Snape--I liked the idea, but they gave him so little to work with.  The movie's Snape was about as malevolent as a mailbox.  The best part of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone was the (computer generated) Quidditch match.I don't own this DVD.  I wouldn't take this DVD for free.  The only reason I didn't walk out of this movie in the theater was that I kept thinking, &quot;Okay, but it can't get any worse . . .&quot;  My suggestion?  Stick to the books.  Your imagination and J.K. Rowling's engaging style are way, way better than anything Hollywood could ever come up with.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2K005W90QEQOP	"Gayle Jackson Sloan ""Author"""	Okay, so some of the reviews are really bad.  I don't care.  I loved it.  I found it delightful and very entertaining.  When the movie came out, there was such an uproar about it corrupting children and that its real purpose was to bring them over to the dark side.  Yeah, right.  I found it to be none of that.  I think it was more about magic than witchcraft and that it had some good lessons in it.  Lessons such as knowing how to choose one's friends instead of being told, whether that friend is part of the popular crowd or not, how to be true to oneself, that love really does conquer all if you have goodness in your heart and that good is always better than evil.  I think for those children who don't like to read, and let's face it, there are plenty, this is a really good movie.  They can still experience the Harry Potter mystic and didn't have to crack a book. However, it may also make them want to go back and read the book in addition to the subsequent books, and whatever encourages children to read is a good thing.  They may even learn a lesson or two. I'm thinking of picking up the other books myself now! ... If you want to be entertained and want a movie you can enjoy as much as your kids, then get it.  I think you may find that you really like it.	5.0	Delightful!	2002-06-17	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first film in a seven film series, based on the first Harry Potter book of the same name by J.K. Rowling.The film, like the book, sees young Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) receive an invitation to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft, discover that he's a wizard's child and gets caught up in the mystery of a strange package, a bank robbery, a forbidden third floor and suspicious teachers, along with his two newfound friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).In the world of Harry Potter, illustrations, paintings and photographs move. I like to think of this film the same way. Rather than be a stand alone film, I see this film as a visual companion to the book, moving pictures that give you an idea of what everything in and around Hogwarts looks like, (like what being in a building full of moving stairways actually looks like, for instance) giving the fictional world just a bit more depth. It's not as if the film would be completly alienating to newcomers, not at all, its just that if I hadn't read the book beforehand, I'm sure I would have found things a bit harder to follow, as things move fairly quickly and there's an ever thickening plot to keep an eye on.Everything looks great, and pretty much everybody is cast well. I particularly liked the choice of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I quite liked the fact that Warwick Davis (of ""Willow"" and ""Leprechaun"" fame) got a double role in this film, both as a banker of Gringotts and as Harry's charms teacher, Professor Flitwick. I reckon Warwick should do a film where he's a whole bunch of characters one day, it'd be great!Fans of the book will notice that a couple of plot elements have been combined, making it easier to follow. Take, the baby dragon subplot, for instance. It needs to be taken home. In the book, Ron's brother's friends take it home to Romania, but in this film, Dumbledore does this, snipping out the book's reason for his absence. It's understandable they did this, and its not terribly major.Included with this DVD is an extra disc of special features, that plays a bit like a DVD remote controlled point and click game. There are seven deleted scenes from the film to watch, but you'll have to work for it, going from virtual room to virtual room within Hogwarts School. Can you find the Philosopher's Stone that will turn menus to cutting room gold? If you don't have the patience for DVD games, there's plenty of other stuff to look at, including a virtual tour of Hagrid's cabin and the Gryffindor Common Room, a ""Catch the Snitch"" game and explanation of Quidditch, various montages of all your favourite characters, conceptual sketches, clickable every flavour beans to ""eat"", and an interview with director Chris Columbus and the producer of the film, David Heyman.Definitely worth a look, though I'd definitely read the novel first. Fans will probably want to watch this again and again, I'm sure."	4.0	A Wizard Motion Picture	2006-06-18	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AK7D1BHZOSOL1	General Pete	I think it does a very good job of retelling the books I mean they practically take the chapters word for word.  Harry Potter also provides some wonderful cameo roles for 2 very fine english actors namly Allien Rickmen and John C(from Monty Python).  It suffers from from only one thing the kids sound like they are reading from the script of a middle school play.  It is not really an issue for your kids, and you will probably be too busy paying attention to the special effects to notice.	4.0	The movie is ok	2002-06-06	0	0	0

Oh yeah, hold on... you should read the books before you see the movies, because the movies just kind of ruin the books (the ending is revealed and so on). The books are so much better, J.K.

Harry Potter is intelligent reading and viewing, guaranteed to keep the children enthralled for hours and he's a good role model, not like the slaughterhouse-style anime which is popular these days.The DVD provides lots of extras and combined with reading the books with it, it comes across well. There's enough action and story to keep the adults interested as well. Once you think the story is told, another twist comes up. Excellent movie (and by the way, The Chamber of Secrets -in Theaters now- was/is just as good.)Combined with the books, the tale turns out beautifully on and off screen.Robert Eldridge (...)	5.0	Intelligent Fantasy for a New Age	2002-12-03	2	2	0

I liked the Harry Potter books, myself. When it was time the movie came out, I didn't want to see it. Once my family made me see it, I complained a lot, like most 14 year old kids do...I was right about everything I had said about this movie. It was mainly a violent movie for kids. The movie made me think about something: Why the heck do they care about what their school does? I would mind my own buisness if there were dogs as tall as the empire state building gaurding a stupid stone! I think most people would!Worse than that, the acting was horrible. The kids were obviously not that experienced, they forshadowed way too much, and some very cheesy and terrible attempts of humor.Believe me. This is a kid's movie. Don't get this. This series will be successful, but only because dumb younger kids will drag their parents to the theatres to see the 4 eyes british boy save the world (including the ""muggles"").

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1Y1YRO74S6ELA	"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames"""	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone one of the best fantasy films i've seen, but one of the best films of 2001. when it premiered, the film broke box office records grossing over $100 million in it's opening weekend. the movie itself lived up to the hype and anticipation.Believe or not, some ridiculous morality groups including agassiz middle school in fargo nd actually voiced concern over the film because of the witchcraft element.from my experience with working kids (i mentor and tutor kids in my spare time ) i can tell you that kids can tell fiction from reality and right from wrong. ''harry potter and the philosopher's stone'' is based on the successful children's book by j.k. rowling who many didn't know is a woman, until she was interviewed on 60 minutesAlso what other people may not know is the children's books weren't successful at first. j.k. rowling came up with the idea for the books while working as a teacher. when rowling first displayed her early harry potter stories to publishers, all of them turned her down!!! Apparently these book publishers (like many in general) didn't know a good thing even if it bit them on the leg. eventually about 4 and 1/2 yrs after rowling's finished her final harry potter, warner bros. and chris columbus amazed by the popularity of the books, and seeing the opportunity to profit from it, convinced her to do a film from her books. this film ''harry potter and the sorcerer's stone'' is the result.The film starts of by a mysterious sequence in which a young boy is dropped of the doorstep of a neighborhood. a big giant, named hagrid (robbie  coltrane(, looks at the boy and eventually promises that he eventually come back for this special boy, who has an unusual birthmark on his head.The boy we learn is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and he been brought here to be brought by one of the worst excuses of a mom and dad: His nasty aunt and uncle Mr and Mrs. Dursely (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and their big fat son named Dudly. They abuse Harry literally using him as a slave around the house, and offering little luxury and love. We fast about 11 yrs, and suddenly we see that Harry is going hundreds of letters inviting him to come to the school of Hogwarts. Harry doesn't know what ''Hogwarts'' is, but his aunt and uncle, and like evil people do and keep that info away from hm, literally ripping  up every letter addressed to Harry from Hogwarts.As Harry and his ''family'' are visiting the zoo , Harry notices he has special odd powers: He can talk to a snake and and literally makes the snake comes alive!!! Dudley, the big fat kid, tries to pet the snake, but ends going through the windows and poops his pants, lol, as he sees the snake escaping. 0 Harry is shocked, but happy he has this special powers. Eventually that day, Hagrid, comes to Harry's house, and tells him all about ''Hogwarts'' which is a special Wizards and Witches school for kids. He also tells Harry that he is a great wizard!!!!!!!! Harry and Hagrid, then leave the Dursely's and Harry begins his first step into the adventure at Hogwarts.At Hogwarts, Harry meets other potentials wizards and witches like Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) who become Harry's roomates at Griffindoor.The headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), and a magical hat sort every Wizard and Witch candidate into their appropriate dorm, and so Harry Potters new classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione are sorted into Griffindoor.Here Harry and others meet their teachers such as Professor Snake (Alan Rickman from Die Hard fame) who specializes in potions. They also learn a  bout special sports at Hogwarts like quidditch a special wizard sport. However, the trio also uncover mystery , danger, and adventure as they uncover, trolls, three headed dogs, and a special mystery known as ''The Philosopher's Stone''. Harry above all will discover a mysterious secret about his parents, and their encounter against, an evil Wizard named Voldemort.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' is loaded withspecial effects: The school of Hogwarts is loaded with special spirits and dangers. There is a great effect in the film where a couple of painting come alive in the movie!!! It looks cool. More special effects such as the walking stairways at Hogwarts. Of course the biggest effects come with showing the Wizard powers of Harry, and the amazing enemies he encounters.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' also has great makeup effects as well:  For example , Harry in the beginning meets a couple of Goblins who work at the  Gringotts bank where Harry has an account. The makeup is fantastic, the people playing the Goblins look amazingly real in their makeup.''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'' was a big hit for it's great story about a special boy, the amazing adventures he has as he Wizardy and Mystery where he will not uncover, great adventure but uncover himself as well. J.K. Rowling has done her best work with Harry Potter. 3 of the Harry Potter films have already been finished, with the 3rd film film being released later this year. There is a great special 2 disc dvd for the movie and it includes:* A special interactive tour of Hogwarts* A special trivia section and Wizard section* Special DVD Roms features such as a screensaver* Interviews with Chris Columbus and cast*Commentary and much moreHowever, the DVD features has it's setbacks for one is it's ''Extra Footage'' of the film. The ''Extra Footage'' are deleted scenes that didn't make the cut of the film. Ordinarly deleted scenes, are put into a special category on a dvd, so users can  see the original film and then see the deleted scenes separately.  I did like the commentary though explaining how tough yet fun it was in bringing Harry Potter to the big screen, obviously when the movie was a successful a box office franchise was born.The franchise of Harry Potter is not limited to the film or books, video games for the Playstation, Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance all have games of Harry Potter. However, Harry Potter is one the greatest fantasy movies in quite a while and J.K. Rowling has a done great job in bringing it to life.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	2004-07-01	3	3	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3LU79BYMWZEW9	Gregor von Kallahann	"As a librarian, I have naturally been aware of the Harry Potter phenomenon for quite a while now.  While there may be a few of my colleagues out there who are not so wild about ""Harry,"" nearly all welcome the enthusiasm the series has engendered and remain ever hopeful that some of those reluctant readers in their communities (adults as well as children) might become absorbed in the series and inspired to read more and more ""Harry,""  then maybe seek out similarly themed books and then, if the ball really gets rolling, discover a whole world of reading above, beyond but still including fantasy.  It could happen. You never know. We guardians of the printed word have to put our faith in something.OK,OK I must confess, from everything I'd heard and read, ""Harry"" wasn't likely to be my own particular cup of English tea. So after all these years, I still haven't actually read it. I'm not a children's librarian, so it wasn't an absolute must. Certainly, I was intrigued by the whole phenomenon but just not in any hurry to read it myself.  Not when there's so much depressing adult literature to plow through. So when the film version came out, I thought it would be a good way to get a feel for what this Harry thing was all about.  The fact that it was reported to be quite faithful to the book made checking out the film version all the better.  Now I could fake my way through lengthy (and they do tend to be lengthy)conversations with Harry-Potter-Heads if I had to.It still took me nearly six months to see the film. Locally, it wasn't around as long as I thought it was going to be.  Finally, on its second or third run, I was able to catch it...at a drive-in!  (Yes, there are still some left here in the Northeast).  It turned out to be the perfect setting, watching this elaborate fantasy unfold while sitting in my own private bubble. (I may have been the only person who ever went to a drive-in ALONE). But it was good, kind of like the solitary pleasure of reading.I'm half-kidding when I say that the movie's literalness was a plus.  I'm sure there are Potter fans out there who would have welcomed something not quite as faithful to a text they already knew by heart.  But when you consider how young (or, at least, young at heart) so many of the readers are, and how none of us likes his fairy tales altered one jot, the film version's slavishness to the original was probably the only possible artistic choice.Any criticisms?  Well, yeah.  Child actors need special coaching.  I'm not one who believes that there are only a few exceptional Haley Joel Osments or Hayley Millses out there.  But they do need special care from their drama coaches and directors.  This is especially true when they're required to deliver ""adult-level"" dialog.  It's not surprising that these young sorcerers have exceptional vocabularies: they're SUPPOSED to be special, but in fact, much of the scripted dialog does not come trippingly off the young actors' tongues.If that's the worst I can say about the movie though, it's not saying much.  Enjoy the film! And its no doubt worthy sequels. And don't forget to read the BOOKS!  (Do as I say, kids, not as I do.)"	4.0	It Gets People to Read! What's Not to Like?	2002-07-09	1	1	0

I thought the DVD had a lot of great extras, although it would have been nice if the deleted scenes could have been watched within the movie, sort of like a special edition.The biggest flaw with the DVD, in my opinion, is that there was not footage of the upcoming Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!!!  I really think WB really messed up here.  Why not give us a glimpse of the next installment?  The movie has to be in at least post-production by now.  I was a little disappointed.Other than that, great DVD, if you liked the movie, you will like the DVD.	4.0	Good DVD, but where is the HP 2 trailer???	2002-05-28	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWI'll start out with what I love about ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.""  It mixes realism and fantasy and hearkens to a wide selection of well-known predecessors.  It's a high-powered version of ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" with a little ""Star Wars"" and even ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" thrown in. In comparison with those movies, that is also its main fault as the storyline in this movie is fairly cliched and threadbare, despite the best efforts of screenwriter Steve Kloves.Featuring an all-star gallery of British and United Kingdom acting talent, the film manages to significantly cover up a fairly uneventful runtime by sheer force of their efforts.  The cast includes Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, as well as Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall and the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore.  Most impressive, however, are the junior members of the cast.  Daniel Radcliffe is wonderful in the title role, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also superb as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.  Tom Felton, as Harry's young enemy Draco Malfoy, is very impressive as well and rounds out a very solid core of child actors in this film.The movie overcomes a plodding, paint-by-numbers approach to laying out its key storytelling elements to deliver an exciting climax.  As a parting comment, am I the only one who noticed the extreme similarities between the names ""Lord Voldemort"" and ""Lord Vader?"""	3.0	Entertaining movie plays with some of the same tricks as its brethren, invents new ones	2010-04-19	1	0	1

Hermione never looks around the Great Hall when she first walks in; when he comes to pick him up from the island, Haggrid acts like it has been a few days since he last saw Harry, not many years.  There are many such examples.I am glad for any and all attention the movies generates for the books, however.  Ms. Rowling works deserve all the attention they get. Seek them.  THERE lies a real adventure in reading.	3.0	Good Movie, but don't deny yourself the book!	2002-09-08	0	0	0

He LOVED it! (And it was great seeing it again.) It's as faithful as a movie can be to a novel-sized fantasy book and doesn't disappoint (something I was concerned about for a smart kid who is big on details and knows both the book and the overall story). The extras also proved popular with my son, who wanted more once the movie was over (we all would have liked more, of course, but it was a good post-movie bit of family fun as it was). Highly recommended. The only issue is that we know the movies get darker/scarier with each installment so he likely won't be ready to watch year 3 on for a couple of years yet.Guess we'll just have to have this one on repeat until then. ;)	5.0	Excellent & great for little ones too!	2013-05-06	1	1	0

The book was excelent, the movie was not.=+= Plot =+=This movie, as do the books, take after the life of Harry Potter, a wizard that lives with his aunt and uncle along with with his cousin Dudley. Ok, they got that part right...but they keep on keepinbg out key sceans. Like the part when Snape refs Harry's Quiditch game. And, the parts that they DID keep in were pretty poorly done. Many parts had a lot of attemps at comedy, but they did not succed. Also, the animation was TERRIBLE. Play Station 1 graphics were better then that! But, they did keep on the plot pretty good so..Plot score: 2-5=+= Cast =+=Let me start out by saying, that the actors that are showing their true colors now, were terrible back then. Danaile Radcliff plays Harry, poorly at that. He is AWSOME today...but terrible in the first one. Same with Emma Watson and Rupurt Grint, AWSOME actors/actress now, terrible back then. Richard Harris did an AWSOME job (as usual) in his role as Dumbledore. Also Allen Rickman as Snape did awsome. Not sure if it was the writing, or just their acting skills, but the acting did poorly, except Richard Harris and Allen Rickman, so..Casting score:1-5=+= Music =+=John Williams was very famous for his music in such films as Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, and War of the Worlds, came back to do Harry Potter, and boy did he deliver. The music in this movie was very well done. The theme was very good, and also he made the music as it went along with the movie so...Music:5-5=+= Closing Statements =+=Harry Potter: And the Sorcerors Stone, a poor movie off of a perfect book. Is that what J.K. Rowling gets for all her hard work in making the books? I was really board in this movie and I had thought that reading words from pages was a lot funner, then looking at images on a screan. Though SOME actors were good, and the music was excelent, you cant just live off of those two things.Final Score: 2-5BTW..JustThinkin is me..I needed a new account	2.0	Harry Potter: And The Sorcerors Stone	2006-06-21	9	2	7

I ordered my copy of the widescreen edition through Amazon and was excited when it arrived in the mail.  I hurriedly took it out of the box and sat down to look at all of the DVD options and extras.The Harry Potter DVD is a two disk set with the movie and trailers on one disk and tours of Hogwarts and Diagon Alley as well as other things to explore on disk two.  To this point, I haven't explored all of the options the DVD has to offer, but I have taken a small tour through the Gryffindore Commons.The movie itself is of excellent quality, and the widescreen makes it that much more enjoyable since the movie has a lot of motion made for a big screen.I'm slightly confused about the features this DVD has.  I was under the assumption that there was bonus footage and what not, but cannot be found on the second disk.  This footage is probably in the movie itself if not hidden somewhere in the DVD menu.  For those who have a DVD CD-ROM the second disk has many other things to explore, but sadly I do not own a DVD CD-ROM.  Others may experience this problem.Overall, Harry Potter has made it to my home and is proudly displayed in my DVD collection.  For those interested in adding this to his collection it is worth to spend a little more for the widescreen edition.	4.0	Harry Potter's first year comes home!	2002-05-29	0	0	0

I am deeply awaiting the arrival of this DVD because I am a great fan and have been waiting forever to enjoy this movie. It kept faithfull to J.K. Rowling and for that I rate it 5 stars. The production might not have been very good to everyone's eyes, but I held it accounted because the movie was faithfull to the book, if it was made into a 'Hollywood Version' perhaps the production would have been better, but fans everywhere including myself would have left disappointed. So over all I think that the movie was great, gave fans a in depth look at the Magival World of Harry Potter for the many years that we have been dreaming about.	5.0	Harry Potter, when is the fame going to end?	2002-02-26	2	1	1

The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" disc is the best part of this Edition. Each of these editions comes with a new part of Creating the World.. It comes with 2 character cards which actually are not of much use.

I go to the movies almost every weekend and as a big movie go-er, I say that the Harry Potter movie was absolutely amazing. The directing and special effects were fantastic. They didn't make the movie to fit the imagination of every Harry Potter reader, they made it to tell the fictional story of Harry Potter and that is exactly what they acomplished. They got actors who I think fit the roles exactly (maybe not their appearance was exactly how your brain imagined them) but overall their personalities were very similar. I advise anyone who hasn't seen the movie to go out asap and see it, if they have read the books or not. I've seen the movie three times already and read the books twice (reading them again at the moment) and I am buying the DVD because I know I will watch it over and over and over and not get sick of it because it's that good.

As for the film based on part 1 in the series, I can say that it is a pretty good fantasy yarn that is just dark, brooding, and complex enough to interest (some) adults, but not so much so that the younger members of the family won't find something to enjoy, despite the film's length. I am an avid fan of fantasy, but am cautious of break-out franchises, and before plopping down in front of &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; I was fairly certain I would dislike the film (especially given that it has the misfortune of competing with &quot;The Fellowhip of the Ring,&quot; which blows it out of the water).

It stuck very close to the original story line, only deleting a few scenes that had no effect on the movie.  I was in awe of the visual effects. I haven't seen anything so alive , real, and ""wild"" since ""Labyrinth"" or ""The Adventures of Baron Munchaussen"".  The characters, some you would not believe COULD be brought to the screen are, with absolute perfection.  Not a single drop of their quirks and funny dialect lost.  I mean, I never expected Hagrid, the sorting hat, or the Quidditch game to be as visual as they were in the book. I was dead wrong.  My husband would look over at me in the theater (which at 2pm, was filled with adults trying to see the movie without the kids) and would tell me to close my mouth.  Apparently I had my mouth hanging wide open through the whole movie.  I have a countdown calender in my house for the movie's release.  I have no children.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A457S8SW690NM	hi	A while back, when there was the Harry Potter madness, I read the first 3 books. After that though, I was pretty much done and I haven't read another one since. I realized that I'd grown out of these books and that these books weren't very good, at leat not for older kids. Sure, it's great for the little kids, but for me, a guy in high school, you know. Anyway, this movie is based on the first book of the same name. The cast is great and it brings the book to life. So, if you're looking for a good book interpretation, you've got it. As for a family movie, it's good but the Incredibles, Shrek, Toy Story 1 and 2, Monsters Inc., Home Alone, etc..are all superior to this.And for little kids, it's a great movie and excellent book interpretation but while I'm watching this, I'm thinking of good serious movies. 5 stars for the kids, good family movie but not the best. 2nd best movie of the first 3.	4.0	Good family movie	2005-09-07	4	2	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A110YY3Z2Z0R7W	Hilary	Words Can't express just how aweful these movies are compared to the books.  I have been a Harry potter fan almost since the begining.  The books have and continue to be a beautiful source of inspiration for me.  But the films fall utterly short of even mediocre.  I understand that there must be changes when a book is adapted for film but too many vital complex characters, such as Hagrid and Ron, are reduced to one-dimensional comic relief.  Every character lost at least one-dimension - even harry.  I felt that if I hadn't read the book I probably wouldn't understand the movie.Not is only a horrible adaptation, it is horrible as a film.  The actors feel as if they're either trying to hard, or don't know what they're doing.  Daniel Radcliff has to gasp before every line!  The corniness was almost too much to bear.  I felt embarressed for the actors.The special effects sucked.  The troll in the girls bathroom should have at least  looked convincing.  The trees in the forbidden forest were too far apaart to be menacing.I  will say though, that Argus Filch the caretaker was portrayed beautifully.  The one star I give this film is for him.	1.0	Abombination	2005-03-06	19	8	11

It's well-documented that Miss Rowling had a very strong presence during the making of the movie, and I do think that Chris Columbus, a competent director, let himself be intimidated and stifled by it. There's virtually no trace of his creative hand that's visible in the film. I could practically hear the pages of the book being read verbatim. &quot;And then they went here, and then they did this, and then this happens...&quot;On the good side, the actors are really excellent and everything looks exactly right. The special effects were not up to par on a film costing this much money. It's actually a pretty good movie, I just wish the filmmakers had taken a few liberties in order to make it better. As a children's movie, it probably gets four to five stars, as I'm sure they will love it. But I have to be honest and review it from my own adult perspective. There's at least a few more movies to go, so here's hoping they get it right next time!	3.0	Five Stars For Kids, Three For Me	2002-09-28	3	0	3

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A29UO9GBSQXS72	Horror Spooky	With Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince recently released in theaters, I thought it was appropriate to look back at Harry Potter's film legacy, and I'll be damned if there's a better place to start than with the original.I remember when this film came out in theaters. My mom literally took me out of school to go to the premiere, and we were the second group in line with about a billion people behind us. I was a Potter nut, like most kids were at the time, and I was insanely excited to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all.The film tells the story of Sorcerer's Stone in a nearly flawless fashion. Sure, there are things left out, but it's a book-to-film ADAPTION, not translation. The film still keeps all of the important and best parts and creates some pretty classic moments for itself.The entire flim was very well done, and they couldn't have picked better actors for the leads. Snape did a particularly good job of capturing the character, as did Emma Watson when it came to Hermione Granger.In case you've been living under a rock, the story of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a neglected child whose parents are dead and is forced to live with his aunt, uncle, and abusive cousin. However, he finds out that he is actually a wizard, and he goes to attend school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. He discovers the secrets within Hogwarts and gets to know all of the colorful characters within its walls.The plot plays out brilliantly and the acting is spot-on for the most part, so why couldn't Sorcerer's Stone nab that perfect five stars? Well, it's the special effects. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some very cool special effects like moving pictures, the goblins, floating candles, and all of that jazz, but there is a problem. The CGI, even though it's used sparingly, looks AWFUL! Honestly, they look like they were zapped out of a cut-scene for a PlayStation One video game. Eight years ago this may have worked, but the CGI techniques used here really haven't aged well. Plus, I hate CGI and don't approve of its use much at all anyway.Both the Harry Potter books and the Harry Potter film series will be forever immortalized in not only American culture but damn near every culture that covers this world. This film is definitely worth seeing and rewatching again and again, with the only problem being it hasn't really aged all that well.	4.0	Here he comes, the birthday boy!	2009-07-25	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2C9DBEEKV54R2	Hudson Valley thinker	I'm afraid I'm not very positive about this film.  I could barely make it to the end.  As a student of film studies, I have to say that filmmakers today, especially Hollywood filmmakers, are tending more and more to rely on special effects and quick shots of people's expressions, and not enough on ACTING!  Even the great Maggie Smith was reduced to a series of melodramatic poses and shallow facial expressions.  And I was ready to tear that plasterboard fake smile off of Daniel Radcliffe's face by the end of the movie.  I'm afraid he, like the rest of the characters in this film, suffer from terminal cool.  I suppose thats what kids today want.  And you can bet Hollywood will deliver.The film is also excessively violent.  If you compare sections of the film with the way the story is told in the book, you can see the added amount of gratuitous violence.  Children and creatures are hurled around and smashed against things like they're images in a video game.  Realism?  Get real!The special effects on the DVD are so loud, I had to keep turning the volume down.  But then I couldn't hear the dialogue, so then I had to turn it up again.  Too much noise, too much violence, not enough genuine acting, sophisticated storytelling, and human interaction.  Period!	1.0	Hollywood sellout for the sound-byte generation	2002-06-06	18	6	12

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1Q8ZB0G22V6YA	Iain S. Palin	"The ""Harry Potter"" movie suffered for coming out shortly before ""Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring"". HP is a good, entertaining, enjoyable family movie, and true to the book (perhaps a bit too much so) - unfortunately for it LotR turned out to be a truly magnificent film which not only captured the essence of its book but showed how you could transfer it to the big screen and be faithful to it while tightening and speeding things up. As both of these films are merely the first in series it seems likely that poor Harry and Hogwarts will be continue to be overshadowed by Middle Earth. This is rather a pity  - one can enjoy both, after all.Yes, the DVD of the film itself is good, though the second one with its various extras (including a few - all too few -cut scenes) really is badly laid out and difficult to navigate.Poor Harry has also suffered a bit, from what we hear on this side of the pond, from the attention of people who think he is anti-Christian. How a story of the power of redeeming love to overcome evil can be this I really don't know. A couple of anti-Potter websites I've seen quote one of the characters who says ""there is no good or evil, only power"" as if this represents JK Rowling's viewpoint. In fact those words are uttered by the main bad character against whom Harry and the forces of good are battling.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A39330ESBLU9YP	I. Dizon	"I have been a Harry Potter fan after the fourth book came out. I didn't see what all the fuss was about and so decided to read the first one for myself. Let me tell you, it really bowled me over! I had imagined so many amazing things, the character personalities, Quidditch matches, etc! I have also listen to Jim Dale's narrations on the books-on-tape and I believe he does each voice to perfection.The movie, however, was a different story. I understand that WB had to keep the movie under a certain time-limit, but there are so many things left out of the film that it's embarrassing. Everything J.K. Rowling had mentioned in the Sorcerer's Stone was explained in the later books, for example, Parseltongue. If they plan to make a movie for all the books (which I seriously doubt), this little aspect will be important in the other films. There was no mention of Sirius Black, a very important character in the Prisoner of Azkaban, and other little things that serious fans would notice. We took notes during the second time we watched the movie and there were many things missing. I heard that J.K. Rowling herself was at the studio filmings and she told the director how she wanted things to be portrayed, but it's still very lacking.I will buy this movie, only because I am such a fan, but after the second time in the theaters, I said, ""That's it, i'm not watching it in here anymore."" because even for me, a fanatic in the truest sense, it's disappoiting.

From bad special effects (the troll, the centaur), a disjointed screenplay (Why do H,H,and R first discover Fluffy in the apparent afternoon, but by the time they get back to the dormitory scurry off to bed?), choppy editing (That cut to the hut-on-the-rock scene is appalling and the music is overbearing throughout the film.), and bad directing (could *someone* have told Emma she didn't have to enunciate everything?!) the movie really could've of been much better.Of course the truth is that it's Harry so I can't help but at least liking it. The sets may've been quite good, I'll admit, but the spirit of the books just wasn't there. The movie is worth it only if you're a fan, but if you're just discovering Harry do focus on the books and not this mediocre bit of celluloid.On a related note, I've still not figured out how exactly to watch the extra footage, or even if it's on my DVD, though apparently it is, and I'm fed up with trying.

Rowling's characters to life.""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is the first installment of Rowling's planned seven-book series about a young orphan, Harry Potter, who wakes up on his eleventh birthday only to be told that he is a wizard and has the chance to leave his muggle (non-magic) aunt and uncle to attend the greatest school of all time: Hogwarts.While at school, Harry meets many unforgettable characters who are beautifully portrayed in this film. There is Harry's best friend, red-head Ron Weasley, the fifth child of a poor family who loves, among other things, wizard chess. There is the over-confident Hermoine Granger, who enjoys reading, studying, and being right. There is Harry's nemesis, the evil (and brilliatly casted) Draco Malfoy, starved for power and from a family that is, well, loaded with money. There is the gentle Rufus Hagrid, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts, who wants nothing more than a pet dragon. And there is the beloved headmaster, Prof. Albus Dumbledore (played by the late Richard Harris), a man who is both wise and gentle.Both the books and the movie have come under heavy scrutiny for being about witchcraft. They are. They are also about the struggles of good battling evil and Harry's triumphs and let-downs as he struggles to discover himself and his expectations as a young boy thrown into a world he completely doesn't understand. This isn't evil, it's a magical adventure, much like Peter Pan.Another comment from many fans of the Potter series is that they don't want to see the movies for fear of destroying their views as to what the books are 'really like'. The first time I saw this film, my good friend, who absolutely loves Harry, kept exclaiming, 'This is just how I pictured it!' Many fans have walked away with similar responses, and I have yet to find another movie that follows the book so closely.The adventures of young Harry at Hogwarts (and even getting there) are magical masterpieces. From his first chance standing on the platform 9 3/4 to his first views of the enchanted ceiling, you will feel Harry's wonder at his predicament -- and, like him, feel the magic behind it all."	5.0	Magically Amazing	2002-11-10	2	2	0

When the fourth book of the series was released and people went wild, I had no idea who Harry Potter was.

The sorcerer's stone is a fantastic book. Very enjoyable reading, and as I was reading it, I could picture the scenes of the movie in my mind.

You will fall in love with the charcters, while watching this film.Well, this is all I have to say for now, but I highly encourage you to go see this movie, or at least rent it, and i'm sure after doing that, you will want to buy it!	5.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- A Clasic	2002-04-30	3	3	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1W9TMK21D5GZI	Jack Reynolds	"I have to admit that years ago, when the Harry Potter series was first getting its start, I was hesitant as a Christian to get into something that focused so much on witchcraft and wizardry.  In the years following, I have learned to be more openminded about such things.  Last month, I finally decided to watch the Harry Potter movies.I was immediately captivated by the movie, and its subsequent sequels.  In the month that I have owned the first five movies, I have already watched them all three times.Yes, the focus of the story is on Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I caution Christian audiences not to immediately dismiss this movie just because of that.  Some of you may remember the old Disney movie, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  This series is no more harmful than that.The entire movie has a wonderful sense of whimsy to it, created by such things as chocolate frogs, banks run by goblins, candles floating near the ceiling, and the great broomstick-based soccer/polo-like sport known as Quidditch.The cinematography was beautiful.  The Hogwarts sequences had such a warm, colorful, enchanting feel to them.  It made me want to enroll at Hogwarts.The cast of characters is perfect, including such well-known stars as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and John Cleese.  And the acting by everyone was absolutely superb.The musical score by John Williams is very different from the composer's normal sound, but is still a masterful score.I say again - watch this movie with an open mind, and you will be amazed and spellbound by this great landmark in fantasy."	5.0	Viewed with an open mind, this movie is fantastic!	2009-01-01	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3LH8SJBNRXZ8R	"Jackster ""Montana educator"""	I find reading the Harry Potter books in french has been a great way to saturate myself with french words. I started out having to look almost every word on the page up and now I can read almost an entire chapter without picking up my dictionary or english copy. What a great idea, I wish I would have thought of it sooner. Of course I love the Harry Potter stories and can read them over and over again. I also have the french version of the little prince and have thought of getting some of my other favorite books as well. I have to say I ordered the french version of the first harry potter dvd and I still have a hard time keeping up, but now that I have watched it about three times I am getting the hand of understanding most of what they say, but it still seems like they talk too fast!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A30RS83H5PAPP9	Jacob Cheney	I can remember back when the 1st installment of the Harry Potter series entitled HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE, came out in theaters back in November 2001.It still to this very day remains the best installment. I think its because back then everybody wanted to see it. It was just very magical the way it was released because no one really knew the real deal of the h.p. films. This is a great movie if you like h.p.. This is my favorite of the 3. Rent the Sorcerers Stone, and The Chamber Of Secrets, and then go see The Prizoner Of AZkaban.The point of this movie was a wizard whos parents got killed, that lives with his abusive aunt and uncle it a brilliant wizard but he doesnt know that. And then he enrolls in a magical place called hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards. After that things start looking up for him, He makes friends, gets away from his stupid fat uncle, and wrinkly old mean aunt, and joins a place where he is protected and cared for. I strongly reccomend this wonderful film.	5.0	... It still remains the best of the 3.	2004-06-19	4	4	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A31RCDFI6WSH6	J A Edwards	Lets be honest here folks, Harry Bloody Potter. An annoying eleven year old wearing oversized glasses claiming to have special powers. If he has special powers, why does he not fix his sight...which is obviously impaired, seen as he wears those ridiculously oversized frames on his nose that make his look like something out of the Addams family, (only that was a decent movie).But of course my review is not all about pointless jeering. The acting in the film is not good either, and the guy that plays Harry Potter (I'll be damned if I know his name) seems to spend most of the time in a trance like state, wide eyed, and in awe of yet another seemingly amazing sight...although the all too poor special effects make it hard to be in awe of anything here, except of course for the terrible script.If you want some good examples of amazing movie making, try anything by Stanley Kubrick, Taxi Driver, Star Wars Trilogy, and anything by Stanley Kubrick.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AY06HIKRT0NZF	James Brock	I liked the movie, I really did but I think the only reason that I liked it so much when it first came out was because I got to see it before a lot of people. The movie is good and the acting is good among certain characters, mainly the adults, but what can you say because the kids were in their first movie. A lot of people said the movie was nothing like the book but it actually was totally like the book, which it should be! The only main differences were just the parts they had to leave out which makes sense because other wise the movie would have been anylonger. The movie is so much like the book that I couldn't read the book after I saw the movie because it was exactly like MOST of the scenes. Notice i did say most. The movie is a TON like the book but it's not totally exact with every detail but it's very close. People will argue but they'll get over it and if they don't they are just doing it for show as everyone does. Anyway the movie is good but if you've just read the book DON'T go see it. I hadn't read the book for over 2 yrs and I'm glad I hadn't because it left me wondering what happened. If you have just read the book I would really not reccomend seeing it just because you'll be bored, in my opinion. If you are going to see the 2nd movie but want to read the book, READ IT NOW because the movie is said to be out in Novemeber and you shouldn't be reading it any later than now because otherwise you'll remember it all and I think it's best that you don't so it leaves the movie interesting.	3.0	I liked the movie but	2002-03-16	2	0	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3CE6J8ABL8WQ4	"James D. Schwarzmeier ""compupc1"""	"I'll not comment on the overall movie itself, as that has been the topic of most other reviews here.  I'll just say that the movie itself was excellent, save a couple disappointing visual effects (e.g. Voldimort; he wasn't scary).  Also, the film transfer and sound mix were great (the surround channels could have been used more, but it wasn't BAD).  I would however like to discuss the movie's presentation on the DVD.  There are several problems:- It is known that there were far more scenes shot than were actually included in the movie.  When you edit a movie for the theatre, you want to keep the running time down for two reasons: the longer the movie, the less tolerant of the running time the casual viewers will be, and the shorter the movie is, the more times a theatre can show it in a day.  HOWEVER, the type of people that purchase DVDs care more about the movie, and will be far more eager to see a longer cut of the movie.  In this spirit, I was sorely disappointed to find out that none of the deleted scenes would be integrated into the movie.  My rule of thumb is that if the scene was a good one but was just cut to shorten the movie for the theatre, it should be put back into the movie for the DVD (the rest should be included as bonus features).  I hope next year's disc has a more ""full"" movie, with scenes that don't make it into the theatre.  As a compromise for ""theatrical purists"", the DVD could be programmed so you can choose either the theatrical cut or director's cut (and example of this is ""Stargate: Special Edition"").- The lack of an audio commentary track was noticeable.  Practically all big movies these days have an alternate audio commentary track by the director, producer, crew, and even sometimes cast.  This is almost unforgivable.  A movie of this scope deserves one, and again, next year we should expect one.I would also like to comment on the DVD's features, or rather, lack thereof.  Put simply, for a movie of this magnitude and popularity, the disc construction falls woefully short.  To its credit, disc 1's menuing system is set up nicely -- clear, concise, and to the point.  Interesting but appropriately short animations make it easy to navigate through the DVD.  This is not the case with disc 2.  I can understand that to the movie's target viewers, all the ""games"" on the second disc might be appealing, but they get old VERY fast.  Whenever you have long animation sequences between menu pages, they are fun to watch the first time, but from that point on, they just get in the way of enjoying the REAL features of the DVD.  Disc 2 was the worst offender I have ever seen of this rule.  While the technical setup of the disc is impressive, it doesn't work in practice.  The single featurette and the deleted scenes were the highlights of the DVD, but you shouldn't EVER have to spend 15 minutes trying to get to a feature.  Here are some things the disc and menu should have done differently:- It should have clearly labeled menu choices that point directly to either a feature or a submenu of features.  Labeling with wizard terms only serves to confuse.- No feature should require the level of messing around that the deleted scenes required.  Instead, the game should have been a separate, independent feature.  Yes, I know you can skip this by directly entering title and track number, but having to take that route is really cheap.  The deleted scenes should have been set up as the interview was - through a single option on the main menu labeled as ""Deleted Scenes"".- The other main problem with disc 2 was the fact that it had so little content.  As mentioned earlier, the deleted scenes and interview featurette were the only major selling points of the DVD (the walkthrough wasn't bad, but it still wasn't that great).  There's just too much fluff.  Clicking on jellybeans just to hear the announcer make some stupid remark just doesn't cut it.  For the year 2 DVD, I expect far more content (making of special effects, blooper reels, more deleted scenes, storyboards, set and prop construction features, interviews with more of the cast and crew, etc.), and far less ""fluff features"".When it comes down to it, this 2-disc set IS worth purchasing for fans and casual viewers alike, but only because of the movie itself.  Don't expect much out of the second disc, aside from the two or three mentioned features).  Because of this, I take two stars from the rating."	3.0	Good movie, terrible DVD	2002-07-29	3	2	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	Before the movie came out I had heard a lot about Harry Potter, but didn't enter this entertaining universe until this movie had come out.  I got so much out of this movie and was impressed with its story and imagination tha I had all of the four books that were released at the time read within a month of seeing the movie.  One of the best movies I've seen in a VERY LONG TIME.So, why 4 stars?  The 4 stars is for the movie itself.  The fifth star is for the DVD.  I was really excited for the DVD to come out so I could watch the special features.  After reading the book, I had wanted to see the scenes that hadn't made it into the movie.  I STILL haven't found it and just got tired of all the stupid games it wanted me to go through just to get to them.  Buy this DVD for the excellent movie and picture/sound quality.  Don't buy it for the special features.  I was left very disappointed by them.

In Great Britain and everywhere else, it is titled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"".Running Time: 2 hours, 32 mins. Rated ""PG"". Released November 4, 2001.Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), Professor McGonnagall (Maggie Smith) and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) give a special baby (Saunders Triplets) to the Dursley's on their doorstep. The child's parent have died unexpectedly so he is given to his aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw).Eleven years later, the boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), is living under the stairs in a stairwell room. His aunt, his uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his young cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) are mean to him. Harry has special powers and is good of heart always. Harry receives a wax-sealed letter by special messenger, a white owl. His Uncle will not let him have it and burns it in the fireplace. In fact, all of Harry's letters have been burnt.Later that night, Harry is in the basement and a very tall and big man knocks down the door. It is Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) to save Harry. Hagrid wishes Harry a happy 11th birthday, gives him a present and tells him he is a wizard. He hands him an envelope. It is his invitation to the Hogwart's School of Witchery and Wizardry to become a student. Uncle Vernon will not let him go.It is Harry's choice to make and he decides to leave with Hagrid. Harry Potter finds it's easy to make friends at the grand school as he learns and studies more of his special powers and begins his first adventure in finding the red Sorcerer's Stone and coming in contact with his first opponent, He Who Must Not Be Named, ""Voldemort"" (Richard Bremmer).Very fine movie for children to watch. Has the same wonderful feeling as The Wizard Of Oz (1939) and I do not find this magical film objectionable in any way. However, some scenes may be scary for young children so I do suggest parental guidance.Also in the cast: Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, John Hurt, Julie Walters, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, Ian Hart, Zoe Wanamaker, Verne Troyer, Warwick Davis, James Phelps, Oliver Phelps, Bonnie Wright, Chris Rankin, Tom Felton, Ben Borowiecki, Harry Taylor, Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray, David Bradley, Jamie Waylett, Josh Herdman, Alfie Enouch, Eleanor Columbus, Sean Biggerstaff, Emily Date, Danielle Tabor, Luke Youngblood, Scot Fearn, David Holmes, Oliver Lavery-Farag, Amy Puglia.Geraldine Somerville plays ""Lily Potter"".

When the movie is over the seeds of witchcraft are planted into the mind of their child and a wicked life will result.  What evil goes in, will come out.  Repackaged witchcraft for children, that's all it is.  For example; many convicts in prison practice witchcraft with many wizard tatoos and demonic symbols.  There is no such thing as good witchcraft as this movie tries to portray.  The special effect is yet to be an unpleasant surprise upon the next generation having grown up with witchcraft firmly implanted and recognized as harmless fun.  The crime level is going to rise.  Just look at the evil spells the Harry Potter movie uses to propel the plot; drinking blood and other witchcraft evils.  Hardly innocent and harmless!  Is this what you want your children to watch?

Truly a very good adaptation of the novel (for my money, a little too true to the book).The DVD brings Harry Potter home, and while the transfer is very good (I bought, and can only recommend, the widescreen version), I found the second disc frustrating. I still haven't reached the hidden deleted scenes, and their just isn't enough stuff for movie buffs or, for that matter, grown up fans of the books.Even my son, who was so caught up in the movie in the theatre, doesn't seem to have the patience or desire to wade through all this.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2UUGDB77KKGAZ	Jamie	I am a sixteen year old girl and in my opinion, the movie was good but it was not fully true to the book.  I went to see the movie two days after it appeared in the theater with some fellow fans and we saw everything that was not there and that was changed.  We noticed that there were some characters that were missing from the movie.  also, neville longbottom was supposed to be in detention with Harry potter, fang, Hagrid, hermione and malFoy.For the most part, the movie held true to the book but for the minor mistakes, I think j.K Rowling could have done something to help.  after all, she is very talented and I admire her for what she writes and the fact that she struggled before she became famous.  Keep writing Rowling and if possible, will there be another book after all seven just to explain what harry does after his years at hogwarts?

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2RQZG0FUSSMPJ	Jamy Shaffer	"I find it hard to believe that so many people are so quick to judge and condemn the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.  Upon emerging as a book (not just for kids but for the kid in all of us), it got children to turn off their video games and READ!!!  It was amazing that a children's book would hold the best seller lists for months.  Public schools as well as Colleges around the country have added the entire series to their curricula.  Most nay-sayers would point that the stories teach about and glorify witchcraft and wizardry.  May I point to a classic which was written a century ago and made into a movie that has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time????  The Wizard of Oz is all about a fantastic land full of witches, wizards, and other strange magical qualities....Another example was written over 50 years ago by a devout Christian.  C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" contains as much magic, witches, and other strange phenomena as Harry Potter.  People are so quick to judge and condemn that they are too blind to see what lies at the heart of the work.As for the movie itself, it is amazing how faithful it is to Rowling's first novel.  The acting is phenomenal especially among the three children (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson).  Miss Watson is so bossy and perfect that I actually believed that she was Hermione.  The supporting cast is full of British acting royalty.  Maggie Smith is fantastic as Pro McGonagall.  Richard Harris is wise and learned as Dumbledore.  Robbie Coltrane is hillarious as the gentle, often muddled Hagrid.I absolutely loved the Quidditch match.  The whole movie just zipped along almost making me forget that it is over 2 and a half hours longNow for the heart of the matter.  At the conclusion of the movie, Ron and Hermione are both awarded for standing along side of their friend in the face of danger.  Harry himself is awarded for ultimate bravery and courage.  Even poor Neville Longbottom is awarded for standing up to his friends when what they are doing is against the rules because it is dangerous.  Is this not what people wish small chiildren to carry with them?  It is a shame that anyone would wish to condemn this wonderful cultural phenomenon.  Bravo to Ms. Rowling who created this wondeful world in an attempt to provide a better life for her children as a single mother!!!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2MIE6AV97MQTE	J. Anderson	First off I want to say that I did enjoy this movie.  I saw it in the movie theater the week it came out and I now own the DVD.  I am a big fan of this series of books, and the movie takes the first book (which is probably going to be the hardest to make a movie) and did it very well.  This movie VERY easily could have put out some complete rubbish or horrid cartoon and relied on its built in audience, but the makers of this film instead went out and made a very good (not great) movie and stuck to the story in the book quite well.However, the movie did have one flaw in my mind that really brings down the quality of the movie.  The story between Malfoy & Harry is barely told, I know that certain things end up not making it into a movie because of length, but I was surprised that they did SO little to build the primary theme of the series in the battle between Malfoy & Harry.  At the very least they could have added in the bit about the Wizards Duel, and adding a few more lines in a couple of places to give Harry good reason for his animosity for Malfoy.  Honestly in the hat scene Harry barely has any reason to not want to join the same house as Malfoy because they did almost nothing to build up his character by that point.Overall, this is a good movie based on a very good book.  The quality of the movie especially considering it was the first really has me looking forward to the other movies based on the series to come.  You can tell allot of effort was put into bringing the book to this media, and the attention to detail pays off in a very entertaining movie worth seeing.  You do not need to be a child to enjoy this tale, if you havn't seen it yet go out and buy it or rent it today.  You won't be sorry.	4.0	Good Movie Better Book	2002-06-05	1	1	0

I had refused to read the books and watch the movie until my mom became hooked on the books.  Then, I gave in...and now I'm glad I did.This movie is a spectacular ride through a young wizard's (Harry) introduction to the magic that was always in his blood.  He and his friends go on an adventurous journey to stop the madman who killed Harry's parents, and show that they are all brave, true, and loyal.The special effects are incredible.  Of course, sometimes, you can tell that they're using animitronics instead of the actors.

Two days later I bought it on VHS and have since watched it over five times.

I havent read the books yet but I know Ill eventually get to reading them. Its a fantastic movie for all ages, Im 20 years old and Ill probably watch it a dozen times more.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	Throughout the course of this look back at the first Harry Potter installment I will refer to what is commonly known in America as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by its original British name, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. J.K. Rowling herself has stated that if she had more clout with the publishers at the time of the initial US book release it would have retained its original name.For movie-goers, it all started on 11/16/2001. And what a start it was! Easily the most anticipated movie of the year, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone even outgrossed the first installment of another highly anticipated film series that debuted a little over a month later: Lord of the Rings - Fellowship of the Ring.* Even with five extremely successful sequels, at $975 million in worldwide grosses Philosopher's Stone still remains the highest grossing Potter film to date.Philosopher's Stone is a great introduction to the series for newbies not familiar with the books (that's how I was introduced to the phenomenon), as well as for anyone who enjoys the books and was, or is, just getting around to the movies. Rowling gave filmmakers a great blueprint for introducing the audience to a world completely unfamiliar to them by making the series' namesake a newcomer to the underground magical world as well. This choice allows the viewer to see things through Harry's eyes, and in turn feel empathy for him as well.Another reason this film works so well is the cast. While the film features then-unknown actors in the children's roles, the adult parts are played by British stage and film veterans. I would imagine that, for the children on set, this film had to feel like a crash course in acting school. Here you had Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber, anyone?), Dame Maggie Smith (Othello, Richard III), Robbie Coltrane (GoldenEye, From Hell), John Hurt (Alien, The Elephant Man), and Richard Harris (Gladiator, Unforgiven) all gathered on one set. While I'm sure these veteran thespians assisted the little ones in learning the art of acting, they also lent the film a level of gravitas that wouldn't have been felt otherwise.While Philosopher's Stone works great as a gateway drug into the Harry Potter universe, it doesn't hold up as well as future installments on multiple viewings. I think this has a lot to do with its slavish devotion to every word of the book. While this is admirable, later installments have shown that you can remain faithful to the spirit of the books while taking some liberties with the source material. I also feel as though Chris Columbus has a tendency to make films for focus groups, giving the film a much more polished sheen than it could have had when converting Rowling's pages to celluloid.This can really be seen in how lavishly sterile the set designs are in this film. Hogwarts looks more like a museum than a school inhabited by boarding school kids, the grounds look flat and clean, and the Forbidden Forest looks appropriately spooky but lacks the dread we get when we read the book. Each time I rewatch this movie, I feel as though some of the soul was sucked out of the book to give us something closer to what Disney would have made of the series. Of course, given some of the dark themes approached within the pages of this debut novel it can only be expected that there would initially be some attempt to lighten the mood a little.Overall, Philosopher's Stone is still a great beginning to a brilliant series. One thing that's remarkable in this film is how the actors, even the more inexperienced younger ones, really bring their characters to life. The production team did a great job of trying to bring the life of the books to the screen, even though they do refine some of the bite out of it.	3.0	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone	2010-11-24	6	2	4

I have seen some reviews to where I thought I was reading a Movie Critic column out of the New York Times. Don't over analyze this movie. It is a based on the Harry Potter book series that is intended for children, but has an appeasement for adults as well. The reason why I gave this five stars is simple: it is a family movie that has no profanity, sexual suggestions, or nuditiy.The purpose of this review is to give an honest assessment of the DVD and if it is worth the money. In my opinion the answer is ""Yes.""

This is a wonderfully magical movie with just the right combination of movie elements. The characters are real, the storyline (while adapted from the book) is solid and everything flows so well that you forget it's a two hour movie. Even the special effects worked for the movie instead of being over the top. Watching the movie, I giggled and smiled and felt as if I was 5 again.My only complaint on this DVD set is that I own a Macintosh and the PC-DVD specials are NOT compatible with Mac drives. Actually, this set includes ""bonus footage"" that is no where to be seen on either disc when loaded into the drives. I presume it's part of the PC-DVD section.

The story didn't seem to go anywhere or interest me at all.  It seems as though there are large sections of the move where the characters forget about the plot (you have to kind of come up with one for them) and just wander around aimlessly.  You could have told the same story in a 21 minute tv show, but instead you end up with loooong drawn out scenes that go nowhere and do not contribute to the story whatsoever.  In short:Harry is an abused little boy that gets trust into the magical drivers seat.  He goes to magician's school.  He is the chosen one (who cares?) but doesn't seem to do anything that proves this.  There is a stone that they need to save from some evil guy, but they stray down long boring sequences that only seem to prove that the famed Harry can't do magic after all and always relys on his friends that do to bail him out.  They drive the chosen one thing into your head a few more times, then Harry saves the day without realy doing anything....	1.0	What was the point?	2002-03-15	12	3	9

This review is for the Amazon streaming video service for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I am streaming from my PS3 to a 1080p 50"" plasma tv for our family movie night.  Usually I love deep blacks, but the digital streaming version that Amazon is currently offering is WAY too dark.  The entire opening scene along with several other were so dark that as our family watched, we couldn't even see what was happening - Dumbledor [sp?] dropping Harry off as baby - Hagrid at lighthouse - any and all night scenes - forest scenes.  Understandably the streaming ""HD"" is nowhere near blu-ray, and for this price don't expect it.All in all, Amazon needs to invest in a new version of this movie to stream that doesn't have such a dark playback.  Should a ""lighter"" version become available for streaming I would gladly adjust my review and give 4 stars.  5 stars if they can get ""HD"" a bit closer to the blu-ray experience.

The acting, writing, and storyline itself were sad, pedantic, and formulaic. It is filled with deus ex machina's, including two pivotal points at the end. Without (the character) Harry Potter, there wouldn't even be a problem at the end to resolve! Most of the film is filled with the daily life of the school, and one keeps on an enduring wait for a real plot. You won't be disappointed- the plot does begin to develop in the last 1/2 hour of the movie.Now having seen the movie, I can finally understand all the concern with the magic in this story. It *is* qualitatively different from Tolkien or Lewis, on two counts. Firstly, magic is the point of the story, and the constant point. InLewisandTolkien, magic is only a plot device that helps the real point of the story along. Here, one can't get away from it. Secondly, the magic is qualitatively different. This isn't Gandalf raising a staff and a burst of light appearing, or Aslan speaking of the deeper magic from beyond the dawn of time as he comes back to life after being slain on a stone slab. The magic presented in Harry Potter is the type that is actually practiced, or attempted- crystal balls, spells, potions, and the like. The emphasis in Potter is on the ""how-to"" of magic- how to actually make things happen. And while it is unlikely that someone could copy spells in the movie to get results, I could easily see where seeing or reading this could get them started on the road to other forms, such as the ouija board or ""light as a feather"". There are far worse things for children out there (Nightmare,Chucky, etc.), but this isn't one of the best either."	2.0	Harry ain't Aslan, or Gandalf.	2001-12-30	4	0	4

I pulled "" The Sorcerer's Stone"" from my collection, and this dvd is the 2 disc widescreen edition.With over 1800 reviews already, I will not rehash the plot.Besides watching the movie, I watched most of the extra's on the dvd.  On the first disc is the movie, plus a cast/crew section.  I thought I would get a more thorough bio on the main stars, but it was a basic ""Professor Snape: Alan Rickman"".  I would have liked so see a bio with the movies the main actors had been in previously.  Rickman and Coltrane were so good as Snape and Hagrid, that I wanted to catch them in some other movies. Oh well.  There was also a teaser trailer and a theatre trailer.The second disc had most of the extra's.  I enjoyed the tour of the Hogwart's Mansion, but wish they would have showed more.  I also enjoyed the conversation with the production staff about bringing the movie to life from the book.  The 2nd disc is very interactive, and each section has many subsections.  Very cool!The movie was awesome both visually, character-wise, and plot wise.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A9YMCVU421UXA	jenmcdan13	LOVE the Harry Potter series. Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a &#34;young adult/kid&#34; series... just stop.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AQ96EWPGZ1SFI	Jennie	Because this movie was made while the book was still being widely read, it had to stay true to the original. Where the special effects were amazing, it stayed true to the original to a T and failed to add anything to the story.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AWA0CA9AYL5YQ	Jennifer Litchfield	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (bizarrely the Philosopher has transfigured himself into a Sorcerer in the USA) is a children's movie with a difference. Thanks to the creative genius of J. K. Rowling, the judicious use of some excellent British actors, and an enormous budget, this is a film that treats its young viewers with respect. Instead of the usual schmaltzy children's fare, Harry Potter (notwithstanding a few minor aberrations) thankfully doesn't descend into the saccharine. On the contrary, it is a highly original and very entertaining trip into the hitherto infrequently visited realm of magic.To the many readers of the Harry Potter series of novels, the storyline will come as no surprise and the movie is very faithful to the book. Despite prior knowledge of the plot nullifying the film's suspense somewhat, the mise-en-scene created is a veritable visual feast. The extensive use of computer animation is largely superb - the first trip across the lake to Hogwarts is awe-inspiring, Quidditch is excitingly brought to life, and the three-headed dog is certainly as scary as Rowling could have wished - although there are occasional clunky effects, such as the entrance to Diagon Alley. The makeup too is outstanding, as evidenced by the alarmingly real goblin bankers at Gringotts.Despite the movie's 2  hour length, it is relatively pacy as it follows Harry's discovery of the magician within himself, and his deadly duel with the greatest dark wizard of all time. Together with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione he battles mountain trolls, bewitched broomsticks, and a brutal but visually stunning game of wizard's chess. After all this excitement, the final showdown with the evil Voldemort is almost anti-climactic. Nevertheless, overall this is a spellbinding movie - in more ways than one.	4.0	"""Are you doing magic?

I think this movie would insult the intelligence of a fetus.  They must have said the name ""Harry Potter"" with awe and reverence 6,000 times in this movie.

Harry Potter Ultimate editions 3,4,5, and 6 do not have an extended cut of the movie, we know the extended cuts do exist because ABC Family Shows them, but it is hard to edit the commercials, what I want to know is why would the WB would promise to release the extended cuts and then turn around and re-release the theatrical cut. so do not buy Harry Potter Ultimate Editions 3,4,5 and 6	5.0	True Ultimate Edittion	2011-07-09	4	3	1

At some stage Harry is given an 'invisibility cloak' left to him by his deceased parents. Soon after he has to hide from the badies. The invisibility cloak would have come in handy there but he appears to forget all about it. My five-year old son commented: why is he not hiding under the magic coat? When flaws are spotted by five-year olds, then there must be something wrong. In this Harry Potter madness are we losing our sense of criticism?	2.0	Magical but also disappointing	2004-12-29	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2OVJ5O4MQ0XE0	Jess	"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)Movie Review - *** (out of *****)One of the greatest fantasy achievements of recent years came to screen in 2001... with less than spectacular results.  The problem isn't the story.  No, J. K. Rowling's stories (both individually and as a whole) definitely pull their weight.  The problem lies in the poor directing, editing, and screenwriting.  It is very obvious that those involved in this project were determined to create a classic.  The problem is, they don't seem to know what makes a good film.  They simply went through the book page-by-page and put it to screen and trying not to make it too long.Ironically, that is just what it is.  No, it isn't three hours long, but two and a half hours is pretty darn close, especially considering that Lord of the Rings, a book more than twice the size of Potter #1, only needed an extra half hour-and people complained about them being too long!  The pace of this movie is plan obnoxious at times.  Its unbelievable that Columus and crew actually filmed the original cut at four hours and trimmed it to this length-that's poor screenwriting right there.Let me bring your attention to one section of the movie that must have taken at least 20 minutes of screen time (or at least felt like it).  Harry and Co. go to Hagrid's hut to talk about the Sorcerer's Stone.  OK, that might be acceptable.  Here's where things go haywire.  Hagrid's hatching a dragon.  During the hatching, Hagrid notices Draco Malfoy looking in on the hatching.  This leads to a scene where Hagrid leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione through detention with Malfoy in the Forbidden Forest.  There, Harry sees a cloaked man drinking unicorn's blood-But wait!  A centaur named Firenze chases the man away and tells Harry that it is Lord Voldemort, who wants the Stone from Hogwarts.  Later, Harry discusses this with Ron and Hermione, and they come to the conclusion that Snape is not after the stone for himself, but for Voldemort.See why this goes wrong?  Let me give you a hint:  none of it is necessary! OK, so that is a little more than a hint, but the point remains.  The revelation that the Stone was being stolen for Voldemort could have been saved for the end of the movie, and it would have been effective and smart screenwriting!  As for Firenze-what does he amount to?  Nothing!  Oh, sure, argue that he's in ""Order of the Phoenix.""  The problem?  He doesn't amount to anything important in ""Order,"" either!  His character could very well have been cut out with no consequence to the story!  The movie could have been effectively trimmed from 150 minutes to 130 minutes!  Viola!Another problem is the sentimentality.  There simply is no sincere, genuine emotion in this film.  The Mirror of Erised scene, the climactic chess scene where Ron makes his sacrifice, and the ending hospital scene where Harry first learns of the power of love-all of those emotions which were subtle and touching in the novels are reduced to melodrama and mere sentimentality.  It is an opportunity missed... but ah, oh well.But as you can see from the rating, this still is not a bad movie.  I still enjoyed it enough to give it a positive rating, but only a little.  This could have all gone under if it weren't for the obvious rising talents of the kids, the wonderful performances by the adult actors (especially Alan Rickman as Severus Snape), and the splendid visuals.  With a little more understanding of the differences between movies and books on the part of the production team, it could have been truly great."	3.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	2005-11-21	8	3	5

Anyone who says it isn't really hasn't seen it! But disk 2 might be something you want to read about before getting involved in all the searching your going to be doing to find the deleted scenes, which is a shame. I don't know why they don't just add these scenes right into the DVD movie and see where they belong. Anyway, if your over 10 this 2nd DVD will drive you NUTS!!! You have to search for the S. Stone! You have to go to one place buy a wand, then go to another section and find where to look to get to the stone, and you can't do any of this without buying a wand. Oh and don't forget to go to the bank and get your money, but wait first you have to find the key!! UUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!! The whole thing was a waste of time! And myself being 3,9 I don't want to play a video game you know I just want to watch the movie and see the missing 7 scenes. It's a crime after all WE put these books on the NY Times bestseller list, WE made the movie #1, and WB should have had more respect for the Adults that don't have time..nor waste it playing a video game to get to see these scenes. If I wanted to play a viedo game I would go out and but the Harry Potter Game..HELLO WB ANYBODY HOME!!! If you want to build a kids gamne do it, but not on a DVD that most people don't wanrt to deal with. Alot of work went into this disk, and alot of cool stuff on it, but not for adults more for kids.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2URYP606SALEU	Jim Mann	"There is a scene in the movie Galaxy Quest where Sigourey Weaver and Tim Allen have to make their way through an overcomplicated deadly maze of moving traps. Weaver shouts out something along the lines of, ""This is stupid. The writer of this should die.""  That's how I felt about the designer of the Harry Potter DVD as I stepped through the 18 steps required to get to the deleted scenes.Perhaps Warner Brothers thought it clever to have the kids have to play a game to get to the extra scenes. Maybe kids do enjoy this. But they should have had a fast path for adults who have no desire at all to play the silly game but just want to get to the deleted scenes.Don't let this detract from the movie though. It's a wonderful film, that does a superb job capturing the feel of the book and transfering it faithfully to the screen -- no easy task, given the millions of kids who would have complained about even minor differences in the ways they pictured the characters looking and acting.So, do watch the film.  But if you buy the DVD, go to the Warner site and download the FAQ on how to get to the deleted scenes.

It delights us, it amazes us, and it even frightens us ... but as entertainment it satisfies us.There has been a lot of complaints from Christians that this movie is anti-religious because it glorifies sorcery and black magic.  I don't agree with that at all.  In fact, you can see some of the Christ story in Harry Potter ... his humble beginnings in a ""muggle"" family, his name being known before his arrival on the scene, the great destiny he is to fulfill, his battle with an evil spirit (that pierces him), and so on.  Plus, this Harry Potter story has done more to get kids to read than any other one thing has ever before done.  And it is fun ... Harry Potter is fun.But this movie's quality is very high.  From the script, to the casting, to the directing and acting and special effects ... it gets A+ all around.I love the imaginative little things that were added here and there to fill out the story ... the sorting hat, the shifting staircases, the live paintings and newspaper photos, the cloak of invisibility, the goblins and the bank, and the wand shop and it's proprietor (which is my favorite) ... all of these things are there for us to delight in.But this is an excellent movie ... one that appeals to children and adults alike ... a classic tale of good versus evil that is interesting, involving, and most of all ... fun."	5.0	Excellent Movie	2005-04-13	4	4	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3A8EDNNXIG6X4	Joan Campion	"In the last analysis, there is only one real plot: the clash between good and evil. Harry Potter and his friends  bring this fact home to us, and remind us that everyone, of every age, is caught up in the conflict.For this reviewer, it took the film ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to make a connection  with the Potter phenomenon. I had read the book;  and while I was impressed by author J.K. Rowling's achievement in getting children to read I was only mildly impressed by the work itself. Then one day I was able to pop the movie into a vcr and magic happened.  And you can never get enough magic.(By the way, on a radio program not long ago I heard a film director describe the Harry Potter films as totally lacking in magic. People certainly are entitled to their opinions; but in this case I believe some sour grapes might well have been involved. After all, the man didn't get to direct either of the Potter films that have been issued to date.)I call numerous things about ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" magical. Not least is Daniel Radcliffe's perfornance as Harry. He is a very charismatic young actor, and it is hard to take your eyes off him. He combines an appealing sweetness with the toughness necessary to survive for a time when the Forces of Evil have a deep personal grudge against you.I would be very happy to recommend this film to anyone. Especially to children who can learn a great deal about the world through this well-crafted and entertaining story."	5.0	You Can Never Get Enough Magic	2003-03-22	3	3	0

It's imagination is brought to life by director Chris Colombus.  He does a splendid job in directing the children, as he does in all his movies.  The story takes a real twist at the end, as all novel readers know, but the film itself is appreciateable in it's humor that is given off by the great child actors.The child acting, at some points, only falls down to decent, but most of the time is terriffic.  The visuals tend to lack at points, the troll, who is supposed to be about five tons, looks weightless because it's computer generated imagery doesn't seem completed.  I believe visual effects teams will improve that in the future though.Of course, John Williams blows us away with his Oscar nominated score and left people of all ages humming the theme as they left the theater.  It was memorable and me and my friends counted how many times we got chills in the theater just from the exciting score.It's an exciting movie, full of suprises, absolutely great acting, and one to be considered an all-time classic.  It lives up to the book and I sometimes find it scary how the artists of this film managed to depict the characters exactly how I imagined them when I read the book.  It is overwhelming how they truly bring J.K. Rowling's vision to life.  And, I have seen the poster for Chamber of Secrets, and Dobby is exactly the way I imagined him.  These artists freak me, but I love them for it.  Splendid job, great film, definetly see it if you haven't.  And don't bother renting it, just buy it, cause it's worth every penny.	5.0	What an event!	2002-07-09	2	1	1

Chris Columbus stayed true to the book and gave us a clean, golden image of Hogwarts and the rest of Harry's new found world of magic.  (From the third film on the image is old, in ruins, dark, dirty and untidy and far from the actual books.  How can the 7th book be filmed when everything and everyone important to the plot and ending has been left out?)

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1ZHHTDET5MTMC	Jody Davies	This is one of the best movies for kids and adults I have seen in a long time. It has lots of magic, some intrigue that kids can keep up with, honor and sticking by your friends lessons that both kids and adults can learn from these days. The cast is excellent and the kids, Harry, Weasley, and Herminoe just hit it off and meld together.The Quiddish match is fun to watch and exciting. Makes you wonder how they did it so well. The extras that come with the dvd are fun too. I even sent a Harry Potter greeting to someone and it made them smile for the day!You really can't go wrong with this movie, it's fun, and if you read the books,you know what's coming, but its fun anyway.

I love the whole series of books and movies, but I feel that the imagery produced by Columbus gives that added element of reality and growth of characters. Anyone that has not seen the film yet should definitly get this as soon as they can. A family film that runs over 2 hours you can be assured wil get most of the book details into it and acurate. This is no exception. I love this movie and so will you.	5.0	The best director of the series	2009-03-28	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2U3UB8WNGXBZP	Joe Schultz	There is really only one reason I didn't give this film 5 stars: the fast pace of the movie. It jumped around too much. I did like everything else though. I loved the quidditch scene, ( EVEN THOUGH BILL MURPHY SAYS IT WAS A SNOOZE-FEST) it was great. Sorry Bill Murphy but sometimes things aren't always how YOU pictured them, or how some Dale so-n-so tells it. Maybe You guys are wrong and, hey, everyone else on earth is right.Anyway, my being a fan of Harry Potter has in no way hindered my review. It was a good movie. Not great, but good. It told the story of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone and cut out nothing that is important. (Sorry, but Peeves wasn't that important). I was very pleased to see that they left the snake scene in because it has importance to the next film.All in all, good film, do not hesitate to buy it (Cause it's gonna go fast) and enjoy it. I heard there are lots of special features, so if the movie doesn't satisfy you, just play around a bit.Buy it.	4.0	Harry Potter hardly misses.	2002-05-27	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	A film by Chris ColumbusThis is the first film in the Harry Potter series and it is adapted from J.K. Rowling's novel of the same title.  A common complaint about movies that have been adapted from a book is that the movie strays too far from the book and that it makes too many changes.  This is sometimes necessary as film and novels are two different mediums and need to tell stories in different ways, but sometimes unnecessary changes are made.  Happily, this is not the case with this movie.  This movie is extremely faithful to the book, and I think the film works because of that.By now, many people probably have a good idea what Harry Potter is all about.  For those who are not in the know, here's the story for this movie.  Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his aunt and his uncle because his parents died when he was an infant.  It is obvious they do not want him around as he is forced to live in the closet under the stairs and he is treated like a servant, an unwelcome servant at that.  One day owls start arriving at the house and deliver letters to Harry.  We see that the letters are from &quot;Hogwarts.&quot;  Harry's uncle keeps destroying the letters, but more come each day.  Finally he has had enough and Harry's Uncle takes the family (including Harry) to a remote island where no letters can reach them.  It is at this point that Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) finds Harry, tells him that Harry is a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  See, Harry is a wizard, and is the son of a wizard.  Harry's parents were not killed in a car accident (as he had been told), but rather they were killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort, a wizard gone bad.  Harry is the boy who lived, which is why he is famous in the wizarding world.At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and makes an enemy of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Ron and Hermione are also first year students and are in Gryffindor House with Harry.  Draco is also a first year, but is in Slytherin House (Ron tells Harry that &quot;not a wizard went bad that wasn't in Slytherin&quot;).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become good friends and get into little adventures together.  They believe that someone is trying to steal something called the Sorcerer's Stone and since no adult will believe them, they try to figure this out on their own.  At the same time, they are in the first year of school, so they have to go to their classes in magic.  A little bit of time is spent in each class so that we get a sense of the school and a sense of the magic of that Harry and friends are supposed to be learning.The movie is very faithful to the book, so most events from the book are included in this movie and while it is a fairly long movie (2 and a half hours), it moves along fast enough that you don't really feel like you've spent so much time.  One of the reasons you don't feel the time is that the acting is fantastic.  The actors are so perfect for their roles that they are almost exactly how I imagined the characters to be.  Two actors who stand out are Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.  Rickman, especially, is a delight to watch.  This role border's on Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) as one of his great characters.  The movie also features Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) and Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick).Even though I would recommend the book to anyone, I'm not convinced the movie is for everyone.  I thought that the movie captured the events and the spirit of the book, but is missing some of the charm.  Rowling's novel just sucks you in, but at times I thought the movie was only for fans of the book.  I really enjoyed the movie, and I will give it a good rating, but it may not convert people who don't really enjoy fantasy (or movies that have fantasy elements).	4.0	very good movie, but lacks some of the charm of the book	2003-11-25	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AZXUFTJVXJWL0	John Dynan	Though by no means the only example of the subject, Joanne Rowling's imaginative book about an eleven year old boy discovering his new-found talent for magic, reintroduced the age-old genre of the fairy story to modern children. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; benefits enormously from modern CGI effects to bring to life a film which will entertain everyone. The basic story concerns an orphaned boy living with his appalling cousins who are determined that he should not find out that he was actually born a wizard. Through outside help from the magical community, he finds himself enrolled at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the fun starts.Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman help to back up the principal child stars and give this film some real presence. Daniel Radcliffe is rather flat as Harry Potter and Emma Watson, as the precocious Hermione Granger, is excessively theatrical and both are shaded by Rupert Grint who is excellent in the role of their cynical friend, Ron Weazley. No doubt all the child actors will improve with time, given that they stay with the series. At the moment they are still finding their feet.There are plenty of special effects to amaze and amuse and I can't imagine how such a film could have been made without them. The cinematography by John Seale, ACS, is excellent and the whole film has a very pleasing look. The two-disc DVD set has many extras, some of which seem to require an intimate knowledge of magic to access.On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I wait with baited breath for the sequels. It is not a five star film; I did not expect it to be, but it certainly rates considerable merit. I have yet to figure out why WB chose to release it as anything other than &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;, since that is both the title of the original book and the title of the film in any other market than the US. Apart from a few little blemishes, an excellent movie. Kids will give it five stars; parents will enjoy it, too. Thoroughly recommended.	4.0	I didn't want it to end!	2002-08-14	11	9	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3A48XEYWLWH7T	John IV	An 11 year old boy living a banal existence, kept in a cupboard under the stairs by nasty step-caregivers [calling to mind a bit of James and the Giant Peach], learns he is actually the son of accomplished wizards.  Traveling to a mystical academy in a pseudo-parallel universe he meets friends, has adventures, and saves the day [Willy Wonka redux?].  Based on the line of successful books, the movie was a nice albeit condensed introduction to the Potter mythos.  I felt it was lively, with some great performances by seminal figures in British film/stage. Some of the CG effects were a bit unpolished, like the giant troll or the three headed dog, but they were more than made up for in the sprawling set designs and clever scenery.  The hunting around in dank dark attics, or dungeons called to mind the exploring, treasure hunting `Goonies'. Targeted towards the younger set, it still made for a nice viewing.  Wide-screen version, recommended.	4.0	Entertaining Intro to the Potter Mythos	2002-08-05	3	2	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AKT8TGIT6VVZ5	John Kwok	"Chris Columbus's fine adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", should appeal not only to diehard fans of J. K. Rowling's novels, but anyone interested in a fun fantasy film for the entire family. I did not see this film when it was released theatrically, nor have I read the novels, so it was truly a pleasant surprise watching it finally. I recommend the film primarily for excellent acting from the likes of Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman, to name but a few of the distinguished British and Irish actors within the cast. But I was also quite impressed with the splendid chemistry among Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), the young heroes of the Harry Potter saga. Robbie Coltrane nearly steals ever scene he appears as Harry's protector, Hagrid. Although this doesn't quite reach the cinematic heights scaled by Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it is without question a splendid film to be enjoyed by the entire family."	5.0	Fine Family Fantasy Film	2004-11-14	4	3	1

But when a friendly large man named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) brings him an important message that he is a wizard born of extraordinary magical powers, he heads into the world of wizards and witches where anything magical is possible for he is assigned to head to the legendary Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy made by headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris). Along the way on his first year at the school he befriends Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grin) and feisty Heromine Granger (Emma Watson) including a new foe named Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) but there is some hidden secrets that are unknown to all students known as The Sorcerer's stone which has great powers, now Harry Potter must find out the mysteries of his past including why his parent died.A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the book! this family fantasy adventure co-stars John Cleese, John Hurt, Warwick Davis, Maggie Smith (""Clash of the Titans"") and Alan Rickman as cruel Professor Snape. Here an awesome new fantasy franchise is born thanks to great reviews and strong box-office reception including crowd-pleasing stuff, here is a movie that proves that kids could act and what great acting choices they had. The special Effects by The Jim Henson Creature Shop and Industrial Light and Magic are fantastic but the storyline is what really matters here for it's complex yet a bit simple at times, it was followed by even better sequels.This DVD has beautiful picture and sound that only an HP fan like myself would love as it's very theatrical quality.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2HVFBVT0X1IP1	Jonah Cohen	I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. I've read all the books, looking forward to #5. I was hoping the movie of Sorceror's Stone would be good, but sadly, it wasn't. It had its good points, but overall it was disappointing. I don't say that just because it wasn't as good as the book, or because it came out at the same time as a truly great movie adaptation of a similar book (The Fellowship of the Ring), but because it had serious flaws.First, the good stuff: This movie looked great. Nice cinematography and art direction. Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were perfect. A few of the special effects were good - Fluffy the dog, the chess board, the flying in Quiditich. There were a few - too few - quiet moments that really resonated: Harry sitting and staring at the Mirror of Erised, the huge flock of owls outside the Dursley house. Daniel Radcliffe got the right mix of heroism and ordinariness for Harry, the actors playing Snape, Hagrid + McGonnagall were spot on. A few actors with minor roles (Malfoy, Filch, Wood, Olivander) hammed it up admirably.That being said, there were big things wrong. The kid who played Ron had one befuddled expression that he flashed in every scene. Richard Harris was as wooden as a broomstick as Dumbledore. A few effects, like the invisibility cloak, were clumsy. But that's minor stuff. The biggest problem is that the movie was poorly plotted and poorly adapted from the book.It feels like they selected random scenes and dialogue and filmed them, not like they were trying to tell an actual story. Examples:Haul out your copy of Book 1 and reread the chapter on the train. In one chapter, Rowling firmly establishes that Harry and Ron have gone from strangers to best buddies, Hermione's irksome bossiness, and Neville's patheticness. Nothing even remotely like that happens in the movie. For all the times they mention Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, you'd think it was a real product that was paying for onscreen product placement. I could have done with less about the beans, more about character development.When Quirrell takes off the turban, that should be the big climax, but the movie has done next to nothing to demonstrate that Voldemort is the big bad guy, everyone fears him etc. No one trembles when Harry speaks the name aloud. No mention of why Snape hates Harry, making him seem like a clumsy red herring in the movie (instead of, arguably, the most complex character in the books). Neville coming through at the end has no impact, because the movie hasn't established what a hard-luck case he is.I could go on, but basically, all too much about the movie would make no sense and have no impact if you hadn't read the book.It also doesn't help that the navigation of many features on the DVD is set up like a clumsy video game.Here's hoping the more plot-driven Chamber of Secrets makes for a better film #2.	2.0	I wish it had been better	2002-06-30	21	9	12
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3L38AZQUJP7XR	Jon Almada	I have always enjoyed classics and own the entire series of books by J.K.Rowling - I know of the difficulties that one can encounter when taking a popular book or series and to convert that into a movie and my take on this movie is that an absolutely exceptional job was done on the special effects and storyline throughout throughout the movie.The Quidditch match, the battle with the troll, and the wonderful scenes of the Hogwarts hall, complete with floating candles, were such marvels. These beautiful sequences were faithful to the book and were representive of the state of the art of CG animation.Yes, certain parts of the book were skimmed over and some would say that some of the character developments were not followed well enough, but most of the people who saw the movie knew the plot and were repeat readers of the book series. I was very pleased with the movie interpetation and consider it an instant classic. The DVD will most likely carry within it extra scenes and in depth coverage of the making of the movie and I just see this as icing on an already substantial and wonderful world that Ms. Rowling has given to the world.Speaking of the characters, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, and especially Professor Snapes were played to perfection by the actors and they matched my visions of them from the books.My recommendation is very clear: Get the CD and watch it often. Read the books to keep the story details clear and then pass these wonderful treasures on to your children and nieces and nephews. This is an lovely and charming series and the movie does the first book justice. I can't wait for the next book and the next movie...

I'm writing this review to give a fast way to find the deleted scenes but you must have the SEARCH function on your DVD player. Go to track 80(80/84) of the second DVD with the SEARCH function. Then, select the 5 th bottle and the stone. That way, you can see the deleted scenes without playing the whole game each time. There is only 6 minutes of deleted scenes on the DVD. Not 10 minutes like I read on the HP website. The deleted scenes are interesting but hardly essential and you can find them as well on the video.	4.0	Deleted scenes	2002-05-27	24	21	3

Few things were left out of the book and I thought the casting was all dead on.The movie part of the DVD is spectacular.  Great crisp video and audio.  The only complaint I have is that the special features on the DVD are for kids only.  I didn't get any real enjoyment out of them, but I guess being 26 years old I wasn't the target audience and it's only a minor inconvience.Would have absolutely loved a commentary with the actors that played Harry, Ron and Hemione but still the DVD was a great value.	4.0	Great movie.	2002-09-19	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1MK79R1KOTJ0	Jon	This is partly a response for the review about &quot;Good For Kids???&quot;  This movie and series of books is about imagination, expanding people (and kids) minds about lives different from their own.  By not allowing kids to see a movie like this is cheating them.  The world is not sugar coated and in these times, tolerance of those different from us is even more important.  Good parents would allow their children to see other points of view than their own (obviously within limits), so that they can raise well-rounded children with open minds.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AWHLCGP5WW5AU	Jordyn	This movie was totally awesome. Yes, it did miss out on some things on the book that we all would have liked to see more of, more Quidditch for example, but it was pretty well done. The special effects were cool, and the acting for most characters was great. It made the story come to life even more, and for those that don't like to read, you just have to see the movie. The characters were chosen perfectly, they fit their roles like a sock fits its owner...(ok, bad analogy, but you get the point). Everyone should experience the magical world of Harry Potter. From the moment you first see the characters, you are hooked. Everyone should have this movie! A must have for the Harry Potter fan!!!	5.0	So Perfect, It Had To Be Done With Magic	2002-07-11	1	1	0

This is a well-done movie, safe for kids and with a good message.  Some people were accusing this movie of being from the devil, I would say just from a smart author and a great director.  I will watch the next movie and probably the one after that.The acting in this movie was at a high-caliber, including the child actors.  There are some real strong veteran actors who support this young contingent of stars.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AD9WTAOAFUZA4	"Jose R. Perez ""Jose"""	Having not read any of JK Rowling's books was apparently a blessing in terms of purely enjoying the film version of Book 1.  This is a thoroughly entertaining, richly layered film, with smart, supreme special effects, plenty of &quot;oohs and aahs&quot; and a nice mix of charming players, engaging plot devices and technical wizardry.  Few true Harry Potter fanatics have expressed satisfaction with the film, which apparently sticks so closely to its book source, it misses the magic these readers had themselves conjured up in their imagination.  As a result, a non-Potter-initiated viewer as myself was quickly swept away by the grandeur and illusion that unfolds on screen.  The young Radcliffe seems the perfect choice, though I hope he grows into the role as he himself grows up - some scenes are wooden, and his slightly crooked smile seems out of place at times.  His cohorts are equally engaging, though Hermoine's character is at times a challenge to enjoy.  Ron Weasly is more effective both as a character and in terms of the actor who plays him, as he gives him real humanity throughout.  A few scenes are simply awe-inspiring - Track 9 and 3/4 in London, playing quiddich in the air, the invisible cloak, the owl-delivery system at Hogwarts, and the 3-headed dog chose.  Maggie Smith is winning, but Robbie Coltraine steals the movie with his tender performance as Hagrid.  All in all, this is a strong start to what will hopefully become a classic on the order of the &quot;Wizard of Oz.&quot;  Don't judge Harry by his (book) cover - enjoy the thrilling film ride and you'll be glad you did.	4.0	A Technical Marvel - Better for the Uninitiated Potter Fan	2002-06-09	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2R1YK3THA0RB3	Josh	I know this is a movie adaptation, but it is so well crafted that I just had to do a review. Ladies and gentlemen: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I have read the books and They are absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Even 12 years later, and yet this movie is still a timeless classic. I seriously enjoy Harry Potter. Chris Columbus is a great director and watching this movie (as many times as I have) you can really tell that his heart was in the right place in making this story into one of the best movies I have seen. If you have read the books by author J K Rowling, it is obvious that the book and movie are two completely different things but the great thing I can say about Harry Potter films as a whole, is that they ALL stay close to the books; so I don't mind the films being as long as they are. Now on to the acting.There are actors who get offered movie roles, while there are actors who audition and get lucky. Luck had nothing to do with Daniel Radcliffe; because like it or not,  He IS Harry Potter. The way he moves, acts, everything about him is Harry Potter. Rupert Grint: Perfect choice for Ron Weasley (there is a humorous side to his character). Emma Watson: intelligence, wit, charm, and grace, Excellent choice for Hermione Granger. Tom Felton: again, HE IS Draco Malfoy, his movements, persona, etc. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: dark, quiet, and just plain strange, so its easy to see why he plays Severus Snape. The actors chosen for Harry Potter all were spectacular. The story  line is intriguing as it is beguiling. And there are NO dull moments in Harry Potter. Fantasy, New worlds, and things that childhood imaginations are made of are what this movie has to offer. All in all, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is a cleverly brilliant movie that is easy to watch.5 Stars	5.0	J.K. Rowling has quite the imagination	2013-05-31	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AP6K3SR8E9EY8	"""jpmb"""	Last winter's release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was a complete triumph, setting a standard that may be impossible for future films of the series to meet.It's not just the great casting (especially the kids, who are fantastic) and the digital magic we have come to expect from movie effects. The real triumph is how fully the creative team captured J.K. Rowling's imaginary world and all the important events.It's all there. Everything you loved about the book is at least alluded to in the film, it's in there somewhere. The screenwriters did not substitute their own cleverness for Rowlings' nor did they slavishly copy every detail. They used what they had to to make the story clear and sprinkled the rest in as well as they could. And they did a brilliant job of it. (It does cause some worry. Subsequent books of the series have grown longer and longer. How can they possibly fit them into a movie that doesn't last 6 hours, without leaving out an awful lot?)It's important to remember when viewing something like this (&quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is an even better example) that the book is not the story. The book tells the story in the way a book does. Movies tell stories in a different way, they're a different experience, which accounts for frequent complaints or disappointments.But &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; works as a movie without sacrificing anything of the book. And that is a terrific achievement.The DVD has plenty of special features, but they're displayed in a way that's a little too cute for me. My kids love all that schtick, but I'd just as soon scroll down a menu and click what I want instead of playing a game to get what I'm after.But that's a fairly trivial complaint, I'll admit. The packaging is pretty slick, the features (once you find them) are plentiful and interesting, and the movie is excellent.(One side note - While the special effects capture Quidditch pretty well, it only illustrates how stupid the game is. Why have all those other players when the only ones that really matter are the seekers? Why not have your other players forget the quaffle and chase the snitch? As a fairly intense sports fan, I find the broomstick game absurd, impossible to believe. I've gotta think if there really were a wizard game on brooms, it wouldn't be Quidditch, which makes no sense.)	4.0	Great movie, very  good DVD	2002-05-30	2	2	0

Just the same...If you're 22 like me, give or take a few years, and you loved Legend and The Dark Crystal and The Labyrinth and The Princess Bride and The Neverending Story, pretend you're a kid with a new VCR and you're momma or daddy just rented this for you.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3KLU935YFI61J	"JR Curtis ""Costellian."""	I didn't get it.  Other than loving the fact that children everywhere were finding the joy of reading thanks to a little boy named Harry, I didn't get what the fuss was all about.  Well, my brother bought the Harry Potter DVD, and I was excited to see it, but I had no idea what it would mean to my life.  After viewing the movie once, I decided to purchase my own copy so as to get it in widescreen, and have viewed the movie 6 times in total.  Also, after viewing the movie, I picked up the first book (and I suggest everyone do so).  I read it, bought the second one, read it, bought the third and fourth ones and read them.  Harry Potter has quickly dominated my life.The movie adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most accurate novel to film adaptions I have ever seen.  It is entertaining, beautiful, and very well acted.  I especially love the kids in the movie (which is strange for a cynic such as myself).  This movie rushed to one of my all-time favorite movie slots.  While watching it I flashed back to such all time greats as The Wizard of Oz and Star wars.  I felt 6 again, I felt the cynicism melt away.  Harry Potter is a movie you should at least try to watch, and if you like it at all, I do suggest the books (all of them).  I don't know how they'll do it, but I hope they can make all of the books into movies.

Although a lot of the smaller details were left out, I can understand due to the over all length of the movie.  But there were enough major events included, that someone who hasn't read the books, could follow the events.  The movie and all the special effects presented were amazing.  The time went by so fast and really kept you involved with the story line.  I do wish more of the childrens inter play and conversations were seen.  As this reconfirms and helps define each character.  In some ways, the special effects over shadowed the characters at times.  But I wouldn't miss any of the future movies. Each of the characters are beautifully played and come to life before your eyes.  Just as you picture them while reading the book. The costumes, sets and special effects really helped you connect with the story line.	4.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	2002-02-13	2	1	1

I agree that with the millions of readers &amp; viewers of the HP series, it would be difficult for the cast/crew to satisfy each &amp; everyone's expectations.  So, when I got hold of the DVD, I skipped the film &amp; proceeded to see the speacial features.I would say the idea of coming up with 2 discs, one for the film itself + theatrical/teaser trailers &amp; one specially for its added features is a great marketing concept.  Going through the 2nd disc made the film seem more interesting &amp; erased all my qualms --- so I ended up watching the film again --- but only after going through the 2nd disc.	4.0	I enjoyed the special features more	2002-06-02	0	0	0

The film, I am pleased to say, was just as seductive in pulling me away from normal life, depositing me in the gothic romance of Hogwarts with Harry and his friends.The books transcended the ages here - it was my 56-year old father who introduced them to me - and the film was as eagerly received by 60-year olds as by toddlers. The actors portray Harry et al with the same naughtiness and courage as their alter-egos in JK Rowling's books (Hermione was particularly good) - the effects were, of course, manadatory and the quidditch game was brought to life on screen extremely well.It is wonderful to see British talent in a world outside of Hughtopia. While London is unmistakably dry-witted and floppy-haired, it is pleasing to see a different aspect of the national character (strength, solidarity and intellect) translated onto the silver screen. Moreover, it is wonderful knowing that the film will encourage more people to read. That can never be a bad thing...	4.0	Outstanding	2002-05-14	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A10872FHIJAKKD	Just Bill	"I realize I could be tarred and feathered and run out of town for giving Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only three stars, but please let me explain before you take up the brush and choke a few chickens.I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I was into Harry from the first book. In other words, the hype didn't compel me to read Harry. It was actually my mother. She read the first book and told me to go find it. I did. And it wasn't easy, let me tell you. Book stores at the time weren't stocked to overflowing with Harry Potter merchandise.It took me a little while to get into the first book (for some reason, I had to keep reading and re-reading the first chapter before I ""got"" it), but I soon developed Pottermania. I bought every book as it was published (I even waited in line at a local bookstore when the fourth book was released at midnight), plus all the books on CD read by Jim Dale and I even purchased the British versions of the books via Amazon.com UK.The CDs are amazing. Jim Dale is a master storyteller who performs all the voices flawlessly. (See my reviews of the CDs for more information.) I couldn't bear to get out of my car a time or two as Dale read the books. I was totally and completely engrossed.So when I first heard that they were making a movie of the first book (with a movie per book planned), I was both excited and quite skeptical. I didn't think any Hollywood version could match the Harry Potter I created in my mind, fueled by Jim Dale's skillful readings and characterizations.Well, I was right. But not because Hollywood took liberties with Harry Potter (the way they did with, say, the first Lord of the Rings movie); rather, because the movie was such a literal adaptation that I felt myself growing ever more bored, waiting for what I knew to be the next scene.Admittedly, Daniel Radcliffe is a perfect Harry Potter. But other characters didn't fare so well in my opinion. Malfoy, for example, wasn't leering and sneering enough. (And he didn't sound like Jim Dale's portrayal of him in the CD versions.) Snape wasn't sinister enough. And I wasn't bowled over by the movie version of Ron Weasley, either.And -- horror of horrors! -- I thought the Quidditch match as filmed by director Chris Columbus was a snooze-fest. Worse yet, it wasn't how I pictured it to be. Or, maybe it was EXACTLY how I pictured it to be. I don't know. All I can tell you is that I wasn't amazed or thrilled with the Quidditch playing in the movie.I know most Harry Potter fans thought the literal adaptation was being faithful to J.K. Rowling's books. But I thought the adaptation was so literal that I knew what was around every corner. It was as if I was watching a Harry Potter documentary, rather than a feature film.As I watched the movie, I kept thinking two things: (1) This is a movie, and (2) My imagination is so much greater than this movie.By the first point, I mean that I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to get into the movie. I was always keenly aware it was a movie, a movie made from my favorite books. Again, it felt like I was watching a documentary of the Hogwarts school student.By the second point, I mean that the sights, sounds, smells and experiences of the Harry Potter books already HAD a place in my mind. This movie didn't add to them; in fact, the movie detracted from them. It simply couldn't compete with the Harry Potter I safeguarded in my head.So where does that leave me regarding the DVD release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and -- more importantly -- the rest of the movies planned for each book?Sadly, I don't think I'll be buying the DVD. It just doesn't stand up to repeated viewings.Plus -- and this is the truly sad part -- I don't think I'll be watching any more of the movies as they're released. There's simply no point in doing so.The Harry Potter I know and love already lives -- in my head.And that's where I'd like him to remain."	3.0	Literal adaptation left little to the imagination	2002-03-31	245	129	116

The casting is abosolutely first rate - Emma Watson as Hermione was perfect, as was Alan Rickman as Snape.

I was pleasantly surprised by this well-made movie and by the wonderful imagination of the author who created this delightful story.  It has everything a child could want in a story--a likeable hero, his two pleasant sidekicks, scary villains, and fast-paced action.  Everything about this movie is first-class, from the excellent cast to the writing to the special effects and visual delights which await the viewer.  It joins other wonderful children's classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, and creates a totally satisfying entertainment experience for adults as well as children.  The popularity of this story is well-deservedl--well-done Ms. Rowlands and everyone who had anything to do with this film!	5.0	Enchanting movie for all ages	2002-06-06	2	2	0

I went, as most people did, but unlike most people I hated it. The movie was poorly done. I felt like I was in a rollercoaster flying past fake dead bodies, but before I could get a good look I was moved on to the next. By the end of the movie I felt rushed and agitated. It wasn't fun sitting there and trying to figure out exactly what new scene was coming up, because they skipped so many that I got confused about where we were! When movies are done on books that were extremally successful then I think they should put themselves in for a long movie, however long it needs be. If Harry Potter had been an hour longer I think it would have been a better movie. As it is I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone but hardcore Harry Potter fans. The kind that got their room re-painted with little snitches everywhere. And only own pencils that are 'Harry Potter' pencils.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A20DW2QWVWEG06	"KAT ""bandbeast_2"""	This movie was worth the wait.  Daniel Radcliffe was awesome in the role of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  First, Harry must survive the harsh treatment of his family.  They treat him worse than a stepson, even Dudley gets in on the act. Second, he must learn to train and control his newly acquired powers, and Third, he must discover where the Sourceror's Stone is hidden and its powers.  This is not an easy task for someone that already has a respected reputation.Usually, I would be turned off by so much computer-aided graphics, but in this case, everything was complimentary.  Nothing less is expected from Jim Henson Productions, Inc.  The numerous costumes were so seamless that I never recognized John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, or Warwick Davis as one of the bank tellers or Flitwick.  Some of my favorite scenes were when Harry's cousin Dudley, quite impish with his behavior, ends up in the snake's cage and with a pig's tail after stealing and eating Harry's birthday cake.  Oh, and let's not forget &quot;Fluffy&quot; the three-headed dog on the third floor.  Don't let the cute name fool you, scary is more like it.  One last villian, He Who Must Not Be Named paid a high price in the Dark Forest.All in all this is a good movie, if you can get past some of the raw language.

It had very little of the plot in it, and the children were terrible actors. The one reason I had gone to see it was to watch the Quiddich, which was just plain awful! The people looked like SIMS!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2RN05UDH183AV	"K. Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx"""	I devoured the first four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books--even driving over to a friend's house to borrow #4 when I couldn't find a place to buy a copy at 9 p.m., when I finished #3.&quot;Not as good as the book&quot; is such a cliche that, of course, I didn't expect the movie to be as good as the books.  I was pleasantly surprised--until the end of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movie.  We'll get to that in a moment.The look of the movie is just what I thought Hogwarts and Harry's world would look like.  I love the cupboard under the stairs.  I love the owl mail.  I loved the Great Hall's ceiling change, and the different holiday decorations floating above the students' heads.  The Quiddich match was fun to watch.  Diagon Alley was more than I could take in.  Watching the chocolate frogs jump around was a nice surprise.  Wow!On reflection, the depth of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series comes in the later books, as Harry learns more about his parents, and the one whose name we shall not utter.  The fun of the first book was the how Rowling created Harry's world.  So in that sense, I think that the movie works well in recreating that world.  After the previews came out, I read criticism that the movie did not appear &quot;dark&quot; enough, that Hogwarts appears to fresh and clean.  Granted, the Quiddich scenes and the broom-riding lesson scene take place under bright sunny skies, but the interior scenes seem gothic enough to satisfy those wanting a darker look.The young actors chosen to play the three leads--Harry, Ron and Hermione--have a great chemistry.  I hope that they will continue through the remaining movies.While I loved the movie, I do have a few criticisms.  First of all, where was the Potions Room?  Everyone I know who both read the book and saw the movie was disappointed that this room was left out.  For those few who have done neither, I will back up a bit and explain.  In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; Harry, Ron and Hermione gradually put together that a mysterious package that Hagrid the Giant picks up at Gringotts Bank, a break-in at Gringotts, the warnings about staying off the third floor, and other incidents all seem to be related.  Thus, as the novelty of Harry discovering the world of wizardry wears off, the movie delves more into this mystery.Ultimately, the trio decide they need to try to get past the various magical barriers to protect the Sorcerer's Stone.  One of the strengths of the book was that this process involved critical talents of all three friends--Ron's chess playing, Hermione's riddle solving, and Harry, well, that would be giving away too much.  Hermione's key contribution comes in the Potions Room, where she and Harry have to select from among several drinks--some poison--in order to advance closer to the Sorcerer's Stone.  In the movie, however, Hermione merely recognizes the plant in which they are entangled--thanks to her overzealous studying--and explains what to do to get through.  The scene merely enforces her being a &quot;know-it-all.&quot;My other criticism is that, for all its wonderful &quot;eye candy&quot; qualities, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; seems to lack the warmth of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  Perhaps had these two movies not premiered so close together, the comparison would not so immediately come to mind.  Both deal with fantasy worlds in which magical creates and an unexpected, seemingly unpowerful hero emerge.  Of the two, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; shines as a classic that no doubt will stand the test of time.  As for &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; let's hope that the sequels develop the depth that of the subsequent books.	4.0	Enchanting, but will it withstand the test of time?	2002-06-14	0	0	0

A plus is the theater release version is included as well as the extended edition (for those times you just want to be nostalgic), plus a digital copy.  The behind-the-scene extras are excellent & very well done, with the advantage of having the actors, now much older, being able to comment & share thoughts of ""back then.""  It is very fascinating to learn all that went into the original creation of this world visually - things we as viewers tend to take for granted - & how that has served as the basis for all the subsequent films.I had originally planned on only purchasing the Ultimate edition of the 1st movie.

If they brought the book over exactly as it is written it would be too long.The movie looked excactly how I pictured the book.  Everything was a treat for the eyes.  They casted incredibly well.

Our frustration came with the special features, the software was hard for our computer to run ( there were 3 or 4 different software programs to install )  To see deleted scenes you have to go through the paces, but our computer crashed every time we tried to use the software on the DVD.  We DO meet the system requirements and don't usually have trouble with new software.  So we feel like we really didn't get the extras, hence the 3 star rating.  We are curious if others had trouble with the software.  Small children would probably not be able to navigate this DVD on their own at all.  Bummer.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A22CGE3WAQC6P7	"Kenny Embry ""I'm a professor who's interested..."	Making the movie version of a famous novel is always tricky business.  How do you take something that takes hours to read and reduce it to 2-3 hours of screen time?  Most resort to eliminating subplots, or changing plotlines altogether.  These aren't necessarily bad things, either.  For example, the Two Towers diverges drastically from the Lord of the Rings, but tells a great story, nonetheless, that fans of the series are still satisified with in the cinema (for the most part).Harry Potter's first film is probably the best adaptation I've ever seen.  Nearly everything is true to the book, even though some endearing plotlines have been written out.  However, when you've got an audience of kids who are probably seeing their first film from a novel, there's bound to be some disappointment.  This is a movie that gets a lot right, though.First off, the sets are what they should be.  Hogwarts comes off as a place where aspiring witches and wizards could practice their arts without distraction (well, at least no distraction from muggles).  Likewise the dialogue is crisp and advances the story at a good pace (especially for such a long movie).  Plus, most of the characters are perfectly cast.  Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris), Snape, McGonagall, Ron, Hermoine are all EXACTLY right.  The characterizations are so well formed and believable, readers of the books are sure to be pleased.My only gripe is with Harry.  Daniel Radcliffe certainly looks the part, but gives a very tentative portrayal of the most famous student at Hogwart's.  I know, I know, Harry's supposed to be weak in the beginning, but sometimes it just seems that Radcliffe has forgotten his lines.  To his credit, he's much better in the second movie, but the first still leaves a lesser impression.Still, this is a movie definitely worth watching.  Let's face it, with the box office it did (and the video sales), you've probably already seen it and are either agreeing or wildly disagreeing with what I've said.  Either way, this is a worthy accompaniment to the novels, and a welcomed addition to children's cinema.	4.0	Oh, Come on Harry	2003-02-07	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	APWKSH4XINI0Q	Kevin Artinian	When it comes to Harry Potter, I have mixed feelings.  The books are very entertaining, but they are also pretty silly, and can't hold a candle to the brilliant works of such writers as Tolkien, CS Lewis, E Nesbit, and such others.  Harry Potter deserves five stars for entertainment value, but one star for innovation and sophistication.  So why is the movie so much better?  Well, movies don't always have to be taken as seriously as books do.  Not only that, but it is extremely entertaining without having to deal with childish narrative or the fact that there are a billion fantasy stories like this.  Harry Potter is just a fun movie, and while I only recommend the books for those who need a break from Dostoyevsky and Victor Hugo (and certainly, we all need a break from serious books now and then), this movie has something for everybody, and can be watched anytime.  I would have given this 4.5 stars, but i can't, and it definitely doesn't deserve the five stars i would give a more serious movie, so four will have to do.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	A strong first outing for the Wizard franchise, thanks in no small part to John Williams' perfect score. Overall, a fairly true adaptation of the novel (but no mention of the Quidditch Cup, only the House Cup and some classes missing that I'd have enjoyed a glimpse at, like History of Magic.) I only wish  Terry Gilliam had actually gotten to direct it (imagine the swarms of CATS & OWLS at Kings Cross). Casting perfection across the board with the kids and adults, Robbie Coltrane (who I totally thought of as Hargrid after that bit as the Ghost of Christmas past in Blackadder), Maggie Smith rocks it as Prof McGongall,  the late great Richard Harris is my second dream-casting choice,  I wanted Peter O'toole for Dumbledore, I wish Rickman had kept his 80's signature beard for Snape, too. Chris Columbus directs here, notice the similarities between this and an early project he wrote Young Sherlock Holmes, I believe JK may have found inspiration there.	5.0	All around Great adaption	2013-12-01	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	Naysayer after naysayer tries to write off this film, and those which followed, as well as the books, as fluff for kids.  Others went as far to say that this franchise had satanic or evil qualities about it.  I say that's a bunch of bull.  These movies and books do something for kids(and adults) that hasn't been done since films like &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; and the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy came along.  It allows kids to use their imagination.  It gives them hope that there is something magical and wonderful in this world.  Regardless if you believe in witchcraft or anything of that sort, let kids have some FUN!.  Sorry to be preachy, but for the last fifteen or so years, kids have been hammered with &quot;suggestions&quot; from professionals, preachers and the ACLU as to what they should be watching and doing.  Well guess what folks, kids need to have fun.  Granted, they do need to learn right from wrong and good from evil, but they have to live a little as well.&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone&quot; gives kids a chance to laugh, scream in fear and be awed all at the same time.  Who in their right mind didn't pretend to be a wizard, witch, knight, cowboy, football star, etc. when they were growing up.  Today's kids have been robbed of that privilege by overprotective parents and worry-wart professionals.So just sit back, relax and watch a pretty cool kid do some pretty cool things.  Harry is a wonderful role-model for kids.  He is respectful of others, minds most of the rules(the ones he breaks are broken with the best intentions), and fights for what's right.  He doesn't whine about being in a rough situation.  He makes decisions that would make any parent proud.  Oh, and by the way, he doesn't use his powers for evil purposes.  He actually fights evil.Please don't let the whackos scare you away from this movie or anything related to it.  I'm a Catholic convert, and if you know anything about Catholic converts, you know that we're pretty holy-roly.  I don't see anything evil or satanic about Harry or any of his friends.  I'm not afraid that I'll find my daughter doing incantations sometime in the future trying to conjure up some evil spirit.  Instead, she'll be using her imagination, much like all of the kids that I grew up with, and pretending to be a warrior or a crimefighter or even a witch!  Who cares?  Just let the kiddies have some fun and quit strangling their childhood.Sorry for going off, but in today's world, somebody has to say something.  God bless you J.K. Rowling, for bringing wonder and imagination back to life in a time where so many are trying to destroy it.Highly recommended film, highly recommended book.  I enjoyed this as much(if not more) than my daughter.	5.0	Finally!!! Imagination and Wonder Have Returned!	2004-06-27	5	5	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A252VVO3JBP3CW	K. Fry	"The movie part of this DVD is great.  The quality is terrific and the special effects don't look quite as fake as they did in the movie theater.On the downside, the ""Special Features"" DVD is a disappointment.  In order to access the deleted scenes, you have to go through an intricate and frustrating set of exercises -- every single time.  Fine if you're into video games -- but if all you want is to see the seven scenes (and there are too few in my opinion), it's a pain.  It's great to have a game, but it would be easier for this non-video-game-playing-person to have it separated from the other features and that way, everything can be enjoyed. (Although I must admit to a certain amount of excitement when I passed Potions, made my way to the Stone and finally saw those anxiously awaited deleted scenes.)On the plus side, there are some amusing film bits on many of the characters sprinkled throughout the interactive section. Another is that the interview with Chris Columbus, the producer and screenwriter is easily accessible.I do not have a DVD-ROM drive and so cannot comment on those aspects -- I'm sure much is hidden there.Given the broad spectrum of extras that so many DVD's offer, this has fallen a bit short of my own expectations.But, there will still be hours of enjoyment to be had at Hogwarts."	4.0	Potter fans will want so much more	2002-05-29	1	1	0

Having read and re-read the books at least twice... I had been following all the media buzz on what was to be a hit movie. I had hoped on the day it came out my mom would let me leave early from school to see the 3:30pm showing to my surprise my mom let me have the whole day off something the state of Texas wouldn't approve of! I like to think I was one of the first people to see it seeing the early 7:30am showing.There is one word to describe this movie magical. Although, I have heard mulitple fans complain about the movie and how they don't live up to the book- I found that they have. The books can only take us so far with descriptions- we usually have to imagine the rest. But, with the movies we get the chance to see these magical worlds come before our eyes. O.K I'll admit as a fan I have been disappointed with some of the choices that have been made with the movies... with certain cast members. But, they do a good job living up to Rowling's epic books!The actors that play Ron and Hermoine are perfectly cast. And although Radcliffe may seem the perfect choice as Harry since he has features and maturity I still believe Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor among them. Although he does a great job anyway. The sets, costumes, script, and acting make this first chapter in the Harry Potter saga a magical one!All in all though this is a movie you should allow your children to see and please give them the right to imagine/dream their smart they know there's no such thing as witches and wizards they just need the chance to believe.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2R2OKDXBGW8UI	Kimberly Plourde	I love Harry Potter.  Like everyone who does, I've read the books many times. I saw the movie the day it opened. And I have pre-ordered the DVD.It is a fantastic movie, but only if you are as familiar with the books as I, and my fellow fans are.It is the Reader's Digest version.I realize that it is extremely difficult to put a long book onto the screen sucessfully.  They did a decent job, and it was fun and interesting to watch.  However, the part that makes the books so absolutely enjoyable was missing -- the character development.The movie is devoid of character development all together, and in fact some characters never get a name.  Take for instance the character of Neville.  While he is in the movie, most first timers to Harry Potter were highly confused when he stood up to his friends and later received points to win the house cup.  Meanwhile, if you read the book, you not only worry about Neville after he is frozen, but cry when he wins the cup.It is a good movie, but pales in comparison to the book.	3.0	The Reader's Digest Version	2002-03-20	4	1	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A18VVDLRLG9SVO	Kimberly Wells	I have young relatives with, shall we say, &quot;issues.&quot;  Harry Potter, despite being a long movie which would normally inspire such witty kid-actions as &quot;try to hold your brother down till he turns blue while mom isn't watching&quot;, kept them glued to the screen for hours.  It also keeps them that way EVERY time we play it.  They just don't get bored, and there are fewer trips to the emergency room.This is because the movie itself is a really well done version of a pretty good book.  I do think there are better books out there (the Narnia Series, for one) but Harry appeals to kids' sense of being unique, different and special.  Heck, it appeals to adults' (mine included) same sense.  I want to find the special train track myself, and I wish I could prove that all along my suspicions that maybe I was adopted or something were true and I was really this long-lost hero of a special world.  Maybe that sense of being special can help the ordinary muggles like me want to BE special, and do good things.  I think it's worth a try, and if it's at the cost of a movie rather than years of therapy, it's probably worth it.The movie's action sequences are well drawn, the magic believable, the actor who plays Harry looks the part, and I loved the way they made Quidditch look real.  Get this for your kids.  They will learn something about how treating people the way you'd like to be treated yourself is a good thing.  They will also, whether muggle or magic kid, feel special and smart when they figure out who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is.  Plus, it's just greatly entertaining.  (Then, try to slip them some other stuff, by saying &quot;It's a lot like Harry Potter).	4.0	Keeps your kids glued to the screen	2002-07-15	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A23OLHL5RPQKLP	"K. L Sadler ""Dr. Karen L. Sadler"""	As a deaf person...I have to wait usually until the most current movies are brought out on DVD format. While everyone else was going to the movie, I had to wait another nine months in order to enjoy it. Movies such as Spider-Man can be somewhat enjoyable if you cannot hear the sound or speech, but for something like Harry Potter, where the writing and the interaction between all the characters in the book are so key to understanding, those of us with no hearing need to wait until someone bothers to caption them.Sometimes I am disappointed because the build-up by the media and word-of-mouth is such that I expect more from the movie than it is able to provide. That wasn't the case with this movie/DVD. As someone who remembers going to the library and reading every possible book I could get on mythology, the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Anderson, many science fiction books written for children, and all books written on Merlin and the Arthurian legend, I was pleased when this generation had a book come out involving fantasy and fairy tale, that could withstand the test of time. The movie did a spectacular job of following the high precedent set by the book. Rowling was right to keep such strong control over her books so that they would be faithful to what she wrote.The movie is spectacular in special effects and in casting not only Harry, but his cohorts. Radcliffe is a read find and his humility in playing this part makes for one of the least obnoxious child actors I've ever seen. You can tell the kids had great fun making this movie in spite of the work. It's nice to see so many great British actors and actressess participating in this endeavor to bring the book to life. Thank heavens, Richard Harris' granddaughter threatened him if he didn't take the part of the headmaster of the school. And as a deaf person who relies upon facial expression, I waited with impatience for Rickman to show up and pull his usual glowering looks...he didn't disappoint.This is not a movie for small children. My grandchildren couldn't sit still that long. They come and go while watching this, but the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband didn't get some of it because he didn't read the book. There is a bit missing if you don't read the book first...but people probably said the same thing about The Wizard of Oz....	5.0	The book's fantasy incredibly brought to screen!	2002-06-06	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2W4BX2P3AKDIC	K McK	(Note: this review is of the movie as released in theaters, not of the DVD, which promises to come out with several more hours of deleted scenes.)I just saw HP for the second time in the theaters yesterday, after practically memorizing all four books.  My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.  I just hate to see what they'll do to Book 4..	3.0	Fun for HP newbies; disappointing for HP fans	2002-04-05	96	60	36

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A34CVGYUNAUJF	"KNO2skull ""kn02skull"""	"Any comparisions to ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or ""Wizard of Oz"" are simply erronious and insulting, .... These series are well written and read classics. The word 'classic' does not come to mind when viewing or reading ""Harry Potter"". It's an alright book, but not phenomena like ""C.O.N"" or ""W.O.O."". Someone pointed out that this drivel will be read again and again, and that makes it classic. Go to it, but good writing will always be the preference of those with taste. Certainly, ""C.O.N."" Chronicles' is moralistic, but more, it's well written, and will be read over and over again (entering a 3rd time, as many will attest).  So too, will 'The Earthsea Trilogy' by LeGuin, and L.O.R. be read over and over again.  However, this should not be a test of a 'Classic' novel; for most people (accurately) consider ""Moby Dick"" and ""War And Peace"" classics, but few will ever read them more than once.  Who cares if the miraculous happens over and over?  I don't see how it is missing in C.O.N., but then, talking animals and a interdimensional portals to lands full of mythic and magical creatures happens every day in my house.  The miraculous occurs often in a lot of namable dime-store novels and children's books that are long since forgotten by most, (the 'Mushroom Planet' series comes immediately to mind). People read 'Nancy Drew' over and over again, good stories, but not classics. This goes beyond the point of the DVD, but people in search of good fantasy fiction should not be lead to believe this is on the level of these other stories. So, this review addresses the story, which is in both the book and film.Essentially, in this installment, Harry Potter discovers after growing up a group of ""muggles"" (non-magical people, usually displayed as boring and bigoted people by boring and bigoted witches and wizards, the ""moralization"" being here that magical people are better somehow, or at least think they are) that he is accepted to a Wizard's School, (a topic given far better treatment in Ursula K. LeGuin's ""Earthsea Trilogy""), and begins his fabulous journey. He arrives at wizard school, and becomes something of a celebrity who quickly rises to the top. He discovers a transparent conspiracy (one that any of the adult magicians should have been able to see) and sets off to solve the mystery.This movie, like the book that's based on, is fairly boring and superfluous. The tasks Harry has to go through to defeat the villian are not very difficult, and thus not very interesting. It is ludicrous that this series of books and movies are controversial, where it doesn't have anything of true value concerning magic, wizards or witches. Nor does it have interesting lessons, analogies or allusions.The special effects are fairly clunky CGI work, (watch the centaur scene for jilting movements). The sets and the look of the film are both fantastic, and the 'quiditch' scene is fun to watch, though you never get the sense that Potter is ever in any real danger. The extras on the DVD are silly, and don't warrant a second disc. Though extra scenes are always nice to see.Though a children's film, there is nothing here to make a comparison to any of the classic stories realistic. It compares better with Nancy Drew or Encyclopedia Brown than some of those that have been loosely thrown about (perchance by people that have not read the series they insult by comparing it to Harry Potter). I actually enjoyed reading Harry Potter's first book though I'm not a child, but there was really nothing warranting the high praise it has gotten aside from good marketing. It just reminds me that there are better children's stories out there, such as the now defunct ""Mushroom Planet"" series. This movie is an enjoyable watch, but don't expect ""Lord of the Rings"" quality of storytelling."	3.0	A near exact film adaption of an O.K. book	2003-03-10	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	What a sensational family movie!  Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry, a rather pitiful orphan, who lives with his mean aunt and uncle. On his 11th birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard and happily leaves home for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  There, he makes his first-ever pals - classmates Ron and Hermione, and their friendship is the heart of the story. We follow the trio as they go through their first year at school attending magic classes, finding adventure, and even solving a mystery that puts Harry face-to-face with the dark wizard who killed his parents.Radcliffe captures the innocence and sadness of Harry, as well as his daring-do and sense of fun. Rupert Grint, as his sidekick Ron, delivers most of the comedy lines and is very appealing. Emma Watson plays Hermione with a heart of gold underneath her bookish bossiness. They are supported by a stellar cast, including Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. There is lots of action, fun special effects, and some sweet, poignant moments as well.All ages can enjoy this movie, even if you haven't read the book.

Peterson	This is not a review of the movie itself but a review of the high definition experience provided by the disc.Many of the scenes are a great improvement over the DVD, but this film was shot on a significantly lower budget than later films and it shows.Not only is there a noticeable amount of film grain present in many of the shots, but special effects that looked decent on the DVD look mediocre at best on blu-ray, especially for a movie released only 6 years ago. There are also a few shots where you can clearly see that the Hagrid standing in the background is not Robbie Coltrane (something that wasn't as evident on the DVD's).Audio quality is a solid step up from the DVD release. The 5.1 channel PCM soundtrack sounded pretty good on my system, but there was nothing particularly outstanding about the track.Considering that this is part one of the biggest movie franchises of all time, I wish WB would have cleaned a few things up before releasing this movie in high definition.The blu-ray presentation of this movie is definitely more enjoyable than the DVD version, but I would hardly call this reference quality material.3/5 video3.5/5 audioThe rest of the Harry Potter blu-ray movies, however, are bigger steps up from their DVD counterparts.All things considered, this is still a must-have for any avid Potter fan with a blu-ray player and a high-def TV.	3.0	Not that great	2007-12-17	6	4	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AN3GRLDKGOUNO	KS	I realize this is not a movie on the scale of Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings; it is, however, a very good movie for families to view together. There are not many of those around anymore. The younger actors are new to acting and yes you can tell and some say the scenes are quick but who really goes to a movie to disect it. I went with my 12 yeard old daughter who loved it and the books. She didn't care that the performances weren't Academy Award material. All she cared about was that the movie was very close to the book and it was very entertaining. I myself have seen the movie twice and read all four books. I also have to say that anything that get children back on the road to reading is an instant hit with me. I have never seen my daughter read likes she reads those books. She has also started reading other similar books that she never would have even thought about before.	5.0	Excellent movie for children and parents	2002-03-28	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2FW9CW8LIOGA8	Kyle Rosenkranz	"Just to inform you this is a review of both of the Harry Potter Ultimate Editions that have been released so far.As I mentioned before, these new releases of the Harry Potter film franchise has been spectacular so far! Individually I love each of the first two movies. The first 2 happen to be my all-time favorites from the franchise so far (Year 1 is the best in my opinion). I got both Ultimate Editions on blu-ray even though I already owned the first dvd releases of the movies. However, my parents gave me both versions of the films in the full-screen format. So, not only did I want to rectify this error, I also wanted them to be in a higher quality. I plan to do the same for the next six Ultimate Editions.I was astounded by the improved quality of the movies in their Blu-ray format and I enjoyed the extended versions that are also included in this set. But the thing that really sold the Ultimate Editions were the Special Features! The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentaries are brilliant. Each of them are over an hour long and give in-depth details about specific aspects of the films (how the film started, how the characters were adapted and cast), the next two Ultimate Editions will deal with creating the creatures and the music. The best part about these documentaries is that they deal with the characters, creatures, etc from films 1-6. Also included are all the special features from the original DVD releases. Also included in the sets is a fourth disk containing a digital copy of the film.The only flaws with these editions are the character cards and the booklets. Usually when I get these type of releases with the booklets (which I enjoy looking at) I feel like they are putting them in there to raise the price a bit. However, it is still a good deal at $10 a disk and I plan to get the rest as I mentioned earlier.I said to myself I would not get Goblet of Fire-Blood Prince, because I did not enjoy those movies enough to spend the money on the dvds. But these Ultimate Editions have gotten me to overlook this promise. I look forward to the next releases and hope they do not release them a year apart the way I think they might."	5.0	"The Ultimate Editions Are ""Bloody Brillaint!"""	2010-07-14	3	2	1

I hadn't seen it at the movies, and was eagerly anticipating it's release on video. It was worth the wait!I had previously read the books, and was hoping the film wouldn't ruin it. Thankfully it didn't, as I can now imagine the characters when I read the books.Daniel, Rupert and Emma were all brilliant considering their age.

I read the book, so while the plot didn't surprise me the special effects and superb acting did.  The book came to life.  The casting was excellent - the chemistry between Hermione, Harry, and Ron was magical, and every character was believable.  The actor who plays Harry Potter was both a child and an ""old soul,"" which brings depth to his character.  I was impressed with many of scenes, such as those with the Sorting Hat, the quidditch game, and the big chess game.A delight to watch!"	5.0	Magical acting and effects	2002-11-10	2	2	0

I admit the casting seems to have been excellent, but then I never bothered with the book, so I had no preconceptions regarding how the characters should look. The special effects were all right -- especially the flying sequences. As for the story, any comparisons to Cinderella were purely intentional.  Listening to 50-year-olds go on and on about how magical this film is stimulates my gag reflex. If you're looking for an &quot;adult&quot; fairytale, buy a Lord of the Rings DVD. Any grownup who spends his/her allowance on this Harry Potter silliness should be spanked and sent to his/her room without supper.	2.0	Hogwarts? Hogwash!	2002-09-19	10	3	7

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2W158T5BF6DLS	LaurieMarie	Alright... this is not a nice review and I am not going to act like it is going to be.  You want the truth about this movie, the pure undiluted truth.  This movie is absolute crap (pardon the language).  I am an avid fan of the books, and I have been reading them since my mom bought the first book and started to read it to me when I was about eleven, I liked the book so much that she never saw it again after the first chapter.  I am almost seventeen (so that equals to about six years of love for this imaginary world.)  The books are wonderful, this movie... should be thrown away and not a single sequel should have come of it.  They should have stopped, waited for all of the books to be written, and then started back up again with the first.  This movie hardly shows what a wonderful series that this first book started, but rather is shows a horrible first movie that only got worse.  Characters are misrepresented, the story line is wrong, ending is botched... need I continue.  I went to see this movie in theatre when it was released, and I was fairly excited to see how they would make this magic real, but by the end I really wanted to shoot the director.  (I actually left the theatre and sat outside in the car... I never saw the whole movie until my dad rented the movie.)  So it is my advice to you, do not watch the movies, but rather sit down with the book and let your imagination create the world, that Hollywood failed to create.	1.0	Horrid.	2004-08-28	17	6	11

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1IWWRZJOXOSYP	Lee Armstrong	"""Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone,"" or as I understand it's released in Great Britain as ""HP & the Philosopher's Stone,"" is a great DVD.  Most critics feel if there's a fault to the film, it's that it's TOO faithful to the book.  It'd been some time since I'd read the book when I viewed the film.  I kept saying, ""Oh, I remember that!""  Chris Columbus has done an excellent job bringing this magical world to screen.  I think Harry Potter, films included, will become as a part of our culture as Peter Pan.The actors are each wonderful in the movie, although action rather than character development is the strength.  Daniel Radcliffe does a great job showing the innocence and bravery of Harry.  Rupert Grint is a hoot as Ron.  Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore gives such a calm wisdom to the part.  Maggie Smith as McGonagall is as wonderful as she was in ""Gosford Park.""  Robbie Coltrane who played a great buddy to Johnny Depp in ""From Hell"" does a great job as the half-giant Hagrid.  Alan Rickman perfected screen villany in ""Die Hard"" and ""Robin Hood""; so we love to hate his wonderful sneer.  He also performed the great service of seeing Sean Biggerstaff who plays the Quidditch team's head Oliver Wood in a stage play, giving him his first screen break in ""The Winter's Guest.""  Biggerstaff was my favorite of the supporting actors.  Fiona Shaw is delightful as the spiteful Aunt Petunia.  Tom Felton has come a long way since appearing with Jodie Foster in ""Anna & the King"" to his role as the hateful Draco Malfoy.  John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander the wand salesman does a nice cameo too.The effects in the film are excellent.  We really believe in Harry's invisibility cloak.  It's such a hoot to see him at night in the restricted section of the library with his hand holding a lantern poking out from under the cloak, as if the hand wouldn't give him away!  The three-headed dog, the plant that smothers and the flying keys are all marvelous effects.The DVD version's second disc takes you on an interesting tour of Hogwarts.  Now, I have to go back and find those deleted scenes!  Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone is thoroughly entertaining.  Relax & have fun!"	5.0	This Century's Peter Pan	2002-12-23	8	7	1

The box is kind of nice, but unless you have it out where people can see, what does that matter?I got this for two reasons: 1) It was supposed to have lots of new scenes, and 2) the digital copy.The ""new scenes"" are okay. Most seem to be the deleted scenes and such from other versions of the movie I already had.The digital copy is a bust. I received the DVDs on the very day they expired, but the system still would not let me download them. I emailed customer service, and got a completely unsatisfactory answer. Basically, if you want their digital copy, don't count on them to give it to you. I now had a useless DVD in a pretty box sitting on a shelf where nobody can see it unless they to looking for it.Was it worth the money? Probably not.

The book was the reason I wanted to see the movie.  The direction and the acting was wonderful.  Everyone did what I went to see the move for--they brought the book to life.  I am sorry that some people couldn't accept the movie for what it was - a vastly entertaining, exciting, and magical 2 1/2 hours.

If that wasn't enough, he soon realizes that there might be more to his existence than he would ever have thought possible...Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!	5.0	EXCELLENT!	2005-04-21	2	2	0

I have been a big fan of Harry Potter for three years now, and I must say that the books are wonderful. The movie...The movie is good. Christopher Columbus is awesome, because he turned the book into almost exactly what I had imagined it would be. And he most definitely has good taste in actors. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson did commendable jobs, but by far the one who stole the show was Rupert Grint, the red-headed kid who does an excellent job portraying Ron Weasley. He's definitely the primo kid. Hasta la vista!	5.0	Cool-umbus did a good job with what he had...	2002-10-21	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A29ON7RAVEIU4P	"Linda ""Linda"""	A truly fun,enchanting film.I have never read the books but the film is great.Harry Potter,the son of a wizard,is left with his evil rellies at birth,after an evil sorcerer kills both of Harry's parents.Only when HP is eleven years old does he discover that he has magical powers,when goaded into anger by his jerk of a cousin.Soon Harry is boarding Platform nine and three quarters and setting off on the Hogwart Express to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft.On the train he meets two other children who are also magical,named Hermione and Roy.I think it was Roy,I can't remember.He swore alot.Once at Hogwarts,Harry,Hermione and Roy must get their hands on the shiny stone that will cause havoc in the hands of that evil guy who knocked off his parents.To do this they must play a dangerous live chess game AND make it past the giant,vicious three-headed dog named Fluffy.(Yes,..Fluffy).There are people who have condemned this movie,due to religion,because of the witchcraft involved.I've been brought up religious but I know that those people are wrong.Harry Potter fights against evil and is always true to good,even when his life is threatened otherwise.He is an empowering character and a terrific role-model for children.	5.0	Harry Potter	2002-12-10	3	2	1

Of special note; my grandson, who is a Harry Potter expert, could only find two or three deviations from the book.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2KSMCH46TL9QF	"Lisa Herbertson ""Author of 'Swimming Along'"""	So as is often the case, this movie isn't as good as the book, but it is still a must buy for the DVD collection. I watched it again recently and was surprised just how young the actors are in this film, compared to later films. They really do a great job and the director is reasonably true to the book. I'm still not convinced Harry potter is actually a kids movie. I think I would have been freaked out as a child. However this first movie is pretty slow moving and has loads of lovely scenes and ideas that kids will just love. Be warned it does get scary in patches.This is a great introduction to the land of magic. We meet Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid, Harry Potter (and his Muggle family), all within the opening minutes; And of course Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger aren't too far behind once Harry gets to Hogwarts. The magic of the first book is brought to life in this first movie, and the best thing I think about it is that it is virtually stand-alone. No previous knowledge is required and nothing but a vivid imagination is needed. It is exactly the sort of movie I would have enjoyed watching as a kid, and it has the same appeal to me today as Disneyland does.	3.0	Not as good as the book	2010-12-12	1	0	1

The sound and diction is excellent as well as the acting, the sets are phenomenal and whoever casted the characters obviously read the book many times because everyone was exactly how I imagined them when I was reading the books. Now I can put in one of the movies and relive the magic of Harry Potter without having to read the book.

Most of the country, and a large percent of the world has read it.  Perhaps thats what took away from the movie, that I knew what was around every corner.  Oh, its not that the actual movie is bad, its just that so many people are familiar with the story already that it doesn't really have the same affect as if you had never heard the plot before.  Using actual places, and incredible graphics to illistrate the story in a realistic way doesn't even begin to compare to our imagination.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Harry Potter is a guilty pleasure.  When I read the books and when I watched the movie, I had to suspend my normal criticism of implausibilities and read the books and watch the movie as an entertaining fantasy; and the movie is ever so entertaining!  Even having read the book, I was still in suspense with the movie, because certain things were given more life in the movie than the book (and vice versa).  I found myself fascinated with each detail, and was readily able to consider the movie as a different version of the book.The actors were perfectly chosen for their roles.  Alan Rickman as Snape was so dislikable and the perfect character to mislead the audience.  Richard Harris was a lovable Dumbledore, and will be sorely missed in the future movies, which there will undoubtedly be.  Warwick Davis of ""Willow"", ""Return of the Jedi"", ""The 10th Kingdom"" and many more played two roles in this movie, and played them very well.  There are many other actors that did so very well, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out the selection of Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, the terminally cute Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and super-nice (at least he comes across that way on the screen, regardless of how many practical jokes and other mischief he performed on the set while making the movie) Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.  These three were able to make the adults wish they were their children, and the children wish they were their friends.  A good deal of the success of this movie is due to the charm of these three young actors.The score completely enhanced the sets and the plot, and brought another dimension to an already multi-dimensional movie.  The special effects were state of the art, evidenced time and again throughout the course of the movie.  The troll and Fluffy I particularly found impressive in their detail and quality.  However, the special effects and their quality are found throughout this movie, and to list all my favorites would take much more than this review.  There are a lot, and they are all very good to excellent.The movie had to deviate from the book due to the length and detail of the book.  However, I believe that the movie caught the essence of Harry's life and attendance at Hogwart's.  The deviations were regrettable, but the movie was already well past 2 hours in length, and the producer was faced with difficult decisions regarding what to keep and what to cut.  The deleted scenes shown in the second CD will show how some of the decisions were made, and I concur with nearly all the choices.Harry Potter is a pure fantasy, creating a world that is based on many worlds, and yet is none of them.  The rules of Harry's world will seem familiar, yet as a set are different from previous rules.  Once you realized that J.K. Rowling was not basing Harry on any known set of rules, but was instead creating her own ""Oz"", the movie and story become enjoyable as a voyage of discovery that parallels Harry's own.  Watch this movie with the eyes of a child and enjoy a unique film experience and achievement."	5.0	Enjoyable Escapist Fantasy	2003-01-24	3	3	0

But I have to admit that the actor who played Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wasn't as good as I expected (altough he did look as I imagined Harry).The backgrounds where great, and they did pay atention to details and that's what makes a movie magical.In the end, I think it's a good movie, worth buying.	4.0	Almost a great movie	2002-07-03	2	0	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A21G1HKUQPHFKI	"Luis M. Ramos ""Soundtrack and Film Freak"""	Granted.  Harry Potter has become one of the most popular literary icons in the world.  The books about a young wizard have done what other books were trying to accomplish: make people read.  I love to read, but I haven't read any Potter book yet.  When I get to read one, maybe my opinion about the movie version of &quot;Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; will be different because I found it to be a little too heavy and dark for a children's fantasy film.  The all-too-British cast do their jobs well, and the children -Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson -make this version watchable.  However, when I saw it in the cinema, I was trying to make myself comfortable in the chair because it was kinda long and dense.  The visual effects are good, and the music by John Williams fits the film perfectly.As for the extras on this DVD, I was a bit disappointed quite frankly because there is only one short documentary in which the actors are interviewed.  The rest are glossaries regarding the world of Harry Potter that, probably, keep the children interested.  As I said before, I have to read at least one of the books.	3.0	The Books May Be Better	2002-07-13	1	0	1

Perhaps I am too old (being 50 this year) but I think the reviews posted miss the point.  I have read the books.  The movie does an amazingly good job of translating a complex story to movie form.  I have seen too many book to screen translations that did not work.  The screenwriter has an unusual sympathy for characters and with the director/editor does a great job of communicating the story as well at setting the stage for future stories.	5.0	Don't we wish we lived in Harry Potters world	2003-04-13	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AHMZEN51O7GS7	M. A. Devlin	Being a big fan of Harry Potter books I really did not enjoy the movie.  There were several casting errors (Maggie Smith comes to mind) but the reason for the low review is this..My 30ish sister rented the DVD to see the extra scenes.  After spending an hour an a half trying to figure out where they were on the DVD she asked me to try to figure it out.  After I couldn't do it (I'm the technowiz in our house) I went online to discover she had to play the game to view them.  Needless to say, after all the packaging and ads screaming &quot;deleted scenes&quot; she was very disappointed.  She was too burned out at this point to play the game so we returned it.	2.0	Poorly put together DVD	2002-06-03	5	4	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3UMR3RM9A9VUC	Maggie	I've been a big fan of the books for quite sometime, and I knew someday a movie would be produced. Now it has. Christopher Columbus has done a wonderful job shaping his cast and weaving magic into this film. It follows the book closely, which, I believe, makes it all the more enjoyable. The cast was carefully chosen and they all performed quite excellently. The cleverness of some of the lines is down right genious. &quot;Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you comes up with another clever idea to get us killed. Or worse! Expelled!&quot; &quot;She needs to sort out her priorities!&quot;  I have to mention Rupert Grint (who plays Ron) most particularly, he did an especially fantastic job. The chess seen was captivating. Daniel Radcliffe was also destined to play the part of Harry Potter, I believe; he has the same birthday! It is a movie for children of all ages; from 8-98, everyone can enjoy it. But I think younger viewers have more of an advantage; they can more easily see and understand all of the magic and it's entirety of the secret world behind Platform 9 and 3/4. I highly recommend this film to all who have an open mind and want to have a good time.	5.0	Can't Get Enough!	2002-06-08	0	0	0

This is a definite plus.With the good come the bad. The deleted scenes are a pain to find. I originally thought I'd been had and it was false advertising. However, once I discovered it was at the end of the game, I felt better.The picture quality is okay but I've seen better. There are moire patterns with the passing Hedwig on the menus and the visual effects are not blended very well. Even my kid said, ""now that looks fake"". Blanching I said, ""yes it does"".As far as the movie goes, the acting was very good. Emma Watson was a little too over-dramatic for my taste but she's the only one. The casting was superb. The set was 'just as I imagined'. Perhaps even better. I liked the dark look about it.I take away a star for the visual effects problem and the Hedwig/Menu/Moire pattern problem.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	Maybe. But this is a somewhat pleasant and unimaginatively flat movie--not the enthralling adventure that some reviewers would have you believe. First, it lacks the dark humor which gave the book life--the Roald Dahl-style sensibility that made you actually indentify with Harry. This movie has little sense of humor at all--and what it has is canned, pure and simple. Second, this film evinces an attitude that all that you really need to be an actor is to be very British. I guess. To be sure, Robbie Coltrane is fine in his role as a feeble-minded giant with a heart of gold, but a better script could have catapolted his role even higher. The kid who plays Harry is entirely unengaging. He brings none of the sly vulnerability to the role that would have made him interesting. Instead, he is this rather bland kid with glasses who effortlessly glides through a plot which cannot produce a single moment of convincing danger. Harry, in other words, is coated in teflon and a bullet-proof suit in this movie--never once do we think any harm is even remotely on the horizon. And if there is no danger, can there be effective drama in a picture like this? No. Halfway through, I found myself looking at my watch. If you think I'm wrong, then you probably haven't seen the Lord of the Rings, which does everything right that Harry does wrong.	3.0	Has a film ever been this over-hyped and overrated?	2002-02-14	2	0	2

My children have watched it about 20 times in the 3 days that we have owned it and I have watched it at least twice.  I had never read the Harry Potter series novels and had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I was not disappointed.  The movie is fast paced and I found it easy to follow.  This movie made me want to purchase the other Harry Potter novels and left me anxiously awaiting a sequel!I did watch the deleted scenes and out takes.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	As a reviewer, I have a tendency to wordiness, and usually look disparagingly at reviews of ten words or less, all in caps, which basically say &quot;WOW!&quot;  This is the first time I have had to struggle with the temptation simply to say something like &quot;ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!  THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!  DON'T COME HOME WITHOUT IT!&quot; and leave it at that.  For one thing, it really is that good.  For another, there is so much to say about it that one's mind boggles at trying to keep within a reasonable limit.  Since there will be countless reviews that discuss plot, effects, and individual performances, I will leave those to others, and focus on some things that I found of special note.The first thing that struck me about the film (other than the fact that I was unable to stop staring at my monitor while it was playing) is the sense of 'rightness' one gets while watching.  What I mean by that is, given a book that has way too many events to capture in a film, the production still manages to have delivered everything that was necessary and sufficient to make it seem true to the original.  This may actually be a first in cinematographic history.  Given a tremendous opportunity to tweak or modify the plot or improve on the character the producers have instead remained almost completely faithful to J. K. Rowling's writing and intent.One of the factors in this is the carefully balanced acting.  Given that the title is &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,&quot; it really should be &quot;Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Draco and even the Weasley's AND the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;  Nobody grandstands, nobody overplays his or her part, and nobody ever goes Hollywood.  Star or part of the background, there is a lack of pretentiousness (except when one is supposed to be pretentious) which makes you really feel like you are looking into the life of a notable student and his friends at Hogwarts.  This invites viewers to immerse themselves in entire tapestry instead of simply hanging on the actions of a particular actor.  And what a tapestry it is!Like the book, the film turns out to be just as meaningful for the old and the young.  The lessons are delivered in easily digestible bits, leaving the flow of the story undisturbed.  Somehow, inside, a part of you knows that maybe, just maybe, you are a little bit better for having watched this film.  Harry's need for family, accomplishment, and self-esteem is no stranger to any of us who seek the courage to face our own 'He Who Shall Not Be Named.'  So 'BRAVO' says this reviewer, 'VERY WELL DONE INDEED.'	5.0	Leaving the Muggles Behind	2002-06-20	34	28	6

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ANBO0H5NDTLI4	Marcy	If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you just as well would enjoy the film version. Well, at least I did.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very magical film. I loved it. The first time I saw it in theatres, I thought it was incredible. It's witty at times and even wonderful at times. I thought it was just the fantasy everyone needed. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy the movie.As fans know, the first installment of Harry Potter is about the young wizard discovering that he is a wizard and is sent to a school called Hogwarts where he meets friends and teachers and becomes sort of a wizard-celebrity because many thought he vanished Voldemort, the guy who gave him a famous scar and killed many, including Harry's parents.The film is a bit too dark for anyone under eight, but I liked this film. For the record, I do not think Chris Columbus ruined Harry Potter because the sets were wonderful. They were exactly the ones readers would imagine if they ever read the book. Columbus, who I am actually a fan of makes the magic of Harry Potter. This is one of my favorite films from the director of family comedies. He kind of breathed life into the Harry Potter at the movies.The acting is pretty one-dimensional. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry Potter - even though probably note the most convincing actor out there, he is actually pretty believable and looks a bit like the imagined-Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is pretty good as Ron Weasley, Harry's best friend and sidekick. But I think the one that really shot through the audiences is probabl young Emma Watson who plays Hermione Granger, Harry's other best friend and female sidekick. The three is pretty good together, walking through the corridors. Looks pretty natural, though. I like the threesome and I think Columbus is pretty good at directing children.The British-supporting cast is pretty good, with the exception of Richard Harris who I believe is Irish? Anyway, I loved Maggie Smith as McGonagall and of course Alan Rickman as Snape (turst me, he is super-funny). I also liked Julie Walters (one of my favorite actresses) as Mrs. Weasley. The cast is just wonderful. I loved the cast.I have seen the film six times so far and I still love it. I won't mind watching it again because it's really wonderful and it's one of my favorite recent fantasy films. It's a magical films and I am guessing many audiences would enjoy it because it's really just-what-you-imagined. Many fans have complained that the first film is a bit sugarcoated, but I still like it! The sugarcoating is done pretty good and it doesn't piss off the readers. Overall, great film, and not a one to be missed.	5.0	A magical journey all fans of the book would enjoy	2005-09-10	6	6	0

But he does not know that, for his mean-spirited aunt and uncle had falsely told him that his parents had 'died in a car-crash'. Of course, there's the fat cousin, too.One day, he discovers all about his parents, his real history, and also about the wonderful school for wizards and witches at Hogwarts when Hagrid, the keeper of keys and something(I forgot) of Hogwarts, meets him on Harry's 11th birthday. Of course, Harry leaves his aunt, uncle, and cousin and goes to Hogwarts with Hagrid.The story goes on about a mysterious stone that makes you live eternally and a three-headed dog that's, obviously, VERY dangerous. It's all very interesting!I think some kids might(MIGHT!) get scared some parts, like the part where the bad guy(not saying who!) shows his two-faced head. Or the part where Harry's opening a book and the face comes roaring out. THAT was surprising and scary in a way. But, it's just my opinion because I got kind of shocked those parts. :)The Quidditch Match was really cool, a little bit silly, but still very cool! I also loved the part where all the foooood comes out(mmmmm!)

But as some people said, this film was a dissapointment.It seriously moved way to fast and dropped too many IMPORTANT elements out from the book. Instead of cutting Hermione's scene with Snape's potions, they could've cut down Seamus's scenes with him exploding his goblet of water and exploding his feather in Charms class to make time for Hermione's scene.There were of course, the good points.  Emma Watson's acting was superb and the quidditch scene was very realistic - not only with the flying scenes but with the points as well. In the book, you can usually tell right away which team was going to win - which is a very slight flaw in JK Rowling's writing skills :) She usually has one team with over a hundred points while the team that you KNOW is going to lose has ten points - the movie equals the points out, adding to the climax and the excitement because you don't know which team is going to win.It's worth watching though, but the book is better by a thousand times.	3.0	Umm...	2002-07-22	1	0	1

The quality of the sound and picture on the Blu-ray was above and beyond the DVD version. The Harry Potter films are definitely worth purchasing on Blu-ray to better appreciate them. I don't automatically purchase movies on Blu-ray, but the elements of the Harry Potter films really stand out on the Blu-ray versions. I would recommend anyone who hasn't purchased the Harry Potter films on Blu-ray (even if you already own the DVD versions) to pick them up. You won't be sorry.	5.0	Harry Potter #1	2011-12-29	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2793L0IS9GXEN	Marilynn Jean Stuart	"With an open mind, this movie can touch the soul of any child and ""the child"" in any adult.  My husband is Catholic.  I'm primarily Buddhist.  He's an attorney.  I'm a speech pathologist.  He's read every Harry Potter book.  I haven't read any.  Nonetheless, we watched the ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" movie together for the first time with sheer delight!  Whether the ""magic"" throughout the movie is perceived as symbolic or real, countless lessons in morality may be derived:  i.e. 1) To take a risk and remove yourself from the same old setting and humdrum routine because you may embark upon the most rewarding experience of your life, 2) To face your personal demons using intuition and having faith that good will prevail, 3) To cherish and reflect upon your past without holding on, 4) To accept your areas of weakness, to maximize your areas of strength, and to encourage and rely on the strengths of others, 5) To stay focused on your own ball in the ""game of life"" because your objectives may not be the same others, and by obtaining your objectives, you help others achieve their own goals, 6) To cease judgment upon those individuals or things that ""appear evil"" because to your surprise, they may turn out to be quite the opposite... and as I mentioned earlier, countless other lessons... But regardless of what you absorb from Harry Potter, it's inevitable not consider the movie as suspenseful as it is humorous.  The acting was superb, the special effects were impressively imaginative, and I recommend every teacher and parent out there to take advantage of the popularity of this story.  It is utterly a GOLDMINE for language-based activities.  TWO THUMBS UP from both Hubby and me... and with flying colors, Harry Potter passed the virtually impossible criteria for our ""repeat watch"" list!"	5.0	Catholic, Buddhist, Witch...

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Now here's something you don't see every day - a movie that is faithful to the book.11 year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is an orphan living with his uncle and aunt.  They treated him barely better then a servant.All that changes one day when he finds out that he's a wizard.  Suddenly, he's introduced to a world that he doesn't know yet where he's famous.  Before it all really sinks in, he's off to Hogwarts for his first year of schooling in the art of magic.There, he makes friends with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).  But he also makes enemies in the form of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), a snobbish student.  He evens seems to have attracted the negative attention of one of the teachers.But under all the fun, a serious danger lurks.  And Harry is stumbling upon the pieces.  Will he figure it out?  What can an inexperienced wizard do against overwhelming powers?This movie was my introduction to Harry's world.  Now I'm going back and watching it again after having read the books.  I was pleased to see just how faithful it really was to the story.  It tried to stay as true as it could to the book.  The set, costumes, and special effects all worked well to bring the world of the books to vivid life.But that faithfulness is also the movie's downfall.  Outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, none of the characters get much in the way of development.  Additionally, the story takes a while to really get going.  This is a flaw with the book as well, so I can't blame this only on the movie.Even with those complaints aside, it's wonderful to see this imaginative series brought to such vivid and accurate life.  Fans of the books will be pleased.	4.0	Faithful Book Adaptation	2007-06-05	3	3	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1W1EBMLCZB7BG	Mark Horton	Let's make this short and sweet. After buying this exact DVD from Amazon, I have played it over and over. The DVD extras are worth the price alone as you can do everything Harry did before getting to Hogwarts. The trivia games will test even the most astute Harry-phile. Not to mention the movie itself is fantastic. After seeing it in theaters, I went out and bought the first three novels in paperback and read each cover to cover. Now I wait for Book Four to be released in paperback, so I can continue my Harry Potter story following. All in all, this movie is fantastic as it doesn't leave hardly anything out from the book. My only sadness is that Chris Columbus will not be directing the third installment, as I feel he has a real knack for this series. So buy it, enjoy it, and as the commercial says...BRING THE MAGIC HOME.	5.0	A DVD Even Harry Would Be Proud Of	2002-06-09	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A35ZP20KIXA6EB	Martha A Williams	"The Harry Potter series of books has been one of the most enjoyable pieces of communication tools between my son and I since, my son was 11 years old. My son is now 14 years old.We have read the books, frequently listen to the audio versions read by Jim Dale, and own each of the movies (DVD) released to date. Quite frankly, in my opinion, neither of the movies can compare, or exceed the magical rendition of Jim Dale's reading of the adventures.We agree with a previous reviewer, that the Sorcerer's Stone movie loses the true feeling of her book, its pace, and its charm. We too really didn't understand the sensless changes made for the movie, like changing the color of the Dursley's hair, from Light to Dark. And just why did the ""bearly acceptable"" Hagrid have to blurt out, ""your a wizard Harry"" in such a deflating fashion.In my opinion any director of any of the Potter movies will be hard pressed to capture the true feeling of the book on film. I challenge any to compare with Jim Dales' audio reading.(PLEASE!!)In all fairness without a doubt, the movie in a way the books could not, brought to life the Quidditch game. Overall, We think this movie would make a good addition to one's Potter library, but it is totally unnecessary for one to see it to capture the true Potter magic."	3.0	From Brunette to Blonde - Why?!	2004-01-31	3	2	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2ZNNVYKIAHUKF	Martin	The movie is a good adaptation of the book.  It captures the story and the spirit well.  However, even at over 2 and a half hours long the movie can't capture the intricacies of the original (book) storyline.  While the book is a children's story (according to everyone but Rowling) that is written well enough to keep the average adult reading, the movie has had to be simplified too much.  It ends up being just a kids' movie.  It's a pretty good kids' movie but it doesn't live up to the hype ... or the book	4.0	Good, but...	2002-09-01	1	0	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1320EJP4UKC6Q	Maryann	I think everyone was way to critical of this movie. First of all, any book adapted to the screen will be lacking. Endings have been changed, characters have been altered and the actor usually playing your favorite character is not the person you envisioned in your mind. Second, scenes had to be omittied. It's a 300 page book with more twists and turns than most writers could imagine. Had every detail been left in, we would have sat in the theater for a good 4 hours at least. Which is fine with most adults, but imagine trying to keep your 5 year old interested. Third, I was thrilled that they picked inexperienced child actors. It wouldln't have been nearly as believeable had they used Hollywood born and raised kids who know no emotion but the scripted ones. Fourth, it was done the way the author saw it fit to be done. She oversaw every detail of every shot. Who's to argue with that? I loved the movie. I loved it more each time I saw it. It made the magic come to life for me and made me realize how angry I was that I didn't get a letter from Hogwart's on my birthday. It was phenomenal.

By then I had already grown a love for the book and went on to read the others.  When I heard that the movie was coming out I reread the book to make sure that I would remember everything that they put into the movie from the book.  When I saw the movie I was a bit unhappy.  Yes the effects were great.  I was very disappointed with the ending though.  Each room is supposed to have a different teacher's trick in it to stop whoever tries to get the stone but many were left out.  Snape's potion room with the accompanying riddle was forgotten as well as the troll.  All of the friends had part in getting Harry to the stone and the mirror.  Hermione was supposed to stay with Harry until the potions room where she takes the potion to go back while Harry takes the potion to go foreward.  Overall it is alright, these portions mentioned are very key to the story and would not have harmed the movie sales if anything it would have made it more popular to the hardcore book lovers like myself.	3.0	Left out or forgotten??	2002-04-23	3	1	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3U02XWSCEESPP	Mary L Wagner	This movie was a nearly perfect adaptation of the book. Everything and everyone looked and sounded just right. The people who have problems with the book will have similar problems with the movie, so faithfulness was definitely the right choice. But some of the things that work well in print, i.e. Dumbledore's exposition, tend to drag on screen. Simply talking faster would have helped - even children can hear faster than people can talk. Daniel Radcliffe is a very talented young actor. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson still make some typical &quot;child actor&quot; mistakes, but they are relatively few, and hopefully the director won't include so many &quot;gulps&quot; from Ron in the next movies. And all the adults are perfectly cast, especially Alan Rickman as Snape.Jumping through hops to find  the deleted scenes in the DVD was very annoying. The game itself might have been fun, but for an adult, being required to play was ludicrous.	4.0	Magic Realized	2003-07-08	3	3	0

Richard Harris(God rest him) came off as a little too grandfatherly for my vision of the character.I thought Snape was right on as was Mcgonical(sp) and somewhat Hagrid.The children were almost there.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	Harry Potter has quickly established itself as one of the most valubable franchises in the world. This is one of the best family movies of this new century and it moderns classic fantasy movie tales like the Wizard of Oz. It's so good because it stays true to it's roots and it dosn't offend the original book.Harry Potter(Radcliffe) has no idea that he's a wizard. He has no idead that as a baby he stoped the most evil dark lord wizard the world has ever known. Harry lives with his mean Aunt and Uncle along with their son Dudley who hate him because he ins't normal. After letters start appearing at the home inviting Harry to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft he starts to realize things might not be what they seem to be.Harry is rescued by his mean family by Hadgrid(Coltran). He arrives at Hogwars almost an instant celebrity because of his defeat of Voldemort as a child. He quickly becomes friends with an outcast Ron Weasley(Grint) and miss know it all Hermoine(Watson). The three develop a quick friendship and are all the three really have. Trouble starts to arise at the school though and because I don't want to spoil the details for you, but it's up to the three to save the day.One of the reasons this movie is so good is because of the awesome cast. All three of the big young kids are perfect. Radcliffe got hand selected from thousands of kids who wanted the part and he's a good child actor. A lot of kids stuggle with such big roles. Look how much Jake Elliot struggled in The Phantom Menace. So much is on there shoulders and Radcliffe picks the ball up and runs with it. He's perfect as Potter.All the adults are casted perfectly also. Alan Rickman is great as Snape. This guy can flat out act and you have to love him in the film. He is so awesome. I like Richard Harris as Dumbeldore. This was one of the last performances of his legendary carear and it's great.Chris Columbus did a great job with this film. This guy was perfect for the movie. He's done blockbuster family films like Home Alone and Mrs.Doubtfire and he can add this one to the list. He shot the movie well and made it an instant family classic.A lot of respect has to be given to Steven Kloves. He wrote the script for the movie based of the writings form J.K. Rowling. He stayed true to her book and didn't offend her or the fans. To many writers do that way to often and it's glad to see it not be done.If you want to sit down with your family and watch a great family movie than this is it. It's a modern day classic Wizard of Oz and is a great tale of friendship and love. Two qualities we need more of in this world.	5.0	A modern day wizard of Oz	2004-05-27	4	4	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AV5X7F4K4ICFX	Matthew	Steve Kloves ought to be commended for his adaption of Rowling's novel.  The writing is really excellent, as is several other attributes of this movie.  Daniel Radcliffe (voice cracking and all) was convincing in the title role.  What I found to be missing was some sense of risk on the part of director Chris Columbus.  Granted that taking too many liberties with the story would have incited riots from the legion of  kids who worship these stories, I felt Columbus did a very mediocre job injecting this film with any sort of personal style.  As with his other films, both the hilarious Mrs. Doubtfire, and the horrible Bicentenial Man, Chris Columbus has displayed his penchant for very conservative, &quot;by the numbers&quot; direction.  Where directors like David Fincher and Terry Gilliam are such that one could view one of their movies, without knowing it was theirs, and instantly recognize the style, I don't think Columbus has ever made a movie I could watch and think &quot;yup, that's Chris Colubus film.&quot;  It's sad that the producers of this film felt the need to go the sure route and come up with a pretty good film, instead of a riskier path and maybe come up with something truly magic.	4.0	Can writing and acting save a mediocre director?	2002-09-09	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"The staggering success of J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter novels put enormous pressures on the producers of the movie version of the first book in a the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". This was the most eagerly anticipated movie based on a book since ""Gone With the Wind"" sixty-two years ago.I am happy to report that the movie turns out to be quite good. If it has a problem, it is that it is too slavishly faithful to the book. This prevents the movie from soaring to the great heights a visual medium can reach on its own terms and makes it run a bit too long. Two and one-half hours is a long time for most kids to sit still; however, there are enough sights and thrills here for most of them to tolerate its length happily.For those of you who don't know, Harry Potter [Daniel Radcliffe] is an orphan who lives in the cupboard under the stairs of his uncaring relatives' suburban home. One day he and his guardians are inundated by letters [delivered by owls!] which say that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts School. This is how Harry finds out that he's a wizard. After much magical persuasion, Harry gets to go to Hogwarts. There, he meets wizards and witches, sorcerers and trolls, and other fantastic creatures. For the first time ever, Harry feels like he's at home. There are a lot of happy, magical moments at the school, but there are also dangerous ones. Among them are a dark wood that students are never to enter, an evil professor, some not-so-nice fellow students, and a demon that wants Harry dead. Harry and his new best friends, Ronald and Hemione [Rupert Grint and Emma Watson], are in for many fantastic adventures.The excellent cast includes some of Britain's best actors, including the legendary Maggie Smith as Minerva and Richard Harris as Demeledore.  Robbie Coltrane is remarkable as Hadrid, the loveable giant who is always doing and saying the wrong things, and so is Alan Rickman as the nasty Professor Snape. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are gifted young actors and play their characters without the annoying cuteness that is found in many kids' movies.Some of the special effects are amazing, especially the flying Quiddich game sequences and one involving an encounter with a giant chess set that comes to life. Many of the effects don't look lifelike, but, considering the movie's big budget, this may have been done on purpose, in order to give the movie a fantasy, dream-like look.Some of the movie may be too intense for very young children. This has always been a problem with movies, though. When I was five or six, I was totally traumatized by the wicked queen and her poisoned apple in Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"". I don't like apples to this day. But, then, I was pretty high on the wimp scale."	4.0	Faithful, well-made film version of the bestseller	2002-06-01	2	1	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1WBZQGB841KYU	Matthew Roth	This movie upped my respect for Mr. Columbus, and the the DVD helped me accept these overpriced home-movie systems. To take a story to a more easily accesable media and simply repeat it would negate the purpose of the origonal, so those who disliked it simply because it didn't hug the plot of the book close enough, just think about it from another angle for a sec'. Anyway, the movie is beautifully crafted and a boon to the entire industry. If you by chance have not seen it YET you ought to. It realy is worth a handfull of hours. As for the DVD itself, the cut sceens are enchanting and watching it with the spanish dubbing is amusing and probably a little educational. Back to general movie info, I have to comment on the music. It hearkens back to Mr. Columbus's earlier work &quot;Hook&quot; and did nothing but enhance the other-worldly setting. The casting was dead-on, matching my personal mind's-eye picture perfectly, barring none. I, along with my fellow Harry Potter enthusiests, eagerly await the continued release of movies and books. To Miss Rowling, the companion books are approprietly wonderfull and I have duely bought my coppy of &quot;Quiddage Through the Ages&quot; and the others. Harry Potter isn't just for kids.

My sister did, however, and I heard all these strange words: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Diagon Alley, Nimbus 2000, Qudditch???  Umm... yeah... sounds... interesting.  So, I avoided the books.  Yet, for some unkown reason, I went along with my family to see the theatrical release.  In a single word, it was excellant.  Great acting.  Interesting storyline.  Excellant movie. I watched it 5 times.  After my first viewing, I had already started reading the books.  And of course, I had a copy of the DVD pre-ordered.Now, for some thoughts on the DVD.  I am not going to get into the differences between the book and the movie.  Many forget that the movie is based on the book.  As such, I regard the two as seperate entities.  The movie covered much of the important parts in the book.  All of the cast was great.  I am glad that Chris Columbus got the directing part over Speilburg.  Columbus picked some very talented, British actors and actresses to fill the roles.  My favorite actress in the movie was Maggie Smith.  The storyline was very interesting and the sights were simply amazing.  Columbus did a great job in bringing the world of Harry Potter to life.My only dislike about the DVD is the poor accompaniment of additional features.  There was little commetary and the deleted scenes were very difficult to find.  I had to go to the message board ...to find that out (It was also disapointing to find 7 relatively short deleted scenes after all that work too).  And finally, I wanted more information about the making of the movie, interviews with the cast, and sneak previews of Chamber of Secrets.  Despite these dislikes, I still give five stars to the DVD for containing one of the best movies that I have ever seen.	5.0	Great Movie	2002-06-08	1	1	0

The movie's special effects help draw the watcher into the Hogwarts School and also Harry's home and really begin to understand the magic behind the mystery. Every piece of the movie was very imaginative and creative to help draw in the people like myself....that just didn't get it. And now I have bought the movie and watch it all of the time. Many movies just don't go to the extent that this movie went into. And with the many unique characters help inhance the movie to bring in both children and adults to this magical world.

It tells the story of a boy who is adopted by foster parents who are very mean to hem and do not let hem know anything about his real parents. Or who he really is. But one day he gets a lot of letters that his foster parents try to keep from hem. That are invitations to Hogwarts, a school for young witches and wizards.

The story is told in the most interesting ways possible, keeping me entertained to the max, even though I had no idea what to expect, and seeing a film that wasnt really aimed at me.Harry Potter is the type of movie that makes your forget you live in reality, which in itself is the most fun you could have for 2 hours.It has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, in the way of it being a fantasy film.  It doesnt need to explain why things are happening the way they are.  They happen, and your happy with that.The characters are all very likable even the sinsister ones.  Alan Rickman seems to be having the most fun as the villan Snape.Like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter has the sequel vibe all through it.  2 hours is clearly not enough time for the plot be be filled.  However this movie uses its time very wise, and doesnt drag at any point.The special effects are excellent.  We know brooms cant fly, and there are no two headed monsters, but if there were... maybe this is what they would look like.  There is a scene where the charcters are pawns on a chess board, the effects look like something out of Jumangi.All in all, I had a big smile on my face in the end, as I turned to my nephew we both had the same idea....""Let's get back in line""."	5.0	Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings,  2 Pleasant surprises	2002-03-13	3	2	1

(I'm quite leery of books that get made into movies as they tend to loose the story somewhere in exchange for special effects; ala Star Wars Ep 1&2, but that's a whole other rant.)Anyways, I fell in love with the story as I saw it unfold on screen. At that point I was itching to go read the book. To my delight I found that there were 4 books. I have not read so much in such a small amount of time.After reading the first book, I decided that was shown in the movie, with the restrictions that movie makers have, that it told the story as best as it could without compromising any of the important story elements.When the DVD went into development, I heard that deleted scenes would be added on a second disk and a whole bunch of other interesting tid bits. ...So the mail comes, I'm eating my cake, my 4 year old niece is with me and her Mom when I pop in the 2nd DVD with the deleted scenes. I had read that there were a bunch of hoops (like playing a game) that one had to do to get to these much wanted scenes, but I'm pretty savvy with technology that I figured I could figure it out.Much to my chagrin the people who made this DVD need to go back to marketing school and think about the fact that the 4 year old was BORED to tears with the way the 2nd disk was set up.I finally found the instructions on how to access the 7 deleted scenes ...The main gripes I have with the DVD are these:1. Wide screen and anamorphic format should have been options (removed the label on one side of the DVD and this is possible.)2. Make all extras easily accessible INCLUDING DELETED SCENES. Jumping through hoops is not only frustrating to adults, but especially to children.3.Include more deleted footage instead of all the ""games"". If I wanted to play a games the online or pay for versions are options that I can go buy.4. As with The Matrix, Moulin Rouge!, or The X-Men DVD include a version of the film that allows you to follow a white rabbit or green fairy (perhaps an owl?) where it then takes you to a deleted scene as it would fall in the order of the film or some behind the scene related *to* the scene option.I was so hopeful that the DVD would have more, just as the book had ""more"" for me when I was finished watching the movie. 7 deleted scenes was not enough IMO.However, in defense of those scenes, I will say that the extended potions class scene gives a greater depth to the Snape/Potter dynamic. Also, seeing the scene where Harry is thinking about his parents after discovering the mirror almost brought me to tears.In closing, I loved the story, the movie was great, but as DVD,  kinda bites. I hope that a better one comes out soon!"	3.0	Great movie; lousy DVD	2002-05-28	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A17LSEN4UY4XZQ	M. Daneker	Chris Columbus has got to be the worse successfull director in history. His camera is still, his shots boring, his pacing perplexing and his lighting banal. The problem with this movie is him, he is not making a movie, just filming a book. The problem is, you can't film a book you have to adapt it to a visual medium, this is not a visual man working here. Want to understand my POV, then read this book & Fellowship of the Ring, then go watch the two films. Both are faithful adaptations, but one is interesting, one boring. I can't wait for the third film and finally, a new director.The bright spot, the cast. The kids are great, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is perfect, but if you notice, Daniel Radcliff, Harry, get's very little good dialogue, he's like a supporting player in his own film.As for the DVD. The deleted scenes should be in an extended version, not hidden behind some inane game you have to play to watch them on the second disk. ... How about a real, decent documentry next time? A real extra we don't have to waste precious minutes of our lives looking for.	3.0	Close adaptation, stunted direction	2003-06-21	2	1	1

Nothing could top the magic of the book - pun totally intended. But the actors did a good job, especially Alan Rickman - gah, he makes such an awesome Snape!!!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"It took me until the release of Half Blood Prince before I started reading the Harry Potter books, and then finished them all within a month. Then I had to get the films - I swear Harry Potter has become my latest obsession! Even though I hated the first book with a passion, the film was so much better, although it does drag in the middle. And obviously there's gonna be a lot missing from the books, but minor bits so far - I dread to think how much is going to be cut from the films in the later ones!What had me transfixed about this movie was a very small thing - that recurring theme that keeps playing. I love it! It sounds like a lullaby, or even the tunes that play in one of those jewellery boxes that you have as a kid (I did anyway). It's also the tune that is played to send Fluffy to sleep, and Hagrid is also seen playing it at one point. I have never loved a piece of music in a film before as much as I do this one.The actors in this are brilliant and even the kids are quite good. I'm definitely gonna be crushing on Daniel Radcliffe in the later films by the looks of it! I do hope the kids get to play Harry, Ron & Hermione right through to the very last film. I also love the little characters that appear, although some of the ghosts didn't turn up as much - I do hope Peeves (played by Rik Mayall) appears in the later films, as I loved him. I loved the way John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) appears, although I originally mistook him for Billy Connolly! And I loved Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane, and I was fascinated by the way they managed to film him looking so much bigger - can I please borrow his platforms?! Although if you look closely in the very first scene where he appears, he looks a normal size. Robbie's 6'10"" body double for Hagrid is former England rugby international, Martin Bayfield. I must applaud JK for making sure all the cast were British in this, apart from a few exceptions: Richard Harris was Irish, and Zo Wanamaker, though she has made her name as a ""British"" actress, is actually a US citizen. Alan Rickman, although having a very small role initially, was fabulous as Snape, although he seemed to be wearing more makeup than I do on an average day. Did anyone else notice the look he gives Malfoy in the first Potions class?Steven Spielberg was originally offered the role as director, but can you imagine he actually wanted Hayley Joel Osment to play Harry? I just cannot imagine that working!I hated the fact that the film & book were changed in the US, from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone. It's so stupid, and I do hope they don't change any of the other names. And the region 1 has a better cover.I hope some of the later films get a higher rating, as the later books get more adult orientated. The word 'bloody' appears in the film six times, along with one 'arse', one 'bugger', and two 'blasted's. This, and some apparently scary scenes in the haunted forest, led to its PG certificate. Frankly, they were not that scary!Most of the stuff transferred well from print to film, especially Quidditch & Platform 9 3/4. While the movie used Platforms 4 and 5 at Kings Cross to represent platforms 9 and 10, there is, in fact a ""Platform 9 3/4"" at Kings Cross. It's located in the walkway area between the intercity section and the section where the real platforms 9 and 10 are, and was obviously put there for fans of Harry Potter.I have to say, I would have preferred a bigger glimpse into the classes, we really don't see many of the classes, or the different passwords to get into the dormitories. (I HATE that word.) I suppose this was unnecessary to show in the films. And I don't remember the staircases moving in the books though? And why did we never see the history teacher who was a ghost? I physically hate Tom Felton, who plays Draco - he's just the kinda face that only a mother would love (in the film!), especially with that slicked back hair.This is a DVD where the extras are hyped up loads, and fail miserably to deliver. I thought they were lousy. Why were there no interviews with the stars? Why did we have to listen to Chris Columbus babble on, with a bunch of other people we don't care about? Why was the adventure 'game' so hard to get through? The extras are way too complicated for a child to get through, just to see some deleted scenes - some of which should have been left in - and I ended up severely frustrated, when I couldn't get through the Potions class. And the transfiguration 'class' is nothing.I'm definitely going to be watching the next 2 DVDs very soon, and I'm going to lose myself in the Harry Potter world. Now I just have to wait `til November for the fourth film, and god knows when for the last book!"	4.0	A lot better than the book, but a lot missing	2005-09-04	4	2	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1CB387BDVSVOE	Meghann McCoy	I had never been so hyped about a book becoming a movie until the Harry Potter series.  I was surprised to see how close the movie was to the book, though it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen.The acting among the younger group wasn't too bad, but the legends such as Richard Harris and Alan Rickman were remarkable, making their characters come to life.  The special effects weren't that impressive--the Quidditch scenes were cool, but a little too obvious that they weren't real.  And the troll in the girls' bathroom...well...that speaks for itself.  In spite of that, it was a great movie that anyone of any age can enjoy.The one thing I must rant about is the bonus features disc.  It might be appealing to a younger child who enjoys games, but for an older person who is looking for behind-the-scenes features, this is not it.  The entire disc is mostly a game where you go to Diagon Alley to buy your wand and such and it's nearly impossible to find the deleted scenes.  Also, the 15-minute interview with the crew wasn't worth the time to watch.  But, then again, a kid who enjoys playing games would find the bonus features entertaining.	4.0	Great transition; terrible bonus features	2003-06-28	2	2	0

The only movie that is even close to the running with this one is ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.""Harry Potter had, what I thought to be, a magical atmosphere that simply beckoned to you to sit on the edge of your sit (like when you were 7 or 8 and you went and saw Star Wars) and get totally lost in it all.Although I was disappointed that they didn't really persue the emnity between Harry and Malfoy, or show the album full of wizarding pictures of Harry's family, they nonetheless stayed VERY close to the plot, the time sequence and the magic.I loved the cast of HP&TSS.; They picked the perfect Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Profs Dumbledore, Snape and Quirrell. I was a little disappointed in who they picked for Prof McGonagall. Not that I don't LOVE the actress that played her, I just thing that McGonagall should have been much younger... even though actress Maggie Smith was perfect in her portrayal of McGonagall's attitude.I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to come out next Fall.

One example; John Hurt is normally a good character on screen, and he should have been in this, also, especially as the fun character that the wand-seller in the book was. He wasn't. It was one of the most boring scenes in the movie. I only give it two stars because of the Quidditch match.Thanks Chris, for putting Harry Potter images into my head which are far less stimulating than my own imagination.	2.0	More energy than a tub of dead fish	2002-02-06	7	1	6
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A12DP14GPRZF7E	M. E. Volmar	This is the film version of J. K. Rowling's novel by the same name, the first in the Harry Potter Series. It's an imaginative, fascinating, fun-filled, awe-inspiring movie for all ages, regardless of whether you've read the books or not. (As a matter of fact it was watching this movie that I fell into the Potter mania and started devouring all the books).You will love everything about the movie including the strong characters with their down-to-earth attitude inside their magical worlds and the fascinating possibilities and intricate plots and sub-plots presented in this movie and developed through the series. You'll also enjoy the brilliantly used visual effects, the fantastic scenery, the emotional musical score and, of course, the enchanting, captivating, and sometimes amusing, magic that will take you away to a bewitching place.In this movie Harry discovers, under very unusual circumstances, on his eleventh birthday, that he is a Wizard. He leaves the normal world of Muggles (non-magical folk) where he lives with his Aunt and Uncle and goes to Hogwarts School to be trained in Witchcraft and Wizard. He meets new friends, learns what happened to his parents who died when he was a baby, faces the evil Voldemort for the first time, and shows his courage, bravery and determination trying to prevent the Sorcerer's Stone from falling into the wrong hands.Not only does this movie faithfully captures the world J. K. Rowling created in her books, it also enhances it as only a well made film adaptation can. The actors are so well picked and their performances are so compelling that you'll never read any of the books without imagining the actors in the roles they played.Don't believe the criticism that accuses Harry Potter of being a bad influence on kids and religion before giving it a chance. You will see for yourself that it is not. It is a good-natured story for children (and adults, too) about a group of good-natured characters that face difficult situations and have to put their values and principles to the test in order to triumph over the obstacles they face.Buy this movie and enjoy it with your children and/or the kid inside you.

Gonya ""rawker"""	It's a little embarassing admitting you like a kids movie or book but there should be no shame in watching the Sorcerer's Stone... or reading it for that matter. The movie follows the book suprisingly well, although I believe if I had not read the book first some of the mystery of the movie would have just been confusion. All of the kids in the movie work well together. The acting isn't Oscar material, of course, but for a fun family movie it works. Since the young actors did do so well together I would have liked to seen the deleted scenes added into the movie. The special effects are believable and makes the Quidditch scene great. It does run pretty long for a movie aimed at younger viewers but being an older, more patient viewer, I wouldn't of minded if it made a whole 3 hours.As for the DVD, they could have done a little better. I found it was geared more toward children. You have to go through hoops just to see the 7 deleted scenes. The Interview with the director and others that helped make the movie is about the only redeamable part of the second disc. Maybe I'm too old now to appreciate it but, some of the features on second disc seem a little lame even for kids to enjoy. I would have been pleased with one disc featuring a commentary and one decent documentary although it probably wouldn't play as well to kids.All in all this is a good movie and the second DVD shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of the movie. It is a fun movie that both children and adults can get into...just like the books!	4.0	Good Movie, Weak DVD.	2002-08-21	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1UYNO24EXETXE	M. G ORELL	The title says it all boyos. This is an amazing movie. It was so thrilling that I was shocked to discover that I didn't remember half of the dialogue. Emma Watson was such a babe. I can't believe they're replacing her, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Now I know how people felt when Sean Connery threw in the towel after he did You Only Live Twice. They should have mentioned that you had to find the Sorcerer's Stone to see the deleted scenes. All of these deleted scenes should have been kept in the movie except for the eggs scene. These scene could have made the movie more faithful. They could have had Harry and Hagrid talking about the dragon thing as they walking to the Leaky Cauldron. This movie definitely stays faithful to the book. It has some dialogue that wasn't in the book but it was worth it. In case you don't know who Warwick Davis is, he played Wicket, the Ewok, in Return of the Jedi, and Wald, one of Anakin's friends, in The Phantom Menace. In case you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm referring to two Star Wars films. Daniel Radcliffe is equally amazing. You can hardly tell he was lipsyncing in some scenes (his voice was changing). I'm almost certain that they shot the scene with the letters flying all over the place last because his voice sounds different. I am so mad that John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick) had an almost cameo role in that movie. I pray that they'll use him in the next movies and I hope that they write some dialogue for him in The Prizoner of Azkaban. I don't think that Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is going to be used for all of the movies. Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) has become quite famous here in America. She recently finished the movie, Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. I have two final complaints, one minor and one major, and the major one comes first. I can't believe that Harry Potter didn't get a nomination for Best Picture. The actors in the movie didn't get nominated for Best Leading Actor or Actress or Best Featured Actor or Actress. Emma Watson's performance deserved an Award for Best Actress. My final complaint is that the DVD has no audio commentary. Maybe, I'll find it. Maybe, it's an Easter Egg.	5.0	H.I.M.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"The year 1997 was the beginning of a literary phenomenon with the release of the first Harry Potter book entitled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (a.k.a. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"") by J.K. Rowling.  Following the release of the fourth book in the series (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") in 2000, Warner Brothers released the first Harry Potter film titled based upon the first book in 2001.  Directed by Chris Columbus, the film received a lot of assistance from J.K. Rowling herself and remained very true to the original book, but with several changes, artistic interpretation and editing.The story is about an 11 year old boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is an orphan being raised by his very unpleasant Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw).  Unknown to Harry, he has magical powers and occasionally (and unknowingly) makes things happen that greatly upset the Dursley's.  However, the Dursley's know that Harry has magical powers because Harry's deceased parents (James and Lily Potter, played briefly by Adrian Rawlins and Geraldine Somerville) were a wizard and a witch.  A very powerful wizard named Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) had left the infant Harry on the Dursley's doorstep following his parents' deaths.  The Dursley's own son, Dudley (Harry Melling), is the same age as Harry and treats Harry very badly.Upon Harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter: something that has never happened before.  The Dursley's won't let him open the letter and become very upset when they read it, but more letters begin to arrive for Harry.  In spite of Uncle Vernon's efforts, Harry finally gets to read the letter when Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane as the groundskeeper at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) bursts in to personally deliver Harry's letter, which is his invitation to attend Hogwarts.  Harry at first doesn't believe that he is a wizard, but agrees to leave with Hagrid and his life is never the same again.  He learns about muggles, goblins, wizards, witches and magic.  He also gets to meet Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Professor Quirrel (Ian Hart), the unpleasant Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and a host of other wizards, witches, ghosts and other creatures.Watching this film and its sequel based upon the second book (""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"") inspired me to start reading the Harry Potter books.  I was very impressed with the amount of detail in the book that did not make its way into the feature film and understood how much the film deviated from the original story.  One of the biggest differences is the amount of attention given to characters in the book that only had minor roles in the film including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), the Weasley twins (James & Oliver Phelps) and Dudley Dursley.  Also, a few characters in the book don't appear in the feature film at all.  The other major difference between the story presented in the feature film and the book is changing of when things are said and done, which is understandable considering the length of the film.  (It took me about 8 hours to read the book as compared to watching the film, which is 2.5 hours long.)Memorable scenes in the film include Harry under the Dursley's stairs, Hagrid's arrival at the lighthouse, Diagon Alley, the train station, Harry & Ron meeting Hermione, the boats, Harry's first class with Professor Snape, the Quidditch match, raising the feather, the mirror, the forest, Fluffy, the keys, and the ending scenes.  Overall, I rate ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone."	5.0	"""You're a wizard Harry."" ""I'm a what?"""	2003-06-10	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ	"M. Hind ""daria_m"""	"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter book series.  I did sincerely hope that the movie would follow the book, because many big screen book adaptators take creative license to visualize their own interpretation.  In other words, they mess it up.  Overall, I was pleased with the first book's giant leap to the big screen, in spite of a few minor discrepancies.First of all, every actor hired to play a part in this movie was perfectly suited for his or her role.  Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter!  If I ever see him on the street, where he will undoubtedly be mobbed by thirteen-year-old girls, I will probably slip up and call him Harry a few times!  I do hope that little guy becomes a big star and not just the next Macaulay Culkin.  He seems like a good kid.As I was saying, now when I read the other novels, I can picture these actors and actresses in my mind.  Bravo to the casting directors for giving accurate visual representations of the characters.  And another bravo to the actors themselves for doing an excellent job all around.The special effects in this film were fantastic, especially in the Quidditch scene.  It is SO much better to see this game played out on the big screen than to read about it in the book.  You can never quite see the action in your head while reading, so this movie pieces that scene together for you.  That is why I call this movie ""a great supplement to the book.""  It fills in gaps where your imagination may not have been so strong.This film is destined to be a kid-movie classic, right alongside films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""  Not many kid-movies are for kids anymore ...but this one is relatively safe to show in schools on Movie Day Friday or during recess.  ""Harry Potter"" has brought a little respectability back to the children's films genre.The story is great and magical with some very true-to-life themes about uniqueness, bravery, and friendship.  Yes, there were a few moments that didn't stick to the book, namely Hermione's exclusion from the final challenge, but I couldn't help but feel like the movie at least did the book justice.  I understand that screenwriting is a difficult process that does not allow for everything in a book to be included in the film version.  That's the way it goes.As far as the DVD is concerned, the movie transfer and sound is very excellent, but the special features aren't so special.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes, but I did not enjoy the mess of a maze I had to endure to unlock them.  A word to the wise: find a website that specializes in DVD easter eggs.  Print out the directions to finding the deleted scenes and follow them to save time and frustration.In the meantime, enjoy this first installment in what will prove to be a very profitable franchise.  I know lots of people, myself included, who are DYING to see ""Chamber of Secrets.""  It's addictive!"	5.0	A phenomenal, surprisingly good movie	2002-08-14	3	3	0

And the filmmakers have created a wonderfully imaginative vision of the world of magic and sorcery.  Director Chris Columbus heads the technical crew with amazing special effects, wonderful costumes and scenery and a rousing score by the inimitable John Williams.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are a captivating trio of child actors, and the supporting cast is superb:  Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Julie Walters, etc.  While the movie is longish, over two and a half hours, you never lose your interest and it is overall a ""classic"" style of film that should appeal to even those of us who aren't on the Harry Potter bandwagon.

So many were originally published on paperback, appealed to a wide audience and ended up being a classic, have since seen a producer attempting to do the same justice to it on the big screen.If every scene and every detail were to be reflected onto screenplay, then a movie could extend to many more hours than most would be willing to endure for a children's story.The inverse is also true. A movie originally written for the screen would require additional efforts by writers to convert a script into a novel.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a children's classic. The script writers did an excellent job of converting the original classic to something that is manageable, viewable and enjoyable to the wider audience.This is a movie well worth keeping in your video/DVD library and one which is sure to delight kids of all ages, as classics often do.Highly recommended.	4.0	Novel adapted to the big screen	2002-03-30	22	15	7

The kids are relatively colorless and adults who seem perfectly cast (from Alan Rickman to John Cleese) are given next to nothing to do.  A more joyless example of how British wit can be turned into expensive American product can hardly be imagined-- this is the kind of movie that, given a choice between showing us a magnificently designed set for Gringott's Bank or a pile of phony gold, encourages us to ooh and ahh over the pile.

I was never one who really got into Harry Potter, I've only read the first two books, but this movie is fantastic. I couldn't believe how well director Chris Columbus (Home Alone) did on making this exactly like the book.Harry Potter is an 11 year old boy. His parents dies young, suppossedly in a car crash, when Harry was only a baby. His only living relatives were his stuck up Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, who had been fueding with Harry's parents for years. Naturally, Harry is treated like crap for his entire time there, always playing second banana to his fat, spoiled cousin Dudley. But one day, Harry gets a letter, the first ever in his life. As he is about to open it, his Uncle snatches it away from him, and his face goes white. He immediately tears it to bits. But, over the next week, Harry would get hundreds more of those letters. So many, that Uncle Vernon flips his lid and moves the family out to an island in a hut in the middle of a deserted lake area. But that night, a giant man shows up and breaks into the house. Everyone terrified, his first words were a friendly ""Happy birthday Harry!"" It was Hagrid, caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He tells Harry then, what his Aunt and Uncle had kept from him for so long. He is a wizard. What follows is a fantastic adventure at a British school of magic that the whole family will enjoy.4.5/5 stars."	5.0	The best book-to-movie adaptation I have ever seen!	2005-11-23	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A9VCD9JX1G7Y5	Michael James Allen	"Believe me, as an anti-Potter fan I went into ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" completely ready to hate it (in fact, I was even looking foward to leaving the theater and bashing it as much as possible). But I cannot do it. While it is certainly, certainly, CERTAINLY no masterpiece of cinema by any means, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does manage to be entertaining and fun, holding a viewer's attention for its complete two-and-a-half hour run.I credit the entertaining success of ""Harry Potter..."" to the fact that its script is very detailed, engrossing, and polished; not to mention that it gives all the fans of the books what they want by being as loyal as possible to the original text.The film's entertainment also stems from the fact that the cast is a cavalcade of British actors ranging from newcomers (Daniel Radcliffe manages to give a strong performance as the title role) to seasoned actors (such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith, who are always joys to watch and are certainly no exception here). The ensemble cast all gives performances that are very well thought out and, more importantly, it looks like everyone in the cast is having spectacular fun bringing the story and characters to life.Yet ""Harry Potter..."" does have its weaknesses, and all these weaknesses are mainly the result of what is obviously a rushed product. It is very apparant in the special effects and some of the blocking and editing, that the film was rushed and not made to the best quality it could have been, in order to get it released during the holiday season. Because of all this, some of the scenery, costumes, and even characters look, sound, and feel phony and unbelievable: And in a movie where the enviroment and the characters that inhabit that enviroment are such an integral part of its charm, that can be a BIG problem.Nevertheless, ""Harry Potter"" does entertain, and I cannot give it the bashing I would have hoped. If you're looking for something to fill a couple hours time or to perhaps show at a party or something of the sort, you might as well give ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" a try."	3.0	"""Harry Potter"" Entertaining If Nothing Else"	2002-02-22	2	1	1

Rowling's wonderful book to the big screen in a way that would satisfy the millions of fans worldwide that the book franchise has built up. It may have been too much for anyone to pull off.This IS the best possible movie they could have made of the first Harry Potter book. Except for a few cuts and tightening of the story elements (necessary for length but not helpful for the film), it's really right on target. Unfortunately, no amount of movie magic can top the experience of reading the Harry Potter books. As much as the realization of the settings and characters in the film matched my idea of how they'd look, the simple fact is...they were more alive and real while I was reading the book than they were when they were brought to life on screen.Don't get me wrong...I'm not a book snob, by any measure. And I liked the movie...saw it twice in the theater. It's just that if you haven't read the book, you should do yourself a favor and buy it and read it. As cool as it was to see so much of it in this film, there real joy of the Harry Potter series seems -- in my experience -- to be in the simple act of reading them.That's the movie's true weakness...the one ""special effect"" it could never contain. It does not absorb you in the charming, intimate wa the book does. For most book-to-movie translations, that's not a problem. But here...it's significant.When I thought about whether or not I'd buy this DVD, I realized that if I wanted to enter that world again, the best possible way to do it was to read the book again, not to watch the movie."	3.0	Good...but no substitute for the book	2002-04-29	5	4	1

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie that does an outstanding job at bringing the excellent story of the book to life in a way faithful to the original material.  The story unfolds in the same way in the movie as it does in the book so this is a very satisfying Harry Potter movie. The casting is fantastic. In particular,Richard Harris was a PERFECT Dumbledore. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape was on an O+ level as well. And John Willams score for this movie is a treasure to behold. My favorite movie theme music ever!

Not since the decision to cast Tom Cruise in Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" had there been so much ""audience"" speculation as to the capability of a movie to match what readers had built up in their minds.But Harry Potter was truly amazing.  Having read all four books myself (and repeatedly, at that) I too had a mind full of imagery associated with the characters and locations in these books.The kids in the movie (Daniel Radcliffe et al) had HUGE expectations to meet.  Not only was this the screen debut for all three, they were playing roles of kids that millions of readers had come to know and love.  Without exception, I think all three lived up to expectations.Next is the scenery.  While some of the actual settings didn't match up to what I had pictured in my mind, the movie is visually stunning and shows a painstaking attention to detail.Detractors may complain that the movie itself didn't compete with what they had envisioned, I enjoyed the differences in what I had pictured and what the director put on film.  With 100 million readers, it would be impossible for any director to satisfy everyone.  I think Chris Columbus did a fine job and produced a film worthy of its literary roots.  Add to that a host of bonus features and a second disc, this is a purchase worthy of the asking price and will make a fine addition to my collection of DVD's and to my Harry Potter books."	5.0	It Lived Up to My Expectations..	2002-05-21	31	25	6

When Warner Brothers bought the rights to the famous children's book series, millions waited in utter anticipation for the adaptation of the first book and executives at the studio were just biting at the bit to accept the money of Mr. Potter's legion of loyal fans. But this was far from an easy task for the movie studio. Why? In order to produce a magnificent achievement for the paying customers, the movie must remain true (to an extent) to the books created by J.K. Rowling and the whimsy and fantasy of those tales must remain no matter the cost. For if this does not happen, Warner Brothers executives can kiss those potential profits on sequels good-bye.The story focuses on the adventures of a young boy in England who discovers he is actually a wizard in training and that he is to be taken to a school, far from the world of the muggles (or non-magical folk) that he has grown up with all his life. After losing his parents when he was a baby, Harry Potter now resides with his terrible adopted family that consists of his boorish uncle, his snippy aunt, and spoiled, brutish cousin. But one day, he learns that he has been accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he arrives in the magic world of wizards and witches, he is overwhelmed to find out that he is one of the most famous sorcerers of all time m due to his confrontation, and evidential defeat of, the evil Lord Voldemort as a baby. But he no sooner puts he foot through the door then the trouble starts, whether it be the up-tight Professor Snape or the spoiled Draco Malfroy. After many strange events around the school, it is up to Harry and his new friends to stop an evil creature from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone which could bring about the re-generation of Lord Valdemort. The story for Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is done marvelously well but not based on material from the book. When going to see this film, don't go into it basing it on the book. You'll only be left with disappointment.Though most of the performances were played out by young actors and actresses, those performances were done in such a way that they were sophisticated for the age of the performers and therefore surprising. Daniel Radcliffe fits perfectly into the lead role of Harry Potter but the real determining factor will be if Radcliffe can keep that outstanding persona in this role as he matures through the sequels. Overall the performers seem well suited to their roles but that is not fully realized in the beginning. Only over a period of time in the film do the actors feel fully comfortable in their roles. The only disappointment has to be with John Cleese's Sir Nicholas, which was shown as nearly as much as he probably should have been.Overall, the mystical and extraordinary world of Harry Potter is brought to life in a way that many wouldn't have thought possible years ago and, though the film may differ from the book from time to time, even the most hardcore of Potter followers will be happy with this first film adaptation. Not to say it is absolutely perfect, there are some minor things to complain about. The time length, which stood at two hours and thirty minutes, seemed way too long for a feature at younger children. Granted they probably won't care too much since their eyes will be glued to the screen but that can problem based on potty breaks or something to that effect. Another problem deals with the editing of the movie. As an example, the burnt roof of Hogwarts that was not present in one scene was shown in the next with no explanation to what happened. But outside of those small problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is a delightful treat during the holiday season but not near the same level as Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc. but a great film none the less.	4.0	The Moose Hole - Potter Weaves Magic Spell	2004-02-05	3	2	1

Harry has no idea that he is a wizard or even the details surrounding his mother and fathers' death until Hagrid, the keeper of keys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, shows up to bring Harry to the school and tell him of his past.  I won't ruin the end of the movie or the conclusion for you, so see the movie to find out what happens to Harry and what he encounters along the way ; )This movie was truly brilliant--it stayed very true to the book, only leaving a few parts out that weren't vital to the plot of the story.  Plus, with all of the events and detail in the book, the movie did a wonderful job of making sure that even people who didn't read the book would understand the story and not get confused.  Buy this movie, see it, rent it, read the book--whatever you have to do to get a taste of Harry Potter, do it.  This movie will not leave you disappointed.

We get never-seen-before footage and a theatrical trailer but I couldn't figure out how to see them because we've got a bloody ""game"" type thing that is pretty much the same as the PlayStation game, blocking us from seeing all the things we want to see. I was so annoyed by this. Adults and adolescents who were expecting an in-depth analysis of this terrific film instead get a kiddie game that analyses ""how to get into diagon alley"" and what the sorting hat sorts!

I've never read the books (I must be one of the only people in the world at this point!) and I still thought this film was fun. It's a modern-day fairy tale with cleaver and charming scenes throughout.The special effects are outstanding, and the film is increadibly well cast. There is a reason that this was a blockbuster. It's just a very entertaining and well put-together film. I hope that the next films are as successful at creating the magic that this one had in abundance.	4.0	Fun Family Entertainment	2002-06-07	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	If you read the Harry Potter books before seeing the movies, this is the one that will take a lot to get used to.  Then you will get a feel for how much they have to cut from the books to make the movie, and get used to the characters etc.  After that movies are almost perfect. The special effects are amazing, the casting was great and as you probably know the story is very very good.The only drawback to this film is that the kids were so young, and so inexperienced as actors that their performances were very forced at times.  Luckily those who did the casting found actors who could learn quickly and develop great skills so that even by the second movie they had their characters down and really became those characters.  Of course all of the adult casting was great.  Snape is played perfectly by Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore.  The only bad thing about the movies was that he passed away before they were complete and the actor they brought in to replace him was just not the same. He played him differently, and did not give the character the same feel as Harris did.All in all, this movie sets up the series well.  It introduces the characters, blends the humor with elements of the dark material that would come in the subsequent films and told the story from the book as well as could have been done.  There are portion of even the first book that had to be cut out, and as the books got longer and longer more would have to be cut.  The Ultimate Edition, while giving an extended version of the movie does not replace much of the material that was cut from the book, just enhances the theatrical version of the film.  The big ticket item on the Ultimate Edition are the extras, specifically the five part documentary series that is the focus of the second disk.  In this set it is Creating the World of Harry Potter.  They talk about finding the cast, filming and how they created Howart's, the Quidditch arena, the various locations used etc.  Not just in the first movie, but throughout the series.  You also get things like the trailers, TV spots, Deleted Scenes, and a bunch of interactive content.If you love the books and want to get the most out of the movies you can than this is a must have for your collection.  Even though it is probably the weakest of all the movies, it is still an excellent film.	5.0	It is the movie that will take the most getting used to	2013-03-17	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A260456QWIKZQZ	Mikey-Likes-It	"Reading the reviews here - and it looks like Amazon is having a challenge with the UK vs. USA versions of this movie. Not to mention that UK/French Region 1 DVD set is sold in Canada.I just ordered the ""ultimate"" version to get the Extended Cut (additional scenes are edited back in to the movie, same as the one that airs on ABC Family channel). I ordered ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition)"" but received ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition)."" The difference is the word ""sorcerer"" vs. ""philosopher"" in the title and script. Fans know that the books were printed the same way (different in UK vs. US). I am trying to figure out now if there are other differences in the movie or not besides this one word. What I received is a Region 1 DVD - so this has to be for Canada (packaging is in both English and French). Very interesting - but for those who definitely want one version or the other, Amazon needs to clearly label these (might sell even faster).Sorry that the customer service representative did not seem to know that UK and US both speak English (she was having a problem with this concept when I called to ask why I was shipped this product by Amazon). I am going to keep it now that I have it, but would also like the US version, may have to purchase it in person at a store so I can get the correct version. In the mean time, buyer beware if you don't want this title - ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition).""

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2ZPYSIPRE0A62	M. J. Musante	OK, so a million other people have written reviews for this, so why one more?  Why not.I loved the film itself when it came out in 2001 and I was looking forward to getting it on DVD because of the extra features.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary track, which is what I was hoping for, so that's one point off.The good news is that they've included six deleted scenes and one extended version of an existing scene.The bad news is that you need to perform a convoluted procedure to get to them.  Here's how to do it.1/ Put in the second disc (the &quot;extras&quot;)2/ Select &quot;Diagon Alley&quot;3/ To enter the alley, you either choose 4 incorrect bricks (at which point the DVD gives in and lets you enter), or you choose, in the correct order, 5 bricks out of perhaps a dozen or so.4/ You then select the *key* on the Gringott's sign.  This takes you to a Gringott's screen.5/ Then you select the coins.  Are we getting close yet?  Nope.6/ You return to Diagon Alley, and select Olivander's.  You have to pick 3 wands, because the first two you choose are always going to be explosive.  Now that you've got your wand, you return to the main menu.7/ At this point, in the main menu, you can pick the &quot;classroom&quot; (the image of the wand below the white owl).  If you didn't go through the first 6 steps, it won't let you in.8/ Now move the highlight to the cat (&quot;Transfigurations&quot;) and push the down arrow.  The two owls on the pedestal should highlight.  Push enter.9/ Now the two owls AND the H on the pedestal should be highlighted.  Push enter again.10/ Are we there yet?  Nope.  Now you have to &quot;get past fluffly&quot;.  Choose the flute.11/ Now you have to select the correct key.  It's the tiny one in the exact centre of the screen.  If you're not sure which one it is, watch the middle of the screen carefully before the animation stops.  One of the keys won't be flapping properly -- it's got a broken wing, you see.12/ Almost there.  Now you have to choose the correct potion.  It's the round golden one.13/ Finally, you're at the mirror of Erised.  Move the highlight to the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's stone in the middle of the mirror and you'll be presented with a screen that lets you choose from three of the deleted scenes.  Be sure to use the forward arrow on that screen to see an additional four scenes.Extremely annoying to get to, but worth it in the end.	4.0	Wonderful, if convoluted	2002-06-17	6	6	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"""Harry Potter"" is one of the biggest money making machines in the world.  Later this year we will all be graced with a new book from author J.K. as well as the next cinematic chapter directed by Brit Mike Newell.  And the phenomenon can be traced back to when Rowling published the first book in the series and when helplessly mainstream director Christopher Columbus took the reins for the first movie.  Columbus, best known for the ""Home Alone"" films and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" beat out a slew of other directors to get the job, most likely after Spielberg withdrew his interest.  As a result, the film is artistically hit and miss.  While the film is esquisitely designed, shot and edited, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" comes up somewhat anemic in compelling dramatics.  In an attempt to please die hard Potter fans, Columbus and writer Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) try to cram in as much of the book's numerous plot strands and details into the films' overlong 150-minute-plus running time as possible, losing narrative kinetics and often bogging down the film in one forgettable passage after another. They sometimes neglect to focus on the characters that Rowling so cannily imagined and on the themes of the story that made the tale of wizards, witches and a demonic dark lord hit so close to home.With so much lacking in the film, it should have keeled over as one bloated, extravagent mess.  But the film has one saving grace that salvages it and makes it somewhat endearing: dead on casting.  It would be hard to imagine a better cast of unknowns and british film and theater vets to bring the Potter legend to life.  Previously unheard of Daniel Radcilffe gives off earnest charm as you Harry, a young, inexperienced savior of the world who is blissfully unaware of what awiats him later in life.  Emma Watson is delightful as the helplessly brainy Hermione Granger, always her nose in a book.  And Rupert Grint is a riot as the well-meaning but a little bumbling Ron Weasly and puts a true sense of humor into his role.  And the supporting cast, what a roster.  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and many others look almost too comfortable in their roles as teachers, professors and groundskeepers at the fabled Hogwartz school for witchcraft and wizardry.  They make the complex art of acting seem effortless and Columbus should be thankful.  The execution of the story may be flawed, but the casting is damn near perfect, saving ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" from fan derision."	3.0	Entertaining Despite Itself	2005-06-21	8	3	5

The casting of the film was perfect, the characters every bit as lovable as in my imagination. The best thing I can say about this movie is that, after forcing my very reluctant husband, (who NEVER reads anything that doesn't feature a mountainbike on the cover) to watch the movie, he purchased and listened to the audio CDs for the remaining books in his car!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AMGS6X9VHETE2	MommyB	I'm an adult fan of the books.  Saw the movie in the theatre and loved it there.  Of course, I did go away with that &quot;oh I wish they showed more detail about...&quot; feeling.  Also, we didn't bring our 3 1/2 old when the movie came out because we were concerned for the scare factor.  Since we've bought it, he (4 yrs now) has watched it 5 times and loves it.  He was a little edgy at first with some of the scary scenes, but with the second viewing he got over it.Now as far as the DVD...  First let me say, I didn't realize you had to play games to find the extra footage.  I assumed that they were now included in the film (even though I couldn't find them there either).  I'm going to go investigate that some more.The problem I am having with my DVD is the audio.  During the part on Hogwart's Express, Hermione's voice is very much off with the movement of her mouth.  As the cd progresses, the audio seems to match itself up a bit better, but still appears &quot;off&quot;.  I haven't seen any other complaints about this, so I'm thinking maybe I just have a defective copy???  I guess I'll go exchange it tomorrow.Once last note about the DVD...  I would have liked to atleast see the DVDs packaged in a clamshell case.  The cardboard case and plastic cd tray are not at all up to the standard that you would expect them to be.	4.0	Loved the movie -- DVD defective?	2002-06-11	7	5	2

This movie is not one that you will be bored of easily, it has it's shares of surprising turns.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"If you've ever seen and loved the classic Halloween special ""The Worst Witch,"" starring a young miss Fairuza Balk, Harry Potter should strike a familiar chord with you.  Though I have yet to read the Harry Potter books, it's my love for fantasies like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Halloween specials like ""The Worst Witch"" that drew me to this film, and I'm so glad! Harry Potter is the fantastic and fun-filled story of a young boy whose miserable life as an orphan living with cruel relatives is suddenly changed when he finds out he is destined to be the greatest Wizard that ever was! Living in a crawl space under his Aunt and Uncle's staircase in 20th century London, Harry has no idea that his parents were a famous Wizard and Witch, murdered by an evil Wizard when he was just a baby. But one day a mysterious letter comes for Harry, informing him that he is soon to be a student at Hogwart's School of Magic. His aunt and uncle do their best to keep him away, but goodness wins out when the towering, bearded, kindhearted and commanding Hagrid comes to the Human world to save the boy from his coldhearted keepers. Suddenly, Harry finds himself being introduced to a whole new world of magic! Hagrid takes the boy to Diagon Alley, a magical marketplace, to purchase a wand and other school supplies, then on to the train station, to board the Express to Hogwart's School. On the way to his new life, Harry meets up with his two soon-to-be best friends, the friendly and true, if a bit awkward, Ron Weasley, and the cute and clever bookworm Hermione Granger (who steals the movie, thanks to the adorable Emma Watson's performance).From that first view of Diagon Alley onward, Harry takes in one jaw-dropping experience after another. But the greatest sights come when Harry gets off the train and enters the world of Hogwart's School of magic. Boats must be taken to reach the school grounds, and the view is stunning. The school itself is a sight to behold, right out of a fairytale. Within, we find several other children waiting to be sorted into their teams and dorms, from the sneaky Slitherins to the noble Gryffindors. Luckily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are grouped together on the Gryffindor team. The students meet the teachers, formalities are taken care of, a feast fit for kings is served up, and their new lives begin. From here on out it is one adventure after another, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione battle a Mountain Troll, investigate the evil Voldemort, play a stunning broomstick ballgame called Quidditch, and learn about honor, friendship, bravery, and magic, not to mention the secret of the mysterious Sorcerer`s Stone.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not to be missed. It's good, clean, family fun, with great characters and lots and lots of magic. Some scenes may be a bit frightening for small children, and if you have a hang-up about movies about kids going to witchcraft schools, well, I suggest you just have a talk with your kids about fantasy versus reality, because that's what this is, a fantasy. And what a fantasy! The DVD is wonderful, but I don't claim to have been as blown away by the extras disc as others have. It was okay, but for the most part it seems to have been made for little kids. But the movie is great for any age! If you love fantasies like The Wizard of Oz, Return To Oz, The Worst Witch, The Black Cauldron, Lord of the Rings, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and The Sword In the Stone, you're gonna love this!"	5.0	The Newest Halloween Classic!	2002-10-13	2	2	0

The book to script conversion is masterfully done, with the right changes needed. The special features don't go overboard, either, but they have enough to fulfill Potter's legions of fans.Is there a downside? Maybe the movie drags on at times and seems a little outside of even magical reality, but Rowling can push the envelope and still pull it off.The acting is decent enough, the effects are well done, the plot is incredible, and the entire thing is well carried out. &quot;We expect great things from you, Harry Potter&quot;.

Then I went to find the 7 deleted scenes.  You have to navigate through endless childish games and play stupid puzzles to unlock them.  This is ridiculous!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	It's a very rare person who hasn't watched a Harry Potter movie or read one of the books (admittedly I know a few of the poor souls who haven't).  And for good reason, the books especially are excellent, and the movies not bad adaptations at all.  Of course I always recommend reading something before watching it, but if the very least you're going to do is watch it, then at least that's something.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first movie in a series of eight.  Obviously you want to watch them in order.  This particular one follows the first book through its entirety.  So you watch as Harry becomes a wizard and joins Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.  But there is a terrible foe out there, one who tried to kill him as a baby.  Voldemort, this evil wizard, may be back again, and there's something very powerful that he's after.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe- Harry PotterRupert Grint- Ron WeasleyEmma Watson - Hermione GrangerRobbie Coltrane - HagridRichard Harris - Albus DumbledoreAlan Rickman - Severus SnapeMaggie Smith - Minerva McGonagallI really don't think the movie could have been cast any better.  Everyone was exactly how I would have envisioned them, or at least close enough that they are what I picture now when I read the books.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry does an excellent job.  He has the right amount of surprise at magic and an innocence that goes along with not knowing how important he really is.  Ruper Grint as Ron Weasley is funny, and I like how they have a ready quip for him at all times.  Emma Watson, what can I say, she's Hermione through and through and has that right touch of haughtiness.  Of course all the others are excellent, although sometimes I can't quite figure out if Dumbledore acts as he should.  And Professor Quirrell was kind of a surprise as well too.The movie follows the book reasonably well.  It's understood that you're going to be disappointed by some things when you watch, that's just the nature of trying to squeeze the detail of a book into the movies.  But they did ok and I was happy enough with the efforts, although there were some scenes I would have liked to see included (like the dragon scene expanded as it is in the book).  Since this movie is for kids the violence is toned down a little bit.  But there is some there and I could see some elements that may be frightening for younger children.The special effects were brilliant.  They really brought the world to life the best they could with the technology and the care taken is shown.  Even the Chocolate Frogs were amusing and I especially like how they pulled off the wizard pictures.  It made it almost as if you were reading it and picturing all these things in your head.  I would have liked to see more magic done, but I guess they had to put plot in in addition to all the shiny special effects.  Music, what can I say.  I read somewhere once that they get goose bumps when they hear the opening music to Harry Potter.  And I quite agree.  When you hear that music there's just a moment of anticipation, like you know something wonderful is about to happen.  And the rest of the score is just as good and just as magical as you would hope it to be.  And it does help that it is instrumental without the singing to distract you during the movie.A great show and one that I don't mind watching over and over.  Although invariably it always results in a several day long Harry Potter movie marathon.  But we all have our vices.Review by M.

Bates ""rldvds"""	Yes I waited in a long line to watch Harry Potter at the movies, and I also bought the DVD and I am 25.  It is a great movie for everyone of any age.  Going to the movies was a great experience because kids were dressed up and ready and excited.  Now the DVD lives up to the fun.  Hours of extras are included as you navigate through a number of puzzles.  Once you complete the puzzles only then are the extras found.  The movie itself has a great feel.  Both picture and sound quality are excellent. I highly recommend Harry Potter.	5.0	Not Just for Kids	2002-06-09	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3Q42508E8TIRG	Mr. Shannon D. Freeman	If you have never read the Harry Potter books, then watch this movie.  It tries to stay true to the book that it is based on, although there a few artistic liberties here and there.  This does not make me mad in the least, if you get the dvd edition, you will see 7 deleted scenes that didn't make it to the theatre (although they are on disk 2, and you do have to work for them), but it is worth it.For those of you that do not like this movie, then I say you haven't seen it.  And if you have seen it and still don't like it, then this is my opinion that I am giving.  Either way, I didn't want to spoil the movie for those who may buy it.	5.0	You gotta see this movie!	2002-05-28	5	4	1

I loved the first movie and even tho Harry seemed like a real character the movie gave him a 3D quality all his own. I think it helped to understand the story line better to have read the books. Now when I read the next book I will be able to see the characters in my mind's eye and live their adventures along with them.	5.0	Harry Potter Comes to Life on the Screen	2002-03-16	13	11	2

It was more or less completely forgettable.  I think children would like it, but I suspect the books are vastly superior.  I have not read the Harry Potter books (although I will one day), but I am a great lover of children's literature.  From Madeline L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, through Roald Dahl's magnificent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, to Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, I loved them all.  If the Harry Potter books have that quality, it somehow failed to translate to the film.  For the record, I wasn't that thrilled with the Willy Wonka movie either (although it would get 3 stars from me).	2.0	Stick in the mud	2002-05-07	3	1	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AL5485T6CBEKK	"""ms_maul"""	I still don't know if I like the movie or not.Though, it's not really the movie in question, it's the book. Personally I dislike the first and (to a certain degree) the second books in the series. Some of the lines are a bit cheesy and I -despise- the ending (you broke all the rules, have a trophy!). Ok, yeah, he kinda saved the world, but still- shouldn't he get some kind of punishment for breaking at least a hundred rules at that school? It suffers from classic 'happy end' syndrome.Now, the 3rd and 4th I really like, and I totally dig the 5th. Maybe that's because I'm a sick twisted little kid, but that's ok I guess. &lt;3 for Moody.Onto the actual movie...Hermione and Ron are great. Harry however isn't that great of an actor- he cracks maybe 3 facial expressions in the entire movie (*coughcoughkeanureevescoughcough*...i love the matrix though). Virtually the whole rest of the casting is perfect.I'm really waiting for the rest of the books to be made into movies, as I believe they will hold up to the spirit of the books more. There is only one problem (Which I believe Abarat, if made into a movie, will suffer of as well). If the 5th/4th books are made into movies they will probably be too scary for the lower end of HP's target audience. I'm talking about the ending of Goblet and just about all of Pheonix. I just hope that they PLEASE don't try to dumb the books down.In any case, I don't know if I like this movie as a movie or not. The effects are severely lacking (ergh, the troll looks SO fake). It sticks to the books well, I guess. I get that 'oh, jeez' stomach-turn effect at a few lines, though.Verdict? It's a well made movie, for the most part. I'm just not a huge fan of the early books. I just wish Harry's casting could have been a -tad- better.	3.0	Hmm.	2003-07-04	3	1	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3P7ZJD1YTG4IZ	M. Smitherman	Why are all of these reviews so darn -bad-? I'm very surprised, especially since so many people are buying this DVD! Having only seen Harry Potter 3 times, I am nevertheless convinced that it is a great movie. It obviously didn't completely measure up to the book, but neither did Lord of the Rings, and that was the -best- movie ever. So despite the movie's inferiority to the book, I enjoyed it immensely, and the DVD as well. The special features are really fun, especially having to get to the deleted scenes. People complained that it was too much hassle to find the deleted scenes, but seriously... if you had time to buy the Harry Potter DVD and watch the special features on it, you have time to play a game in order to watch the deleted scenes.I admit that the movie could have been a little more scary, and possibly more creative, but all in all, it's a great film for young and old alike. If you're a fan of the books, you really ought to see the movie!	5.0	A Really Neato Movie, Seriously	2002-06-16	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1YE4PVYRBQPT1	Music Fan from St. Louis	"I recently viewed this, the first in the Harry Potter series of movies - it had been years since I'd first watched it and wondered how has it held up since its release and the subsequent movies have been released?  Overall the movie holds up well - the effects were well done so no issues of ""that just looks so limited compared to today"" like you might see with other effects-laden movies after a number of years.  And it struck me again how closely it followed the book.What limited me to 3 stars (I would give it 3-1/2 if Amazon allowed half-stars) was the fact that, especially compared to the later movies, the movement of the storyline was not as smooth.  I think that was due largely to having so much of Rowling's imaginative world to present and at the same time keeping the movie length to something the younger set could sit through.  Yes, the story is there and follows the book closely, but at times it does have somewhat of a ""oh here's another aspect of life with magic and at Hogwarts we need to present..."" jumpiness to it.So overall, 3 stars, definitely worth viewing.  I'm sure in a few years I'll watch it (and the other HP movies) again."	3.0	Good intro to the Harry Potter movies	2012-07-11	1	0	1

I was really excitied for the special features on Disc two.Well, There isn't much to get excitied about.  There is only one portion that actually lets you see interviews with the Director and scriptwriter and such.  Its only about 15 min and during that time, is when one can see behind the scenes.  I was hoping for J.K. Rowling to have something to say, or any of the cast members.  There is no commentary, no outakes, and only 10 minutes of deleted scenes.To get to the Deleted scenes on the second disc is fun, at first.  We get to see clips of the actual movie, and try to get to the stone.  It was fun, for the first fifteen mins.  I thought it was a bit much, just again, for only 10 minutes of deleted scenes.  I did like the design photos that you can find - not telling where they are though.  That was really cool.I am keeping in mind that this is desgined for Children.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A5QE86H97FDJA	Mynameisthis	"** Please note that this review is modified from the original, to which all the negative feedback is directed. **** Over the past few years I have changed my opinion on this film and the entire film saga. Much of what I stated originally is still true but to me, the film series is entertaining. I wouldn't let a small child watch the later films since it would probably scare the heck out of them, but as your kids grow up, though the films become increasingly darker, I think they can handle it and enjoy them. **My biggest concerns revolve around the blatant way witchcraft is flaunted around. This is not like the tales of Narnia (a superior series of books) or even the ""Wizard of Oz"" where magic is part of the story not the predominant aspect. Harry Potter glorifies witchcraft and encourages kids to become involved, going so far as to teach them the basics of Wicca. Wizard of Oz did not ""teach"" witchcraft. The Warner Brothers website for Harry Potter has a link for kids to enroll in the school of wizardry.Harry Potter attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns to cast spells, make potions, use divination and the make up of a witches broom. They also talk to the dead and use sorcery routinely. They are introduced to animal/human sacrifice, drinking blood, Mother Goddess theories, reincarnation, divination, demon possession, Celtic and Druid religions and even Satanism.A child reading the books will learn witchcraft as if they were studying Wicca. The only difference in Harry Potter is that the spells are ""made up"" words in Latin with a humorous touch, but are not real spells. However, the intrigue leads the child to wanting to learn the same things as Harry, which can lead them to learn correct spells on witchcraft websites linked to Harry Potter. If the interest is there and a child gets excited about learning to be ""like Harry"", they will find a way to learn sorcery.This is why those who practice witchcraft and Wicca are so excited about the ""positive"" attention that Harry Potter is bringing to them.There is a prevailing shadow of death that hangs over much of the storytelling. This is not a light happy world, but a landscape clouded by gloom and murder. J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, herself admitted in a recent interview that ""death and bereavement and what death means, I would say, is one of the central themes in all seven books."" Yeah, and this is what we want kids to see? I don't think so.These are concerns for me as a parent and it should be a concern for anyone afraid that their child could do more than enjoy this film and books as entertainment.** I probably haven't changed enough of this review to satisfy those who gave it negative feedback but hey, what I wrote is factual. Having said that, anytime I get a chance, I watch the films and enjoy the world that Rowling created. **"	4.0	Harry Potter and the spell over kids	2003-01-22	23	3	20

The cast is ideal, and, hopefully, will be able to complete the series intact. Having read (and loved) the books, but not as much of an aficianado as some other members in my family, I did not catch the parts which were, either, combined or omitted. Thus, I felt no need to pick it apart.It is, in fact, a rousing good story, with a plot that holds your attention consistently, throughout.Harry Potter is the nephew/ward of a truly dysfunctional family, who finds out at the age of ten that he is a wizard. His parents, who were successful wizards themselves, were mysteriously murdered by the evil Lord Voldamort. After attempting to do the same with baby Harry, Voldamort was somehow vanquished through means unknown. Because of this, a certain respect is paid to Harry by almost all except his muggle (nonmagic) relations and, Professor Snape from Hogwarts, the wizard school which Harry eventually attends.This is the Wizard of Oz/Alice in Wonderland/Morte de Arthur of our age, and I, for one, am enjoying the ride immensely. I highly recommend that everyone, especially if you have resisted thus far, do the same.	5.0	Harry Potter hypnotizes...	2002-09-20	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1Y5NZ9BWJEY88	Nado	"The book was indeed more indepth than the movie but as with all movie adaptations of books, they only have so much time to cover what's happening in the book. Still, the movie covered the important parts really well, like how Harry learns he is a wizard and what happened in his past. The characters grew over the course of the story. Sure, Hermione was a smart nosed and all around brat that mnay people disliked initially, but after certain events she becomes more personable, humbled and a valued friend to Harry. Similar to the book, it makes you feel like you're in a fantasy world with all the visual cinematics and at the same time like you are going back to school. Giving a few scenes in the classrooms with all their professors like the ""classroom battles"" with Professor Snape and the stern, motherly but proud teachings of Professor McGonagall. The overall tone is pretty light and kid friendly with limited dark context that isn't really exposed until the later books and movies. To enunciate this the music is pretty light and upbeat throughout the movie, with some sad scene exceptions (Mirror of Erised), to give it a more warm-hearted feel.Comedy is also present to give laughs to the audience. Like in the scene after the trio (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) get lost on the third floor and encounter Fluffy. Hermione berates the two boys for their choice to hide there from Filch and states ""Now if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed or worse, expelled."" to which Ron retorts at Harry ""She needs to sort out her priorities."" And then there's the exciting scenes from the Quidditch training and matches. Nothing like a good game of Quidditch!Sure, some the actors, like the kids, did seem a little dry or emotionless at times but for a lot of them, it was probably their first shot on camera. You have to give them credit for the bravery it takes to showcase yourself to the entire world at a young age. Not my favorite, but definitely a great start to one of the best movie series ever created. 4 out of 5 stars."	4.0	The Book Came to Life	2013-05-15	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A50W7ZVTG606	"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff"""	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the best thing to hit children's literature and film for many years. It has everything it needs to be a long-lasting icon of the film industry. And yes, I say the Philosopher's Stone, not that other horrible name, because that is the true name of the book and movie. The alternate name was plastered onto the American edition because... well, I won't go into details of those rumours.Suffice to say, this movie was brilliantly done. Kudoes to Chris Columbus for a magnificent job. It seems he was criticised from a number of different angles (unfairly, in my opinion) for either sticking too closely to the book, or for not including various scenes.One, he couldn't have included everything. It would have been a logistical impossibility. Two, had he strayed from the story given in the book, it would have lost a lot of its magic. Pun not intended.I was a little disappointed at some things being missed. In particular, Hermione's momentary panic when Harry and Ron are caught in the Devil's Snare, and the alterations to the entire 'Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback' saga. But all in all, I think it was a great effort that resulted in the sort of enjoyable movie that you can watch again and again.The stars are all brilliant. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all perfect in their roles. Emma Watson in particular - she has Hermione's mannerisms down pat.As for the adults, they too were all wonderful. Especially, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. And a special mention for Tom Felton - he has really made Draco Malfoy into someone that we can love to hate.The Philosopher's Stone is marvellous enough in its own right without people deriding is as a Lord of the Rings copy (which it isn't), or saying that it is too 'airy-fairy'. And, what is with the accusation by a latter viewer that it (book & movie) is a blatant copy of Star Wars?Okay, there are people who don't like Harry Potter. That's acceptable. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But to start making ludicrous claims is just off the planet. Harry Potter is not a copy of Star Wars, and the Quidditch match is not a copy the Episode 1 Pod Race. Try reading the book again, and then having a look at the copyright date in the front of the book. Then check out the production date for Phantom Menace. Then, grow up and get a life! Sheesh....This is a great movie. It is about friendship and courage, and just happens to be set in the fantastic world of wizards and witches. If you really think this movie is brain-dead, try watching half an hour of Teletubbies, or that insipid...'Blues Clues'. (Anyone who freely uses the phrase 'handy dandy' seriously needs psychiatric help, quickly)At least the stars in Harry Potter can act. Daniel Radcliffe is no Macaulay Culkin (thank God), and he leaves other child actors (ie, Haley Joel Osment) in his dust. Okay, now I'm ranting. But 'The Philosopher's Stone' has far more redeeming features than negative ones, and I find it sad that there are people who - as a wonderful Australian critic stated - feel that they are entitled to trash a movie just because they don't personally like it. You may not like something, but that doesn't always mean it's bad.And for anyone who derides it as being 'just ordinary', I really feel sorry for you.	5.0	Philosopher's Stone is a Winner	2003-03-16	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2BINN9VKKAO5I	Nathan Lorenz	I have to admit that I haven't read any of the amazingly popular novel's from which this movie came. However, after viewing this film, I am certainly tempted to do so. While this film is certainly designed for the preadolescent market, it has those necessary hooks to keep even the most hardened realist of an adult interested.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a young wizard, who after his parents were killed, was left with his mean and un-magical, aunt, uncle and bratty cousin who force him to live under the stairs. However, on his 11th birthday he is accepted into the Hogwart's School for young witches and wizards and enters a world of magic and mystery. While at school, he and his classmates Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) set out on a quest to find the Sorcerer's Stone (which will bring immortality to those who possess it) and to prevent an evil wizard from acquiring it.Outside of the main cast of children (who are excellent); this film is chocked full with an astounding cast of British actors. Robbie Coltrane (Henry V, GoldenEye) is perfect as the lumbering and loveable giant, Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman (Bob Roberts, Dogma) once again proves that he can do sinister better than any living actor. English heavyweights Richard Harris (The Guns of Navarone, Unforgiven) and Maggie Smith (Tea with Mussolini, Gosford Park) give good performances. The short appearances by John Cleese (Life of Brian, A Fish Called Wanda) and John Hurt (I Claudius) round out this superb cast.The cinematography is fun and inventive with a superb use of computer special effects. The setting is a combination of gothic horror and Dickensian melodrama, which works to good effect. The story combines fairy tales of every shape and kind. From Cinderella to Greek and Roman mythologies, this movie weaves a storyline that is fun to follow. The appearance of Cerberus, the three-headed dog, now renamed as Fluffy is especially amusing.Now, despite all of these good things, the fact of the matter is that this is a fluff adventure. The characters are fairly cookie-cutter with very little time given to character development. The storyline is convoluted by its attempt to juggle too many plot lines. However, it is fun to watch and I'm glad I checked it out. I may have to borrow a child so I can go watch the next one in the theatres.	3.0	A Fun Adventure.	2003-03-29	3	2	1

I believe it is a strength. There is, however, one small error in the film. When Hagrid blows into the island hut where the Dursleys are hiding out, he mistakes Dudley for Harry.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2XDK4TEM093SM	Nicholas J. Coleman	"I walked out of this movie in the theatre, preferring instead to view it on DVD.  Having read the books, I was extemely excited about the movie.  I LOVED the introductory scene between Richard Harris and Maggie Smith.  The tone was right, there was just enough ""magic"" and the acting was superb.  Then the movie flash-forwarded (as does the story) to introduce the ten year-old Harry.  And Daniel Radcliffe was TERRIBLE.  Not only was he over-acting in his responses to every single situation, he was uaing an altogether incorrect response.  The Harry of the books was scared and confused by the things happening to him...at least until he arrived at Hogwarts, but Radcliffe gives Harry no surprise to find out he is a wizard...sure he says the lines, but they are uninspired and completely lifeless.I would give this movie an even lower rating if it were not for the remarkable supporting cast.  Rupert Grint was DELIGHTFUL as Ron Weasley, coupling a youthful wonderment with the shyness and embarassment of an underpriveledged youth.  And Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood easily comes across as the most believable character in the entire film--watch this guy, he's going to be big someday.Overall the film has a gold-veneer polish that will at least make you smile at a few points, but it is not the entertaining juggernaut it has been made out to be.  Go read the books to find out what you're missing.  Let's just hope that in the next installments, Radcliffe either learns to act. or is replaced with someone who has more going for them as an actor than merely looking like the character drawn on the book covers.The DVD itself is fun, incorporating an interesting (if time consuming) game on the second disk.  The DVD will appeal more to children (as per its design) than it will adults, but makes for a good rental.  You will undoubtedly want to add this to your permanent collection if you are a Harry Potter fan, otherwise, skip it."	3.0	Overrated, underacted, overblown, uninspired...	2002-06-04	2	0	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2HDJDMP7USKZQ	"Nicholas R. Herum ""Movies Hate You Too"""	"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneUltimate Edition Blu-Ray ReviewYear: 2001Rating: PGRuntime:  2 HRS 32 MIN (Theatrical), 2 HRS 39 MIN (Extended)Directed by: Chris ColumbusStarring:  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan RickmanFilm Rating:  3 out of 5 starsVideo Rating:  3 out of 5Audio Rating:  4 out of 5Extras:  4 out of 5Overall Rating:  4 out of 5 starsThe FilmHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a film I absolutely despised upon its release in November 2001.  At the time, I was a complete Harry Potter virgin and didn't know a ""muggle"" from a ""bezoar"" and I wasn't patient enough to give the film a chance.  It wasn't for several more years until I could sit down and actually enjoy this opening entry into one of the more magical (pun intended, stop rolling your eyes) franchises in recent memory.HP1 tells the story of a neglected 10 year old orphan with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead who is raised by his cruel aunt and uncle and finds out of his 11th birthday that he is in fact a wizard.  He travels to a distant magical school named Hogwarts where he meets new friends (and enemies), learns about how he received that lightning scar, what happened to his parents, and runs across an old foe in a new form.This film is extremely loyal to the book which is both a blessing and a curse.  Sorcerer's Stone is the shortest entry in the book series and that allows for a more literal adaptation when you have 150+ minutes to tell your story in the theater.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't take many risks when it comes to differentiating itself from the book.  Many fans appreciate how dedicated this film is to it's book but I think for the sake of pacing some liberties should have been taken.HP1's biggest problems come in the form of direction, acting, and effects:-Sorcerer's Stone is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) who is obviously very good at working with child actors but I've always felt that he is a little out of his element working on a film of this scale.  HP1 looks as though it could have been directed by anyone, it's competently directed but there's nothing to set it apart style wise.-Kid actors always seem to cause problems.  For every film with good child actor performances (think The Goonies) there's a movie filled Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars Episode I) level actors. Sorcerer's Stone falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to the children's performances.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Rupert Grint (Ron) come off a lot better than Tom Felton (Draco) and especially Emma Watson (Hermione).  What's funny is, Emma Watson has put in some of the best performances in the later film entries so kudos to her for putting in the effort to become a much better actress.-CGI has come along way since 2001.  There are far too many scenes in HP1 where the effects have not aged well or just weren't that good in the first place.  The Quidditch match in particular is a scene that I remember rolling my eyes at when I first saw the film and it continues to take me out the film years later.There are a lot of good things working in favor of HP1.  Set direction, practical effects, sound design, and the soundtrack are among the many things in this film that are top notch.  The adult actors such as Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Robbie Coltrane add a lot credibility to the film and usually seem to elevate the children's performances while in their presence.  The last thing you have to keep in mind when judging this film is the often forgotten fact that this is the setup film of a huge franchise.  Sorcerer's Stone had the near impossible task of introducing the characters and wizarding world to the movie going audience.  While I didn't appreciate this film upon my first viewing I've grown to enjoy it more now that I've seen and read what comes after.The Blu-RayHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray comes housed in a  sturdy blue cardboard case with slip cover.  Inside you'll find the movie blu-ray with both the theatrical and the extended cut of the film, a special features BD, a standard-def DVD of special features, a theatrical cut digital copy disc, a collectible book, two character cards (Harry Potter & Minerva McGonagall)As stated above, this set features both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.  The extended cut runs approximately 7 minutes longer than the original cut.  Most of the extra footage are scene extensions and most novice Harry Potter fans won't notice any difference between the two.  Both cuts of the film appear to be mastered from the same source print which is identical to the transfer used for the 2007 HD-DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the film.  While the transfer is very good, it's not likely to blow anyone away but it is accurate to the designed look of the film.  I no longer own the SD DVD version of the film to compare this release to but I believe it would be safe to say this BD outclasses it in every conceivable way.  Black levels are very good, I didn't notice any crushing even in the darkest scenes.  Color accuracy was consistent and the level of detail is usually on par with what I've come to expect from Blu-Ray with only a few scenes appearing overly soft.  I didn't notice any use of Digital Noise Reduction since there is always an appropriate level of film grain visible during the film.Regarding the audio tracks, there several differences between the this and previously released editions but I doubt that most listeners will hear the difference.  Unlike the aforementioned HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases, which featured a Dolby TrueHD and an Uncompressed 5.1 PCM  track respectively, this release features a DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1 track for the theatrical cut and a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 for the extended cut.  The added channel for the theatrical cut most likely stems from the fact that when released in theaters this film was released in Dolby Digital Surround EX which is a 7 channel format.  Since the extended cut of the film adds back segments of the film that were never encoded in that format that cut of the film feature a 5.1 audio mix.Extras on this set range from wonderful to ""I couldn't care less.""  I typically don't watch extras that aren't presented in HD so only extras presented in high definition will be included in this review.  The only significant extra on disc one is the PiP (Picture in Picture) commentary track from director Chris Columbus.  The track is sporadic at best with Columbus popping up more frequently the farther a long into the film we go.  He's interesting to listen to and seems to have fond memories of working on the film but there are long  gaps without his input that hinders this from being a must watch for anyone but the most die hard HP fans.  Since disc one's only special feature is the PiP track disc two houses the rest.  First off is a brief introduction by Daniel Radcliffe which is both amusing and a little creepy.  He makes it clear in no uncertain terms that you'll absolutely love the Ultimate Edition Blu-Rays and you'll learn things about Harry Potter that you never knew.  The best special feature included on the set (and for some the entire reason they bought the set) is the Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 1:  The Magic Begins documentary.  This is part one of the eight part series with a new installment being included on each new Ultimate Edition set.  The Magic Begins is presented in HD and looks as though great care and effort has been put into the documentary.  Each documentary is themed and as the title leads you to believe this segment dives into the launching the franchise.  Most of the interviews with cast and crew are newly produced and everyone is very candid about what led to certain decisions being made, what works and doesn't work, and how it those decisions affected future films.  It's an interesting look back at the beginning of the franchise especially now that we're so close to the release of The Deathly Hallows Part 2.  Other extras include 10 minutes worth of deleted scenes.  Most of these scenes are what make up the Extended Cut of the film so your not going to see any hidden treasures if you already watched that version of the film.  The only other extras on disc two are the teaser trailer, two full trailers, and 15 television spots all presented in standard definition (SD trailers, etc. are inexcusable in this day and age).  Disc three extras are all presented in SD and are recycled from previous editions of the film so I didn't even bother wasting the time to put the disc in my player.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a faithful adaption of the inaugural Potter book.  A number of issues, namely the children's performances, the bland direction, and some spotty CGI hinder the film from being truly magical.  It does however setup the world of Harry Potter effectively, tells the story competently, and looking back, makes enough good decisions to help future Potter films succeed in ways this film could never achieve.Highly Recommended for any Potter fan with money to burn.  If you're unsure if Harry Potter is right for you I suggest checking out the single disc Blu-ray, it will only cost you around $10 so your financial risk is a lot smaller.  The disc sports the same transfer, similar audio, it doesn't include The Magic Begins doc, or the extended cut of the film but if you're looking for the cheapest HP1 option this is it."	4.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Ultimate Edition Blu-ray Review	2012-02-15	2	2	0

Perhaps I would have liked it more if I hadn't read the books beforehand.  For those who don't know the story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about an 11 year old orphan boy named Harry Potter whose parents die in a car crash (or so he's led to believe) and goes to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin when he's only a year old.  Of course Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon treats Harry horribly in favor of their own spoiled and greedy child, Dudley.  Harry seems resigned to live this terrible life until one day on his 11th birthday a mysterious letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft andWizardry appears.  Soon after Harry learns the truth about his past, that his parents were wizards and that they really died at the hands of the evil wizard Voldemort (mostly known among the wizard world as You-Know-Who). That he is famous in the wizarding world because he is the only one known to survive an attack from the evil Voldemort with only a lighting shaped scar on his forehead to show for it.  Soon Harry is off to the magical world of witches and wizards, destined to learn to be a wizard at the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The movie actually followed the book pretty closely, which may or may not have been part of the problem.  However, there were some parts that were cut that should have been left in mainly because it aided in the development of some of the characters. For the most part, the actors where cast well, Daniel Radcliffe did well as young Harry Potter, Rupert Grint was hilarious as Harry's best friend Ron Weasley,  Emma Watson was excellent as bossy Hermione Granger, and Robbie Coltrane was every bit the Hagrid of the Harry Potter books.  Other supporting actors were also excellently cast with Alan Rickman as the imposing Potions master Snape, Maggie Smith as the strict and stern Professor McGonagall, and Richard Harris as the wise school headmaster Professor Dumbledore.  Strangely enough, the trio portraying the Dursleys, Harry's mean relatives, seemed oddly miscast.  For example, in the book, Aunt Petunia was a blond and in the movie she was a brunette, which would be a minor point if the other characters weren't cast as well as they were.The most exciting and visually stunning part of the movie was during the fast paced Quidditch match, a wizarding game played on broomsticks. But all in all, the movie appeared be to rather slow, especially for children who haven't read the book or for those with fairly short attention spans.  It also seemed to be missing...something...the something that makes reading the books so magical.  It could be because the plot lines and character development in the Harry Potter books are too rich and well written to make an effective translation to the screen.  The scenes that read as witty, quick paced and funny in the book appeared to fall flat and drag on the screen.  I'm hard pressed to decide whether I'll buy the movie or just stick to the books.	3.0	It lacks...something	2002-03-19	5	2	3

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AHZ14R07BWLOV	"Norene M. Parker ""Joe's Foster Mom"""	I originally made the mistake of purchasing the Wide Screen option of this film, only to find well over a third of my screen wasted and the darker scenes difficult to see, at best.  As soon as I realized a Full Screen Version was available, also at a reasonable cost, I couldn't purchase it fast enough.  The whole family is MUCH happier now.  Everyone from 16 to 74 LOVES the movie!  My only concern is that at the speed (or lack thereof) the books and movies are being released, that the actors/actresses are going to be approaching their 30's by the time they &quot;finish&quot; school at Hogwarts&quot;.  I hope things can pick up the pace, because I am 47 years old and I certainly want to live long enough to finish the series!

Actually, it was better than I expected.Yes, the movie has cut many, many, small things from the book.  But, this is inevitable.  If everything from the book went into the movie, you would have a five or six hour movie.I recommend this movie.	5.0	Better than I expected	2008-11-29	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	Having thoroughly enjoyed all four Potter books so far, I was skeptical about a movie version. Yet I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's general faithfulness to the book. Considering the horrid limitations that constrain moviemakers trying to bring a book to the silver screen, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good adaptation.Though I had some minor problems on first viewing: the abbreviation of the book's beginning, the poor portrayal of the scene in the forest, and as great as she is in her own way, Emma Watson did not fit my picture of Hermione--the movie has since grown on me in its own right.On its own, this movie easily gets four stars out of me. But...(and this is a big BUT) with two discs to work with, Warner Brothers has underwhelmed me with the DVD's weak special features. Most of the cool stuff included here has been available free at the Harry Potter website.In comparison with other recent multi-disc releases (Cast Away, The Godfather Collection, The Simpsons Season One) and even some single discs (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Gandhi) Harry Potter's special features come up miserably short. There is not even a director's commentary (just a woefully short featurette).I give the movie my full recommendation; just don't expect much else from this DVD package.	3.0	well done movie, poor DVD package	2002-07-17	19	16	3

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3E0MSKBIWMU6F	obryanstars	I LOVE the Harry Potter series, there is almost NO book(s) like it.  I have already pre-ordered #5, and am crazy about the series.  When I heard that a Harry Potter movie was being made, I was, in a funny yet true word, HYSTERICAL!  I was so excited (I was 13 at the time).  Well, a year later, I went and saw the movie, and while it was a good movie no doubt, parts of it were just...stretched?  Heres what I thought of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone.1) Plot: This movie follows (DUH!) the record selling book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling.  This movie, as promised, is FAITHFUL to the book.  And if thats all you were looking for, seeing the book for the most part brought to life page by page in a movie, then this movie was PERFECT for you!  I even enjoyed the movie because it was so faithful.  But while nearly every scene, literally, in the book made its way on to this film, a lot of it had NO insperation whatsoever.  For example, when they were in a lot of the classes, it showed maybe 30 seconds.  A charm being completed, a potion being made.  Why not have a bit of the class actually shown, like Proffeser McGonagall reading text from her book, or perhaps even all of the STUDYING for the exams, or being assigned homework and projects.  They literally skip from scene to scene to scene, and while I did enjoy going &quot;Oh yea, I remember when Snape said that&quot; or a few seconds later &quot;that was one of my favorite parts of the book&quot;, it gets dull after while, and NO scene really seems to grab you.In Lord of the Rings, they stayed in one spot or situation for at least 5-10 minutes (one reason it was such a GREAT movie), but in this, thats counsidered a LONG scene, and you never really get in to it.  Another problem I had was a lot of things I thought were important still WERE missing.  For example, the EXAMS in my mind were a HUGE part of the year, cut out.  The Elders Mirror or whatever, they spent 15 minutes on.  I think that could have been trimmed down to perhaps 5-7 minutes.Quidditch games?  Only one game shown, about 5 minutes.  Daily classes?  They only go to each class once for the most part, and they don't even go to every class.  They tried to cram so much into this movie, it became almost too little EVERYWHERE!  They cut out the visits to Hagrid except for 1 or 2.  And you really don't get to know the characters.  Everything seems to happen AROUND Harry, never to him.  He almost NEVER gets hurt, he never gets in fights with Malfoy (ANOTHER big part).  Except for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, almost no one did more than a few minutes of acting.  But for everything they did put into this movie, and I know I sound criticle, they DID do an excellent job and created in many's hearts, a classic to the book.What they DID do well was the last 30 minutes or so, the tasks, Voldemort showing up, the Forbidden Forest, etc...  These last few scenes set the drama, and for a movie aimed at kids, this one was GREAT.  But for the teenagers and adults, this film lacked some things.  Still a good movie and worthy of your owning (I DID buy it on DVD), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was done very well, and I would reccomend it!2) Graphics: Very well done.  Everything in Hogwarts is put together FANTASTICLY!  The castle, classes, robes, wands, spells, Quidditch matches (EXCELLENT), the unicorns, etc...  The one part I think they didn't do well on was when Harry grabbed the bad teacher (can't say who...not a spoiler) and his head feel apart.  Could have been done a LOT better, but I guess they had the kids in mind.  Everything looks convincing, and while it's no Lord of the Rings, it was done EXTREMELY well, 4 stars!3) Acting: This is where the movie struggled if it did.  Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) did a very good job for the most part, but in certain areas, ex. when Ron was nearly killed, Harry (without even looking at him) asks offhanded &quot;You okay?&quot;  &quot;Yea!&quot; gasps Ron.  Harry never even looks at him!  Little things like this popped up every 15 minutes or so, but as these are young actors and should without a doubt get better, they did a pretty good performance.As for the teachers and Hagrid, etc..., acting was done EXTREMELY well.  Within a few years, I'm sure this cast of Hogwarts will improve dramaticly, and while it may not sound like it, the acting was well done.4) Overall: This was a good movie.  The acting was good at most parts, the graphics were above par.  The plot, while sometimes un-inspired or strechted, follows a book that won countless awards.  Everything here is wrapped up into a pretty good package.  There are little things here and there that I didn't like, and I think this could have been trimmed (ex. The Mirror) to about 2 hours, or added more important events.  But overall, this is a good movie, and in my book, worthy of a purchase.  While this isn't going to ever win an Oscar, its loyal to the book, is a great movie for kids and a good movie for adults, and even though parts were kind of choppy, this is a great movie, and being the first of an epic adventure, I expect this is just the beggining of the great moments of Cinema still to come in the series.3.5 Stars / 10Thx!	3.0	A Good Movie, But Something Was Missing...	2003-03-16	6	4	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2JLK1SQ8O03EO	octobercountry	Well, most people have already made up their minds about this movie, whether they loved or hated it, but a few more thoughts here... For me, the picture did seem to be missing something--it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would; seemed to be a bit lacking in emotional depth.  I didn't get the sense of how desperately unhappy Harry was to be living with his relatives, and what a relief it was for him to get the invitation to Hogwarts.  I'm not sure that's the fault of Daniel Radcliffe, though, since the film skipped over the first part of the book pretty rapidly... One section of the film that really DID work for me, emotionally, were the couple of scenes dealing with the Mirror of Erised--very nicely done, and rather touching.Other plusses... The casting was very good, I thought.  I really liked both Ron and Hermione.  The Quidditch match was great--doesn't that look like fun?!  And Hogwarts was splendid, both inside and out.  How could I possibly resist all that mediaeval architecture?  Great to look at--and nearly all the interiors were shot at actual locations, in rooms hundreds of years old, not sets.  The music was very fitting as well--I'm not a big John Williams fan, but the main theme for this film was just perfect.So, after seeing the picture several times my complaints have subsided--I do enjoy it!  It does lose a bit on the small screen--seeing it on the big screen, in six-channel sound,  is of course much more impressive than watching it on television.  (For instance, in several scenes if you looked closely you could always seen the figures in the paintings on the walls moving slightly--it's hard to notice that on the small screen.  And when the flying keys crashed into the closed door, they made a very deep THUD that you felt in your chest--you got a sense of how dangerous they were.  Lots of little details like that are lost on tv...)Now, as far as the DVD presentation of the film itself goes, boy, what a DUD.  I honestly don't know what the people at Warners were thinking when they put this thing together.  There is almost no supplemental material at all--there was so much that could have been included, but wasn't.  No director's commentary, no in-depth behind the scenes material, no out-takes, no interviews with the child actors, NOTHING.  Disc two is almost entirely a sort of ... game/puzzle combination.  You have to do all sorts of tasks in the proper order to get to the stone and your reward, which is seven brief deleted scenes.  I don't know what age this is aimed at--certainly not adults, and not many kids either, I would think.  And the thing is, there is no way to get to those scenes directly through the menu--you have to go through the entire thing every time you want to see them.  Just stupidity...However, there is a shortcut which others have mentioned.  I couldn't do this on my particular DVD player that is hooked up to the television, but it did work when I put the disc in the computer.  Bring up the track listings, and click on track 80.  Wait just a moment for the scene to change--when the row of bottles appears, click on the round one.  And that will take you to the deleted scenes.A few of the scenes are interesting enough--problem is, there aren't many of them.  For instance, I know that there was some material shot with the Weasley family at the train station, but none of that was here.  What I would really have liked to see was a longer cut of the film, about three hours in length, with an intermission added.  That would have been perfect for viewing over two evenings, for those people who are pretty busy.  (I'm thinking of myself--by the time I finish working at about eleven every night, I'm too tired to watch a two and a half hour movie in one sitting anyway!)  The rough cut of this picture ran a whopping FOUR HOURS--there was plenty of material to work with, to put together a longer version.  So, I'm rather annoyed that the film wasn't lengthened, though perhaps someday another version will be available.  Still, I'm very glad I bought the disc to be able to view the film, or certain scenes, whenever I'm in the mood to do so.	5.0	Great Movie, lousy DVD	2002-06-15	3	3	0

It's very true to the book (which is fabulous in my opinion, I don't know why some people complained about that), although there are some slight differences.  The movie makers have done a wonderful job bringing Rowling's world on screen.  The visual effects, especially Fluffy, ghosts, chess pieces, Quidditch game were done exceptionally well.The second disc is all extras.  I guess it was designed for Harry Potter fans and people who enjoyed the movie very much because it was assumed that you've watched the movie beforehand.  The deleted scenes were a little hard to find since several steps have to be taken.  First I had to go to get the key and take money from the Gringotts bank in Diagon Alley.  Then purchase wand from Olivander's.  Then return to the school and attend classes.  Go to potions class and answer three questions.  The questions were a little bit of a hassle for me.  Answer for the 1st question: Aphrodel and the tube next to it (forgot name); 2nd question: wolfsbane and monkhood; 3rd question: snake fangs and porcupine quills.  After the questions, select winged key by trying out a few. Then select the orange colored potion and you will see the mirror of erised.  There are a total of 7 deleted scenes.  Although some will say they are not worth the hassle, but I liked them.  My other favorite extra is the interview.  It was good to learn about the behind the scenes interaction of the director/producer/actors etc and production of the movie in general.  They also mentioned something about the second movie.Overall good buy.  Worth every cent.  Will rewatch it on DVD many times.	5.0	Excellent adaptation of the book!

She does not look the part..too cutesy.DumbleDore (Richard Harris): Harris didn't want to do this part but his grandaughter made him and it shows. He is too subdued and there is no twinkle in his eye. Very bad compared to his performance in Gladiator.Ron (Rupert Grint): Only makes weird expressions throughout the movie..you call this acting?As for leaving out important stuff..wasn't it important for Harry to know why Snape hates him?

If you have then you know the entire plot of this movie-- if you haven't-- here's a brief synopsis:  A young boy named Harry Potter is an orphan and lives with his only family-- his horrible Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudley.  His life with these people is awful-- they treat him like a ""dog that rolled in something smelly"" (to quote the novel) and make him sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.  One day Harry receives a mysterious letter but his Uncle snatches it away and destroys it before Harry can read it.  Soon, more and more letters come and Uncle Vernon starts to go mad-- he uproots the family to get away from the thousands of letters addressed to Harry.The next night a giant man barges in on the family and delivers a letter to Harry (one of the same that plagued Uncle Vernon)-- it's his acceptance letter to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Harry is a wizard!  The rest of the story involves Harry's first year of learning magic, making friends, playing Quidditch (like soccer on broomsticks) and finding out more and more about his past and his parents-- apparently he's famous in the world of magic!Ok, it's a great story and the novels have captured the imaginations of children and adults alike.  The Harry Potter books are a phenomenon and the movie has been greatly anticipated.  Fans will not be displeased with the film when it comes to the story line-- director Chris Columbus stayed true to the book in most respects (many small details are left out and some events have been altered just a little in order to help move the plot along better).  The film was two and a half hours long, if all the little details had been left in the film, who knows how much longer it would have been.Now, the only thing that might disappoint those who are hard to please (like me) are the special effects.  The movie is about wizardry and magic, yet there are only a few scenes in which anything magical happens.  It would have been nice to see more magical things, especially in the class rooms (hardly any scenes about that at all-- which really disappointed me).  The special effects that were there, some were fine, some were good, and others were laughable.  Ever see ""The Mummy Returns""?  Remember the end with the Scorpion King animation?  Some of the animations were that bad....but not all of them.So, do I recommend this film?  Sure.  It was fun and it's a good story-- obviously, or else the book wouldn't have been a hit in the first place.  It is a little long...2 1/2 hours will do a number on your rear, make sure you've got a comfy chair!  If you haven't read the books and you enjoy films in the genre of fantasy then you will like Harry Potter.  If you did read the books, you'll be happy that nothing important was left out and nothing was bastardized-- (think ""Circle of Friends"").

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AMGG7A32NKTB3	Patty O'Brien	Before Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone came out on video/DVD I could not stand the sight or sound of Harry Potter.  To be honest I could not stand the name.  So when it came out on video/DVD I rented it to see what the hype was all about.  Now four months later I own the movie (which I bought the same day I rented it). I have sence bought all four books and read each twice and am on the third time reading them.  I cant wait for book five to come out and for the next movie.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an awesome movie.  It is just like the book it keeps you going till the very end.  The movie however, just brings it to life even more.  The entire cast is totally aweosme and the special affects are awesome to.  This is a MUST OWN MOVIE!!! I highly recomend it to anyone with an imagination.	5.0	Made a believer out of me	2002-09-24	2	1	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AKYP06R981T5B	Paul	J.K. Rowling's mega-bestseller receives an excellent film treatment from director Chris Columbus, although the film falls just shy of true masterpiece status.You'd have to have lived in a cave in Afghnistan not to know the plot: Harry Potter lives a miserable existence in the cupboard under the staircase at the home of his Aunt and Uncle Dursley, and their spoiled rotten son Dudley.  But just as Harry turns 11, he is accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his hidden heritage as a wizard is revealed, a heritage of fame throughout the world witches and wizards, a heritage with powerful enemies and unexpected dangers.Columbus does an outstanding job of re-creating Rowling's world onto the screen.  Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as Harry, and the supporting cast is stellar, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Hogwarts' Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the sinister Professor Snape.However, the movie's greatest flaw comes from its overly faithful adherence to the book.  Out of sheer necessity, some scenes have been cut, but the movie sticks to the book like glue.  This provides a limiting factor, as books and films are different media, following different rules.  For instance, Peter Jackson made sensible changes on &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, by not being as slavish to that book, resulting in an improved film.Ironically, one of biggest bones to pick with this film is the elimination of a scene near the end of the film, where Hermione is denied a scene of physical courage that was in the book.Still, the widescreen version is a classic, with a wonderful score by John Williams.  The DVD features are interesting, although a bit lacking, and are nothing special.  It's also a pain to have to unlock the deleted scenes which are contained on the second disc.But, to paraphrase The Bard, &quot;The film's the thing.&quot;  And this is a film no family should be without.	5.0	A Magical Movie Despite a Few Flaws	2002-06-09	6	4	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A25XGZX0YRTJKN	Paul J. Moade	"... this is probably the best one. It captivates the audience with the magic and dreams of a young boy (Harry Potter) finally learning who he really is -- and discovering that he is something special.As is generally the nature of the film business, sequels never quite match up to the pilot film. This is not to say that ""Chamber"", ""Prisoner"" and ""Goblet"" were not good movies; they were. This is simply better.The story takes us on a tour of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft -- as unlikely place as any in the realm of fiction -- and introduces us to some delightful characters. The sanguine master, Professor Dumbledore; loyal and gentle giant, Hagrid; sinister and sulking, Professor Snape; and of course the main characters, Harry, Hermione and Ronald Wesley.Harry is singled out almost immediately as exceptional and develops a continuing advisary in the guise of Draco Malfoy. Draco represents everything Harry is not. He comes from a wealthy, well-known family; has influence, is arrogant and is sure of himself. In the sequels we come to know him a bit better (and dislike him even more) but even in the first film, he reminds us of the kid in school we always hated (envied?).The imagination runs wild as Harry and his new friends discover many delightful objects and puzzle over situations. The mirror that shows one's innermost desires, a trek thru the dark forest to look for unicorns, fluffy the three-headed dog, wizard's chess, and the mystery of the sorcerer's stone itself.The music score well fits the scenes depicted and tends to be on the light side. Characters are well played and believable (within the realm of the story at least). And the ending - if not a surprise - is at least not a letdown. One finishes the film smacking his lips in anticipation of the next release.This is a movie to be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. Adults will marvel at the special effects and probably remember their own childhood experiences in school. Kids will delight to the characters and the many devices throughout the film. The action is mild enough that even the youngest of children can watch without parents having to worry about language or violence.Want a good evening's entertainment with the family in front of the television. You can't go wrong with this one.*** Highly Recommended ***~pjm~"	5.0	Of the Released Films ...	2007-01-25	6	6	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3L23DPICGVP1T	P. Dolan	Knowing how Hollywood has a tendency to butcher a book's adapation to the screen made me very leary to see this film, but, for once, they got it right.  Knowing there is only so much you can put into a 2 hour movie, the deleted scenes (which, by the way, don't make it so difficult to get to) could have been put in the film which would have extended it by about 5 minutes, but they also would have provided some nice transitions and/or more needed background (Dursleys).  The acting was where I would have expected it to be, the sets so realistic I wish they offered tours.  But the basic charm and magic that is found in the books was transferred to the screen intact.  In all, my only real complaint is that it wasn't long enough.  I really look forward to the next installment (provided the same attention to detail is kept).	5.0	The Magic Was There	2003-02-24	1	1	0

One of the things that most impressed me is that may three year old child was mesmerized by the film and did not fall to sleep both times that he has seen it.JK Rowlings did a wonderful job of writing a book so interesting.  I believe that the most amazing aspect of the story is that it is about everyday life at a not so common school.The film is almost like reading the book.  No complaint about it.  It is still nice to read the book, but the film brings into being the wonderful caracters of Harry and Hermione.If you have not read the book, the vocabulary may be a little difficult, so that you have to see it at least twice.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2000DWMMYNIYB	Peter Lorenzi	Not much of a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genre, an overseas flight offered me the opportunity to see what I had understood to be a delicious, imaginative story of an orphan finding himself. Instead, I found the creative elements to be more boring and mundane than exciting, the kids to be overly stereotyped, and the plot more banal than bodacious.The story blends recycled elements of Dickens with Star Wars and Ben Hur only with tens of millions spent on 'special' effects. Expecting colorful characters, I found only silly characters dressed extravagantly drawn by aging  if not ancient English thespians. Fighting off sleep was more of a challenge than the twists of the tale. And the bits of terror are inappropriate for any child under age thirteen, unless you accept that young people need to have nightmares.Thank goodness they didn't charge me for the headphones on the flight!	2.0	Oversold product of an overactive imagination	2002-06-05	34	5	29

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3B2ODL8TGGN5G	"Philip Bolton ""Panda Phil"""	Being the sort of person who is strongly allergic to hype, I've stayed well clear of the whole 'Harry Potter' phenomenon up til now. Great, another overwrought kids book full of silly names, and bratty child heroes. But, when my roomie came home with the DVD, my curiosity got the best of me and in the dark of night I smuggled the disk up to my room and into my player.And was instantly hooked! On it's own, I found the film to have just the right mix of humor, warmth, and yes...magic. The heroes aren't bratty at all, but loveable, with just the right touch of vulnerability to make you care for them. Even the female lead, who all too often in these sorts of films is either bratty, or in need of rescuing every five minutes, manages to hold her own with the boys.The special effects are fine, and the cast of seasoned actors seems to be quite enjoying themselves. The script is quite charming, with all the great touches of british wit that make their fantasy stories seem so charming. I haven't had this much fun since my younger days of watching Doctor Who.  Add to that the youthful enthusiasm of Speilburgs early films and you have quite the winning combination.Like most everyone else though, I have to take one star off for the DVD itself. I certainly have no problem with a disk full of games and the like to keep the kids entertained, but I had hoped that there'd be a bit more meat on the disk for us serious movie fans. More deleted scenes, a proper commentary, that sort of thing. I can only hope that at some point, WB will grace us with a Special Edition set for us older viewers.I'm not sure I'm ready to join the long line of rugrats haunting the Waldenbooks to buy the books. But for the $... HP is a real bargain, and a must-have title for the fantasy lover, or those who just want to feel like a kid again.	4.0	Better than I expected	2002-06-16	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A6II5W2FBOWG1	Phillip Lozano	It became unbearable to endure all the wholesale lifts from other material, including The Chronicles of Narnia, the Oz series, The Lord of the Rings, The Worst Witch series (especially), boiled down into a tasteless hodgepodge. There's not a single fresh idea in there, in concept or execution. However, the movie should have been somewhat redeemed by the supporting cast, behind-the-scenes talent and the production values; it wasn't. This series opener is a cynical, bland and charmless attempt at a family film. Where The Fellowship of the Ring film adaptation trancended the traditional limitations of the fantasy genre with its heartfelt performances and its themes of loyalty and sacrifice, Harry Potter seems a one-dimensional power fantasy with some flimsy moral lessons tacked on as an afterthought, like the public service messages you used to see at the end of children's cartoon shows in the 1980s.There are a few excellent family films that have been virtually ignored the past few years, such as Kiki's Delivery Service, The Indian in the Cupboard and The Iron Giant. Buy one of those for your kids instead. The director's own Young Sherlock Holmes is far superior to the watered-down Grimm's Fairy Tale that is Harry Potter.I have to admit, though, I did like Fluffy; I always was a [softy] for a three-headed hell hound. However, it's a shame the filmmakers felt they had to tone down the scary stuff like this to placate queasy parents; Monsters, Inc. was geared to an even younger audiences and had more genuine thrills, dealing with some of childhood's most primal fears in an truly entertaining and, for children, empowering way.	1.0	Banal source material, cynical movie	2002-06-17	24	10	14

The special effects for the most part look as though they were done in the 1960s or 70s, and I've seen better make-up in old Dr. Who reruns. The muzak is worthy of the most derivative drivel by John Williams, swelling to clue the audience to the heroic bits and cloying to signal the sweeter nougat. The only sadder sign of massive cultural collapse than the popularity of this sort of cobbled together candyfloss is the number of people who think that the Harry Potter books are ""manuals for the Religion of Witchcraft.""No wonder Spam is making a comeback in Ms. Rowland's homeland.

And Dumbledore, who is supposed to be jolly, energetic, and a bit on the mad side, is tired, not even half a happy face's jolly, and too serious. Also, Harry can be a bit flawed as an actor in SOME parts, but he is okay in most parts. Ron, Hermione, Snape, Quirell, Flitwick, McGonagoll, Wood, Neville, Dudley, Malfoy, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, Hagrid, Nearly Headless Nick, and Percy are great for the roles they play, however.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2CMYX10636NG2	Portia	This movie, was of course, the most anticipated of its kind. After the almost magical success of the Harry Potter books, it would be MORE surprising if a movie DIDN'T make a smash! JK Rowling, a fabulous author, deserves the successful recognition of a movie version-- it is only a shame that in these days, a movie is almost expected. I personally would have preferred to let the books remain legends in themselves.This movie was quite wonderful, nonetheless. First of all, we had really wonderful British actors and actresses. From those we already knew would be brilliant (Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman), to the pleasant surprises (Daniel Radcliffe and especially Rupert Grint), the cast was awfully strong. The recreation of the atmosphere invoked by Rowling in her books is to be thoroughly applauded. The touches and nuances of color, texture and feel were absolutely perfect. The sound (especially the phenomenal musical score) deserves praise. Daniel Radcliffe delivered a rather sensitive portrayal of the newest brand of hero: The timid, &quot;who me?!&quot;, real-life, youthful chap who is raised to nobility despite himself and to much humble surprise. (Frodo in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Peter Parker in &quot;Spiderman&quot; are two other surprise-hero roles)A couple gripes: Special effects looked like they were headed out to be flawless, until we got the icky video-gamey ogre and the dissapointing revelation of Lord Voldemort's face. Also: Emma Watson wasn't exactly ON. I hate critiquing actors because sometimes they are perfect in one role and just miss it in another, occasionally it isn't their fault. I just found Emma's Hermione more annoyingly one-demensional than Rowling's Hermione. She played up the confidence without tempering it with Hermione's slight insecurities. It's just a thought.Also, despite all my praise, I realize that without the fabulous book series, this movie could never stand on it's own. This sounds obvious-- I mean, if the books hadn't been written, the movie wouldn't have been a concept, let alone a reality. But let me explain: This movie just doesn't mean as much unless you already loved the books. It isn't a great piece of film in itself. It is loyal to the text and faithful to Rowling's descriptions. Unfortunately, the best books-turned-movies were not exact replicas, but affectionate homages. The movies reflected the book without exactly copying it.Of course, I am no director, and deeply admire anyone who can take such a literary success and even attempt to create a theatrical success as well. I realize that I am probably in the minority with my criticisms, and there is much to like about this movie. Worth seeing, but NOT instead of the books. My advice? Read the books instead. Hats off to all, especially Rowling.	4.0	a definate fan-pleasing flick.	2002-11-05	0	0	0

This is the blue ray version of that first film. Actually the only differences in the US and British (Though this disc is probably the Canadian edition since it is region 1) versions is virtually wherever the characters say ""sorcerer's stone"" in the US version, they say ""philosopher's stone"" in the British version. Frankly I prefer the British version. This is a one disc blue ray product. The resolution is superb throughout the movie. This disc has the movie and the following special features: Additional Scenes; Capturing the Stone: Casting and Bringing the Novel to Life; Around the World Multilanguage Lips; Ghosts of Hogwarts; Yearbook Character Clips; Lesons in Qudditch and What It Takes To Hatch a Dragon Egg; Theatrical Trailers.I particularly enjoyed watching this high resolution blue ray disc looking for those items that will be in the Deathly Hallows: the put-outter; Griphook the Goblin; the vaults of Gringotts; the first time the various characters met; the interaction between Dudley and Harry; and, of course, Snap's interactions with Harry.I highly recommend this blue ray edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."	5.0	Great British version of the first Harry Potter film	2010-03-30	6	5	1

Definitely recommend any one who likes the Harry Potter franchise movies and doesn't have it yet picks it up.  Well worth the cost (since so cheap too).	5.0	Family of 6...	2011-08-23	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AER15RIMV8E6D	Pumpkin Man	See how it all began. Six years before Harry and Voldemort's final battle, we find out that Harry is a young wizard and must be trained at Hogwarts. He befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Together, they try to stop someone from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone. I still remember being 11 years old and seeing this with my mom. This is a very fun movie to watch.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3DGALKDMMEWXZ	Pushpak	Update : August 31 2010 : I received the new disks from Amazon and the audio issue has been resolved.This is a review for the Blu Ray Disc Set and not the movie itself (which I have no problems with). The audio track for the main movie was defective and had an almost Headphone-ish feel to it. No sound from center and back speakers, and only sound from front left & right. Furthermore, there was no option (that I could readily find) to change the audio track so that I could troubleshoot the problem. Thankfully, Amazon has agreed to ship a replacement. Awaiting the replacement set and will update the review accordingly.Note that other BD's work perfectly on my setup and only the main movie from this set had the problem.	4.0	Great buy - with extended scenes !!	2010-08-10	5	1	4
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stays faithful to the popular book which inspired it (though sometimes a little too faithful), and creates a magical film that everyone in the family can enjoy.Bringing the text of J.K. Rowling alive is an excellent cast and superbly designed set and props. Without any major changes or exclusions, fans of the books along with those un-read in the adventures of Harry Potter should enjoy this flick. The celluloid world authentically feels like the words Rowling wrote. Daniel Radcliffe is great as Potter, and the young actors playing Ron and Hermione are equally as astonishing. But it's the late Richard Harris who is most notable, perfectly cast as Dumbledore the headmaster. The wisdom in his eyes reflects the genius of the head wizard.The one flaw this film has, however, is its straightforward adaptation. With hardly any changes made from the book, the film seems too rushed and crowded with characters and events. When adapting from a book, the movie should take scenes and characters that work in the transfer to the different medium, and change events or scenes that don't work. That which works in a book, doesn't necessarily work in a movie. Comparing this to Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, which came out at the same time and is another fantasy adaptation, it's easy to see that Potter wasn't quite as successful in the adaptation process as that movie, which knew what it had to change and delete in order to make it work on the big screen.But despite that problem, this film still works as a whole. It's magical, beautiful and perfect for the whole family. Kids will love seeing their favorite characters come alive and see first hand the wonderful world of Harry Potter.	4.0	Magical family entertainment	2002-11-17	3	1	2

It was said that this movie is filled with witchcraft and it is true that magic and witches are in this film, but nothing too suggestive or eerie.

ButThis movie was rushed, it kicked everytihng up to fast speed to get itdone in time. I tried while watching it to enjoy it, but it justdidnt happen Little neeeds to be said about it, you can read otherreviews. But LISTEN dont put too much stock in what the fans say. Theyare all Book fan yes men, who like the movie just because it is harrypotter. I am an avid reader and have seen many good book movieadaptation, and this isnt one of them. If you want to see a moviebased on a book, go see Lord of the Rings or anytihng by JohnGrisham. So im not bias this is a fair review by someone who reallyreallly wanted to love this film. SO take my advice and dont justlove the name Harry Potter, open your eyes and read the books again ifyou have toMy Problem isnt that it was cut or it didnt have all thebook material in it. It just didnt capture the essence of the story,the casting is horrendous, the acting is worse, and the story was toldall wrong. Sorry I know you wont listen to me, you see all theseother shallow reviews of Potter Maniacs and you WILL beleive them, Iknow I would, but I went to the theater with all open minded fans, andthey all hated it. I have seen it twice in hopes to like it uponsecond viewing, NOPEThis is a good childrens movie, but ""theemporers new grrove"" or classics like ""the Wizard of OZ"" were MUCHMUCH better E.T is coming back to theaters go see that, buy it onDVD with the money you saved by renting Harry Potter instead of buyingit."	2.0	Lacking a Soul	2002-03-09	120	32	88

The entire series was a delicious escape into fantasy and mystery.  The first movie introduced me to a fine ensemble of talented actors and that talent grew as the characters grew up.  Ms. Rowling masterfully weaves a tale of mystery and suspense that even rivals the great J.R.R. Tolkien.  Young Harry Potter must learn of his mysterious past along with the audience and that is great story telling. Thanks to Amazon.com for their low pricing because I first purchased the series on DVD and later replaced them all with Blu-Ray disc's.

When I took them to see it I was totally impressed, so much so I went out and bought all four books to read for myself.Now second, all this negative feedback about the movie compared to the book has got to stop. You have to realize that the film makers have to take a four hundred page book and reduce it into a two hour movie. They do not have the time to go into all the detail of the characters background.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2PTWKZ2VKD2D0	"Red Moose ""Mark"""	I know that this is an enormously popular series, and I've tried quite hard to like it (I read all the books too), but I can't get past the copious shortcomings of Harry Potter. For one thing, it's terribly overwraught; the supreme clumsiness and obviousness with which the writer tries to manipulate our emotions is totally laughable. In fact, I can't believe that even children fall for it. Not to mention the fact that there is no room for humanity is any of the &quot;villains&quot;. None of them are shown to have any redeeming features at all; they are so one dimensional that they might as well be cardboard cutouts with &quot;bad guy&quot; stencilled across their foreheads. Nor is there ever any opportunity for them to be forgiven or to be allowed to make amends. The show very much promotes an &quot;us and them&quot; attitude among the heroes. Even when one of the bad guys offers to make up he is rejected by Harry. This brings me to the actor who plays Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, the worst child actor I've ever seen in my life. I could forgive him his lousy acting if only his expressions were a bit more human. The kid has all the facial complexity of an old Japanese cartoon character. He has two expressions: utter delight and joy when awful things happen to people he doesn't like, and a vengeful scowl until these things do happen.Also, the show promotes kids lying and stealing to get what they want (the end oh-so justifies the means); it encourages cliquiness and a ruthlessness towards opponents (win at all costs!). This is certainly nothing new, and neither is the advocation of disrespect and disobedience towards authority, but it grates just the same.As for the film production, it's pretty good, though not spectacular. The sets are contextually predictable and the special effects are average. Everyone but the star does a fairly good job of acting; there are a bunch of cameos by more established actors, though most of the scenes feature Harry and his two friends.All in all, I'd not recommend this movie to anyone.	1.0	Sorcerer's Stone is Rock Bottom	2003-05-05	24	4	20

I really wasn't expecting anything, I really don't when I see movie adaptations of books.  And let me tell you, I love the books, I think they're truly wonderful.I am always disappointed when movies cut bits out of books, but I understand the necessity, so I'll skip over that particular criticism, and just say that the production team did a magnificent job bringing Harry Potter to the screen.  Everything is as I imagined it, most of it even better.  Quidditch finally realized is a true treat for the eyes!If you haven't seen this movie, and have a vivid imagination and can disengage your doubt and Twenty-first Century cynicism, you will truly enjoy this fantastical treat.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A39W3263A9HCMN	"Renfield ""Up the Irons"""	"Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test.Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray.As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the ""Watchmen"" of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable.In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, ""soft"". The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come. Still, a must see nonetheless.MOVIE: 3.5/5VIDEO: 3/5AUDIO: 5/5EXTRAS: 2/5OVERALL:4/5PROS: Soightly above par video and excellent audio to be found in this blu-ray release,CONS:  Video is not as good as it could be, plus the lack of extras is disappointing."	4.0	Philosopher's Stone Blu ray review	2011-08-21	1	1	0

I was nearby the movie theater entrance when I heard a voice say ""The Harry Potter movies first showing is starting now""  than I saw a mob of elementary school kids rampaging their way to the theater and I was in their way.  After the dvd came out I decided to buy it just to see what the excitement was all about and I was astonished at how much I enjoyed the movie.  After that I decided to but the first book and have since gotten the entire seven books of Harry Potter as well as the five movies that have so far been made.  The first blur-ray dvd video and audio isn't to much better than the standard version.  Some of the background is a little clearer and sharper but in all not to much of a difference and the same can be said for the audio as well.  The next four I can tell you are a lot better though as those have much better picture quality detail.  The audio choices are also amazing with the next four blu-ray dvds meaning the languages you can select are massive.  You also get a bit more with the extras but if you're like me you probably never really check them out.  So as the prices for these great blu-rays have gone down in price I say either get the entire collection set or just buy the first one and see if you like the movie.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed with your decision..."	5.0	Nearly Been Trampled By Grade Schoolers Brought My Interest About The Movie	2008-11-01	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2O7E9V4W7OHDF	RICHARD ALTEMEYER	It was great to watch Harry Potter again and revisit the world of Hogwarts.  The book literally comes alive with the performance of this children's movie.  My kids enjoyed not only the movie, but plays for hours with the enclosed special features such as making potions,clicking on the characters to make them talk and the game.  The extra disc (which has the extra footage and bonus games) is a nice feature to keep separate the movie from the extra fun (and less chance of damaging the movie).  Overall it was an excellent choice to purchase for the kids!The only complaint I had was that many scenes from the original big screen production was that some scenes had been trimmed to make the movie shorter (ie Dudley's birthday trip to the zoo).  I would have prefered the original movie unaltered, but it still is a great story!rick from florida	5.0	Harry Potter widescreen dvd review	2002-06-02	2	2	0

It gives you a different point of veiw on how the characters look and it also gets parents to understand what their kids go gaga on all the time. I am glad to say that my dad has finally seen it and i was the one who took him. It was the fifth time for me.

However, the original movie was over four hours long, and it is being advertized as if that is being put back into the movie. With an extra two hours to put all the detail I mentioned into the movie, it should be exelent, hence, my 5 star rating.	5.0	Good... But not Great.	2002-02-17	0	0	0

After working at Radio City Music Hall and seeing special effects done live and seeing real entertainment special effects in movies is worthless and is usually a cover-up for poor acting and untalanted actors.  But i digress. Every-so-often there is an acception and this film is it. It's wonderful! Pure enjoyment! Fun &amp; exciting, following as close to the book as i've ever seen.

Like perhaps everyone else on the planet, I also became enthralled by J.K. Rowling's works.So, it was with a great amount of trepidation that I went to see the first Harry Potter film.  Having been disappointed so many times before, I found it hard to believe that the magical world created by J.K. Rowling could possibly translate to the screen.  After all, these worlds were so intricately detailed, so perfectly described, and so different from anything that we had previously experienced.  After four books, I had a ""perfect"" mental image of every character, every place, every event.However, I am delighted to say that I was wrong, and very much impressed by the way that all of this detail was captured in the film.  The characters were very much like I had them pictured.  I can't think of a single detail that was left out.The acting is superb.  The visual effects are stunning.  The film was very well directed, and the editing was masterful.  Instead of spoiling my mental images, the film simply enhanced them even more.This is THE film to own on DVD.  You, your kids, your neighbours and your relatives will come back to watch it again and again."	5.0	Brilliant	2002-03-05	5	4	1

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1G85HUQ51BD30	"Rista ""ristaus"""	I have never read any of the Harry Potter books so I didn't quite understand what the big deal was over the movie when it came out. But I decided to get it on DVD to see what all the hype was about. I was really quite surprised how much I enjoyed the film. It's such a charming family movie.The best parts of the film were definitely the special effects. The actors who played Harry Potter and Ron were adorable and very likable. Ron and Harry's female friend Hermione, was a character who was simply annoying, but I suppose this was the point of her character. Alan Rickman as the puzzling, yet slimy Snape couldn't have been played any better.From the music, to the cinematography, and great story, I just can't go on enough about Harry Potter. Surprising to me however, was the length of the movie, about 2 1/2 hours. A bit long for a children's movie, but the pace moved along really well, so I don't think anyone over 7 or 8 would be too bored. The extras on the DVD are pretty good too, especially the deleted scenes. You have to play a game to access them, but that's half of the fun.	5.0	Pleasantly Surprising	2002-08-02	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	APBDZ88BBTN4F	R. McAdams	"We just got our blu-ray player, after holding out for so long.  So, naturally, I am on a blu-ray buying spree.  So far, of all of the blu-ray discs I have watched in high definition on our 1080p HD TV, these new ""Ultimate Editions"" of the Harry Potter films, have impressed me the most.I am *NOT* an audio/video expert.  However, I can say that the films look crisp and sharp, to me.  We are playing the discs on a Playstation 3 using an HDMI connection to our Sony Bravia Z-Series 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV.  The sound is quite nice as well.  We don't have a full digital audio setup, but we do have a limited 2.1 sound system attached to our setup, and the sound seems to be better on the blu-ray discs, than the DVDs.  But that may just be a placebo affect.I was worried that because the films we made quite a while before blu-ray came out, or before it was super-common to film all digitally, and in high definition, that what we would end up with would be an upscaled version of the DVD footage, showing heavy grain and looking blurry.  I can say that it doesn't look like that at all.  It looks fantastic.  Like the actors are right there in the room with you.  Additionally, the blu-ray disc contains both the theatrical release, and the new extended version with cut scenes put back in.  A *LOT* of scenes make more sense with those scenes back in.  It helps if you have read the books, but if you haven't, then those extra scenes make the movies make more sense.As for the extras, the booklet is nice, and has some interesting photos (and very little in the way of words or explanations to explain them).  The case is fantastic, and high quality (the interior case which is the big box right inside the slipcover is the same kind of pseudo-leather the LOTR extended versions use, AND it has a nifty magnetic clasp to hold itself shut!).  The over-sized trading cards are ridiculous and clearly a gimmick (but they are well made).  The DVD copy has all of the old special features from previous releases.  However, if you are a super-fan of the books and movies, it will be the blu-ray special features disc that you buy this set for.  Specifically, for the hour long documentary included in each ultimate edition containing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff I have been wanting to see for such a long time now!  They also do in depth interviews, and show stuff we have never seen before, like the actors screen tests, and their green-screening techniques.I loved the set, I loved the price, I loved the quality of the films in HD, and I loved the extras.  5 stars, all the way!"	5.0	Fantastic!	2009-12-13	10	8	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A4FX5YCJA630V	"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya"""	With J.K. Rowling becoming the richest author in the world, it seemed almost inevitable that her books should become movies. Though everyone went to the theatres with a healthy dose of trepidation, most came out satisfied, feeling that Rowling's story and vision had been successfully transferred onto the big screen. This is not too surprising as Rowling herself was a major participant in the making of the movie.For those people who have been living under a rock these past few years, here is the general story - orphaned Harry Potter is taken to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin where he grows with no knowledge of his magical past. He lives a rather miserable life under his family's tyranny, till his eleventh birthday when he recieves a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. So off he goes, to find his independance and freedom, a host of friends, kindly teachers who become parental figures, and of course an education in the magic arts. But there is a secret plot within the school concerning the Philosopher's Stone - one of the staff is planning to steal for his master - Lord Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed his parents, and only Harry, Ron and Hermione can stop them.The real strength of this movie lies in the transition of Rowling's imagination and her host of characters, places and creatures to 'real life'. The detail of the sets, the merticulous costumes, the superb casting choices, and the special effects make this movie a visual feast for the eyes. A big highlight was seeing the Quidditch match - it was inevitably more exciting visually than any written account of it. Although in some scenes you could tell the actor where obviously CGI or strung up against a blue screen, the pace and action eliminates this minor gripe.Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Ian Hart as Quirrel are great, but standing out even more so is Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid and Alan Rickman as the cold, arrogant Snape, who still comes across as one of the good guys despite his loathing of Harry.I felt that perhaps the friendships between Harry, Ron and Hermione was not properly created as I picked up no real warmth or affection between them. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all fine young actors and presented the personalities of their characters they functioned more as three separate beings than the team linked by friendship that Rowling creates in her books.On the whole, though this is a *very* enjoyable and re-watchable movie, it is presented more as an accomplice to the book, only being able to be fully appreciated to those familiar to the books, who are able to fill in the blanks that the movie leaves out. Therefore, I urge others to read the books before watching the movie, as it cannot even begin to convey the intricate layering that Rowling creates in her book that reflect on future books in the series (for example the plot twist concerning Scabbers in book three). Though purists will hate me, I felt perhaps film-makers should have been given a bit more extra freedom to work with the material instead of being so restricted to the book. To do so would have made the movie feel like it had beginning, middle and end, with character development, plot growth and a climax, instead of a series of events where one can almost see the separate chapters of the book.	4.0	A Great Transition from Book to Film	2002-06-24	1	1	0

In fact, I really had no idea who he was (except for the bits of information from my brother). I read several reviews, and decided I would go ahead and buy the DVD when it first came out. I have not regretted my decision since.Prepare to be amazed as Harry Potter, a not-so-ordinary boy becomes an extraordinary wizard. The plot line is interesting, and the movie more than adequately explains the story to those of us who were not previous addicts. A new viewer will easily be able to catch on quickly. This movie has everything from fantasy to sci-fi to sports action to science. A truly great movie that everyone can enjoy.The DVD is well worth the money to purchase, as much for the special features as for the movie. The makers of this DVD have gone the extra mile to bring you a tour of the magical Hogwarts, so that after the movie you can do a little bit of exploring on your own. This feature had me hooked for hours. There are numerous others, so prepare to spend an evening with this DVD.The movie is great for those with children, because it is very clean compared to other movies. If you have young children, however, please remember that this is a PG film so you may want to view it once before you purchase.If you're not into the magical realm of movies, then I recommend that you rent this one before you buy.

I love the film and the fact that the actors are REALLY English, for the most part and not just Americans pretending to be English. I believe they've captured the magical sense of the novels. I believe the author's forcefulness was a great piece to the film. As a writer myself I often play with the idea of the ""what if"" my novels are picked up for a movie release. I don't know how much control I'd want on the film. I'm more prone to keep strong about the soundtrack, rather than the film, which is mostly someone else's interpretation to the book. As with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone parallel the novel very closely.

But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up.

But then, I watched the interviews with the cast, and I thought to myself 'Hmmm, maybe I should give this film a chance, and check it out.'  Being that I had never read the books, I went into this film completely fresh, without any expectations whatsoever.  And boy I was NOT disappointed at all with this film.  Everything about this film was great, the storyline, the acting, and the special fx.  everything was just on point, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"I must admit right up front that I have never read the J.K. Rowling novel on which ""Harry Potter: The Sorcerer's Stone"" is based.  As a result, I come to the movie ""cold"" as it were, being neither a full-fledged aficionado nor an inveterate denigrator of this phenomenally popular book series that, in the past few years, has taken the literary world by storm.  Thus, I will not be able to say to what degree Chris Columbus' handsomely designed film adaptation does or does not do justice to its source.  All I can say is how the film struck someone like myself who comes to the material fresh and without expectations of any kind. Well, the verdict, I must say, is a decidedly mixed one, so please allow me to elaborate.Let me state, at the outset, that the movie starts off splendidly.  We are introduced to the infant Harry Potter as he is mysteriously dropped off one night at the home of his maternal aunt and uncle in suburban England.  We quickly move ahead in time to find Harry, now aged 11, living a sort of male Cinderella existence, mistreated and overlooked by both his surrogate parents and Harry's precocious, spoiled brat cousin, appropriately named Dudley.  In the early stretches, the film does a superb job subtly injecting the excitement of magic into a real world setting.  There is also quite a bit of wry humor as Harry begins to slowly awaken to the fact that he has these strange and inexplicable powers to manipulate the elements of his world to his own advantage.  The film retains its spirit of fun as Harry, led by the mysterious but lovably burly Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid, journeys to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the tools of the trade towards which his eccentric destiny is leading him (his parents were also witches, killed by the evil wizard, Voldemort, who obviously has designs on Potter himself).  The preparations for Harry's enrollment in school (i.e. purchasing a magic wand) and the attempt to find his way to this magic hidden land are executed with fine, deft strokes, and Columbus keeps the movie blithely bouncing along at just the right momentum and speed.  Harry's introduction to the school itself is well done as well, as he meets an assortment of colorful characters (both faculty members and schoolmates) and boggles at the amusement park-like atmosphere he finds there, with an imaginative surprise seemingly lurking around ever corner.Yet not too long after we hit the school, something seems to go out of ""Harry Potter.""  Perhaps the anticipation raised by the first half of the film leads us to expect too much, but, if the truth be told, the storytellers don't seem to have thought much about what to do with Harry once they get him to his destination.  Though we like Potter's two chums, Ron and Hermione, and a number of the faculty members, the adventures Harry ends up encountering while at the school seem rather tame, bland and ordinary when you get right down to it.  The monsters the writers have dreamed up for him to conquer aren't particularly interesting or intriguing and the plotting itself lacks excitement and suspense.  In fact, structurally, the film seems more like a series of elaborate set pieces designed more to show off the special effects than to provide a unified narrative that builds and grows to a cumulative impact.  Even worse is that much of the ribald humor of the earlier part disappears as well.  Had more of that dry British wit we are treated to in the initial stages been carried all the way through the film, ""Harry Potter"" might not have come across as quite so flat and attenuated as it does.On the positive side, Daniel Radcliffe gives a superb performance as Harry, capturing the innate goodness, wide-eyed innocence, and no-nonsense practicality of the character he's been called upon to play.  He makes of Harry a very real, very recognizable and very likable young boy.  Radcliffe is more than matched in performance by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione, Harry's two finely drawn companions in adventure.  It's a pleasure, too, to see the wonderful Maggie Smith doing her Miss Jean Brodie bit again after all these years.  No one can convey the brittle starchiness of the English schoolmarm better than she.""Harry Potter"" is also a beautiful looking film, thanks to outstanding cinematography, production design and art direction.So there you have it:  as I said earlier, a decidedly mixed bag of virtues and drawbacks.  Those already enamored of little Harry Potter will probably balk at my carping.  Those already driven mad by Potter-mania may think I am too indulgent in my overall assessment.  But for one who feels little personal stake in the Harry Potter deification/demonization battle, I must say that this is a pretty good film that, I suspect, could have been much better."	3.0	starts well but can't sustain itself	2002-07-04	1	0	1

I didnt like malfoy however, because i was frightened by him. This is because of the fact he was mean to the runtish harry potter lookalike boy. Ron was funny because he had a pet mouse, and i thought it would be funny if the mouse was eaten by some form of ravenous rabbit. Voldemort had a rubber head that had been constructed by an obviously low paid prosthetics and special effects team but this added more humour to the film, so i was not frightened by his evil antics of doom.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A7KWYZ2ZYQRA6	Rosebud	This movie is Bloody Brilliant!I was a Harry Potter fan the second I picked up the first book, which was when it came out.  And I have thouroghly enjoyed reading all these brilliant books.  If you are a Harry Potter fan I know you will enjoy the first movie.  It has everything a movie needs.  Suspense, Drama, Fantasy, Courage, a Hero and a Villan, love, loyalty and betrayal.  Being after the book it just had to be good.  There are a few parts I wish they hadn't taken out but all in all it was wicked.  I would recommend reading the books before you see the movies, I enjoyed very much comparing the Book and the Movie with my friends.  Being 15 you would think that maybe I might of outgrown Wizards and castles, at least thats what everyone else thinks...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO WAY! See this movie I know you'll think it's Wicked also!	5.0	Harry Potter Fans Unite!	2004-01-10	5	2	3

Rowlings books aboutthe young wizard who comes to Hogwart's to learn to be a greatwizard and his adventures are all lively told in the seven booksbut what kind of director would take on the task of bringing thisbeloved tale to life i would be none other then the director ofthe Home Alone films Chris Columbus.The story goes as one day when Harry Potter was only a babyhis parent's were attacked by an evil wizard named Valdemort,hewas then taken in by his horrible foster parents that dislikedhim a great deal because he was diffrent then most kids HarryPotter(Brett Radclif),recieves mail from a Rupis Hagrid(RobieColtrain),who takes Potter to a place that's filled with magica place called Hogwart's on the way Potter meet's his two new companions Ron Weasly(Ruprent Grint) and Hermonie Granger(EmmaWatts).With Harry Potters poularity not many people at Hogwart's know what to make of there new edition neither does Prof. Dumbeldor(the late Richard Harris),when the three investigaterumors of the Sorcerer's Stone there days at hogwart's get's a big more stranger and where there path will lead them will testPotter and his friends jugement to find the stone in this endearing gem.With loads of special features included a guided tour of hogwarts , trailers , games and hunt's you'll be content when you buy this DVD not to mention you get a ticket for The ChamberOf Secrets if you love fantasy of family film or just want a that feeling that you had when you saw The Wizard Of Oz thenadd this film to your collection you won't have any second thoughts you did.	5.0	Magical entertaining and endearing , a film with heart.	2002-11-14	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"I've never read any of the books, co I'm not going to quibble about how well it holds up to any of them.Harry Potter is the son of two married witches killed by the evil witch, Voldemort.  Somehow surviving the assault as a baby, marked by a jagged scar, Harry is raised by his hateful cousins (they keep him in a special room under the steps; Harry's portly cousin Dudley makes sure to come down the steps like an elephant) until that day when his parents' alma mater, Hogwarts Academy of Witchcraft, decides to accept him into their freshman class.  Knowing nothing of his parents or witchcraft, or of the way that preturnaturally magical people live alongside the rest of us non-magical types (or ""muggles""), Harry is happily surprised to learn the truth.  Though set in modern-day UK, Hogwarts and the Witches Quarter resemble a cross between England in its Dickensian and Edwardian eras, complete with a winding street that looks like the one used in the ""Muppets Christmas Carol"" (Hogwarts itself seems like a send-up of the old English schools like those made famous in ""Tom Brown's School Days"").  Introduced to this new world by a gentle if dim Giant named Hagrid (Robby Coltrane, made to resemble a friendly grizzly in size and texture), Harry takes to his new existence and quickly maps out his challenges both mundane and epic - making friends with other student wizards, amassing points for his ""house"" (Hogwarts students are divided into dorms), contending with a snotty, bullying student named Draco (another nod to Tom Brown), and looking into the suspicious workings of the academy's potions professor (Alan Rickman) who appears undoubtedly in league with Voldemort.This was a fun film, but somewhat long and loose - too content to be an event movie than a closely plotted one.  It was fun watching all of those kid actors navigate a world full of more recognizable adult stars (Maggie Smith resurrecting the heavy Scottish accent she used in ""Jean Brodie""; Richard Harris as the school's dean; Alan Rickman who probably doesn't appear enough for plotting reasons; and Michael Caine as...wait, Michael Caine wasn't in this movie!  What happened to Michael Caine?)  While the special effects are great and all the players do a great job, the movie on the whole holds very few surprises.  The moral of the story is that love and friendship are the strongest forms of magic (there's hope for us muggles yet!), but the relationships are undertreated in the script (climaxed in a sort of deadly game of wizrard's chess played by Harry and his friends; in another instance, Ronald makes fun of fellow Griffendor-Wicth Hermione.  Though she's hurt, she spends much of the time being about the most frigid 12 year older you can imagine, never explaining how Ron's comment caused so much damage, or why she's so cold).  Still, despite its foibles, a fun movie and an event movie that outdoes the latest Star Wars flicks.  My 5 year older watched this and had a ball."	4.0	Misses some magic, but still a lot of fun	2002-11-10	1	1	0

I enjoyed watching the film at home even more than in the theater. The transfer was sparkling, and the sound and score magnificent.On disc two, my quarrels begin. Trying to view the extra features on the DVD was akin to torture. After hours of tootling with it I finally managed to watch the 7 deleted scenes, at least three of which were highly enjoyable, particularly the full scene of Snape's reprisals of young Harry and Hermione in the potions classroom (this should have been retained in the film!). I said ENJOYABLE, not worth the massive headache I had after a night of toying through senseless games and irreverent insults courtesy of Jim Dale, the narrator of the ""books on tape"" versions of the novels in the Harry Potter series. I previously enjoyed his work (he's a wonderful voice talent and brought real magic to the audiobooks) but this was just too much!And at the same time, it wasn't enough. Rumor has it that four hours of footage were shot for this film, but we get seven deleted scenes of about 9 minutes total? After all the features I saw on television leading up to the film's release, they could only muster a very short and very talky ""Interviews"" segment? With the second film in post production the summer before its release, is it not time to reward loyal readers and watchers with a teaser trailer?  I enjoyed a very hilarous feature on NBC's dateline where Katie Kouric interviewed people at King's Cross Station about the whereabouts of Platforom 9 3/4. Would it have been too much trouble to include some fun for adults as well in the form of information about Harry Potter's massive impact on popular culture and literacy? About how the books fostered a new and fervent reading culture in our children?I guess not...and as such, some of the most loyal fans of a great series have been pretty drastically let down."	3.0	Magical film, lackluster DVD	2002-05-30	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2RHBT46LS6DA3	"Ryk E. Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God"""	"First, the bad. Then the good.When the DVD was announced, much was made in the advertisements of the Extra Scenes Not Seen in the Theater. This is of course one of the Cool Things (TM) about DVDs, they often have neat additional material. So my son and I were eagerly looking forward to seeing this. I hoped at first that some extra would be added to the movie itself, but it appears not. No problem, says I, we'll just go to the extras menu and go to the deleted scenes.There is no such selection.In fact, there is no selection which would TAKE you to such a selection.The extra material is there, of course. But to get to it you need to play through what amounts to an incredibly lame short semi-RPG game of puzzles and so on. And since the DVD can't remember such things, you have to play through this stupid sequence of actions *EVERY* *SINGLE* *TIME* you want to view the footage, unless you tape them to a VHS -- which, of course, removes a lot of the utility of a DVD.Take those responsible for the marketing out in the back, and shoot them. This is quite probably the most boneheaded design decision I've ever seen in corporate America, and that's saying quite a bit. One whole star off the rating for this moronic design flaw.Now, as to the movie itself...Most adaptations of books to the movies or television depart from their source material; sometimes it's a matter of a few liberties, but in many cases it's more a matter of systematic abuse and torture, often leaving the viewer wondering what the heck the point was of using the title if you weren't intending on filming the story CONNECTED with that title.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, however, hews very close indeed to the book from which it's derived; not surprising, since J.K. Rowling was given an unprecedented amount of control over the entire project. The major changes are cuts and compressions, something which is inevitable; even a relatively short book contains more material than can be put onscreen even in a long movie.Unfortunately, this does slightly damage the story. The original novel is a rather interesting fusion of three subgenres: the English Boarding-School adventure, the ""child with mysterious background/powers"" story[related to the Cinderella trope], and a classic mystery novel.The movie severely damages the mystery-novel aspect of the story, eliminating or downplaying important clues and rushing us along in the final solution. Reading the book permitted a clever reader to figure out what was going on before it was all revealed at the end of the book -- it was a ""fair"" mystery, one that did give you the chance to solve the problem without hiding crucial information. The movie, unfortunately, does leave out or severely understate some important clues. It also severely compresses several sequences, most notably Harry's time with his ""evil step-family"" the Dursleys.However, the rest of the book is kept virtually intact, with much of the dialogue taken verbatim and the scenes precisely as described. The casting ranges from ""good"" to ""inspired""; I can't think of a single bad casting choice, and all the acting (which in a production with this many child actors is a major concern) is at worst workmanlike and at best is excellent. Alan Rickman as Snape and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid put in stellar performances, making the book characters spring to life perfectly.The edits -- especially the compression mentioned earlier and removal of the fiendish logic puzzle that protected the way to the Sorcerer's Stone -- do, in the end, rob this movie of its potential for perfection, but it remains an excellent, fun, and wonder-filled diversion, perfect for any age."	3.0	Movie GOOD!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1ERDXS0QLEVKB	rzaster	"In this adaptation of J.K. Rowling's acclaimed ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone,"" Chris Colombus put together a great movie that any fan of the books will love. I was a bit skeptical about seeing this film because I thought that the movie would be done poorly and that I wouldn't end up liking it. I ended up enjoying a lot. Chris Colombus stayed right with the book and didn't change a thing. Never have I seen a director that was making a film out of a book keep the film so real to the original novel. Colombus had some skill to do this movie with such beauty.The actors chosen for this film were great. I had imagined every character from Harry himself to Hermione all the way to Albus Dumbledore. Each of the actors did such a great job that I am sadenned to see that this film was not nominated for many Academy Awards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were adroable and no other kids could have done as good as a job as they did. The castle chosen as Hogwarts was great and presented the witchcraft and wizardry school very well.This movie serves the book very well and most Harry Potter fans will be very pleased with this. I recommend that you pre-order this DVD so you will be able to watch it when it comes out. Everything in this film was done very well and it seemed like the movie was being played off of Rowling's book.

Some parts are changed or embellished, but I found that it made the movie more interesting, i didn't know every little thing that was going to happen.

I saw this movie after reading the book.  What a marvelous adaptation.  I had a huge grin on my face as I sat in the theatre and watched in awe as the characters came to life on screen from the horrible Dursleys to Ron and Hermione.I was most impressed by the array of talented actors, especially Maggie Smith and Daniel Radcliffe.  He was amazing as Harry.  Alan Rickman was superb as Snape; effectively conveying his dislike of Harry.For the sake of time, there were some scenes that were changed in the movie, such as when Harry Potter meets Malfoy.  In the book they meet on the Hogwart's Express and at the end of the movie, when Hermione solves Snapes potions puzzle (which wasn't in the movie).All in all, it was a faithful adaptation of the book.  That will probably annoy the hell out of all those right-wing Christian lunatics who condem Harry.  If you're sane, and enjoy a good story with great special effects and acting, get this movie.	5.0	The new Wizard of Oz	2002-07-02	1	1	0

How could anyone say that those such as Robbie Coltrane's acting was flat? He, not including looking the stature and gruffness of Hagrid to a tea, was the best portrayal that they could have possibly found for the role. Really-who else can copy Rubeus Hagrid's accent to such a caliber?!...The kids, Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint and Tom Felton were excellent for their roles-especially Ron, who was played to the at most perfection-he even looked how I imagined him!! Emma Watson is a little too pretty to be Hermione (I always imagined her much plainer,) but she plays Hermione's cleverness and frank scoffs with flair.And lets not forget the actors who portrayed Percy Weasley (who was very business-like and only lacking his Horn-rimmed glasses) The Weasley Twins Fred and George, (both very convincing, though most of their very very funny lines were sadly cut out) and Oliver Wood (who besides being very cute, has a nice Scottish accent that adds to his personality. Great Quidditch captain!!)Second of all: The special effects were awesome-especially the Quidditch match, played, AT LAST, before your very eyes in full-fledged velocity!! I was thrilled to the tips of my fingers, and found that to be spelled out spectacularly in stunning visual effects. Fluffy, though clearly a computer generated three headed dog, was nice and vicious-big teeth and lots of slobber on Ron's shoulder added to his personality.Third of all: They kept all crucial elements in the movie that made the book what it is!! What did they take out, may I ask? They added all of the characters, their great acting and great specail effects, along with keeping all of the best parts and leaving the message that warmed our hearts in the book in the movie. ""It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to our enemies-but even more to stand up to our friends...""...At least I know what this movie is-a spectacular,enchanting, (even though not perfect, but honestly movies can never be as good as books) adaptation to a classic that will live on forever in our hearts and minds! Harry Potter-THE BOY WHO LIVED!!oh yes, and P.S.-Ian Hart did an amazing job as Quirrell-I thought he deserved more credit than he got for his wonderful portrayal.

Old and young alike love the Harry Potter series. Many fans are awaiting the 5th book. But no it has been delaying pending the 2nd Harry Potter movie. Not only did this movie leave out characters (peeves) and changed the ending of the movie completely (i wont go into details) it also took a book and turned it into another movie for youngsters to watch instead of reading the book. The book is definately better. Tolken goes into such good detail it could never be made as good in Hollywood and i was dissappoined they even tried. However if you never read the book and never will (a very bad choice in my opinion) is this movie is fine it has a good plot and characters and some of the special effects are cool (I like the candles floating).

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AYGGVG5VNZV9V	Sarah E. Mcfadden	The casting of this film is perfect.  There is not a single character who does not look exactly as he or she ought, particularly Rupert Grint as the quintessential Ron Weasley.  (Now, in the second movie, as much as I love Ken Branagh, I'd adore Hugh Grant as Gilderoy Lockhart ... but I digress.)  Chris Columbus and company maintain overall a refreshingly reverent faithfulness to the book, which is, of course, a classic.So why did the film version leave me slightly flat?I've decided it's not the fault of anyone involved in the production but the inevitable result of condensing an entire school year into a 3-hour film.  So much of what makes the book irresistible is in the details, details which must, sadly, be excised in the conversion to a film that you can watch without a lunch break.  Hermione's application of &quot;petrificus totalis&quot; to Neville is far less poignant without the backstory of his struggles thus far in the school year. A Quidditch match without Lee Jordan's biased color commentary just isn't the same.  And, oh, how I miss Fred and George Weasley's jokes!So I applaud the efforts of Columbus and crew, who have, I believe, delivered just about the best product possible.  But let no one make the mistake of seeing the movie while omitting the read the book.In regard to the DVD version, I found the extras on the second disc disappointing, apart from a truly enjoyable interview with Columbus et al. on the making of the movie.  But no outtakes?  No deleted scenes?  No early peek at the making of the sequel, already well underway by the time this DVD was issued?  Color this fan disgruntled.  The movie itself deserves 4 stars, but the DVD presentation downgrades my rating to 3.	3.0	Somewhat less than magical, especially on DVD	2002-06-10	2	1	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ARFQZBTNWB0XV	Sarah	The Harry Potter movie was good, altough I was a little dissapointed when they left out some interesting parts. Like the part when Hargrid gave the dragon to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, to give to Charlie. The three of them use the invisibility cloak and loose points for their house. They spent way too much time on the wizard's chess, twoards the end, and they left out the part where they have to drink a potion to go through the dungen. The book was very good and better than the movie. It was good to see the movie just to see how they portrayed all of the characters.	3.0	Muggle Magic	2002-07-13	1	0	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A262552763NJRG	Sarah Ragin	The Harry Potter books are wonderful. I like action and adventure books and Harry Potter is sure that kind of a book. J. K. Rowling did a great job on books 1-4. The author put in a lot of fanasty into books 1-3. I must say that in book 3 was really great because, that's when Harry finds out that he has a godfather and Hagrid had a hippogriff named Buckbeak, who is a half eagle and half horse. Well that's for now.From,Sarah Ragin	5.0	A great movie	2002-02-10	3	1	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1F4F3GU4TDNYJ	"Sarah Russell ""Adaria"""	The deleted scenes DO exsist, on disc two. It is hard to get to them, you have to work your way trough the 'game' of the second disc, starting on Diagon Alley, getting your wizard money at Gringotts and then your wand at ollivanders, then going to the classrooms and starting in Transfigureation, go to the stand with the owls on it. It will take a bit of time to figure it all out but you can finally see the deleted scense, you basically play through the book. I am dissappointed by this, as it took me a long time to figure it out. This doesn't dampen my spirits though, the movie is still `number one, though it cut out some minor thingsfor the sake of time. Overall it's a great buy, if you have kids, if not, still worth it to keep the movie forever, since DVD's, unlike VHS tapes, don't wear out, only break.	4.0	Great DVD but hard to see the deleted scenes	2002-06-02	0	0	0

We enjoyed it immensely and can't imagine ever getting tired of seeing it over and over again.  However....our excitement at viewing the &quot;extra features&quot; available on the DVD quickly grew to frustration.  You are not able to simply select and view the &quot;never before seen footage&quot;, as you can on other DVDs.  I've since learned this feature is &quot;hidden&quot; somewhere on disc 2...I've also read that children can more easily find this feature...perhaps.  My daughter is just as big a fan as I, except that she is only 3 years old, and as intelligent as she is, can not navigate around that DVD, looking for the extra footage.  It is most annoying-they should have thought better than to hide what is to be a highly anticipated feature.	3.0	Movie: 5 stars  Extra features: 1	2002-05-29	5	4	1

There are additional scenes that actually add to the story. Those of us that have read all the books often get a bit caught up in the differences between the books and the movie. The additional footage fills in a bit of what was missing.The additional footage will be of interest to those that would like the movie to come closer to the book, and will add a little help understanding the details for those who have yet to read them.In addition to the added content, the BluRay version is a superior visual and audio presentation. I already had the first, older BluRay edition and was instantly impressed with the video quality of the new release. I don't know what they did different but the new BDs are superior to the disks that cane in the BD ""trunk"" set that came out a little over a year ago.The added (non-movie) features are entertaining also.

I can whistle the theme song and they both drop everything and come running. The older one is only 2, so what does that tell you? It means that it's not too scary, not too complicated, and interesting enough for their rapidly changing attention spans to hang on to.  It's a great match to the book because it capture the innocence and naivete of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and it does a great job of introducing the audience to the characters, the conflict, and the setting of the Harry Potter series. These young actors have done a great job of nailing down the characters, Alan Rickman was born to be Snape, and Dame Maggie Smith IS fabulous.

I like it very much, wish there are more like the book I read.However, true that 2nd disk does giving trouble for people who do not know what to look for. Most people around me did not read the book or know how to solve/play the game. The company should have leave all 7 never before-seen-before scenes in the movie than on 2nd disk. OR They can make dvd with no game and dvd with game so that we can pick what we want.Last of all, I am very disappointed that all 7 scenes do not have English subtitle! No closed caption/English subtitle for me to know what they were saying. I am deaf. I have found almost all of my dvd movies does not put closed caption/English subtitle for special features. They should. Any movie maker company should do that. It is not fair for me to ""suffer"" with lot of guesswork for 7 sceness- trying to imagine what they were saying.All DVD movies I have said ""closed caption"" They did not appear on my tv or anyone's tv! I tried with different system and different tv. No such luck. I wish they should be clear if closed caption is English subtitle then PLEASE mark it clear! I personally doubt regular closed caption works at all. Three of movies I have with no English subtitle- they were labeled with closed caption- NONE! Totally waste my time with any movie's special features-""blind sound(voices, etc)""(don't know what to call it) for me.UPDATE: And finally, 2011, I recently found out HP4 movie for PSP... I am so shock that it has NO CLOSED CAPTION NOR ENGLISH SUBTITLE!!! Seriously?!?!? I am deaf and I do really want to be able to enjoy the movie on my PSP (region 1) It is not fair for deaf people.

The DVD, however, is a bit of a disappointment because there are no audio tracks for commentary, and the deleted scenes are nearly impossible to find. Instead of allowing the viewer to select the deleted scenes, they turn it into a game, and the game is very confusing. I gave up, rented the video, and watched the scenes on that. All of the special features are on a second disk. So far it's seemed like to much work to get through it. I'm glad I got the DVD since the art direction and cinematography deserve the clearest medium, but I think the project manager was a bit over-ambitious and knew nothing about human-DVD interaction. Pushing buttons in the hopes that something will happen certainly isn't my idea of a good time, and that's exactly what you have to do because there are no buttons on screen, just arrows as in &quot;go here&quot; or &quot;go there&quot; through corridors kind of like a DOOM game.	4.0	DVD difficult to navigate	2003-01-03	2	2	0

I won't go into a diatribe about ""New Age"" or Witchcraft influences... quite frankly, they are everywhere and I don't want to beat a dead horse... but aside from those concerns, a parent should be concerned with the trend in all child-targeted films (including this one) of making authority non-existent.Harry Potter has been orphaned and growing up with hateful, loathesome relatives. Too many kids in our society live  in blended families or other situations in which there is favoritism and/or verbal and/or emotional abuse.Harry is ""rescued"" from his life as the unwanted child by being whisked away to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Parents are not present, nor do they visit. The children at this school live in dorms on campus and there are several ""forbidden"" rooms that contain monsters or booby-traps and all children are informed that a visit to the library will result in certain death.  That school is one scary joint! But the attitude of the film is ""let's have fun"" and ""there are no consequences for disobeying authority"" and ""if you don't like the ways things are going, cast a spell.""We live in a very selfish society... and the story subtly gives the message that adults are only good for instruction in some areas, but can otherwise be ignored and not listened to.Yes, it's ""just a movie,"" but in a world where kids are kidnapped from their own bedrooms and terrorists are looming around the corner, kids tend escape further and further into fantasy and have less and less interest or desire for reality.In a nutshell, if you're going to buy this movie for your kids, then you need to watch the film with them and talk to them about it and ask them questions about what they thought about it. Any movie, including this one, should not be used as a babysitter or as a substitute for exhibiting family values instead of just espousing them.As for myself (an adult) and for my parents (in their 60s), we found the film to be entertaining, humorous, clever and a good way to escape... but we all agreed that we never needed to see it again. Some films (like Star Wars) can be seen over and over again... this is not one of those films... at least not for adults. Kids who obsess on Potter, et al, may feel differently."	4.0	Entertaining film for all ages	2002-08-02	18	3	15
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1JDDX70A0XUFO	shivatrance	Good movie, but will be disappointing for fans of the series.  In it's defense: It does try much harder than most book-to-film adaptations to stay true to the book, although it was the little things that annoyed the hell out of me. For instance the major complaint I have is the placement of Harry's scar.  In all of the books, the lightning bolt shaped scar is located dead-center on Harry's forehead.  For some reason, in the filmsit will be located off-center. Why? What purpose could there be to stray from this little tiny detail that I am sure all fans of the series would notice?The main reason to watch this film can be summed up in two words:Alan Rickman.This guy kicks...! They couldn't have casted the role of Snape any better.Worth seeing, but be sure to rent before buying as you could be dissapointed.	3.0	Could have been soooo much better, but still decent.	2002-09-16	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	"Harry Potter was one of the big event movies of 2001, and its massive box office and popularity showed the world that kids do still read books ""on occasion"". For the uninitiated, Harry Potter is the story of a boy who discovers he is the heir to a proud tradition of magic, and travels to Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry. The movie is a very faithful adaptation of the novel, and also showed the world that directors can successfully adapt novels and remain faithful to the source.Perhaps though, Harry Potter is a little too faithful. The movie tells the story competently, but does not add anything new or insightful. Basically, what you see is what you get, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Either way, however, I feel the movie did not justify it's long running time. While I'll admit I can't offer any suggestions offhand of where the movie might be trimmed, I do believe that a slimmer, more compact screenplay could've been written. Perhaps if the film had an exciting climax I might have forgiven this, but it doesn't. I can only imagine how annoyed those who didn't read the novels felt after two and a half hours when the movie ended rather anti-climatically. All in all, Harry Potter is still a very good movie. I wouldn't call it the next ""Wizard of Oz"" (like the DVD's packaging does), but it definitely has potential to make a very good franchise.Speaking of the packaging, this is where Warner Bros. really dropped the snitch. For those not in the know, Warner Bros. is one of the most reviled DVD producers of the major film companies. For awhile, many feared that Warner Bros. would package Harry Potter in one of its cheap, cardboard snapper cases, using a double-sided disc. While this was thankfully not the case, the results are definitely a disappointment. The packaging is still made of cardboard, with the discs being held in those awkward plastic boards ala Simpsons or Moulin Rouge. Considering that the movie is aimed at children, WB could've made sure the package was a little more child-friendly.But more importantly, especially for a two-disc set, the extras are sorely lacking. The majority of disc two is taken up by point and click ""interactive"" games that unlock the deleted scenes. I don't know who at Warner Bros thought the ""target audience"" would appreciate this, but my brother and sister are part of that audience, and they were left severly frustrated trying to access the deleted scenes. Besides those scenes, there is a mini featurette and a trailer or two, but almost nothing else. No commentaries, no special effects documentaries, interviews with J.K. Rowling, NOTHING. Harry Potter may use two discs, but only one was really needed. Warner needs to learn how to produce a proper two-disc special edition.As a movie, Harry Potter is worth the purchase. It's overly long, but still enjoyable. Just understand that you're basically paying for the movie, and very little else."	3.0	Warner Bros You Dropped the Snitch	2002-06-29	1	1	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A299HWEZ7HVX7R	Skellyblade	If your read the books, you will not be let down by this movie.  So often the books and movies have little more than the title and main character names in common.  This is NOT one of them.  The story of an orphaned boy who discovers that he is a wizard is well told in this movie.  A word of caution: this is about an 11 year old boy.  Some of the situations frighten him and rightfully so.  As such, I do not recommend little ones to watch this one alone.The only aspect of the DVD that I didn't care for was how difficult it was to get to the deleted scenes.  Normally, you choose to watch the scenes from a menu.  On this DVD you must complete a series of challenges to get to the scenes.  One challenge in particular is unreasonably difficult.  To solve the puzzle you must either guess well or have read the book MANY times.  I liked the idea of a challenge, but the answers should have been somewhere in the movie.	4.0	A good movie, true to the book.	2003-04-18	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	"I spent the equivalent of a full day's waking-hours in front of my big screen TV this past winter break with just the 2 sets of the four Harry Potter movies and the three Lord of the Rings movies. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3RWWJ05113D3D	Slim	"These ultimate editions are a pretty good value, especially if you don't own the films on Blu-Ray yet. They're only about $10 more than the normal editions, and they come with loads of extras. However, I feel like when you call something an ""ultimate"" edition there's nothing more you can add to it. There's a lot here, but I think any Harry Potter fan would feel like you could have more content.What you do get are 3 discs loaded with stuff. You get pretty much everything you get from the original edition (which includes trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, and a few other small features). What you get that's new is a 1 hour documentary of the making of the first film. it looks like each of these ultimate editions will come with a new chapter of making the film. So once all 8 films are released, you should end up with 8 hours of the making of Harry Potter.The packaging is pretty nifty. You get a hardcover art book, 2 cards (one of Harry and one of McGonagall), and a digipak case which contains the 3 discs. The art book has stills from the film, but the quality is exceptionally bad.I wish they had gone the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions route with these ultimate editions and re-cut the movie to include an hour of footage that you know they filmed but cut. I wish we had gotten commentaries from the actors and production team. I supposed we'll never get those now, since this is probably the last edition they'll release. It's a shame, because it could have really made this a great value and a must own for Harry Potter fans.So should you buy this? If you don't already own the films on Blu-Ray then it's definitely a must own. The extra content is worth the money. However, if you already own a Blu-Ray copy of the movie I can only recommend this for a die-hard Harry Potter fan. You're essentially paying $30 for a 1 hour documentary, a low-quality art book, some cards, and an extra cut of the film where they say ""Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone"""	4.0	"Good price, good content - but not ""ultimate"""	2010-07-31	5	5	0

It's hard not to enjoy the fun but complex writing of JK Rowling.  Harry, Ron, and yes, even Hermione, have become personal friends of mine through the books.That said, this movie is one of my favorites.  I usually find child actors annoying and unbarable to watch, but I've fallen in love with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson and the chemistry they have playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.A well written screen play, as well as wonderful acting puts this movie into the five star range.	5.0	The Boy Who Lived	2002-07-02	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1VOBEQ68G1D0Z	"""soanna1"""	I had read the HARRY POTTER books several times, so when I found out that a movie was coming out, I was eager to see it. I was not dissapointed at all, since it followed the book almost exactly! The plot (if you have not already read the book) is this: Harry (Daniel Radcliff) is a young 11-year-old boy who is an orphan and lives at his cruel Uncle and Aunts's house. Unexpactant letters begin to come to their house, yet for some reason is aunt and uncle do all they can to destroy the them. Finally, they decide to leave and camp out at a rustic old shack in the middle of nowhere. In the middle of the night, I strange giant (Hagrid) comes to the house. When he finds that Harry had not recieved the letters, he finally hands him one. He finds out that he is a wizard and heads off to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The scar on his forehead shows that while his parents died (not in a car crash as his aunt and uncle imply!) from the dark wizard Voldemort, he is the only boy who lived. I won't tell you the rest of the plt, as it may ruin the story for you. I'd suggest reading the book first, as it helps to give some extra background information not totally clarified in the movie. The actors, although many of them young, did an excellent job as their characters. (Daniel Radcliff as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione, etc.) I'm looking forward to CHAMBER OF SECRETS, the second installment in the series, as there are more events and action taking place. The reason I gave this movie four stars (4.5 actually) was because of some lack in development. Everything seemed to movie by very quickly, so there was no real understanding. Of course, if you read the books it wouldn't be a bother, but if you didn't you might find yourself questioning about the events occuring. The movie is rated PG for some mild language (there's not much, trust me) and scary moments (i.e. the huge mountain troll in the bathroom, forbiddon forest and 'Voldemore scenes', etc.) Appropriate for most kids 8 and older. Check this out on video/DVD (along with some extra footage) and be sure to watch for THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS coming out this November!	4.0	Excellent movie follow-up from a great book!	2002-07-14	1	1	0

The Sorcerer's Stone is probably my favorite of the Harry Potter series, because it starts us on Harry's journey as he discovers he's a wizard. I've read all the books multiple times, and have watched the first four or five movies on TV multiple times, so decided to add them to my video library.

John Seale's sometimes flat, muddy cinematography and the rushed FX shots become even more jarringly apparent. The reincorporation of the deleted scenes is a nice feature, however.The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary on the second disc is a very welcome addition. I appreciate when the film makers and studios make a more straight-forward feature like this, especially for a family-friendly or children's movie. Too often they're burdened with boring, kid-friendly infomercials that recycle the same behind-the-scenes footage. Much like......the third disc, which is disappointingly just a reprint of the bonus disc from the original 2-disc DVD release from 2002.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1QLUP86XSAK24	Steph	I thought that this movie did a great job bringing the novel to life. Actually seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts was great! However, as I have found in the past, books are almost always better than the movie, and this is no exception. Although the movie was great...the book was so much better. There are just so many more intricate details in the book that you just don't get in the movie...hence the 4 stars.  All together a great movie, and a must see for any Harry Potter fan!	4.0	Great Adaptation of the Book!	2003-06-11	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ATAL9NCZRN3AC	Steve MacFarland	"Generally when companies advertise deleted scenes on DVD, it means the owner can access them at will.  This is not the case with Harry Potter.  The deleted scenes were one of the reasons I purchased this two DVD set.  However, I discovered much to my chagrin that I have to play a video game to see them.Although the Warner Brothers website shows the steps to access the deleted scenes, it is nevertheless a tremendous nuisance.  I have never seen these scenes.  I really have no time for 18-step games.  I sent an e-mail to Warner Brothers asking them to send me a ""disk-2"" with no goofy access procedures.  I doubt if they will, but it is fair request. Disk-1 was okay."	3.0	Why must we play a goofy game?	2002-06-09	16	12	4
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	The Harry Potter franchise recently ended after the seven books were transformed into eight movies. Sorcerer's Stone (also known as Philosopher's Stone) was the first entry. It did well at the box office, grossing $975 million worldwide, and was the most successful entry until the final installment in the series beat it in 2011. The eight films grossed $7.7 billion worldwide, so they are enormously popular.Due to the popularity of the franchise, I'm going to assume that you have read J. K. Rowling's books, seen the movies, or both, so this review will contain spoilers. If you have never entered the world of Harry Potter, stop reading now.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was directed by Chris Columbus, who was responsible for Mrs. Doubtfire and the first two Home Alone movies. The tone of this first Harry Potter movie is quite similar to those three, relying on whimsy and comedy rather than drama. That matches the tone of the book, so it is not a criticism. If you had read the first book, like me, you were probably looking forward to seeing the world of Harry Potter portrayed on the big screen. The adapted screenplay by Steve Kloves didn't disappoint.There's a lot to like about Sorcerer's Stone; the sets are vast, the important story elements are present, and the majority of the young actors do a good job. It's a tricky business casting children who have to develop over the course of a decade, but I don't find myself disliking any of the choices. It's great to see Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express, Gringotts, Diagon Alley, and Quidditch brought to life.Sorcerer's Stone starts slowly and might seem overly long, but it's necessary to introduce the characters and the worlds they inhabit. I could imagine some people viewing this first installment and giving up on the franchise, but that would be a mistake. This is a vast story which starts off as a charming fantasy before quickly becoming much darker in tone. In a way, it mirrors childhood. We are initially fascinated with the world until we mature and realize that it does have plenty of problems. As the series progresses, the films grow more serious as the threat of evil increases.Some of the best moments include Harry first learning about the existence of Hogwarts, his initial flying lesson, and seeing the teachers demonstrate some of the spells that the children will learn. The main characters are fully realized and know a lot about them by the end of the movie.Sorcerer's Stone is a good blend of fantasy and action, with the final part of the film containing the most dramatic sequences as our three heroes try to recover the Philosopher's Stone. The music used in the movie is excellent, and the main theme itself suggests a magical setting. There are a lot of important themes in the series and I think it's generally a good example for children. The importance of friendship is one of the major messages and it all begins with the relationships between Harry, Ron and Hermione.The Harry Potter franchise isn't just for children. I'm 50 and I have worked my way through the books and the eight movies several times. The adults in the story are played by some of the finest British character actors. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? Dumbledore was played by Richard Harris in this movie and the sequel, and I think I prefer his version to Michael Gambon's portrayal, although Gambon's version did work for the more serious tone present in the other movies.There's a whole generation of people who grew up loving Star Wars, but here's a franchise for the next generation. Sorcerer's Stone is funny and lighthearted compared to later entries in the franchise, but don't let that deter you from watching all eight movies. The adequate acting improves considerably as the children age throughout the series.	4.0	J.K. Rowling's world looks just like I imagined	2012-07-30	3	3	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ANUSBCN463G1M	Steven Becker	"I purchased this DVD quite some time ago....and quite frankly, I should bequeath upon it FIVE stars instead of four...and would have EXCEPT for something that happened this last weekend.I was visiting friends for the weekend and on Saturday (I think), ABC Family Channel was showing Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. It was a dreary afternoon so my friends and I settled down to a couple of hours of watching young Harry in his first year at Hogwarts. Suddenly, while watching the movie, I sat up and exclaimed out loud. ""Hey, that wasn't in the movie!"" Indeed, my friends and I agreed that we had just witnessed a scene that was not in the DVD version we all had (and therefore assumed not in the theatrical version either). After that first surprise, we watched with rapt attention and extra scene after extra scene passed before us to the place where we were kinda making it into a game as to who would discover something new first.Well I was excited at the notion that maybe the makers of the Potter movies were doing what Peter Jackson did with LOTR: namely, bring out extended versions of the original movies, a year or two after the first DVD release,When I got back home, I knew I had to find out if extended versions were indeed coming out. Of course I went to Amazon. com. ...only to read MenollyK's review which stated that the original DVDs were actually trimmed down versions of the movies that were seen in the theatres. I hadn't seen the first two Potter movies in the theatres so I wouldn't have known this. I remembered how George Lucas had trimmed down the very first VCR versions of Star Wars, episode IV back in the early 80's, And just like Lucas I supposed the powers-that-be behind the Potter films didn't think the viewers would notice (let alone mind) if they also cut a few things out. Of course, someone could buy the special edition DVD and I guess these scenes can be seen separately from the rest of the movie ...BUT really, what my friends and I saw on Saturday was extraordinary; the extra snippets here and there only added to the magic of the story! Who could possibly be upset at their addition to a film a whole lot of us have loved from the get-go.SO, I give the DVD version of The Sorceror's Stone FIVE stars because the movie is still wonderful; minus ONE star because someone decided that those extra scenes weren't necessary for those of us who paid good money for the DVD (even tho ABC Family Channel apparentally thought otherwise).Who knows, maybe there is a charm (or a curse) that will compell the powers-that-be to release the movies in their entirety some day. Until then, take care!"	4.0	WHAT!...no extended version coming out?	2005-12-12	4	4	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a fabulous book. It's a good movie. It stays extremely faithful to the story (one might argue, too faithful) with very high production quality overall.There are some cheesy scenes -- the Quidditch match dazzles some unsophisticated viewers, but I found the special effects in that scene to be quite poorly done.The central story, that of a mistreated young boy who flourishes into a powerful wizard, is a universal theme that appeals especially to children. There is little objectionable material here, although some scenes are a bit scary.Two complaints -- Daniel Radcliffe looks the part, but lacks the spark that shines through in the books -- and there is a general lack of imagination on the part of the director, Christopher Columbus. Compared to the Lord of the Rings, which required a visionary director in Peter Jackson and included far more complicated themes, Columbus simply goes for the most sure-fire formulas for the box office. To use an analogy, this is the Twinkie and Lord of the Rings is the gourmet, many-layered raspberry souffle.	4.0	A competent and faithful film	2002-03-30	3	0	3
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3VQSFORKH8B7O	Steven Hancock	"""Harry Potter"" is a decent movie with good acting, good visual effects and weak-but-interesting storytelling. My concern HERE is the DVD packaging. Having the opportunity to release some fine behind-the-scenes material, Warner Bros. has really messed up this time. Instead, they've released a stupid kiddie-Video Disc. The only safe-havens on this disc are an interview featurette (With the filmakers commenting on this film as well as the sequel, which will also star Kenneth Branagh), theatrical trailers, and deleted scenes that I can't even find yet! Take a hint, and get your kids the VHS. Trust me, you'll save some money for a good reason! Movie Grade: B+; DVD Grade: D+"	2.0	4-Star Film, 2-Star DVD Set!	2002-05-30	2	1	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3SCRUU0LAPRLX	Steven R. Cunningham	This is a thoroughly entertaining fantasy, fun for children of all ages. The movie's release worked out well for me because I had just finished reading J. K. Rowley's book at a friend's insistence.Wisely, the movie takes us quickly through the early material of the book. Any more coverage of Harry's life with his Muggle relatives would have been tedious. Instead the film gets quickly to the good stuff after laying only the necessary foundation.Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermione, and the students and teachers at Hogwarts are all perfectly cast. Emma Watson's &quot;Hermione&quot; is a delight in every seen. Each member of the all-star cast is so well costumed and in character that he or she does not distract from the storytelling. It took me a while to recognize John Cleese and Richard Harris.The first view of Hogwarts, the school for budding witches and wizards, is visually stunning. The special effects are so linked into the storyline that one tends to stop taking notice of just how remarkable they are.If there is a shortcoming to the movie, it is that it attempts to achieve two purposes in a relatively short space of time--it must introduce us to these characters in their very unfamiliar world and it must tell the tale of the sorcerer's stone. This ambitious undertaking keeps things moving pretty quickly, and require plot resolution a bit more quickly than one might like.Nonetheless, this movie leaves you anxiously awaiting the sequel. The DVD provides lots of interesting ancillary materials and curiosities.	5.0	Fun Fantasy!	2002-06-10	2	2	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AL4JFZWR1BINZ	Steven Z	"This is a review of the Blu-ray set, not the movie. The movie is fantastic on every level, and I think most people know that.What's included:-Blu-ray Version (with bonus features)-DVD version-Digital Copy CodeBluray: 4 StarsThe Blu-ray disc included is the same as the first Blu-ray release of the film. The picture quality is good but not fantastic. Out of all the Harry Potter Blu-rays this one looks the worst (but that's understandable considering its age). Some less than impressive CGI effects become more apparent due to the picture upgrade. The sound quality is fantastic all around when played on my home theater system. All in all the picture and sound are MUCH better than the DVD version for sure and are worth the price.Extras: 2 1/2 StarsThe bonus features is where this edition falls flat and really shows that it's not for hardcore fans. Most of the features are just clips extrapolated from the movie and not really anything new. Also worth mentioning is the lackluster menu which is just a screenshot from the movie with the selections completely covering it.The list below will describe all of the extras...+ Additional Scenes - You get 7 deleted scenes. Good extra, we appreciate it.+ Capturing the Stone - A 15 or so minute feature of the director and producer explaining the process of bringing the novel to the big screen. Best of the so called ""features"", quite interesting.+ Around the World Multilanguage Clip - Basically a scene that you can play in several different languages, kinda pointless.+ Ghosts of Hogwarts - A brief clip of the ghosts in the movie with a narrator introducing each of them. Again, pointless.+ Yearbook Character Clips - This feature takes you to a menu that lets you pick from several different characters, once you select one you see a montage of clips from the movie showing their personality. If you watched the movie once, this isn't worth looking at.+ Lessons in Quidditch - The clip from the movie where Wood explains Quidditch to Harry with some scenes from the Quidditch match. Useless.+ What It Takes to Hatch a Dragon Egg - The clip where Hagrid's dragon hatches with a narrator explaining how it works. Slightly interesting, but still USELESS.+ Theatrical and Teaser Trailers - Do I need to explain this?DVD: 4 1/2 StarsThere's not much to say here. It's the DVD version, it gets the job done. It somehow manages to have a better menu than the Blu-ray version too. No extras except Cast & Crew Bios and Trailers.Digital Copy: 4 1/2 StarsAgain, not a lot to say. You download a program from the link they give you and enter your code to download the movie. The program is a little hard to install sometimes but usually works fine. You can pick either a Windows Media Player or iTunes digital copy to download, which is nice. The quality of the digital copy is decent, about the same as the DVD version.Packaging: 4 1/2 StarsThe new cover artwork is a nice touch for this series of Blu-ray Combo Packs. I do wish they had slip cases for these releases but it's not a big deal.Overall: 4 Stars ****Like I said this is more for the casual fan who wants to be able to watch the movie almost anywhere. Hardcore fans I'd suggest looking at the Ultimate edition. If you are interested in this edition I'd suggest getting it at Target rather than Amazon if you want a better deal."	4.0	For Casual Fans	2012-07-29	2	2	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1NMPAFS7FJPJ4	Stratago Havenlocke	"For starters, this box set has the proper title of ""Philosopher's Stone"", rather than the US title of 'Sorcerer's Stone' (I believe this is a Canadian release) and in the extended version of the film, via ADR or an alternate take, I don't really know, every time the Stone is talked about, it's called the Philosopher's Stone by whoever is speaking. In addition to the other features of this set, this is like the icing on the cake for a detail-obsessed HP nerd like me.Since everyone in the known universe has probably seen this movie, I won't go into the film all that much, beyond saying that the deleted scenes have been re-integrated into the movie much like the extended cuts of the LotR films, most of them to good effect; the scene with Neville leg-locked creates something of a redundancy with the kid's discovering Nicholas Flamel's identity on Dumbledore's Wizard Card and then again in the library, but it's forgivable.In any case, this is my preferred version of the film, and I think any true HP fan will agree."	5.0	"""Philosopher's Stone"" = win, in my book"	2012-09-14	2	2	0

Those, frankly, are the only reason I bought the CD, and it is extremely irksome to me (who stayed up til 1:45 a.m. working last night) that I can't simply view the scenes I bought and thought I had immediate access to.  There should be a work-around for the many adult fans who actually have busy lives.  This isn't a Sesame Street movie aimed only at toddlers, and I think the producers ought to have taken the sophistication of its audience into account in designing the special features of the CD.

I found this movie so entertaining and enjoyable (gotta love Draco and Oliver Wood). But the DVD is a bit disappointing. It is meant to be for kids ONLY.What I have been waiting in the DVD the most are interviews with the cast especially since Malaysia aired an interview once. And one more thing is ""Behind the Scene"" that should let you see the making of the movie and how the special effect was done. Additional outakes and extra deleted scene would be great. But no, they had to make all the stuff for kids apart from the 7 deleted scenes. I mean come on! I caught the snitch in less than 2 seconds, and solved the puzzle in less than 5 minutes to get to the deleted scenes.There's also no commentary from the director, or the cast or from J.K Rowling, or any message from J.K Rowling.I want to suggest that the second movie ""Chamber of Secrets""' DVD, there should be more stuff for adults than for kids. Or better yet, make 2 seperate DVD for kids and adults so kids can have some interactive entertainment and adults could have all the interviews and stuff. Otherwise, the movie itself is awesome :-)!

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3JKP7MGHVLREK	Tessie	I have been an absolute die-hard Harry Potter fan from the beginning. I read the first two books before they were even popular, and have since read all four of them a dozen times each. Not exagerrating. So you can imagine how psyched I was when I heard about the movie.I watched every trailer a million times. I was on the internet 24/7 searching for news. And I got my movie tickets five days in advance. I was there at the theatres on Nov. 16, and waited two hours for the film to start.It was great. I loved it. But there were some things that really ticked me off. First, a lot of time was spent on things that didn't need dwelling on...a lot of stupid lines and jokes were added, like Ron getting hit in the face with his broomstick, or Seamus' constant explosions. These aren't true to the humor in the book, and it took time away from things that should have been there. We also needed a lot more character development. I would sit in the theatre for 4 hours to watch that movie, as long as they made it good.Now for the actors. Daniel Radcliffe, though he's an absolute sweetie, was not perfect. He looks the part, but he was a bit weak througout the movie. He was REALLY good in the emotional scenes, though, and I think that makes up for it. Harry really is sort of an impossible role, as most of the book takes place in his head. Ron was perfect, i thought. I didn't quite agree with the way he looked, but the acting was altogether perfect. Hermione....well, I don't like Emma Watson at all, I think she seems like a little snot, so I might be biased. But I thought she really overplayed Hermione. Hermione should be kind hearted, self conscious, very intelligent, and a little bit bossy. Watson added a certain self confidence that Hermione doesn't have, made her an absolute know-it-all, and we didn't see much of the warmth that resides deep in Hermione's character.Albus Dumbledore...one of my favorite characters from the books. Hilarious, a bit crazy, wise, gentle, understanding...Richard Harris was none of these thngs. He was just an old man with a long white beard and glasses. All his funny lines were cut, except for the earwax one, of course. He was just far too stiff and strict and....ugh, horrible. Then again, I also hate Richard Harris, so....Well, at least Hagrid was perfect. Absolutely perfect in every way, shape, and form.The special effects oculd use a lot of work. Quidditch and the chess scene were excellent, but the centaur, the troll, the flying lesson with Neville...all horrible. Get some new CG animation guys, because that's just not gonna cut it. If Aragog and Dobby look like that, I might just puke....CoS is my favorite book.Don't think the movie's horrible, because it's not. I've just pointed out everything bad. It's actually quite wonderful and amazing...I love the costumes and sets. If it was good enough for me to go see 4 times, it can't be all that bad. Just my two cents, anyway...	4.0	Great....but disappointing in many ways to a die-hard fan...	2002-05-05	1	1	0

I had read the books, and became an immediate fanatic... I was one of the people that piled into theatres the first day that it came out on the big screen.Let me start with the good things:1. I loved the sets. Hogwarts was great (love castles) and Diagon Alley's shops looked so interesting that I wanted to pop into one.2. Maggie Smtih (Professor McGonagal) was magnificent. When I had read the books, I pictured the professor to be rather large and frequently huff and puff down the hallways, but Smith's take on it was great. Completely bashed the other idea out of the water.3. Alan Rickman was great as Snape. Perfect voice- and I loved the contrast of the black hair and clothes against the dead white skin. Scared the heck out of me.4. The music to this movie was awesome. Seriously awesome. When the movie started with the theme music, I was on the edge of my seat...And it all went downhill from there.Like I said, there are a few bits of great acting, but the rest of the time...Harry Potter, for instance. Daniel Radcliffe looks like him- REALLY looks like him. That's the good part. But he NEVER shows any sort of emotion, and that's what got me. He never made me believe that he was really Harry Potter.Ron Weasley... Rupert Grint looked like him, and he was even funny sometimes. He didn't really get a lot of times in the spotlight, though, so you never really noticed that he was there.Hermione Granger was one of the biggest let-downs of them all. She was my favorite character in the books, because, even though she was sort of a scholarly snob, you eventually liked her even with her faults. Emma Watson played the character as snobby in the beginning at least KIND of well, and then when she, Harry, and Ron became friends, that entire side of her personality went away and she ceased being smart and ended up being one of the sidekicks.And what about the special effects? Fluffy looked fake... and so did Quidditch. I don't know if there's a way that you COULD make a three-headed dog or people flying around on broomsticks look real, but I think that they could have done a LOT better.All in all, I loved the sets. Loved the costumes... and a few of the actors were okay. But overall, the movie was a disappointment.	2.0	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone	2004-07-26	7	5	2

I just happen to be one of the twelve people in the USA who hasn't seen this fable, and I finally decided to give it a try.  The premise and story are both interesting: Daniel Radcliffe is impressive as Harry Potter, a 11-year-old kid who is raised by his cruel relatives before he is shipped to school to become a wizard and befriends a couple of classmates who help him during a series of adventures.  At 2.5 hours, the movie passed along nicely, but ultimately suffered from an overall blandness that sank the movie.  I fault director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, who apparently followed the book so closely so as not to include any surprises or any degree of spontaneity.  On a technical level, I wasn't all that blown away.  The scenes where the kids fly on the broomsticks were kind of blah, although the scenes with that three headed dog were impressive, if slightly reminiscent of &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;  All in all, I was slightly entertained but also disappointed.  A film of this magnitude is supposed to give the casual viewer a reason why the Harry Potter novels are such a staple in pop culture.  As it is, this film is a serviceable kiddie flick that may please its built-in audience but will be hard-pressed to entice those who aren't all familiar with the novels.	3.0	The Trouble with &quot;Harry.&quot;	2002-06-29	10	4	6

Luckily the movie jumped right into the plot, they didn't spend too much time on the his life with the Dursley's and touched on the more important scenes. The casting was done well, each of the kids were able to grasp and portray the personalities we've all read in the books, as well as the Hogwarts professors.Reading all of the books before even watching the first movie didn't take away from the excitement of watching Sorcerer's Stone.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ACM5343OCU6CN	"""themiskatz"""	OK, so the story goes like this:There is this boy, who is an orphan, his parents were both killed by the dark one. He lives with his uncle and aunt. He hides a power within him, that he is unaware, of but he feels that he is made for greater things. His uncle and aunt know about it, and if not acting against it, they keep quiet about it.Then one day, a strange messenger appears starting a series of events that eventually lead the boy away from his foster home, have him join a bearded wizard/mentor that teaches him all about his power, he begins a friendship with another boy and a girl, and all three of them, with the wizard's advice, take off for a series of mind-blowing adventures that ultimately lead to the destruction of the dark one, the killer of the boy's parents.The Question. What is the boy's name?If you answered Harry Potter, you're soooo wrong!The boy's name is LUKE SKYWALKER. The wizard is Obi-Wan Kenobi. The friends are Han (Not Ron) and Leia.It as apparently the most outrageous theft of an original idea that has ever happened in the movie business. Outrageous because it had such a wide acceptance by the audience and no one to see right through it.Technology had already advanced tremendously since star wars so the effects job gave &quot;Harry Potter&quot; a more exotic look. But!! not being able to come up with an original idea, they borrowed from a newer Star Wars some elements. the silly broomstick/basketball game is clearly an altered Pod Racing, and is used in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; almost at the same point in the duration of the movie as pod racing in &quot;Episode I&quot;My problem is mrs. Rowling, who obviously, when had this &quot;amazing idea that eventually changed her life&quot;, was watching Star Wars: A New Hope, on video...Do yourselves a favor. When in the dillema &quot;Magic or Force?&quot;, choose the Force.Go see STAR WARS instead. Such a better movie.To be continued...

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	APRZ2IVM8JTLV	The Mysterious Traveler	HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERORS STONE(2001) Directed by Chris Columbus. Starring Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Fiona Shaw, John Cleese, Ian Hart, John Hurt and Richard Harris.The first in the series details the early childhood of Harry---son of a pair of powerful wizards named Potter who were murdered by a black wizard named Voldemort, the discovery of his magical heritage and his first year at Hogwarts--a magicians school rather like Eton and Cambridge except with monsters and ghosts. Besides the usual teenage angst, there are mysterious goings on at Hogwarts that conspire against Harry and his friends as the dread Voldemort seeks to gain the Sorcerors Stone which would allow him to remanifest himself and gain immortality.While some of the plot points could have been better explicated, this turned out to be a highly entertaining fantasy of much whimsey, imagination and not a little terror. The direction is solid. There is CGI in abundance but that is the world we live in so there is little point kvetching anymore. One enjoyed the giant three headed dog Fluffy and the Voldemort specter was chilling. The centaur and giant troll were less succesful but whatever. The film allows many of Great Britains finest actors to get away from Shakespeare and Merchant Ivory films and actually have and be fun again. While Cleese is pretty much a glorified cameo, everyone else from Harris to Smith are very welcome and pleasing---thougth Rickman takes the honors as a sinister Professor of spells and potions.While one is not sure one loved the film, one was thoroughly entertained.	3.0	Entertaining	2013-11-13	1	1	0

The sequels are superior in both acting and directing.Becuase this movie is derived from a book, I'm not going to write a summary but instead focus on the caliber of the film-making.Chris Columbus did a very good job on the first Harry Potter. The storyline is rather basic, though, becuase of the need to introduce all the characters. Cinematography is decient (it's no ""2001"" or ""The Matrix"" but, you get what I mean). In acting, we have many famous English actors joining the trio of then-newbies. The now-deceased Richard Harris (Resquiescant in Pace) does a fabulous job as the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Other famous actors and actresses include: Maggie Smith, Robbie Cultrane, and Alan Rickman (his role as Serverus Snape is underused for his talent at being villainous, like in Die Hard)Overall, good for the family (except the fight scene which is a little grim for a children's movie) and quite entertaining.

Nonetheless, when I finally saw this movie on cable the other day, I tried to be unbiased.  As I watched I was struck not by how bad this movie is, because it was not awful, but by just how mediocre it is.  It looks splendid, the goblins' makeup in particular.  Some of the computerized shots suffer from Lucas Syndrome, but it takes CGI technology just about as far as it can go nowadays.  Yet film is more than just a visual art, it's also about telling an interesting story involving real and compelling characters.  This film lacks both of those key ingredients.  The actors work well with what they have (I will not slander any cast that includes John Hurt and Alan Rickman), but an actor is only as good as is material (perhaps that's stretching it a bit, but I think you get my meaning).  The filmmakers drag out every rusty old cliche you can imagine, dust it off, slap the name ""Harry Potter"" on it, and present it here as a brand new product to be consumed and almost immediately forgotten.  Character development is nil, for example, it's rather hard to understand what motivates the evil Professor Quirrel to turn against his colleagues in the end.  Has he been masquerading all along as a good wizard when he in reality turnd to the ""dark side"" long ago?  Or has he switched allegiances because he's generally looked down upon for being a sniveling twit and seeks revenge?  Or is it something else entirely?  Perhaps I missed it, but I cannot recall this ever being properly explained.  Or what about when the children are punished for breaking a rule by being instructed to break ANOTHER rule by going out into a forbidden forested area, two of them unchaperoned even, and risking their lives?  Is that supposed to make sense?  The entire film is weakened by non-sensical plot twists and unbelievable characters, but even this is not the weakest point of the film.  The fact is, it's a bore.  Another long, predictable piece of eye-candy that is, rightly enough, meant for children.  Even so, there is no reason children's entertainment has to be this... mediocre.  The films I loved as a child didn't suffer these same problems.  Nowadays though, you get film after film after film of material of this caliber.  And it's evident in modern literature and pop music as well.  But now I'm just ranting.  Final thought: for family-oriented entertainment of a far superior quality, check out the first two Star Wars films (that is, Episodes IV and V), Raiders of the Lost Ark, How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the animated version), The Nightmare Before Christmas, Something Wicked This Way Comes, PeeWee's Big Adventure, Harvey, A Christmas Story, or The Bishop's Wife (1948) to name a few."	2.0	a testament to mediocrity	2002-11-25	7	3	4
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A3S308AYEEVWTC	Thomas Burka	Truly a bad movie, made all the more disappointing for the clunky, unimaginative way it tackles its subject: one of the most delightful and imaginative creations to come around in a long time.  The sets uniformly resemble prebuilt facades at Disney World, and the pacing and direction are plodding and second-rate.  Nowhere in this movie do you find yourself lifted out of your seat and truly engaged; one is always aware that they are watching the ponderous and effortful attempt to recreate the book.  The movie has no magic of its own.  One example is the wonderful secene from the book where the Sorting hat picks Harry for Gryffindor; in the book this scene is enthralling; in the movie, it has no zing.  The spectacle of the hat with an animated mouth is silly, and actually detracts from the notion that the battered old hat has hidden, mystical powers which Harry can only sense (and who's voice he can only hear) when he slips it on and is plunged into the inner dark world of the Hat.  (The hat in the book has no mouth.)  There were a million different interesting and creative ways of depicting this scene cinematically and Mr. Columbus, the director, has exhibited the anti-genius to find one of the more drab approaches to it.  (if only Terry Gilliam had been picked to direct the movie; he was in the running; but then the film might not yet be finished . . . .) The kids' acting is good, particularly those of the kids playing Ron and Hermione, although there are times when you're only too aware of the mimitations of the young cast.  The adults are fine, with the best performances coming from Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane as Professor Snape and Hagrid, respectively, but they're not around enough.My 7 year old son, who loved the books and claimed to LOVE the movie, was squiriming in his seat by the end of this overly-long movie; and now that we own it, he never watches it at all.Read the book instead.	1.0	Lifeless Adaption of Spectacular Book	2003-01-11	12	4	8
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A8NB711TPAGFB	"Thomas Farrell ""irish02144"""	I absolutely adore both the book and movie versions of this story, and Disc 1 of this boxed-set is 100% as good as it should be: it's an absolutely lavish transfer of the film, with rich vivid color, crisp picture, and excellent sound. Indeed, I think I had a better viewing experience with the DVD than in the really rather nice theater I saw the film in.That said, Disc 2 was a MAJOR disappointment. Much of the content is just rehashed material from the film itself, and the interface is supremely irritating. Indeed, while first looking at it with two friends who are also great fans of the books and film, mere minutes of being assaulted by this lousy interface had everyone complaining loudly. There is no actual menu, and no direct way to access any of the supplementary material. To get to anything, you have to navigate through a series of screens relating to the story, and since nothing is labeled as to what it actually contains, you have to poke around endlessly to find anything interesting.Also, there isn't a lot of interesting supplementary content for an adult audience. Most of it is geared toward children. While this is a children's story, it actually has more adult fans, and the content should have much better accounted for all ages.Finally, the packaging of the set is horrible, flimsy cardboard. I would expect the outer box to last two seconds flat in the hands of children... and I don't expect it to last a terribly long time in the hands of adults.In conclusion, this is a superb movie superbly transferred to DVD, packaged in a really lousy boxed set that I think you'll be very disappointed with if you want anything at all more than the movie itself.	2.0	Superb movie, Vile extras.	2002-05-25	2	1	1

I don't really think it matters how good the book or the movie are, people are just so afraid to say they enjoyed any movie more.  Well, I enjoyed this movie more than the book.  This is probably because I saw the movie first, which means that when I think on all those feelings of excitement and worry, I remember the movie.For the purists, who love to pick apart any difference between the movie and the book (and judge the movie's version to be worse, regardless of whether it is), there are plenty of little changes to keep them occupied (and give them hours upon hours whiney conversation topics).  But, for those of you who love a great story, you will not be disappointed.This is an excellent movie with all the important moments from the book nicely bound in to a 2+ hour movie.  It is so well done that if you see it before you read the book, you may like it more, too.Don't bother renting, it's just wasting 3 bucks (You'll end up buying it anyway)."	5.0	A Movie better than the Book?	2002-07-21	2	1	1

Audiowise it sounded good on my system. The score by John Williams sounds especially good.My one real complaint with this DVD is the special features. I bought this in order to see the deleted scenes. The amount of time I spent trying to access them outweighed the actual running time of the scene. Way too much trouble for nothing groundbreaking. I also would have liked to have a commentary track from the director and maybe some of the stars.Overall this is a good DVD set, but the amount of work to access the special features is very annoying.	4.0	Good movie, decent DVD	2002-11-06	0	0	0

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	I love dark movies, or those with a dark tone to them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a PG movie that manages to deliver dark elements throughout while not compromising its rating. The result is a balanced film that reaches deep into the senses and psyche. The whole school of wizardry thing really captivates, and the story is best told through the deep British accents that were used. If I have one criticism of this film, it would be the length. At over two and a half hours, it's a tad lengthy, especially when there's some overindulgence in the length of some scenes. A two hour movie probably would've been better, though I'm not complaining too much. This film sets the stage for the rest of the series; it's a series that has at least one movie that's sure to appeal to someone. A good opening act that I recommend.	4.0	A Somewhat Dark Family Film	2013-02-09	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A17Y6PHLBMQOF6	Todd C. Spears	Since I figure that everyone has already seen Harry Potter and formed their own opinions, I'm writing this review primarily on the DVD and the much touted extras.  The movie itself is wonderful - but the DVD set leaves a little to be desired.  The first DVD in the set is great.  They did a first rate job on the transfer and the sound.  The second DVD with all the extras though is lacking a certain something.The extras disc has just enough to make you want more but doesn't have some of the very things that we all heard about during all the publicity about the film.  I remember hearing over and over that the first cut of the film came in at over 3 1/2 hours.  Then on the disc there are only a few deleted scenes totally under 10 minutes.  They had the obligatory making of but that too seemed more than a bit short.  Another frustrating thing was navigating the extras - it was close to impossible.  It took me over ten minutes to work through the little game system to even access the deleted scenes(though I later discovered there was a very small place to click for direct access).  This just wasn't fun.  I don't enjoy being made to jump through hoops to watch a film and see the various extras packaged in.  Maybe they should release one version for adults who don't like the games and another for children who enjoy things like that.Overall I love the film but I have this feeling that they are holding back to release another set sometime.  It would be nice to just be able to purchase the film without having to wonder about another release coming out in a year.	3.0	Wonderful film... questionable extras....	2002-11-06	5	3	2

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	I've never been the kind of person that buys into hype and to be honest, I hate most big budget films, So until this weekend, I've avoided everything Harry Potter. That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series. Harry Potter is a huge budget franchise, but for once, a blockbuster film does live up to the hype, and earns the title of a must see movie!	5.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078	2013-04-21	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2YKADCJME4FSW	Tom Birkenstock	"Film adaptations must strike a tricky balance between dual demands: fidelity to the source material and obligations of the new medium.  If you steer too far from the core ideas of the original story, then you betray those who loved the story long before it was green lit by a studio.  But if you chain your film to the source material, then the end product might end up being a rote matter of connecting plot points.  Sometimes those who love the original book or story tend to think that all a director needs to do is paste pages up on the big screen, but this ignores that different mediums, by necessity, must tell a story in different ways.  Long exposition might be effective in a novel, but ideally a film communicates more concisely through visuals.  In fact, one of my favorite adaptations, Blade Runner, not only departs wildly from the original book, but also seems to be arguing against it.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first film in a very long series of adaptations, never manages to strike an appropriate balance between the book and its new home in cinemas.  From the beginning it becomes clear that this film is not for the uninitiated.  It starts with several wizards arriving at an English suburb to drop off a young baby.  We don't know who these people are or why they need to drop off this youngster off at someone's front door.  The scene has a nice ambience to it and leaves enough questions to drive the film forward, but for someone who has not read the book, the question of the relationship between the baby in the basket and the family he is being left with becomes somewhat troubling.  There is a long tradition in books and films of random babies being dropped off at someone's door, so we cannot assume there is some relationship between the baby and those he is left with.  It turns out they are his aunt and his uncle, but we don't discover this until almost a half-hour into the film, shortly before Harry leaves for Hogwarts.  This is a minor problem but it is indicative of an inability for the film to break from the novels and establish itself as a piece of art that can stand on its own two feet.We may not know who this family is, but it becomes clear early on that they are not the ideal family for an orphan.  They force Harry to live in a small closet under the stairs, and they clearly favor their biological son over the one left on their doorstep.  Not only is Harry's cousin spoiled beyond what is appropriate for a young child, but he also appears to be well on his way to contracting type-2 diabetes.  Luckily, when Harry reaches an appropriate age, he is recruited into Hogwarts, a school for young wizards.  This is something his aunt and uncle apparently dread, going so far as to move to the middle of nowhere to avoid the onslaught of acceptance letters from Hogwart's.  But this is to no avail, and Harry is recruited by Hagrid, a friendly, if slightly bumbling wizard, who has a difficult time keeping secrets when the plot requires a little more information in order to move forward.  Soon Harry learns that both his parents were wizards, but that they were murdered when he was very young, requiring the cadre of wizards from the beginning to deposit Harry at his aunt's and uncle's.Anyone who has read Joseph Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces, or at least has seen Star Wars, can recognize the hero's journey in this setup.  The hero's journey is when a seemingly provincial protagonist is plucked from the mundane world in order to cross over into the world of magic and adventure.  Normally there is a guide who accompanies the hero as he traverses his way from the mundane to the magical.  In Star Wars this guide was Ben Kenobi, and here it's Hagrid.  The appeal of this setup is instantly recognizable.  Even if you were from the most well adjusted family, every child has felt persecuted by the seemingly arbitrary rules of adults.  And who hasn't felt as a child that you weren't destined for some grand adventure in your lifetime?Along the way to Hogwarts, Harry encounters the sociable Ron and the slightly uptight A-student Hermione.  Upon arriving to Hogwarts, all three wind up in the Griffindor House, which means they will be competing against students from other houses for top prize at the end of the year.  Hogwarts certainly owes more than a little something to the British private school system, and I would imagine a similar system of competition could feasibly exist in the childhood of many British subjects.  Even the villainous student Draco, of the Slytherin House, has a haughty air of aristocracy straight out of George Orwell's memoir ""Such, Such Were the Joys.""  (I'm giving little away when I tell you that Griffindor House wins the prize at the end of the year, but not before the headmaster, Dumbledor, lets Slytherin House think they have won.  This was a rather cruel move on Dumbledor's part and I half expected him to say ""psych"" before revealing that Griffindor won).In addition to midterms, social cliques and getting to class on time, Harry and the gang must also worry about a mysterious object that is being housed within the deep recesses of Hogwarts.  They learn that this magical object has the ability to free the villainous Voldemort (much like Dickens, Rowling likes to twist names so her audience is absolutely certain who is good and who is bad).  The students are up against a teacher, Severus Snape, who they believe is planning on stealing the object in order to smuggle it to Voldemort.There's much to enjoy about this first installment in the Harry Potter franchise, not the least of which is the filmmaker's intention of employing just about every great British actor imaginable (in addition to Robbie Coltrane and Hagrid, there's Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Cleese and John Hurt).  While the child actors aren't always on the same level as their elders, within the spectrum of child acting from bad (Anakin from Phantom Menace) to good (Elliot from E.T.) they're firmly within the middle.  Of the three main characters, however, it's Hermione who gets the most thankless role.  She's the student at the front of the class with her hand constantly in the air.  It's much easier to role your eyes at the A-student than to empathize.But the real appeal of a film like this is being able to see the world of J.K. Rowling on film.  Since I've never read the book, I can only compare this fantasy world to others.  Rowling deftly cobbles together time honored fantasy creatures and concepts, but assembles them in such a way that they manage to be both familiar and new.  The film paints Hogwarts as an ancient castle, but imbues it with a sense of kinetic energy.  It is a place where ghosts roam the halls as leisurely as students, where paintings come to life and where staircases never stay in the same place twiece.  Hogwarts, like an M.C. Escher drawing, appears to contain more space within its confines than is physically possible.  Rowling has also created a fun, if slightly confusing, game called Quidditch, which is similar to rugby but on flying broomsticks.Unfortunately, what really holds the film back is the direction.  At two and a half hours Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lengthy film, which by itself isn't a problem.  I've seen enough David Lean films to enjoy immersing myself in a story.  And besides, part of the fun of a fantasy film is watching the filmmakers construct an entirely new world brick by brick.  The length wouldn't be a problem if the director was better skilled at creating atmosphere and urgency.  The director is Chris Columbus who showed promise in the 80s by directing films like Adventures in Babysitting and writing Goonies and Gremlins.  But since then he has become a third rate Spielberg with a higher tolerance for sentimentality.  Columbus draws his character with big bright crayons so no one can forget for one second who we are supposed to root against.  Harry's uncle is grossly obese, Draco's hair is slicked back like Gordon Geco from Wall Street, and even an opposing Quidditch player is given a mouthful of ungainly teeth.It's Columbus's cumbersome direction, which stumbles from one scene in the book to another, that ultimately stifles the film.  Instead of bringing the underlining mystery to the forefront of the movie, we are left to sightsee in Rowlings world, which isn't an entirely unpleasant experience, throughout most of the movie.  This first installment in the Harry Potter series likely offers more for fans of the book to enjoy than for the uninitiated who wish for nothing more than a new fantasy classic."	3.0	Loyal to the book, but not to newcomers	2010-09-06	3	1	2
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A38QJ7JUUTVLKX	"Tom Servo ""Robot"""	Didn't like the book, didn't like the movie. Here's an event movie that holds up to being an event. This filmed version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, adapted from the wildly popular book by J.K. Rowling, stunningly brings to life Harry Potter's world of Hogwarts, the school for young witches and wizards. The greatest strength of the film comes from its faithfulness to the novel, and this new cinematic world is filled with all the details of Rowling's imagination, thanks to exuberant sets, elaborate costumes, clever makeup and visual effects, and a cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me cast, including Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and more. Especially fine is the interplay between Harry and his schoolmates Ron and Hermione, as well as his protector, the looming Hagrid ). The second-half adventure--involving the titular sorcerer's stone--doesn't translate perfectly from page to screen, ultimately because of the film's fidelity to the novel; this is a case of making a movie for the book's fans, as opposed to a transcending film. All in all it's your typical kid flick. If you want a great fantasy film, I'd strongly suggest Lord of the Rings.	2.0	Ehhh....OVERATED!	2003-07-29	38	7	31

I thought id see it to see what all the hype was about and I guess I was indifferent. It didn't blow my socks off. The effects were good. My favorite part was when they played chess against the human sized pieces. I can't help to compare it to the Lord of the Rings which was a superb movie and even better book. I find that more interesting because it is darker in nature and magic seems to be used as a means to an end not just to have for the matter of having it like it seemed to be in Potter. I Have to compare the 2 because; A) they came out very close to each other. B) Tolkien basically took fantasy to a new level and every thing after it is just trying to come close to matching it.I liked it but it did npt leave me thirsting for the sequel unlike a few other movies I saw in the past year.	3.0	Good but not great.	2002-07-29	1	0	1

There are a few slight differences though, but in general it was a great movie with flawless computer graphics and special effects.The only problem i had was that the movie was based in a place with english accents, and some word choice that might not be heard in the USA threw me off.  Such as when Mr Dursely called the mail service &quot;post&quot;, whereas in the USA we call it &quot;mail&quot;.  None the less, still very easy to follow, and they really did a great job with the Twist ending.Note: This movie is for kids and adults alike.~hope this helps	5.0	A great movie from a great book.	2002-11-19	8	5	3

I don't want to see a movie that long.  I also don't want to see three movies that cover the first book.  This movie was catered to HP fans.  I went to see the movie with two people who never read any HP stuff.  I enjoyed it more than they did.  I know that the reason I liked it better is the fact that I was familiar with HP's world.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	Harry Potter is a phenomenon around the world. That is for sure. The motion picture of the first book of the series is a very promising attempt of the story, attending every bit of the details. However, for the book lovers, they might feel less satisfied in a way that not all the materials included in the book were shown. This could be understood in a way that a featured film for mostly kids can't be too long or it would lose the concentration of the audience. Nonetheless, for people who really love the book, this might not be as good as expected. On the technical side, the Quidditch match is well filmed and presented, but for other parts of the movie, like the ogre attack and Fluffy, the level of effects is not as promising. It was said that in the next movie, ILM will be responsible for the special effects, hopefully it would be better. For the actors playing the main characters, they are still very green, although Hermione did a very good job in being a very difficult girl. More development could be given to the actors, but since this is the first Harry Potter movie, it is assumed that they would become better and better in the up coming ones. Overall speaking, this movie is a good pass time for all.	4.0	A good attempt of the book	2002-05-07	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	The following behind J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter is tremendous. However, just because a popular and world-famous book is turned into a movie, doesn't mean that the movie will be a success. Nor does it mean the movie will be any good. Often, movies based upon novels are terrible (look at the many bad movies based upon Stephen King stories, for instance). Sometimes, a movie based upon a novel ends up better than the original work (FIELD OF DREAMS or JURASSIC PARK for instance). However, it is a very rare case when a movie based upon a novel succeeds as a piece of cinema and stays true to the original work. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is such a film. The film stays true to the novel on which is based and leaves very few details out. It also works quite well as a movie. Even more surprising is that the film successfully introduces the world of Harry Potter to the uninitiated without becoming bogged down in details. The actors do a brilliant job, the special effects are fairly believable, and the cinematography is picturesque. The only major drawback to the film is that the characters aren't completely fleshed out. Of course, complexity of character perhaps is best left out of the first of what will be many films in a series. A delightful film that most are sure to at least half-way enjoy.	5.0	Faithful Adaptation of the Novel	2012-06-04	0	0	0

I'm 30 and I was captivated. It ranks with Wizard of Oz, E.T. and Star Wars, even Miracle on 34th St.. As a matter of fact a comparison for those who are worried that it maybe too intense for kids would be the Wicked Witch of the West. Really a solid film for all ages. But getting to the deleted scenes while cute at first, by making you go through a series of puzzles in order to get to them, can get downright annoying if you want to get to it quick. Example: Thanksgiving day our family was watching and wanted to see the deleted scenes. 15 minutes later, five adults over 25 were still trying to figure it out! It's funny now, but just be warned. Also a note for collectors and film buffs: The rest of the features on the DVD, save for a featurette, is geared for kids. Virtual tours, sorting hat etc.. It's safe fun and, in my humble opinion, I'm sure a 9 year old suffering from a few goosebumps will be able to breeze through the puzzles in record time. So parents rest easy.

Why? It's quite simple, really. The key word is escapism. Children would love to be Harry Potter, sent away from their parents at an early age and then rescued by a giant and flown on a motorbike to a castle that teaches children to be the world's best witches and wizards. Unfortunately, however much of a classic these works of fiction are, every child is disappointed at the end of the day. But hey! Fiction is fiction, and it should stay like that. Harry Potter's parents were killed by Voldemort, an evil satanic wizard, and he is left to live in a cupboard with his bullyish cousins, the Dursleys. However, Hagrid rescues him well and takes him to the place of his dreams: Hogwarts School. Fighting through the toughest adventures possible, with an added touch of friendship and future romanticism, such a film entertains, and yet brings positive emotions to the viewer. Beautiful music by John Williams accompanies; and what's more, special effects are carefully used to really bring the viewer into the film himself. A brilliant, high budget movie, suitable for any ages, and certainly resemblant of the books themselves, this movie must be awarded five stars.

Harry Potter the story of boy who finds out he is a big part of a hidden world of magic, spells, and mythical creatures, now must join it only to discover he is being hunted by the one who murdered his family.I was already a huge fan of the books, so when the movie was set to be released in 2001 I was very excited and curious to see how it would turn out. I enjoyed the movie, unlike many who said it was long and sometimes boring. Read the tagline people...'Let The Magic Begin'. Hello we still have 6 more parts to this story!

Introduce the main characters show us their part and of course just throw a tiny bit of foreshadowing of what is yet to come.This movie is truly enjoyable for anyone who wants to get away from the real world. The characters are great as well as the actors who play them. I was also amazed at how Chris Columbus tried as best as he could to keep this first movie as close to the book as possible. Yes there were some things taken away and a few others changed for the sake of cinema, but for the first part of this grand story when the movie was over the only thought going through my head was...

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1AHKWQHU3YDMC	Urs Schmid	BOY was I surprised! Really surprised about that bad movie I'd just seen while leaving the theatre. Most people who have seen the movie know the Potter-universe as good as their pant pockets. Not me, but I really like kiddy-movies, it's always very entertaining and the kids mostly show up with enormous lust and fun for acting. Not little Harry. He's just REALLY terrible and it takes a lot for me to place such statement. His 3-hour-lasting-smile completly spoils his character, his look on the face doesn't change a bit - or if, then a little cute bit. He's been trapped in his tiny room for his whole so-far-childhood and is being &quot;released&quot; by his unimaginable destiny. There are two extreme situations but Harry (re)acts like he's just luckily found 5 Cents...Storytelling is extremly inpatient, journeys between real and Magic-world are unspectacular and some scenes are just ridiculous, like the final chess-battle, where the other kid is riding the horse and acting as if the end of the world depends on him. Hey, you're just sitting on a chess horse probably made of wood you could jump off (or did somebody paste you on it?). The ideas are brilliant, the whole university-stuff is undoubtly very cool. Nevertheless: the things that happen in that environment are being prepared somehow &quot;carelessly&quot;.I think the movie is more attractive to the people who've also read he book and some of them confess that the story is really difficult to follow the way it's being told in the movie. I had my troubles following the much-too-fast-paced storytelling.

And I can say it really follows the book pretty well.I love the books, they're pure magic. They stir up excitement in my inner child- something that really takes something special to do.And the film is wonderful-- It's exellently cast, just as I imagined the characters, and better! The cinematography is lush, the special effects are exciting, the script is fantastic and funny. And the sets are amazing.The young actors are really good- very believable and so cute. I really enjoyed their preformances, especially Daniel Radcliffe.Emma Watson was great as the perfectionist (slightly know-it-all) Hermione, Tom Felton is really funny as Draco Malfoy, the snob(with greased back hair) who's attracted to the dark arts. And Rupert Grint as Ron is the best support, he's wonderful. :-) But all the children are great.I also enjoyed Alan Rickman (as the mysterious Snape) Maggie Smith (who always delivers a wonderful preformance!) Robbie Coltrane (who is marvelous & hilarious as Hagrid) and Ian Hart. I'm also glad the cast were British. Since the story takes place there, to hear the real accents, rather than bad fakes, was (maybe trivial) but a nice touch anyway.And I adore the story.The people who protest these books, are out of their skulls! Harry Potter is about how good triumphs over evil and how love is the most powerful magic.The story (and the movie) moves all emotions---It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, both from sadness and happiness.I can't believe this movie only made a four star rating. Who'd actually vote for less? it's a fantastically made film. And this first one is and will always be my favorite.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A17PY5QJLSCE80	Vanessa Roa	Harry Potter, hmmmm, where to begin. If you read my review for the book you already know What I think. Here we have a fine example of a promising cast that fails to deliver what the book did, except one thing, THE BOOK DIDN'T DELIEVER ANYTHING!!! Lets start off with Leading Man Daniel Radcliffe. He seems to be a nice kid but I am not going to lie, he is not a good actor. He merely says things and looks around, and then moves his body parts. It's not acting, it's just insulting the art of theater. I, in all my honesty, don't really think you care what so ever about the other actors, but in case you are wondering about Draco, who is played by Tom Felton, he does nothing but remind you of Karl Lagerfeld, and oh yeah, he acts like a total douche to everyone in the film, just like Karl Lagerfeld would do in real  life. Which, I guess if you like Draco, or merely dorks with greasey long blond hair,  at least that's promising. Hermione, ( FINALLY! we learn how to pronounce her damn name, I have been calling her hormonies for the longest time now) is played by the adorable Emma Watson. For Some reason, when you see Harry and Hermoine ( what is it with J.K. Rowling and the names that begin with the letter H, anyway? Does it have some thing to do with hell, maybe? Like it holds a secret message?)you are strongly reminded of Corey and Topanga from Boy Meets World. Let me just say that who ever got Rupert Grint only got him because for some reason, red hair is cool when you are intoxicated or high. That kid doesn't scare me becuase he is a red head, he just scares me. There is something about him that reminds you of leprechans or Garden Gnomes, like he is about to burst out of a box of Lucky Charms. Normally I would call him Shawn from Boy Meets World to complete the boy meets world joke but that would be an insult to Ryder Strong and his good looks and acting so, I must refrain. And of course, there is Professor Snape, played by one of the ever talented actors in the film Alan Rickman. In this role, Alan Rickman resembles the Nine Inch Nails one and only one band member Trent. The only good actors are the adult actors in the film, but don't be suprised, most of the kids here are in their first role, or for those that aren't, it gives you a better excuse to avoid the film, and hope that they drop the whole series.	1.0	IT came, IT saw, ............it sucked	2004-02-03	12	3	9

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1QV3GLX8S9HZX	Veronica Bauff	I will try to keep this review rant-free, but it is going to be difficult. There are many causes behind my 1-star review of this abysmal movie, most of which follow:To begin with, the acting. All the children (with a few exceptions) over-act their parts, especially one Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), who appears to think that opening her mouth very wide, bobbing her head, and exhaling on each line will improve her performance. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), however, does not seem to act at all, apparently under the assumption that having the title role means he can just stand and deliver his lines with either forced or no emotion, in a Pokemon-esque style. But, in the words of the Potions Master, &quot;Fame clearly isn't everything.&quot; Alan Rickman and Dame Maggie Smith, as Professors Snape and McGonagall respectively, perform bravely in a sea of the mundane, and David Bradley gives his all to the character of Filch the Caretaker, but they are not enough to save this movie. Robbie Coltrane's giant Hagrid, though cute, is reduced to the one-liner (&quot;I shouldn'ave said that!&quot;) comic relief, much like Gimli in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which at least had brilliant special effects and acting from the heart). Richard Harris (Dumbledore), though I do not wish to speak ill of the dead, lacks the twinkle and spirit his character has in the books.Secondly, there is the little matter of the special effects. To cram it all into one sentence, they are over-done, much like everything else in this movie. Fluffy, the three headed dog, looks like a creation of Pixar, and Quidditch, though ment to be thrilling and awe-inspiring, is rather like watching someone else play a video game. And lose.Not to be a purist, but one of the greatest issues that bugged me about this movie was its horrible, horrible mistreatment of the book (no offense Doug Thomas, author of the amazon.com review, but did you even read the book?!). Oh, sure, there are the small things one can be nit-picky about (the color change of Aunt Petunia's hair from blonde to brown, the students are not called in alphabetical order for the Sorting) but some of the blatant errors makes a Harry Potter fan's blood run cold. For exmple, Harry's eyes. In the book, Harry's eyes are the same color as his mother's (this is rumored to be very important in future books) and that color is green. Green, the color of grass and emeralds and Sprite bottles. Yet, Chris Columbus appears to be colorblind, for Harry's eyes in the film are blue! Blue! I apologize; I promised not to rant. Actually, the only things that do come from the book are presented in such a way that one thinks the writers used a checklist.If you add all this to John Williams' hyper-emotional score and the film's choppy delivery, you have a definate must-not-see.	1.0	Are you all mad?

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A14M62UJVB2PDH	vervelb	As a fan of the book, I will admit that many story elements were left out, and the changes made to condense the plot really irked me upon my first viewing of the film. Also, many of the special effects look very cartoony. That said, I just rewatched this film, and when you don't compare it to the book (which is obviously going to be better) the movie does hold its own and is very entertaining. The actors are all wonderful (the film is very well cast), the sets and scenes are very true to Rowling's fictitious world, and the movie captures the essence of what made the books so popular in the first place. In fact, my only complaint with the second viewing (and the reason the movie only gets 4 stars from me) is the lackluster special effects in 2 specific scenes. Other than that, I would almost be willing to say that I loved this movie.	4.0	An enjoyable flick	2002-09-27	1	1	0

I am 49 and my husband is 54 and we went to theater twice to see this one and I cant wait for my DVD to arrive.  The books are great - the movie even better!  The child actors are suberb in their roles and then there are the special effects.....And as for children being unable to distinguish between a fantasy movie and Wicca - all I can say isn't it time to stop underestimating our youth?And while the movie is great fantasy on magic - it bears no relationship to Wicca.  If you are not Pagan and don't understand what it means to embrace Wicca as a religion - please don't attempt to equate Wicca and fantasy of Witches and Wizards...

So you don't need me to tell you how spectacular the movie is, or how well acted, or how beautifully adapted from the book.  I give the movie 4 stars.So how in the world can I give the DVD 5 stars, you ask?  Because of the special features, like nothing on any other DVD I've ever seen.  The interactive stuff is truly interactive, with all kinds of neat rewards for choosing the right answers, and neat punishments for choosing the wrong ones.  There's even a section about the Seven-Bottle Puzzle that was such a neat point in the book, but which was left out of the movie-- you have to have read the book to get the correct answer, a nice case of movie producer acknowledging his debt to author.  There's a very nice virtual 3-D tour of Hogwarts, including details you can barely make out during the movie itself.My only complaint is that there are no interviews with the three major young actors, but that's minor.  On the whole, I love this 2-DVD set, and in some ways the second disk is the better of the two!	5.0	A Really Good Movie DVD-- with Great Special Features	2002-08-26	3	3	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A2BNT2G1L4VIAD	"""watty_69"""	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, as you know, is the first installment in the Harry Potter series. And it's quite impressive. It stays loyal to the book, not leaving out one part, and has amazing special effects, almost unlike anything I've ever seen on a movie, not to mention on a PG rated one. The characters are just like the book described, led by a Harry Potter look-alike, Daniel Radcliff. You all know the plot, so there's no use explaining it. And if you've seen TLOR, I just wanna tell you, in my opinion, this is WAYYYYYYY better.	5.0	Well I'll be a teenage girl backstage at a Aerosmith concert	2002-04-04	2	1	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A37H2FY5NDHY20	W. Barton Burns	While I still utterly adore this movie (which certainly is 4 stars or more), I think there are some issues with DVD that deserve mention.The quality of the transfer is obviously good and I am very happy to see that most are now being made with WIDESCREEN as the default format.  However, the &quot;extras&quot; included seemed painfully scant from a release with this much anticipation. A good deal of content is rehashed of the web content. If you visited the site at least once (which I imagine many fans have), you've seen much of the DV-ROM section.Secondly there is no easy way to access the additional footage.  It was mildly charming to initially plod through the &quot;game&quot; to find hidden footage, but not so much so if you wanted to view it a second time. Other than the interview with Chris Columbus (director) and the producer of the film, there are not many other things to hold the attention of an adult. Particularly annoying is the lack of a director's commentary. And while there IS a book in the library containing Quidditch pre-production art, there is little else.Finally, while this is a very minor point, the DVD is boxed in such a way that it JUTS out from my shelf. I am sure that is a clever marketing ploy, but from a collector with nearly 200 DVDs, I find it a little troublesome.BUT... buy the DVD anyway. Its a great film and franchise! :)	3.0	Movie is great... but the DVD is lacking	2002-05-29	3	3	0

While it was missing the best parts of the book, it is truly a great movie. The Quidditch scene is exactly as I imagined it. I heard someone say it was too computer generated... yeah, seeing as it WAS computer generated it would be pretty hard not to be! The sets are beautiful and the actors, even the kids, are outstanding! Two out of the three times I saw it, everyone clapped afterwards! I have never seen that happen before! Far better than Lord of the Rings, which, to put it frankly, put me to sleep,  this is a movie that everyone, ages 6 - 106 can appreciate and enjoy. I am greatly anticipating the release of the DVD!

I'm not a kid, just a kid at heart.  I probably can't say more about this movie than EVERYONE ELSE DID, (although waiting for the next one)...One thing I will add is that Amazon did a good job on the release and pricing of this movie.  I preordered the movie, at what I thought was a reasonable discount.  Then, when the movie came out, in many of my local store ads, it appeared for a lower price.  I was dissapointed, but figured there was nothing I could  do.  Low and behold, Amazon came through, and emailed me letting me know that they had reduced the price online, and were giving me a credit on my account.  This sorta turned out to be an Amazon review, more than a Harry Potter review, oh well.  They did well in my book.	4.0	Awesome movie, can watch it over and over...	2002-08-06	1	0	1
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1O7Z8T9TDEMGR	"W. F. Spencer ""Bill"""	About the Movie:Of course, this is the story anticipated by millions.  My kids have enjoyed re-watching it several times, but interest seems to be fading, as we await Book 5 and Movie 2.Chris Columbus has managed to include in the movie all the important story lines from Book 1, and many parts are downright fun, such as SEEING a Quidditch game like the many we've imagined for several years.The biggest problem in the movie is that every story line gets its little part of the movie, making the movie non-stop, whilst, incongruously, somewhat boring, as the pace stays relentlessly the same for 2-1/2 hours.  Never terrifyingly break-neck, and never a breather.  Remember the garbage compactor scene in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;?  A great breather -- just long enough to make the upcoming terrors stop your heart.But, you can't skip Movie 1 in this set of 7!The DVD-ROM:Hugely disappointing.  Buy this for the movie, not for its PC companion.  Ditto for the special DVD features played on a TV.It was hard to install, eventually failed, and delivered mostly just links to the HP web sites we've already enjoyed.Owl mail is just a way to get HP-related advertising.Mixed potions, but couldn't figure out how or why you'd guess particular combinations, except through random trial &amp; error.Had a wand choose me, but it wasn't really me -- it doesn't know anything about *me*.  Ditto the Sorting Hat.Casting a spell over a scene in 8 languages is interesting.  Once.  Well, maybe a few are - 8 gets a bit much.  It's really just watching the standard DVD capability to play in different languages.Never found many other features, probably due to failures with installing the viewer software, even after trying the latest patches from the web.  (Learn Quidditch, Meet the Ghosts, Sneak past Fluffy, Collect Wizard Trading Cards, etc.)Worst of all, never found the 7 Deleted Scenes.  (We all wanted *more* HP...)In summary, the DVD-ROM was thin, weak, disappointing contents, and technically flawed.	3.0	Essential HP, but Staid &amp; Conservative	2002-06-13	1	1	0

Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &amp; the film is very true to the books. I hope this continues as the film series continues.One disapointment is that I wish the deleted scenes had been added INTO the film as a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; instead of just tacked on to the end of the tape, it would have added to it's fidelity to the source material...of course, a Director's Cut will probably come, when Warner Bros need more cash!Also, I wish the VHS would have ALL the deleted scenes, &amp; interviews.

Some people complain about the magic and witchcraft and sorcery. But I'm a baby boomer I grew up in the 60's and 70's watching Bewitched, Twlight Zone, Star Trek, etc...  I knew as a child that these things were not real, and thats the same thing that we teach our children. It's not real it is for entertainment and enjoyment.

Now while the film has some nifty special effects, the storyline is too slow and the film is aimed for a smaller audience. I wasn't a fan of the books and this film won't make me buy one anytime soon. If your children must see this video then watch it only if the books are interesting for you.

The video has a few flaws here and there with the transfer - but overall it's minimal.  The sound is superb.As for the extras, the box describes all the many features, but fails to mention that you can only do things once you've completed others.  The dvd contains 6 extra scenes - but in order to do so - you have to play a game that is as fun as pushing blocks through a hole in the wall.  Boredom and frustration sets in from the first momment.  Pardon me for felling peeved that I have to WORK for my extras.  As for the rest of the extras - they're boring.  The wand thing is stupid and it's always the third wand.  The transfigure feature is no existant.

The actors & actresses who were picked for the roles were pretty close to perfect and the cinematography did the story justice.  Of course, as usual I enjoyed the book more than the movie, but there are rarely times where that is not true.

Sadly, this is the ONLY film in the series that made any kind of effort to portray Hermione and Ron as they were meant to be, while the sequels either butchered or overblew them.Old pros like the late Richard Harris and Maggie Smith add to the charm of this engaging fantasy.	4.0	Despite being handled by Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves, this emerges a winner	2006-07-01	4	2	2

What but magic could have made so many American kids (among others) pick up a book willingly and read it?Everything came together (or was brought together) just right for ths film. I understand that Rowling demanded artistic control, to make sure her story survived as well as it could, and it did. The casting was great. Alan Rickman made Snape into something that can never be repeated. Hermione, Ron, the professors - all brilliant matches of person to role. Even Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was wonderful. I knew, because as soon as I saw him on screen, I just wanted to smack him.There's just so much here for a tween-age kid that I'm amazed all over again. All the adults are way too big, every experience is new, all kinds of wonderful secrets are being exposed, and there are still way too many rules.Most of all, the effects are a) pervasive and b) unobtrusive. The amount of computed imagery is just mind-numbing. Still, almost all of it looks natural and well tuned to the live action.Buying the DVD costs about as much as seeing a first-run movie twice these days. If you watch this twice (and you will), you break even if you buy it. If you watch it more (and you will), you're ahead of the game.Go for it. Get yourself one of the best kids' movies ever.

My oldest daughter introduced me to Harry Potter. Previous I had been clueless to anything Harry Potter.Having now read the book, I feel that the movie does Harry Potter justice in form and feel. Obviously you cannot capture the entirety of a book in a 2 hour movie; they are different medium. But I do believe the movie is as compelling and fun as the book.The actors are spot on. In fact, now that I am reading book 2 in the series I can't help but picture the actors from the movies. They are convincing, lovable and memorable. Especially Hagrid!I don't know how the rest of the series will turn out, but having seen 3 Harry Potter movies and read 2 books, I think they compliment each other as well as can be expected. Each adds a new dimension to the other.A must see for hardcore Potterite, and casual fan.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AOTKCRM7D3SLO	"""wishful_hopeful"""	Refusing to get hauled into the Harry Potter mania, but succumbing to the movie when it was shown on HBO, I must say I can definately see why children and adults alike all over the world are going cuckoo over the books. Who won't like waking up one day from your mundane everyday life, or if your life is bad as in Harry's case, to find out that your actually a wizard. And a famous one too! Living a horrid life under his cruel uncle and aunt who forces him to live in the cupboard under the stairs all changed one day when Harry's received a letter inviting him to study at the prestigious Hogwarts school of magic. There the movie takes you to a journey of Harry's magical adventuers with magic, mystical creatures, resident ghosts, pictures that have moving characters, staircases that shift every now an then, dining rooms with candles floating and everything that can boggle your mind and fill you with awe. He even gets to play quidditch, a game played on a broomstick.The movie was lovely, the special effects very convincing indeed, not at all forced or fake looking. The acting of the main characters left a little to be desired however. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were abit stiff in the first hour or so of the movie and looked like they were just reading of a script page. As the movie progressed on, they got better, but kudos must go to Rupert Grint as I felt he was the most at ease and natural of the three.I would definately recommend watching this one.	4.0	You're a wizard Harry!!	2003-07-13	2	2	0

The movie is excellent, but I feel a little bit frustrated because so many things has been cut out from the original story.  The thrill of the books because of the way the writer expressing exaggeratingly on what happen to the character, that's what make it so fun to read.  And the character, besides Harry, Hermione and Ron is nice too, especially Fred & George and of course in the other books, Oliver Wood.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AMMEMPM9MPS55	www.DavidLRattigan.com	Harry Potter is a simply charming, exciting, and wholesome old-fashioned entertainment for children and adults alike. Christians (especially fundamentalists) decried the books when they came out, and then the film, but such hysteria betrays utter ignorance of what Potter is about, and where its roots lie. It stands in an ancient tradition of story-telling, with the familiar imagery of monsters and magic being used to illustrate the struggle between good and evil. At its core is a message that is truly Christian in spirit.Potter has humble beginnings, growing up with his aunt and uncle who reject and despise him, before on his 11th birthday discovering that invested in him are magical powers that most children only dream of. From there he is taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he must learn to use his powers responsibly and morally. Like Christ, Potter is faced at every turn with the temptation to misuse the powers he has been granted, to befriend evil and use his abilities for his own, selfish gain. His journey culminates in a final battle in which he faces evil head on and, in a fiery climax, laden with infernal imagery, he must decide whether to put his own desires (however legitimate and heartfelt they may be) above the good of others.The virtues of self-sacrifice, honour, and love clearly (and predictably, of course, but that is not the point) emerge the victors in this oft-told story of war between good and evil. How shallow must one be not to be able to see, beneath the trappings of mythology, magic and folklore, that this is the kind of tale every child wants to hear, and ought to hear? Potter's pilgrimage is one that begins with childish fascination with magical powers, but goes on to show us that power is not merely a toy, but is a gift which carries with it responsibility and duty; power means nothing and is worth nothing when it is wielded apart from love. As St Paul wrote, 'If I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing' (1 Corinthians 13:2).I asked myself what made Potter into such a hero. He is hardly any more interesting as a character than his peers: the presumptuous Hermoine Granger; Potter's unassuming best friend, Ron Weasley; and the dastardly Draco Malfoy. On the contrary, Potter is rather bland as a character, and there are far more curious traits to be found in others. He does, however, exemplify all that is good (even though he might be found ambiguous in some regards, but this is a staple of good story-telling). He is an underdog who, in finding that he has been given a precious gift, also finds justice and compensation for the way he has been treated. And it is a gift which he uses in the right way. The character of Harry Potter is no hazardous doorway into occultism and wizardry (as if Rowling's creation bore anything other than a very superficial resemblance to real witchcraft anyway); rather he is a role model in whom parents and teachers can have confidence. He is a hero, and his popularity is proof that goodness and virtue are still what people (children most of all) value, admire, and want to emulate.The tale is told with great excitement, awe and invention. Amongst a wonderful cast, Alan Rickman stands out as the creepily disconcerting Snape. As an exhilarating and enchanting adventure, even aside from the positive message conveyed, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is marvellous.	4.0	A Christian perspective on an engrossing fable	2002-07-04	1	1	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	It is really quite amazing that a major motion picture not only remained very faithful indeed to Rowling's original novel but actually succeeded very well in recreating the magical scenery and extraordinary environment of Hogwart's. The special effects in the movie are, on the whole, fantastic, a fact which becomes obvious upon Harry's first entrance into the Great Hall. Most amazing of all may be the spectacular presentation of the game of Quidditch. While almost all of Rowling's descriptions in the novel come leaping off the page, it is a little difficult to get a real picture of Quidditch in one's head; thanks to the movie, my days of struggling to really visualize the game as it is played are a thing of the past. There are a couple of occasions upon which the special effects look just a tad hokey, but the overall effect of the film is so magical that I'm not complaining. Indeed, I find it quite refreshing indeed to see a film follow the author's original words and scenes so faithfully; there were minor adjustments to the story along the way, and in a couple of cases the changes actually proved more effective than the original scene would have played on the big screen. The cast is excellent up and down the line. Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter as far as I'm concerned, but I was even more impressed by Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley and Emma Watson (my favorite) as the incomparable Hermione Granger. Richard Harris' brilliant performance as Albus Dumbledore will be sorely missed in future films. I would be remiss to forget Robbie Coltrane's critical contribution as the one and only Hagrid, but by far the most effective job is done by Alan Rickman, whose performance as Professor Snape ranks among the most impressive acting jobs I've ever seen.Everybody knows the plot of the movie by now. The only weakness in this epic production comes in the form of snippets and scenes from Rowling's novel that were not included - this is understandable, as the movie runs a good two and a half hours as it is. The ending seems to come up just a little short, yet it is quite enjoyable as it is. A few plot points that reveal more about some of the key characters can only be found in the book, but the fact that they are most important in terms of what they betoken for future novels and movies makes them a little less than crucial for this first Harry Potter motion picture. Overall, as a full-grown adult clinging to what few fancies of youth he has left, I have to say I loved every minute of this movie. Its commitment to Rowling's vision is to be commended, and there can be no doubt that there are bigger and better adventures yet to come in both book and movie form.The DVD features are, at least to a certain point, rather fun to mess around with, but they probably appeal more to young people than adults. I for one began to grow a little bored after touring Hogwart's, but the fact is that anything on top of the movie itself is just a bonus. I've watched Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone several times now, and I have enjoyed it greatly each and every time.	5.0	A faithful, bedazzling adaptation of Rowling's novel	2006-06-12	2	2	0

I could barely make out Dumbledore's features and backdrop was even worse, couldn't see Privet Drive at all. The audio was poor too - I had the volume turned up high, yet the sound was muffled. It is not my wireless that is the problem - I played back my other instant videos (ie Walking Dead and an old black and white film, L'Avventura) and they looked great. I tried playing this video on my desktop, which has a wired Internet connection, and the video/audio quality looked just as bad. Luckily, Amazon customer service is excellent.

B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"If you watch ""Sorcerer's Stone"" without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual).  However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.For a basic plot summary, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.).  Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage.  Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a ""Wizard Academy"" of sorts, to begin his training.  While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step.  There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few ""facts"" from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book.  Why?  Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters.  For some, the ""mystery is gone"" when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of ""epic-ness"" to it.  It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.Thus, ""Sorcerer's Stone"" is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes.  The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into."	5.0	Visual Awe Vaults It Even Over Book	2013-03-24	0	0	0
B00003CXI0	Harry Potter &amp; Sorcerer's Stone [VHS]	A318RKL1I9ABCM	"""zaloop"""	"This is supposed to be a review of Harry Potter, but I feel like talking about two previews I saw before Harry Potter more than Harry Potter itself: the newest Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: Episode II trailers, which were amazing and contained more originality, imagination, and pure excitement in them than HP did in its entire 2 hour-30 minute running time. HP proves that popularity (2nd or 3rd highest international gross so far) does not always equal quality.The film is about a boy, Harry Potter, who is raised by brutal and uncaring foster parents in a cupboard storage area under the stairs of their house (no, I'm being serious). One day he receives an invitation to Hogwarts, a school for training wizards, and Harry sets off to begin his career as a wizard in training. On the way, he discovers information about the death of his natural parents and is caught up in a plot to get the eponymous sorceror's stone.I appreciate how HP tries to contain a somewhat complex plot, complete with a mystery and history. It's very ambitious for a kid's film, but it still fails to succeed in this area. The first 15 minutes - showing Harry in his life with his foster parents - are nothing short of unbearable; Harry's situation and his mean parents are meant to evoke sympathy for his character and provide pathos, but it all ends up playing out as a comedy with the parents not being threatening at all but just bumbling fools. His treatment does not end up accomplishing what it should - making us genuinely desire that Harry go to Hogwarts and escape this undeserved life - but rather only serves as a kind of weird, humorous mess, and the only reason we are happy Harry has gotten into Hogwarts is because it means this segment of the film is finally over.On the journey through the film we do encounter some nice visuals, the direction here being at its strongest: the Dickensian detail of Diagon Alley, the interior of Hogwarts with its morphing paintings, shifting stairs, transparent ceiling, and so on. However, Chris Colombus is not an Oscar tier director, to put it lightly, and one can only sigh to imagine how someone capable like Spielberg or even Tim Burton would have brought the film to more life. The effects also hamper the film a lot (except the invisibility cloak, which is quite impressive in a simple way) - the troll and three-headed dog look awful, as does a lot of the Quidditch match, and the centaur looks like a videogame character on par with the awful job they did with the Scorpion King at the end of Mummy Returns.The acting is fine. Radcliffe is good because he's good at being shy and understated, which is what his character is like. Alan Rickman is devilishly entertaining and drips his lines with venom. The other kids are okay, sometimes bordering on annoying.The Quidditch match is a much ballyhooed action piece in the film, and it turns out to be pretty mediocre. There is great speed and velocity in it, to be sure; but the CG people on broomsticks turn out to be quite fake looking when the film decides to speed their frame rate up to 10 times their previous speed in the blink of a second, in the hopes that we won't notice and will just think it's their lightning reflexes. The game itself never gets very interesting because the rules are various and confusing, and are only explained in a brief two minute segment beforehand. I find myself asking more questions about how the game is supposed to be played and why people aren't just chasing after that damn golden ball thing instead of being able to ""enjoy"" the match.I mentioned the LOTR and SW trailers that played before this, and I must say I am glad these other fantasy/sci-fi films are coming/have come out relatively soon after HP, because hopefully people will realize just how much HP ""borrows"" ideas and elements from them, especially LOTR. Potter, to be completely honest, just isn't a very imaginative or creative film: the wizards are the typical long-bearded type (Richard Harris' Dumbledor looks like a carbon copy of Gandalf from LOTR), the witches are the typical broomstick-wielding, black pointy hat-wearing type, the goblins look like a cross between Yoda and (again) the goblins we will see in LOTR, the spells and magic we see in the film aren't anything new or interesting, there aren't any truly exciting action sequences, and there are plot holes galore: Why does Snape hate Harry? Can't Dumbledor come up with a better spell to protect the sorceror's stone? What did Voldemort have against Harry's parents in the first place?I don't want to waste much more time talking about this film. Honestly, why has this film been so popular? Even if we ignore the obvious ""inspirations"" it has taken from other sources and look at it for its ""own merits,"" we still end up with a cheesy, kiddie fantasy flick with clich&eacute;d and typical fantasy wizard/witch figures, cutesy kid characters that spout cheesy comic relief one-liners like ""wicked!"" or ""she really needs to straighten out her priorities,"" fake special effects, an action sequence played up to be the central event in the film that is bogged down by poor CG and confusing rules, a running time that is too long, subplots that take the film off on a tangent but end up contributing nothing to the central ""story"" , a very silly ending, and the fact that we still come away from the film knowing almost nothing about wizardry.But what do I know? 600 million dollars can't be wrong. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to finish watching the special features for Phantom Menace and begin getting hyped up for Episode II, because unlike Harry Potter, Star Wars deserves its popularity."	2.0	Unimaginative, un-magical mess	2002-02-12	11	6	5

Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is a feast for the eyes, it is beautifully filmed, the special effects are fantastic, and the cast is excellent.The story centers around young Harry Potter who discovers his destiny as a great wizard and goes off to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry Potter is played by the brilliant young actor Daniel Radcliffe who seems perfect for the role, not just in looks, but also in his gestures and mannerisms. His best friends Ron Weasley [Rupert Grint], and Hermione Granger [Emma Watson] are perfectly cast as well, and together, these three young actors make the story of Harry Potter's exploits come alive.The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well - Richard Harris's Dumbledore reminds me of Gandalf the Grey, he is dignified, and full of wisdom. Maggie Smith delights as the strict Professor Minerva McGonagall, and Alan Rickman truly breathes life into the character of sly, cunning Professor Snape who seems to have a secret agenda of his own. Robbie Coltrane's gentle giant Hagrid is amazing as well.The costumes exceed expectations - truly what one might expect of characters playing wiches and wizards, and the creatures such as the centaurs, dragon etc are fun to watch, as are the special effects.This is a great movie for both kids and adults - a great beginning to the series and truly outstanding in its storytelling skills. The others in the series are amazing in their own right and merit multiple viewings as well.	5.0	If the book captured your imagination, the movie is a visual feast!	2007-08-02	2	2	0

Mann	The first time I saw &quot;HARRY POTTER&quot; I liked it, the effects were great, the acting I guess was O.K., the score was great too, but what bothered me was that it seemed to be a more childish and simpler than the original book. The original book could be likable for all agaes(supposedly), but the movie can't. One disapointment in the movie was that the scary parts were scarier written down in the book than to be actually seen in the movie. And anyone over 12 years old wouldn't likely be caught laughing at the &quot;supposed to be funny&quot; scenes.Even though the special features should be interesting, I would reccomend renting it first befor you run off to your nearest movie store and buying it and not know what your getting.So, overall, I'd say this is a good family film. Though it would help to have read the book, it seems you don't need too much background information to understand it.	3.0	A Bit Too Simple.	2002-06-07	1	0	1

I thought there were lovely little touches and some good acting in HP, but the scene with Quirrel and Voldemort, the climax, was slightly disapointing. Wasn't  Quirrel supposed to be burning, and not crumbling? Yeah, I know; &quot;the burning would scare the little kids.&quot; I would know as well as anybody: after all, I have a friend in second grade who would be scared by it. But still... Well, that wasn't the main problem ( I s'pose I'm just complaining). The troll DID NOT FIT. He was just a bit too unreaistic (but, hey, I guess that would be too scary for the little kids too!
