0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	Peter Benchley's best selling novel comes to life in Jaws. The novel was based on the Jersey Shore shark attacks in 1916. Jaws helps to re-image what happened on the beaches. Basically all caos.Are the waters safe? The answer to that question on Amity Island is NO. Martin Brody is convinced of that when Christine Watkins's torn up body washes ashore. To fix the problem he has to do one thing. Kill the Shark. Easier said than done. And, better yet, the beaches have to remain open for the Fourth of July celebration. In other words, Brody has to do something about it, and fast. Can he kill the maneating Great White Shark before it kills the people on the beach?So continues Jaws. The whole idea of a shark rampaging public beaches and eating everybody it sees can get a little boring after a while. But the whole plot and storyline is very well laid out. I haven't read the book Jaws, but I'm guessing it's pretty similar to the movie.The acting is really good in Jaws. Roy Scheider does a great job of portraying Martin Brody. Everyone else does a great job too. Also, the movie is pretty good for being filmed in 1975. But I must say that this movie does have blood and is probably not suitable for kids under 12-13. However, you can be the judge of that as the movie itself is only rated PG. Still just be cautious about that.Now for the effects. I guess for a '75 film, they aren't that bad. But you can easily tell the shark is nowhere close to being realistic. It swims like a robot to me. You can be the judge on the shark. I guess you can give them a break for a '75 movie.So the bottomline for Jaws is that it's a good movie. It's not a sci-fi movie either. So if you hate watching sci-fi movies, you're in luck. If you enjoy this movie, you're in for a lot more Jaws movies. There's actually 3 more Jaws movies. So I recommend Jaws to you!	5.0	He's out there, watching...waiting...	2008-07-24	1	1	0

That being said, somehow I've never seen it until I bought it on instant streaming. It was great! The character and plot development were really well done, and the closing action was really drawn out, but in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat.	5.0	A classic	2013-02-06	1	0	1

I was surprised at the newly inserted sound effects which enhance the original film. And the 'Making Of' feature was impressive.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"Jaws, 1975 filmIt is night on the ocean. A buoy clangs its warnings. Young people are sitting around a campfire at night. A couple goes to the water's edge. The girl goes in alone and finds an unpleasant surprise. She screams, then all is quiet. The next morning a man gets a telephone call. There are body parts on the beach, with crabs. What will they do? Amity Island is a small town that depends on summer tourism, the Town Council does not want the beaches closed. Will the truth be covered up? We see people in the water. ""That's some bad hat, Harry."" Where did that dog go? ""Did you see that?"" People rush from the water. Where is Alex? The Town Council wants this nes suppressed. Will they close the beaches? One man offers to catch the shark for $10,000. Quint says ""you know me"".Chief Brody does research on sharks. Two men try to catch a shark with bait. The dock collapses! ""Swim, Charlie, swim!"" They can go home now. People volunteer to hunt this shark. Matt Hooper from the Ocean Institute arrives. Its not a boat accident, it's a very large squalus. One shark was caught. Hooper measures its mouth for the bite radius. Mrs. Kintner objects to Chief Brody's failure to close the beach. Can you believe the reports on the news? Most shark attacks are about ten feet from shore in three feet of water. The shark is still out there. The boat sails at night. They find a small boat. Hooper gets a shock! ""It's a great white."" The Mayor's politics override any warnings. Brody says they need men with guns and boats. Tourists arrive for the July Fourth weekend. All seems peaceful, but nobody is in the water yet. Some boys go sailing in the pond, others in the ocean. The people see something in the water. You see the reactions as they race for the beach. False alarm?The shark appears in the pond and gets a man. Larry seems confused, but he will sign the voucher. Quint presents his terms for hunting the shark. Hooper will go along on this fishing expedition. [Note how the story changes focus here.] They throw bait into the water to attract sharks (""chumming""). Noise from the reel sends a signal: a bite on the line. They change course. Brody sees the shark. Quint and Hooper compare scars in a bonding ceremony. We hear about the USS Indianapolis in 1945. It was torpedoed and only 316 of the 1,100 survived. Then bumping noises alarms them, something is hitting the boat.Quint fires a rifle into the sea to no effect. A barrel floats close to the boat. The shark is back. Quint puts another harpoon and barrel into the shark. Tying the line to the boat? There is a problem with the boat. Hooper will try to stab the shark in the mouth. [Sounds easy?] The shark-proof cage is lowered into the ocean. What if it fails? The shark attacks the cage! Next it attacks the stern and weighs it down. Quint slides towards it. Brody throws a tank of compressed air. The ship lists to port. Brody climbs to mast with his Garand. He spears the shark. Next he shoots at it. One shot hits the air tank for an explosive result. The shark leaves the half-sunken boat. There is a new development for a happy ending. [What's next?]Note the message from the ending to this story. Was it an echo of ""Moby Dick""? Why should the most experienced sailor be the lone victim? Its still a good movie, but not as impressive after 35 years. Note the presence of firearms, would they do that today? [Shouldn't Quint have used an exploding harpoon to finish off that shark? It kills bigger fish.]I wonder why Quint didn't take any explosives along. An exploding harpoon would have quickly ended the attack; it kills the much large whales. The use of a military rifle to kill the monster must have kept this film off broadcast TV for many years. One version used electronic editing to remove the guns used in the early part of this film! This reflects the corporate politics for gun prohibition, and the mocking of the armed people who respond to the threat of the shark.There were attacks along the Jersey Shore in 1916. There are two books that go into more detail. Note the freedom to keep and bear arms then."	5.0	Horror from the Sea	2003-02-09	1	0	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2S0DMJJRHJHBS	Adam	Many people criticize this movie because the shark looks so fake.  I refute this with the style of direction by Steven Spielberg.  He is a genius for focusing the story on the attack of the shark, rather than on  the shark itself.  Most of the maulings are done without ever getting a  shot of Jaws.  The openning sequence confirmed the fact that I will never  go anywhere near the ocean at night, EVER! We don't actually witness the  shark until well into the story.  This manifests the true horror of the  movie.  The viewer becomes scared of the water, terrified to progress into  the deep of the ocean, because we can't see what's out there and possibly  waiting for us.  This is the true definition of a horror movie, a flic that  scares us using our minds rather than our eyes.Also, Shaw, Dreyfuss,  Scheidner, and Hamilton are brilliant in portraying their characters.  Your  not sure whether to root for the shark or for Shaw.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2000-01-02	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A25ZYFCUCINB7K	"Aditya M. Rao ""amr46"""	Few movies have been able to capture the audience's attention with such a simple opening scene. The brilliant combination of surrealistic lighting, the twilight becoming dawn, and especially and PRIMARILY one extremely  haunting theme song ensure that Speilberg and co. have your undivided  attention. Jaws capitalised on something that our generation has sadly  become desensitised to: the feeling of fear. We've seen it all, whether it  be slashers gutting their screaming victims, hideous monsters on deserted  spaceships etc. But Jaws takes that which we can conceive as very real, the  Great White Shark and makes the audience feel that this could really happen  to you. The movie's buildup is fantastic and the climax is simply  unforgettable. The sheer malevolence with which Scheider delivers his coup  de grace in the face of an unblinking monster is definitely one of the  greatest cinematic sequences ever captured on celluloid. A must see for all  those who are WILLING to put themselves in the place of the three men on  the ship and realise along with them, that they are not necessarily the  most ruthless and remorseless beings out there in the wide open sea.	5.0	Pure unadulterated fear	2000-01-28	2	1	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2TLCFD8RE12Z1	"AGD ""Jonas Mac"""	"YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BETTER MEDIUM..., 2 Sep 2012JAWS THE BLU RAY""What we have here is a perfect movie, all it does is entertain, terrify adults and give little kids nightmares all night long...""Like most people from my generation, I have a strange but very personal history with this movie. When it first came out I was not able to see it, I think I was thought to be too young. (The Poster did after all warn that this movie might be a bit too intense for little kids). My older brother saw it when it first came out and being a kid who lived inside his own head most of the time; he was able to remember every single line in the movie.I come from the Bogside in Derry of Northern Ireland and I had absolutely no idea what a shark was, no concept at all - my brother Paddy, told me it was like a goldfish that was grey, that it was about the size of a bus and that it had rows of teeth the size of steak knives, oh yeah, and it also could bite a man clear in half below the waist - Yikes!.One Halloween's night, a very stormy night if I recall correctly, in a friend's house, we sat, three friends and I, (all of us thought too young to see the film), under the kitchen table in the dark with a candle, and line by line, doing incredibly accurate impersonations of all the characters, the sound effects, the music, the screams from the onlooking bathers as people were eaten alive, my bother created out of the darkness of our overactive imaginations the entire 2hour plus movie and we were rooted to the spot and terrified beyond belief for every minute of that tale. When the shark was about to attack my brother did the two note music and that just built the tension even more than his vivid depictions of the mayhem off Amity.When I finally saw the movie for the first time it was as a double bill with Jaws 2, - How lucky was I!!! - (which I think is still a pretty decent sequel but could have been better if Spielberg had a hand in it).Needless to say, Jaws blew me out of my seat and when I had my first glimpse of what a grey goldfish the size of a bus with knives for teeth looked like up close on the big screen I told myself never ever to set foot in the ocean.When Ben Gardener made his unexpected appearance from the jagged hole, I shot clear out of my seat as my heart jumped right out of my shrieking lungs; the timing, o boy, the timing of that appearance was sheer brilliance and from that moment on, whenever there was water on screen, even a slither of it, I was all bunched up in tension with my eyes darting all over just to make sure that monster was not about to suddenly pop from out of the screen to chomp on me.As a kid from a slum, when I first saw the Chief's car driving along the beach road at the beginning of the movie I turned to my friend watching with me and told him that one day I would get out of the ghetto and live in a place just like Amity Island and strangely enough, I happen to live now in the very place where the underwater shots of the real shark attacking the cage was shot - Port Lincoln South Australia - a place that looks quite a lot like ole Amity - Weird or what, right?I loved the movie and still consider it to be one of the most perfect movies ever made, great, mind blowing opening, and great pace, characters you care about, funny, frightening, and suspenseful with a great ending that makes you want to jump up and down on your chair and cheer.I later read the novel in school, the version without the steamy affair between Hooper and Ellen Brody, and I loved that too. I went on to read Jaws 2 by Hank Searle and that was even better than the sequel movie, (I recommend it).Over the years I have watched Jaws a number of times in different mediums, the last time being the DVD 2 Disc Edition and I have to say it is still one of my favourite films.I have ordered it on Blu Ray and although it has still to arrive, I know it will be money well spent because Spielberg has had a hand in the restoration and if there is anything evident about this man when it comes to movies it is he is a perfectionist so I know I am going to have my socks blown off when I finally get to see my favourite film in HD for the first time.I am already planning a Jaws fest with my eldest daughter, Storm, who also loves Jaws, she has yet to see Jaws 2, and so it is going to be great to watch the first one on Blu Ray and the second one on DVD. I have also ordered the Jaws Novels, 1 & 2, and the Jaws Log by Carl Gottlieb; maybe I should try and get a poster too!I would like to say thank-you to all the people involved in the making of this movie and to those responsible for bringing it on to Blu Ray because even when we first watched it on video and DVD we all knew the makers were going to need a bigger boat to do this movie justice.There I got in the best line in the movie.Great novel, great story, great actors, Roy, Richard & Robert, great screenplay, great cinematography, and brilliant directing from a guy young enough not to know the difference between courage and stupidity.Can't wait to get back in the water...UPDATE...Just received the blu ray and watched it immediately and I suppose the question on everyone's lips is does this transfer deserve me updating from the 30th Anniversary 2 Disc DVD Edition and the answer is YES-INDEEDYDOODY, YOU CAN BET YOUR GRANDPA'S BACK MOLARS AND YOUR GRANDMA'S PRETTY GREY HAIR - That is if he still has them and she isn't as bald and wispy as a China Man's chin -The images are crisp on this baby now, I noticed things I had never noticed before and I loved that fact, the colours are glorious, the night time water shots are stunning, the blue skies oh so blue, the aqua waters crystal, the sheen of sweat on skin so clear you can see the pores on Chief Brody forehead, all of it wonderfully upgraded. This movie looks even better than it did when it first screened, and let's not forget, this is a 36 year old movie we are talking about. The underwater shots of the shark are especially good and one has to include the eeriness of the SS Indianapolis scene with the whales singing to each other in the background; which brings me to the sound, oh dear me, the sound, when that shark is on its way and the music tells you so, the sound in 7.1 is spine tingling, the hairs on your neck stand up, absolutely brilliant.And as for the extras, well, we still get all the extras from the 30th Anniversary Edition, including the great Making Of, which ran at 1 hour and 40 minutes and I thought when I first saw that that it was brilliant, I loved all the behind the scenes information; however, the Blu Ray goes even further with another feature length doco called The Shark is Still Working. I thought it would be just more rehash from The Making Of; but oh how wrong I was - this doco alone is worth the upgrade, we get to see a lot more behind the scenes as well as getting to hear some current directors talk about how much of an impact this movie made on them and their careers; wonderful stuff.So, as good as the DVD was; this Blu Ray treatment blows the DVD clear out of the water, it is most definitely worth the upgrade, it will be the best $20 you will ever spend on a movie and it is a movie that you can now introduce to the younger generation and do it some justice this time round.Buy it, buy it now, tell all your friends to buy it, if you haven't got the money, go rob a bank, take hostages at gunpoint, do whatever you must do to own this amazing movie in this format; even go tell that old git down the road none of us can stand to go out and buy himself a copy today.""Show me the way to go home; I'm tired and I want to go to bed; well, I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head, no matter where I roam, through land or sea or foam; you will always hear me singing a song; show me the way to go home...""Jaws has just arrived.Finally, she's home!Shalom"	5.0	WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BETTER MEDIUM...	2012-08-30	7	5	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A25ORKPDC1N1QW	A.J.	I need to start out stating this one thing: I somehow managed to avoid seeing Jaws up until I picked it up on Blu Ray last month.  That being said, I can't compare it to an older DVD release or how I may have seen it in a theatre.  So with fresh eyes, the best review I can give it is that the transfer from the original film is amazing.  The sound is great, the picture is PERFECT, and it gave me the sensation that I can only imagine it was like to see it on the big screen when it first came out.	5.0	Blu Ray was amazing.	2012-12-12	2	1	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3CSRP3P4U9HI	Alan R. Holyoak	JAWS is, in my opinion, one of the movies that saved Hollywood and revitalized the movie industry.  Speilberg and Lucas, along with a few others, sent America back to the movies.The movie includes an  assemblage of great actors.  The casting is superb, and the acting is  top-notch.The story line, though somewhat more difficult to believe  now than it was in the 1970s, still makes people think twice about getting  in the water.  The idea of being eaten alive by a huge animal that has  evolved into a perfect eating machine is one of the few things that  instills nearly universal feelings of horror among virtually everyone.The special effects (FX) support the character and plot development, but  the FX do not overpower the acting.  &quot;Bruce&quot; the huge shark  mechanical used in the movie actually takes on a character of its own, one  that develops as the story moves along.Main and supporting characters  are all outstanding...from the narrow-minded mayor all the way up to the  three primary characters who make up the majority of the movie on the  boat.There is suspense, story line, acting, and nearly tactile horror  that grips you as you are drawn into this story.  If you have watched this  movie only on broadcast TV, do yourself a favor and watch the movie on  video or DVD for as close to the original experience as you can get.A  true classic by an outstanding director, featuring an excellent cast.As  for the faithfulness to Benchley's book, there are whole subplots that had  to be trimmed in order for the movie project to work.  But if you never  read the book you'd never know.  In either case, I recommend watching the  movie and then reading the book -- both are wonderful treats for anyone who  enjoys tales of the sea.5 stars all the way!I hope this review was  helpful to you -- Alan Holyoak	5.0	As good and as captivating as it was 25 years ago!	2000-05-21	7	6	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A5H1GQONFOHD2	Alexandra	Since I first saw Jaws when I was a little kid, it's been one of my all time favorite films. I never get sick of watching this masterpiece of suspense, it's your classic man against nature story and I love it. So I  preorderd the DVD and waited for the day I could have some friends over to  christen my great new copy.  Nowadays, I think in order for a DVD to be  competitive and worth buying over renting it needs to have lots of great  extra features. The &quot;featurette&quot; about the making of the movie  that's on here is just the same thing that was on the VHS edition, and as  for deleted scenes and outtakes, there's not much to speak of. The trivia  game was a cute touch, but it's just 12 questions (though they are tough,  even for a Jaws nut like me) and all in all I really was hoping for more  cool extra stuff.If you're a big fan of the movie, like me, it's more  than worth the cost to have the quality of picture and sound you get here,  but if you're just looking for cool extras you'll be disappointed. (But  cranking this puppy on my home surround system made it an absolute blast!  The sound quality is terrific.)	5.0	Still an all time fave, but the lack of extras disappointed.	2000-07-13	1	0	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1A87TUBBDPMF0	"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer"""	"Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film....and made beachgoers ask themselves if that dip in the ocean was really necessary.Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb (who also have roles in the movie) wisely jettison the melodramatic aspects of the source novel and focus on the core of the story.It's summer in Amity, a sleepy Long Island town that depends on ""summer dollars"" from thousands of tourists who come to stay in seaside cottages (the summer dinks, they are called). When a young girl goes skinny dipping in the nearby sea and is fatally attacked by a shark, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is coerced by the mayor and town council to keep the incident under wraps. He reluctantly does so, though he will regret it, for a few days later, the shark claims another victim, a young boy named Alex Kintner.Finally convinced that there is a shark out there, Amity's politicians and citizens take action...but not wisely. When shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) bids for a contract to catch and kill the shark, the town elders ""take it under advisement"" and the shark hunt becomes a wild free-for-all seagoing circus.When shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), called in by Chief Brody to help in the investigation and shark hunt, arrives and sees the shark (which he identifies as a tiger shark) caught by local fishermen, he examines the remains of the first victim. What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.Jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel. The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark....becoming the hunted in the process. Spielberg, only 27 at the time, overcame the difficulties of shooting a movie on the water and dealing with a balky mechanical shark (nicknamed ""Bruce""). Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now-famous ""shark motif"" and would earn him his second Oscar for Best Score.The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent. The movie is presented in letterbox format, and the sound and image are above average. The documentary on the making of the film is also first-rate. All in all, a must-get for Spielberg (and action film) fans."	5.0	Is it safe to go back to the water yet?	2003-07-06	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2TJPLT2K3U49E	Alex in Florida	Jaws is the best movie ever made--in my lifetime (or, one of the best, for certain).No need to submit a plot synopsis here, you know it already.  After all, that's why you won't go in the ocean anymore, right?  But I will say that the main characters in this movie (not counting the shark) are what makes a good movie great.  I like the characters.  I like seeing what they do, how they interact, what will become of them.  They're human and relatable.  In so many other movies--most of them, actually--I don't like the characters and don't care what happens to them.  This movie is like watching your friends going on a fishing expedition gone bad.The transfer to Blu-ray is very good, and done without destroying the texture of the original film, for the most part.  Very highly recommended.	5.0	BEST  MOVIE  EVER	2014-06-02	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2T2MYZEB81NOQ	"Alex K ""Catman"""	What can I say. This movie is not only stupid, but also insensitive. Along with the fact that the acting was terrible, and the music was cheesy, I need to add something else. I am, along with being a big cat, hyena, and wolf lover, also a shark lover. Sharks are both cool and beautiful. This piece of trash shows sharks as something they are not-bloodthirsty, sadistic killers who kill for fun and destroy anything they please. Hey, humans. How about the fact that over 1,000,000 sharks died because of humans, but only 100 humans died because of sharks? How about the fact that sharks have difficulties and feelings just like we do? How about the fact that this movie is an attempt to make people hate sharks, when they should be helping them? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who likes this movie is insensitive to the cruelties sharks have had to go through. A message to the director Steven Speilberg-YOU MAKE ME SICK!!!!!!!!!! If it were up to me, every copy of this movie and any other movie meant to make hate to any cool predator would be rocketed into space forever. And I don't give a (BEEP)that many people liked this movie. They just don't see what I see. I can't believe I ever watched this stupid s--t. If you are a shark lover, or an animal lover of any sort, do not see this movie. It is just another way to represent sharks as evil. And Steven Spielberg is a jerk. A very big jerk. Boy, how he makes me PUKE! Anyway, nuff said. Don't see this work of insensitivity.	1.0	Don't sharks have enough problems already?!	2005-10-25	42	4	38

I was but a schoolboy, and after that day, I never stopped drawing sharks on every piece of paper I could find. It's great to see one of my most loved films restored beautifully on Blu-ray. I can finally see the patterns and the textures on Mayor Larry's jacket, the sun-beaten craggly features on Quint's face, and all the details on Bruce the shark.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1GGJB0S7AS00O	Amaris	This movie is great.When I first saw this movie(about 5 years ago)it made me stay away from the water for months.The way the shark looked was so awesome and real!!Just think this movie was made in the 70's but it looks so real!!just think...they didint have computers to make affects or anything like that but they still pulled through and had made a very  real looking life like killer shark.The charecters are great and have lots and lots of depth.Its realy thrilling to and has lots of scares and action.It has a pretty high body count and its not that gory but its still cool to watch after jaws draggs his victims down into the cold abbyis and then you see all this blood cloud over the water.The most thrilling part id say is at the end when the ship is sinking and the main charecter is up on the sail and has to figure out a way to kill jaws before the boat completely sinks and he becomes a meal for the killer shark!!!!Very suspencful.There are also alot of other scens that was very thrilling but none as much as the final showdown between the main charecter and the killer shark,I dont wanto tell you any more but you have probly already seen it mainly because its been around forever.Buy this movie and also get jaws 2 but pass up jaws 3 and 4,they are just an embaresment to the brilliance of the first 2 jaws movies.	5.0	Greatest Shark Movie So Far And Forever Will Be	2001-11-05	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AEQMXKCI6NTOQ	"Amazon Customer ""bjorn-toby-wilde"""	A lot of people I know criticize widescreen format videos and DVDs. They  say it looks like part of the movie is cut off. JAWS is the film I use to  convert them. I show them the video I own in pan-and-scan mode, usually a  scene where the shark pops out of the water when Brody, Hooper, and Quint  are on the boat. Then I show them the DVD widescreen version.What a  difference! In the first version, you can only see most of the shark's head  and one of the people on board. In the widescreen, you see everyone.  Spielberg has a terrific eye and knows how to compose a frame. And the  widescreen format is the only way to do justice to this fun and scary  film.The new DVD also has terrific and rich color. The sound is great  and will remind you why John William's soundtrack is famous 25 years later.  But you can also hear other sound effects Spielberg stuck in, like a muted  dinosaur roar when the shark is sinking at the end. This, along with many  other interesting tidbits, was revealed to me with a behind-the-scenes  featurette that comes with the extras on the DVD. There's interviews with  the cast members today, as well as a fun trivia game. I also found the  deleted scenes interesting, although I'm glad Spielberg didn't use them.  The extras gave me a glimpse on how a film is made. When I rewatched the  film, I had a new outlook to what went into it. The outtakes and the photo  gallery were useless, but don't let that stop you from buying this. If  you're a fan of the film, you will want to own this.	5.0	You definitely want the DVD widescreen version	2000-08-09	8	8	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1GOI8745FGIDN	"""an_avid_book_reviewer"""	In this classic movie, I liked how realistic the shark seemed. Just as in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, man tries to conquer nature, in both cases a beast of the sea. This book may be taken to suggest that man can conquer nature, although incurring destruction in the process, but this is fictional story. In both stories, the beast means no intentional harm, that is just the result of its instinct. There are two technical errors in Jaws. It involves the initial harpooning of the shark to a barrel.  Even though Quint, an experienced seaman, notes upon the shark's first appearance that it is the biggest shark he's ever dealt with, he acts surprised when the shark submerges with one barrel and then with two barrels harpooned into him. After the first barrel is harpooned into the shark, it comes back at night and strikes the boat, with the barrel still on him. The next morning when the shark comes back, there is no barrel and no explanation for its absence. Those are just two minor errors in a great movie.I found it ironic that Quint, the experienced seaman, the fearless S.O.B., is the only one of the three crew members who are killed by the shark. Also ironic is that the Chief of Police, the one least knowledgable about the sea and sharks and most afraid, (&quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot;) is the one who puts the shark to death.This movie will be loved for a long time. The TV version has started to censor things it didn't before like swearing and violence, which I think detracts from the quality of the film. The sequels to Jaws just don't compare with the original.	5.0	A great classic, great story	2001-08-30	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2JDYUSI2RILEB	Andre Dursin	"The original summer blockbuster, Steven Spielberg's JAWS quickly became my favorite film growing up, having devoured it on VHS and on ABC's Sunday Night Movie presentation (the one with the added footage) so many times I could recite dialogue before I was out of grade school. Over the years I've been able to see it on the big screen (thanks to a visit with Lukas on Martha's Vineyard back in `96 or so), but despite that - and having reviewed numerous laserdisc and DVD releases over the years - only now with Universal's Blu-Ray edition do I feel like I've really, completely seen ""Jaws."" This is a spectacular HD presentation on every level and is sure to thrill fans of this classic 1975 screen adaptation of Peter Benchley's bestseller.There's not much I can say about the movie that hasn't been written or documented - from behind-the-scenes books to countless documentaries - since the film's 1975 release date. Spielberg's miraculous direction took advantage of every difficult production situation to create an all-time film masterwork that's always been as satisfying for its unforgettable characterizations, surprising humor and memorable atmosphere as it is a white-knuckle thriller about a great white marauding swimmers off the shores of Amity Island. As I write in my review of the terrific ""Jaws: Memories From Martha's Vineyard"" book a year ago, ""Jaws"" itself was a collaborative success, one that saw actors from Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw down to extras improvising their lines, giving the film a real, human center that we seldom see in modern filmmaking. The daily shooting schedule couldn't be mapped out all that far in advance since screenwriter Carl Gottlieb spent most nights working on the script with Spielberg - combined with our unpredictable and ever-changing weather here in southern New England, ""Jaws"" relied on the people making it so much that it's because of their efforts - as well as Spielberg who marshaled them all together - that the movie overcame its physical production struggles. In fact, had the movie not endured such a tumultous shoot, it's likely that ""Jaws"" never would've become the classic it did.Universal has produced a number of ""100th Anniversary"" Blu-Rays this year with remastered transfers - the results have ranged from superb to mediocre, but none have looked as brilliantly detailed as ""Jaws."" Restored from high-res 35mm original film elements, this is one of the most satisfying catalog releases the studio has produced on Blu-Ray to date: Bill Butler's cinematography is richly textured down to the finest detail, with warm colors and just a dazzling appearance that, even though I've watched the movie dozens of times, brings new background details to light with a clarity that I've never seen before in any format (there's also, thankfully, been no attempt here at ""tweaking"" the movie's color scheme like we've seen on too many BD releases over the years). The water has more depth, the Martha's Vineyard locations come into sharper focus, and just the faintest hint of some filtering is apparent on a transfer that is content to let the movie's natural cinematography speak for itself. It just looks phenomenal. On the audio side, viewers can select from the movie's original mono soundtrack as well as another, ""rethought"" 7.1 DTS MA stereo remix, both of which are more full-bodied than their DVD counterparts, though purists may still object to some of the alterations in the latter (i.e. the ""new"" gunshots at the end still sound closer to the controversial 5.1 DVD remix from a decade ago than they do the original mono recording; in other instances, though, the newer effects are much closer to the mono mix than the 2001 version. It's at least a noticeable improvement in that regard).Extra features are something of a letdown, mainly because they're almost all in non-anamorphic, 4:3 standard-definition and suffer from low bit-rates. The ""Jaws Archives,"" for example, is comprised of direct screen captures from the laserdisc, many of which look blurry and should've been cleaned up for high-def. Ditto for the deleted scenes, which appear to be filtered and ported straight off the LD (and the DVD). The eight-minute ""From The Set"" segment includes candid footage of the production's first few days on-location in Martha's Vineyard. Included here is priceless footage of Carl Gottlieb falling overboard and into the icy, early May waters of the Atlantic -- all for the abandoned first attempt Spielberg made at showing the discovery of Ben Gardner's boat. It's a wonderful segment and it's a shame it doesn't go on longer than it does.Laurent Bouzereau's dry but essential two-hour documentary from the `90s Signature Collection laserdisc is back, and it's been complemented by ""The Shark is Still Working,"" a 2007 labor of love doc from James Gelet, Jake Gove, Erik Hollander, and James-Michael Roddy that treads over ground previously traveled by numerous other behind-the-scenes docs, as well as profiles other aspects glossed over by them (such as an interview with Percy Rodriguez, who performed the voice over for the film's classic theatrical trailer). Unfortunately, the inferior visual presentation does no favors to the program, with heavy compression and ""jaggies"" present throughout its 103 minutes. Finally, the movie's original, primary theatrical trailer is also on-hand here, in a likewise poor, non-anamorphic standard-def presentation that's worse than its laserdisc appearance from years ago. Of course, given that the prior DVD didn't have trailers of any kind, it's at least an improvement in that regard (the movie's original teaser is a regrettable omission yet again).The sole new addition is an eight-minute look at Universal's restoration efforts on the picture, presented in HD, plus a digital copy and Ultraviolet copy. The disc is housed in a standard two-disc Elite case with one of Universal's nice 100 Years slipcovers; fans looking for more deluxe packaging ought to check out Best Buy's exclusive (though pricier) Digibook release, or the UK's Steelbook edition, which arrives in early September.Ultimately, Universal has done one of their crown jewels proud with a Blu-Ray that boasts one of the format's finest catalog transfers - not just from Universal, but any label. Spectacular! ("	5.0	JAWS Dazzles on Blu-Ray	2012-08-02	32	30	2
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	Before tampering with prehistoric predators, Spielberg gave us a giant fish.  That giant fish proves to this day to be one of the most horrifying and successfully bone chilling creatures in movie history.  I stand by the belief that `Jaws' is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It has all the components of a good thriller and satisfies the moviegoer from start to finish.The plot is simple.  Amity Island is being terrorized by a great white shark.  The new police chief Martin Brody is working very hard, despite the contempt from the town's mayor, to keep the beaches empty and the body count minimal.  After some heavy persuasion and a few lost lives the mayor, Larry Vaughn, finally agrees to hire Quint, a shark hunter, to kill this great white.  Accompanying Quint on his hunt is Brody as well as shark expert Matt Hooper.  The film really takes a turn for the superb as these men soon realize that they are indeed being hunted by the shark.  The madness sets in slowly and the film's finale is jaw dropping.I think that everyone who has ever seen `Jaws' can attest to the fact that the opening sequence with young Chrissie Watkins decides to skinny dip in the dangerous waters stands alone as one of the most heart racing and all around gut wrenching scenes in motion picture history.  I was a young boy the first time I saw `Jaws' and for what felt like years I was unable to swim in the deep end of my pool, always fearing I'd be tugged under in the same manor as young Watkins was.  This is the reason that `Jaws' is a classic.  It stays with you.  Sure, the shark looks fake when we finally have the chance to see it full on, but to be completely honest it's not the shark that scared us in the first place.  It was the idea of the shark, the undeniable knowledge that he was on his way to devour you.Steven Spielberg is a masterful director and he turns out yet another brilliant picture in `Jaws'.  The mood created by the lighting, the music and the camera angles (I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.  While not technically a `horror' film, `Jaws' sends more chills, more realistic and meaningful chills, than many quote-unquote `horror' films that litter our cinemas today.The cast is all at the top of their games here.  Roy Scheider manages to make Martin Brody relatable and real to the audience, and Murray Hamilton captures the pompous selfishness surrounding Larry Vaughn perfectly.  It's Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss though who take the cake so-to-speak in regards to electric performances.  Shaw is magnificent as Quint and Dreyfuss breathes so much life into Hooper.  I just love Dreyfuss and this performance is yet another reason why.`Jaws' may not be your favorite film but there is no denying its powerful presence.  Anyone who has ever seen this film must admit that it had a huge impact on how they viewed a leisure swim.  And who can forget that commanding score.  I still hear that fear inspiring composition every time I get in the water.	5.0	The fear will swallow you whole...	2008-01-04	1	0	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3EW4TUSY1HAXC	Andrew Mcdonald	"When I was much younger I could watch Jaws again and again.  I don't know how many Friday nights I spent rewatching Jaws but there must have been many.  That tone, dah-dah dah-dah, was ingrained in my mind.  Even though I knew exactly what would happen my adrenaline would always rise during certain parts of the film (the severed head, the girl being tossed around during the opening sequence, and Chief Brody's last desperate attempt to kill the monster shark, etc.)  This is essentially a perfect film where the characters are developed enough so that we care about them when they are put in peril.Bravo recently made a television program about ""100 scariest"" movies ever made and it ranked Jaws #1, putting it ahead of movies like Alien (#2), The Excorcist (#3), and Psycho (#4).  While many people would disagree that this is the scariest movie ever made, Jaws makes it to virtually everyone's scariest top 10 list.  You cannot possibly call yourself a horror film buff without owning this.But before you buy this, just one note of caution: Don't take this film too seriously.  The one sad thing about this film is that it was so effectively scary that it led to the deaths of many great whites around the world by ignorant people who viewed them as mindless killers.  In reality, these creatures do not actively seek to kill humans.  Most hate the taste of our bony bodies and, of the few times they do attack humans, it's usually because they mistake them for sea lions which they like to eat.With that in mind, sit back, relax and get ready to watch the greatest shark movie ever made."	5.0	If there is one bad thing that can be said about this film, it's that it caused the great white shark's population to plummet	2007-05-28	6	6	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z	Annie Van Auken	This 1983 VHS is a collectible as it was the movie's first home tape release. However, the full screen dub doesn't have Hi-Fi audio, only a linear mono track of lesser fidelity.Steven Spielberg's first and perhaps greatest masterpiece (of many) also epitomizes the summer blockbuster. His screen realization of JAWS (1975), Peter Benchley's bubblegum novel of a giant shark lurking in the waters off a fictional Massachusetts resort island, occurs during a July 4th holiday weekend.The three main characters are somewhat clich&eacute;d, but the talented actors portraying them manage to keep these men from being laughably cartoonish. Roy Scheider plays a transplant from NYC, the sheriff of an island town surrounded by water who's terrified of the ocean. Richard Dreyfuss is a boy genius icthyologist whose family wealth allows him to turn a hobby, the study of sharks, into a career. Robert Ryan is the crusty sea salt with a tragic past that comes closest to caricature; comparisons to Captain Ahab are apt.By story's conclusion, Ryan joins his prototype in death, the boy has become a man nearly eaten by the Great White he tried to poison, and Scheider learns he actually likes the sea. But what brings them to these ends is unforgettable cinema, and the reason this film was the blockbuster of 1975, a phenomenon that has yet to be equalled in public hysteria and popularity.John Williams' famous score is one of his best, subsequently imitated yet never topped. His music enhances on-screen action and helps turn what could've been an average monster movie into a screen classic.	5.0	"""Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods.

It's just when I use to see it on regular Television or on a Movie Channel, I heard a dubbing sound where Richard Dreyfuss is examining the first victim and when they cut to the part when he lifts her hand (on the DVD) he said &quot;Now this is what happens...&quot; (?) and then they cut to another piece of dialogue that doesn't flow with that scene. On Television or on a Movie Channel they would dub in &quot;And this is what happens when a shark attacks.&quot; I think that's what it said.

The reason I was disappointed, when so many people raved about it and considered it fantastic, was because I had the ""20th Anniversary"" laserdisc set, which had a documentary twice as long as the chopped-up version they stuck on the DVD, and even a more complete deleted scene selection. I rented this new 30th Anniversary to see if my suspicions were right, and found that this WAS basically everything on the LD put onto DVD; this is what they should have done five years ago! (I think that they are still missing one deleted scene, however: the short clip of Quint arriving at City Hall as the grieving parents walk out.) But they fall short of the mark by leaving out all the extras created for the 25th Anniversary edition: the production-note-style extras and the trailers--How could you leave out trailers? And instead they stick on a little nine minute featurette with the boast that it was never before seen in America. I am glad I only rented it and didn't purchase yet another release (okay, so I got the last one for free) of this classic film that deserves better.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A13T9FCU0J1GO5	Anthony Sunclades	The Film:Jaws, as most of us know is the story of a lonely shark looking for love ... or it is the story of a vicious eating machine with a penchant for the dramatic.  Hailed as an all time classic by most, this is the film that put Spielberg on the map.  The emotion from the characters jumps out and grabs you.  You can feel the fear and the sorrow in everyone.  Not much can be written about it here that has not already been seen elsewhere.  I would qualify this as a horror movie.  The dramatic tension and the build up creates a real presence of fear and horror, that today's special effects driven splatter fests cannot even dream of achievingAbout the DVD:While this is only a one disc edition, they still had room to include a making of featurette, deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers and a trivia game and a screen saver.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ABC8EYY6GKFO6	Ashley Knowles	Growing up, I too remember going to the movies, and then, 2 hours later, never looking at the ocean the same way ever again!  Jaws is, without any doubt, a true classic.  Anyone who has never seen this film, and I can probably count them all on one hand, needs to go out and see it ASAP.  Jaws personified the horror genre and perfected true fear in a film without even seeing the antagonist fully until about halfway through the film [the first half has the audience seeing through the shark's eyes].While I am happy to see this new restored version of the original 1975 classic coming out, I would have preferred to have seen this released as a box set, including all 4 Jaws Movies [Jaws, Jaws 2, Jaws 3-D, and Jaws: The Revenge].  While some may argue that only Jaws 2 was a decent sequel, and many have dissed parts 3 and 4, you cannot deny that all 4 films bought us all back to the theaters to see that shark do what he does best!I know for a fact that I was disappointed by the lack of extras on the releases of Jaws 3 and 4 [just film trailers only], and I would love to see this complete series, much like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, done up as a box set, and done right...FOR THE TRUE FANS!  All films had extras and television specials to get the fans pumped up to go to the cinema, and all of this stuff should have been on a fifth disc in a box set!  Why the movie studios never give the true fans what they truly want is beyond me.  I will still go out and buy this newest restoration of the cult classic, but as for me, I would have loved to see a box set.  Maybe in another 10 years or if the studios decide to reboot this series?	5.0	JAWS BOX SET	2012-06-25	4	0	4
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2VMT89TCSF105	"Ashtar Command ""Seeker"""	"""Jaws"" was something of a classic already when I was a kid. I didn't like the movie back then, and I still don't. My best friend was also very sceptical.For starters, ""Jaws"" isn't particularly exciting. With the exception of one or two scenes, you *know* when the shark is going to show up due to that loony tune tam-tam-tam-tam-tam-tam-tam... Most of the movie, there is no action at all. And when Great White started attacking Steven Spielberg's ridiculously small boat, I yawned. Cujo was more scary in that Stephen King movie. And Cujo was just a puppy back then, right?Perhaps me and my buddy were precocious or something, but we also criticized ""Jaws"" for being unrealistic. I doubt Great White Sharks can become this large. I mean, he's the size of a killer whale! Basking sharks can become very large, but they are harmless. (Yes, we knew about basking sharks. Common knowledge, alright?) And why would a guy looking for the world's most vicious shark use such a ridiculously small boat?Naturally, there are several sequels, including one called ""Jaws 3D"". I never saw it as a kid. Maybe it was X-rated or something. I wonder why? Apparently, you needed a special kind of specs to watch it. Since I'm near-sighted, I would probably just have gotten a bad headache anyway.I know that I'm in a minority here. One of my workmates (let's call him Happy Chappie) actually likes ""Jaws"", claiming it's a real classic and one of the best films ever made. Chappie says I'm not getting it. I guess I don't. ""Jaws"" didn't scare me even as a kid. ""Alien"" is a real horror movie. It scared me as an adult, even when I was watching it the second time on TV, with commercial breaks! I suppose I'm more afraid of xenomorphs in my closet than Great White Sharks in my bath tub. Or something.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AI46E73DWKD2B	BackToGood	"JAWS (1975), IMHO, is the best film in the 1970s. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! And I'm not just coming up with this. I've thought this to be the case for a very long time. Spielberg's timeless tale of a New England island terrorized by a maneating shark is the seminal Hollywood blockbuster. It's got something that EVERYONE can latch onto and enjoy...a wealth of great characters, suspense, drama, thrills, action, adventure. The genius of Steven Spielberg's early works is that he managed to make us part of the action, the same way that Alfred Hitchcock did, but I dare say that Spielberg upped the ante quite a bit because films of the 70s had a palpability and realism that the primary filmmaking career of Hitchcock (the 40s and 50s) just weren't allowed to possess. I mean, as much as I love NORTH BY NORTHWEST and Cary Grant's performance in that film, I cannot see myself as upper crust classy businessman Roger Thornhill and envision going through the incredulous situation that he went through. I just reviewed Spielberg's debut masterwork DUEL and can TOTALLY see myself in David Mann's situation, as can a LOT of people!To a somewhat lesser extent (but not by very much), perhaps many of us cannot see ourselves in the EXACT situtation that Chief Martin Brody (essayed perfectly by Roy Scheider) is in in JAWS, but many of us can IDENTIFY with Brody and the Amity residents as they live in fear of the dreaded maneater waiting in the waters for them. ""Fear"" is a running emotion throughout JAWS; the results of the shark's actions (immediate and after-the-fact) are scarier than seeing the creature itself. Layers of character are revealed throughout JAWS. The fisherman Quint (brilliantly played by Robert Shaw, who should have received Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) starts out turns tough, rough, and seemingly without humanity, then blows us away with his USS Indianapolis story and we see a different side of this man. Oceanographer Matt Hooper (played with perfect aplomb and humor by Richard Dreyfuss) seems like nerdy pushover at first, but shows that he can verbally go toe to toe with the likes of Quint and the town Mayor, and shows major courage in daring to go face to face with the deadly shark in the shark cage. The 3 men represent different sides of masculinity and at various points in the film, their character traits rub off on each other to an extent. Is there any other movie in film history with 3 such well-rounded, diverse LEAD characters that complement each other so well?...Nope!Modern filmmakers of summer movies ought to watch early Spielberg just to see how to handle not just lead actors, but also supporting characters and extras as well. Not to mention to see how to perform ""on location"" shooting. The cinematography in JAWS puts you right there along with the characters. And Spielberg films (especially his earlier ones) are editing masterworks; no wasted shots and the perfectly timed cuts to accentuate the action and tension. Most newer summer blockbuster type films with shooting on location don't seem to have this quality; maybe it's the focus more on using CGI (even good CGI still can't mask the fact that it's CGI!) even in realistic settings; whatever it is, I rarely ever get the sense of really being in that place when I'm watching newer films. Whenever I watch JAWS, I feel like I'm right there with these guys battling that shark!The story of JAWS is so simple, yet is told with such forthright confidence and clarity that it comes across a lot deeper than many more ""complex"" films. The leads Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss all rule in their roles, but at the same time, they don't try to outdo each other or the ""lesser"" actors in the film. The 2 major supporting actors, Lorraine Gary as Mrs. Brody and Murray Hamilton as the town mayor are just as authentic as the main characters. The woman who plays the grieving Mrs. Kitner shines in her brief scene (the most emotional, authentic scene of the entire film). As impressive as Spielberg was with the pulse-pounding seagoing shark-chasing moments in the last act, I was equally impressed with the way he incorporated and handled these ""little"" moments, which are a huge reason why JAWS still holds up all these years later. I've found over the years that when everything seems ""real"", no matter how simple the story, a lot more can be gained from the moviegoing experience. And that is a testament to how much effort and work was put into the process.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1V8OYLDDQERDH	Bakuryuu Tyranno	"Literally, the only remote credability I can see from this movie is Spielberg directing.Professional move script writers agreed with me that the plot of this movie is very thin, and here's a perfect example.Basically, the plot goes round in circles with people (who don't even qualify as minor characters) getting killed off by a shark while nobody cares... I mean, knows that this is happening. But THEN, later on someone dies in front of everybody. So because they all saw this, nobody goes in the ocean at that beach anymore and the movie ends, right? Well, no. Because this is only about 40-50 minutes in, three idiots begin hunting the shark with a boat, despite the fact that nobody with any semblence of a brain would be swimming near that beach. In other words, not only does the plot make no sense, but THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF OF THIS MOVIE IS FILLER.By far the worst thing about this is that it is an adaptation of a novel (written by Peter Benchley, if I'm not mistaken). This means that Peter Benchley actually managed to drag out this boring, black-and-white, thinly-plotted storyline, without characters* anyone actually cares about, for several hundred pages. Well, either that of Pter Benchley wrote a GOOD novel and it got turned into this garbage.* = well, okay, there were about thirty-five minutes in which Chief Brody was non-boringBy far the wrost thing about the Jaws ""fandom"" is that they claim every movie remotely involving sharks (or in some cases, any marine animal) eating people is ""a Jaws rip-off"" yet they completely ignore that another shark movie came out about six years or so before this abomination. So this can't possibly be a ""rip-off"" of a movie that came out before it, but a movie that came out thirty years after this MUST BE a ""rip-off""?This movie is only popular because people flock to stupidity.

For those of you who have been watching even the 30th anniversary collection edition, there is no compare!  The visual scope of this movie is stunning in this format, and Universal has taken great steps to ensure it is top of the line in the restoration process.  Spielberg is even pround and he tells you so!  I just can't tell you how good it looks.  You have to see it for yourself!  There really hasn't been anything new in terms of the special features in this version, other than the ""Shark is Still Working"" special feature that should have been released on it's own years ago!  It is a very good retrospective on the movie, not to mention adding a lot to the otherwise known ""Making of Jaws"" that is once again included.  ""The Shark is Still Working"" brings more of the human element on the making of the movie, and actually shows more than the ""Making of"" feature in some respects.  It brings in people such as the actor who plays Sean Brody, as well as more location video and pictures.  It also gets more in-depth in some respects.  And none other than Martin Brody himself narrates it!  I was very impressed.  The ""Making of Jaws"" is also a good feature, but I still like the orginal, watered down, version of that feature which appears on the 25th anniversary edition.  Less talk, more action.  The other feature on the Blu Ray that is cool is the ""From the Set"" feature, which was the orginal ""behind the scenes"" shot in 1974.  Other features on the Blu Ray include production photos, the marketing of Jaws, Jaws Phenonemon, and trailer, all which were on previous versions.  I just wish there was a Directors Commentary, or at least someone's commentary!  That would've been the ideal package for me!  I'm a ""behind the scenes"" type of viewer, especially to the classics, but the main meat of this whole thing is the actual movie itself.  It is a classic, now restored to the upmost quality of sound and video resolution!  Does it make the shark look more fake?  No.  But it does bring you in and grip you like it always did, but now with a little more intensity.  Enjoy... I did, and will continue..."	5.0	The Classic Continues...!	2012-08-20	2	2	0

Also, the picture quality is excellent.  And I just noticed how necessary the widescreen  actually is with this movie because you would miss a lot of the action  without widescreen.  We all know the movie which definitely stands up to  the tests of time.  The performances are great, particularly that of Robert  Shaw whose Quint is portrayed as not-quite-sane but not totally over the  line.  And does anyone not tense up when they hear John Williams' music and  know that the shark is in the area once again?  This is definitely one of  the best movies of all time, definitely one to buy and keep.  I just wish I  could give this DVD 5 stars, but for a 25th anniversary release I really  expected more.  What about more outtakes?  What about an alternate audio  with commentary by the director and one of the stars?  And, BTW, why didn't  we get a summer theatrical release for the 25th anniversary?

This is a  riviting tale superbly told, with excellent cinematography and special  effects, and a scary soundtrack that builds the edge of mystery to a  crescendo each time it musically announces the shark's appearence.The idea for the movie is deceptively simple; a great white shark with a  fond taste for the sweet taste of human flesh is patrolling the water off  Amity Island (read Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard)and terrorizing the  summer tourist population. Inject into this some interesting and novel  subplots regarding a burned-out city cop and unlikely undersung hero, a  brainy, affable but basically misunderstood young marine biologist, and a  wonderfully crusty old mariner turned professional shark fisherman and you  have the recipe for an entertaining rollercoaster ride.This movie is a  modern classic, one with a young Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the  late  Robert Shaw. Watching their characters interact is an afternoon's  entertainment well deserved, one that is durable and repeatable. It also is  one that translates very well into the DVD mode.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	This 1975 blockbuster by Steven Spielberg became the first real summer blockbuster film. Having grossed about $260 million at the box office, it opened the doors for the epic summer film. Notmany of the films in years since, has been able to equal the sheer brilliance of Jaws. Roy Scheider stars as a local sheriff who's quaint little coastal/tourist town is suddenly in terror as a great white shark begins attacking swimmers at the beach. Incomes Richard Dreyfuss, who plays a shark specialist, who tries to help the sheriff. Robert Shaw is also on hand as a local fisherman who wants to hunt the killer down and kill it once and for all. There are numerous scenes that are classic and incredibly memorable. The shark itself looks undeniably real and is scary as hell. There are scenes that are destined to make your heart beat faster and your pulse to race. Spielberg executes it so well, and gets his actors to deliver such real performances, that it all comes off as very real and believeable. There is nothing more scarier than when it's real and hits close to home. Know what I mean?. This is one of the finest thrillers ever made hands down. It spawned a pretty decent sequel, but then went downhill(fast)with Parts 3 and 4. Jaws is still one of the best movies ever made. Nothing can match the terrifying theme music either.

If you already have a previous edition of it, then you are fine with the one that you have. But if you do not have ""Jaws"" already on DVD, then you are in for a real treat.This edition features some excellent bonus features, including a two hour long documentary on the making of the movie, as well as a nicely put together scrapbook of pictures and quotes from the cast and crew. But, let's be honest, you could put out ""Jaws"" as a bare bones DVD and it would still be mandatory.And that's because after thirty plus years the film still manages to have the same visceral reaction as it did upon it's release. It's still a scary, taut, perfectly pieced together thriller. And on this DVD it looks as sharp and crisp as it ever has, and the soundtrack is well mixed and put together.So, if for some reason, you do not own ""Jaws"", this is a must purchase for you, because films rarely get better than this."	5.0	I'm talking about working for a living, sharking.	2007-11-29	4	4	0

Very well put together and has a few extras that are nice. The joys of us getting to let our daughters watch the movie for the first time is truely priceless. In relation to that apparently the back of the couch is a seat also since that is where our kids ended up about half way through the movie. A bit of caution though...In a certain scene a woman (Christy?) goes for a skinny dip swim and in most versions of the movie it is so dark you can't see anything. In this version it seems lit up a bit more and lets just say you could tell she really was fully nude. Just thought i'd add that since I didn't remember that from when I watched it so many years ago.	5.0	Ah the joys of Jaws	2011-12-17	3	2	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A32YXQLKMCR5FS	bernard mungeam	For the 20 years since i have been watching films, one film has stood out from the rest.That film is JAWS.People always talk about Star Wars being the mother of all films, well if thats the mother then JAWS is the Grand daddy.When first watching it at the age of 5 i just loved the shark scenes but over the years i have learnt to appreciate the finer aspects of the film and the attention to detail to which Spielberg and his crew went to.Everyone knows by now that what makes the film so frightning is the music by John Williams(SUPERMAN,JURRASIC PARK)and what you dont see. Remember using your imagination is the best tool to scare yourself.In my opinion JAWS is is near enough the perfect film.Firstly you have the 3 main characters who are beutifly constructed. Roy Schieder is so right for his part and  was born for the role as the chief of police in Amity island.One of my faverite lines is 'Its only an island if you look at it from the water'.Hooper and Quint although sharing the same passion have incredibly conrasting personalities which makes their screen time together all that more memorable.All 3 characters have very different relationships with each other and this is shown by what they call one another.Hooper calls them Martin and Quint where as Quint calls them Chief and 'Hooper yer idiot'.On the other hand Brody uses the names Quint and  well this is interesting because only on the odd occasion does Brody use Hoopers name, the only occasion i recall is 'Let Hooper take a turn'.Strange but true.What sets JAWS apart from other films of similar type is that the film builds up to a grand finale.In deep Blue Sea you see the the shark in the first 5 minutes need i say more.As you readers may well know the making of JAWS didn't go to plan, but that in my view wasn't a bad thing because they had to work round this and develop the characters on land making them more humain and normal people whom which we could relate to. I myself ended up really liking the 3 characters in different ways.The way Brody was always worrying,trying to do the right thing and him hating the water was a terrific combination.Hooper who although rich ,really did love and was dedidacted to his work. All he wanted was to be given a chance to explain himself and put his views across and the Mayor and Quint didn't like this.While on the Mayor he plays a very good part as a stubborn son of a a bitch.Quint in many ways is also stubborn.He is very intimidating and has a strong presence around the room in the the very first scene we see him and ihe Indianapolis classic scene. Without doubt that second scene i have just mentioned is a show stopper and is acted masterifly by Shaw.The character Ben Gardner who helped write that scene has a small part in the movie and it is his head that pops out of the hull of his boat. That was probably the bit of the movie which made me jump most first time around.What made me die with laughing was on a documentary about JAWS the character who plays Ben Gardner talks about that scene.He talks about how smart and tidy the shark was to leave just his head by the hull of the boat and the sarcastic manner at which he says this is too funny to put into words.I recommend you see that documentary if you are an avid Jaws fan.Thats about it ive spoken my mind in the last half hour and i hope you enjoyed my review.Thank you for making the film, Jaws Mr Spielberg is the best piece of work you have ever done.In fact its just the best piece of work.	5.0	Jaws at its best	2000-11-24	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1BJOEQSRX2IBM	"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer"""	Spielberg took a simple story and stretched it to limitless proportions and along the way created one of the highest grossing films of all time. Along with 'Casablanca' this is one of cinema's greatest 'happy accidents'.  Spielberg began production without a finished script or an ending and  without a fully operational main character ('Bruce' the shark). But still  he managed to create one of the most shockingly suspenseful films of all  time using the Hitchcock method 'less is more'. The story is simple, a huge  'great white' terrorizing the small summer island resort of Amity. And it's  three very different main characters; the sheriff (Roy Scheider), the  oceanographer and shark expert (Richard Dreyfuss) and the crusty old shark  hunter (Robert Shaw) who all go out and try to hunt down the leviathan but  instead become the hunted. Scheider and Dreyfuss are both excellent in  their roles but Robert Shaw is unforgettable as the eccentric Quint, a  Captain Ahab for the cynical 70's. Shaw's narration of the 'USS  Indianapolis' story is one of the most frightening moments of the film. But  still the best and most suspense-filled moments of the film are the  shark-hunting sequences on the boat. Nail-biting suspense is given an  adventurous air thanks to John William's brilliant score. A technical  marvel with brilliant editing and cinematography. John William's score  became one of the most famous of all time, simple but extremely efficient,  it also informs us of the shark's presence. 'Jaws' is a  money-making-crowd-pleasing machine that also happens to be one of the best  movies of all time. Extras: Peter Bencheley, the original author of 'Jaws'  appears on the beach as a news anchorman. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 10!	5.0	The Ultimate Adrenaline Rush!	2000-07-24	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1AM8S4Z92R8NL	Bill Brunner	Steven Spielberg's second feature film (and one of his most challenging projects), Jaws was THE blockbuster event of 1975. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, this very effective thriller set box office records higher than any previous film....and made beachgoers ask themselves if that dip in the ocean was really necessary.Screenwriters Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb (who also have roles in the movie) wisely jettison the melodramatic aspects of the source novel and focus on the core of the story.It's summer in Amity, a sleepy Long Island town that depends on &quot;summer dollars&quot; from thousands of tourists who come to stay in seaside cottages (the summer dinks, they are called). When a young girl goes skinny dipping in the nearby sea and is fatally attacked by a shark, Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is coerced by the mayor and town council to keep the incident under wraps. He reluctantly does so, though he will regret it, for a few days later, the shark claims another victim, a young boy named Alex Kintner.Finally convinced that there is a shark out there, Amity's politicians and citizens take action...but not wisely. When shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) bids for a contract to catch and kill the shark, the town elders &quot;take it under advisement&quot; and the shark hunt becomes a wild free-for-all seagoing circus.When shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), called in by Chief Brody to help in the investigation and shark hunt, arrives and sees the shark (which he identifies as a tiger shark) caught by local fishermen, he examines the remains of the first victim. What he deduces is chilling: the deadly creature prowling out to sea is a great white shark.Jaws is one of those rare movie adaptations that is better than its source novel. The screenplay is crisp and taut, yet with enough light moments and scenes of sometimes wry humor that ease the ever increasing tension, particular when Brody, Hooper and Quint set out to hunt the great white shark....becoming the hunted in the process. Spielberg, only 27 at the time, overcame the difficulties of shooting a movie on the water and dealing with a balky mechanical shark (nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot;). Jaws also put composer John Williams on the map with movie audiences with his now-famous &quot;shark motif&quot; and would earn him his second Oscar for Best Score.The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD is excellent. The movie is presented in letterbox format, and the sound and image are above average. The documentary on the making of the film is also first-rate. All in all, a must-get for Spielberg (and action film) fans. --.	5.0	Something to chew on	2004-11-06	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3Y6GNHCOER58	Billie Mann	"This is the movie that really reminds me of high school; it came out the summer before I started my senior year, the summer I turned 18.""Jaws"" was the ""Psycho"" of my generation. I don't apply this term to ""Halloween"", another equally scary film of the '70's involving pointy things that can kill you, because ""Jaws"" and ""Psycho"" have too very important elements in common with each other, and ""Halloween"" somehow seems to fall into a different horror genre.Both ""Psycho"" and ""Jaws"" are about ordinary people doing something ordinary and enjoyable, two activities one would normally never find dangerous: showering, and splashing about in the shallows of the ocean.I don't remember, but I can't imagine that this movie made people very happy whose livelihood depended on beach tourism, as it was released in the early summer.Seeing ""Psycho"" made many people afraid to take showers (including actress Janet Leigh, who starred in it and claimed she never took another shower afterwards), and ""Jaws"" made many people afraid to swim in the ocean. It scared the hell out of us teenagers and made for endless pranks at the beach that summer (hey, I was 17 when it came out in the theater, what can I say)? Two of my friends would take turns pretending to be an approaching shark in the water, using his hand as a fin, while hmming the classic ""Jaws"" soundtrack, or pretending to be the first victim in the film (minus the screaming, which upset the lifeguards), thrashing and flailing about in the waves as if being attacked and dragged underwater.""Jaws"" was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster. It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star). It spawned one of the most classic and oft-quoted lines in film history: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat."" It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.I hadn't seen this film in several years, having seen it umpteen times when it first came out, and several times on VHS, as I owned an old VHS copy of it. But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full-screen only old tape).Suffice to say that when the head pops out of the boat...I still jump just as much as I did the first time I saw it in the theater.The ultimate, and best, of the ""Scary Summer Movie"" genre.This ""Special Edition 30th Anniversary Edition"" (widescreen, of course) of the film includes some great special features such as deleted scenes and outtakes, a never-before-available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two-hour documentary of the making of the film. The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot; I can certainly see why the shot of Robert Shaw's clog-sheathed foot stepping out of a big black car with the words ""QUINT"" in white and a white outline drawing of a shark on its door were cut!

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A25Q6YSL31AQM	Bill Kelly	A simple story about a New England resort community that is terrorized by a giant killer shark.  Half of the movie focuses on the shark attacks, human reactions, and character development between Brody, Hooper, Quint, Mayor Vaughn, and so forth.  The second half of the movie focuses on human intervention - Brody, Hooper, and Quint try to kill the shark.  In between there is Oscar-winning film editing, sound, and a now-classic score by maestro John Williams.  'Jaws' was unjustly ignored at Oscar time, especially for screenplay, acting (Scheider, Dreyfuss, and especially Shaw), and director Spielberg.  Roger Ebert was right when he reviewed this movie - &quot;In keeping the Great White offscreen, Spielberg was employing a strategy used by Alfred Hitchcock throughout his career. 'A bomb is under the table, and it explodes: That is surprise,' said Hitchcock. 'The bomb is under the table but it does not explode: That is suspense.'&quot; Spielberg is doing the same thing for most of this movie. The audience doesn't see the shark, but the underlying result of its actions. So, for the audiences who claim this is simply slow-paced fluff where the shark is hardly seen for about three-quarters of the film, put Mr. Ebert's review of the film into your pipe and smoke it.	5.0	The ultimate antithesis of horror films.	2001-10-20	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ARFBRSE35ZJ6A	Bill W. Dalton	Back in 1974, I was browsing the paperback book shelves at my local supermarket when I noticed the very intriguing cover of a novel called simply Jaws.  I picked it up and thought it might be interesting, so I bought it.  That evening I lay on the couch, eating peanuts, and started reading it.  I finished the peanuts quickly, but I didn't stop reading the book until I had finished it, too, much later that night!The movie came out the next year, but I didn't go see it, despite all the hype and its huge success at the box-office.  I had read the book and I knew the movie wouldn't be as good as the book.  They never were, I thought.But when I finally saw Jaws, uncut on pay-TV, I realized I was wrong--the movie was better than the book!  The book had a love affair between Hooper and Brody's wife, an unexplored underworld involvement on Amity Island, and Hooper was killed by the great white shark at the end.  Not to mention that the shark just rolled over and died of its wounds just in time to spare Brody's life.  Such an ending in the book was believable, but not very exciting.  Spielberg wisely deleted all these extraneous elements and cut right to the chase, and made a taut, suspenseful, exciting film, one that is enjoyable time after time!And this 25th anniversary DVD edition is great!  The menus are easy to read and use against a scene of the deep blue ocean, there's commentary by Spielberg, Benchley, and others about the making of the movie,  deleted scenes, outtakes, photos, trivia game, and more!  This is a superb DVD, and should be in the collection of every Spielberg/Jaws fan!	5.0	Don't go in the water!	2001-02-17	1	1	0

However,  this wonderful piece of action/horror preceded it by two years, which I guess makes it the  Grandfather.The performances are wonderful.  The action is riveting.  And even though the shark definitely looks pretty fake sometimes,  it still  manages to scare the bejeezus out of you.  I still have a hard time going  swimming!This was the first movie to ever break the $100 million dollar  mark,  a feat which today is standard for most summer movies.  But when you  consider that an adult ticket was less than three bucks at the time,  that  makes it a bit more impressive.This movie broke all previous box office  records,  and it held those records for two years until audiences were  swept into that galaxy far, far away.	5.0	The grandfather of the Blockbuster	2000-02-22	1	0	1

I remember the absolute mania surrounding this Spielberg classic. People were suddenly terrified to swim in the ocean or even in lakes. You couldn't go anywhere without getting into a conversation about this movie. I saw it at the theater and was mesmerized. Here was Moby Dick for the modern age. A monster shark, intent on feasting on the inhabitants of tiny Amity island has begun snacking on swimmers. A local sherrif named Brody (Roy Scheider) slowly realizes that it's a much bigger problem than just a few random shark attacks. Enter Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) the marine expert, who first shows the seriousness of what they are dealing with. Meanwhile, the mayor has decided that there's nothing to worry about. He's more concerned with the thousands of tourists who will be arriving at the beaches for Labor Day weekend, and the money they will spend. Several deaths later, a local fisherman named Quint (Robert Shaw) offers to hunt down and kill the beast for a price. This brings Brody, Hooper, and Quint together for the greatest water adventure filmed to that point. It's man vs. Great white in a struggle for survival and supremacy. Not to mention the battle of wills between our three unlikely heroes. JAWS is a genuine masterpiece of suspense and horror.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3GKMQFL05Z79K	blackaciddevil	Jaws tells the story of a bunch of beachgoers, on Amity Island, who get attacked by a giant man-eating Great White shark. This causes the local police chief to round up a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter to go on the hunt for the thing. What happens during the course of that hunt is going to surprise you.Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, Jaws was directed by Stephen Spielberg(as you all know) and, after viewing the movie, I believe it is one of Spielberg's biggest achievements in filmmaking. Even though, when you watch The Making of Jaws featurette, he expresses the fact that it was very difficult to make the picture. Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production(mostly dealing with the mechanical shark for the film), going over budget and past schedule. The movie itself was well-recieved by critics and fans alike. It was the highest grossing film of its' time, in 1975.  The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint(my favorite character out of the whole movie), Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. It spawned  three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, with varying success. It's been imitated many, many times through the years in different movies about sharks but not with as much success as Jaws.Honestly, I've always been more interested in Spielberg's Science-Fiction movies(like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extraterrestrial, Jurassic Park, and War of the Worlds) but this movie has me looking up his older movies no matter what genre of movie to watch. Jaws is a great movie and one that should be viewed by everyone at some point. It truly is worthy of its' accolades.	5.0	Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)...one of Spielberg's Greatest Achievements!	2012-07-03	1	0	1

But when a flesh-eating Great White shark enters the town's beaches, it is up to the town sherriff (Roy Scheider in perhaps his best performance outside of ""The French Connection""), a geeky graduate scientist (the always admirable Richard Dreyfuss), and the town fish gamer (played by Robert Shaw, the film's best performance by far) to save the day.Spielberg plays the tension like a sneaky household cat ready to pounce on a silly toy. He knows exactly when his temptations will take over and when he will strike, but the audience is left to guess in fear as the shark terrorizes the small island. What makes ""Jaws"" so great is not just the fine soundtrack by John Williams, the special effects and the lovable shark machine ""Bruce"", but the fact that it allows the childish fears in all of us to creep up on us and still make the hair on our necks tingle.Spielberg would later create even more popular and elaborate masterpieces such as ""E.T"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but for those who truly enjoy film and its impact on an audience, ""Jaws"" can certainly bite with the best of them."	4.0	Deep and personal	2004-11-20	0	0	0

Bringing Steven Spieldberg to this review is wise, after finishing Duel, he came to this after reading the novel by Peter Benchly, they decide to make the movie, Peter Benchly with the screenplay, Robert Shaw makes the part on the spot, Richard Dreyfuss who implied to have the part of Hooper that was originally given to someone else, got the part, and after thinking about it Roy Shcieder took the part of the Sea struck Rode Island Police Chief.  These guys were remarkable in this film, they were too real asuming the coincidence of this happenening never, they were also extremly funny especially Drefuss and Shaw's little quarries....&quot;Hooper!&quot; it just cracks me up, and above all John Williams terrifying score, the movie would have only been half as scary without the music, in which became one of many memorable symbols to the movie, 4 stars from Leonard Maltin, srtictly by book speaking I agree 110%, yet out of boundaries I give this one 5 stars.	5.0	Dun Dun - Dun Dun.	2001-09-03	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	'Jaws', directed by Steven Spielberg was released in '75 and still stands as one of the biggest box office money makers of all-time. Now, some thirty-one years later it probably looks a little hokey compared to modern high action state-of-the-art special effects. Fortunately this film has much more to offer than sweaty palms or an occassional gasp and scream. The real strength of this film lies in the teaming together Richard Dryfuss, Roy Scheider and the ever elusive Rober Shaw as the three valiant souls willing to way anchor and search for the great white killer shark terrorizing the little seaside resort community of Amity. Watching their transformation from initial hostilities slowly evole into deep mutual respect is the best part of the film. Their constant banter is hilarious, insightful and packed with great quotable dialogue.If you don't like scary films just pretend the shark isn't there and watch for the great acting!Also a wonderful performance by Murray Hamiliton as Amity's Mayor.	4.0	"""Oh Boys', I Think He's Come Back For His Noon Feeding"""	2006-09-02	4	2	2
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3G09DPVXZCUA	Brian	I think pretty much everybody can agree that this movie started the whole Blockbuster thing and also the big monster genre in general.  It has spawned countless monster clones that have not touched this movie at all.  After 25 years it is still a chillingly good piece of work.  It hasnt lost any of its edge. Even the shark looks surprissinly good for its age.  When Jaws showed on tv a while ago I wasnt that excited. I thought maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it.  Boy was I wrong!  I watched the whole thing. not budging from my chair, my eyes glued to the television.  The plot I think everybody knows so Im not gonna go over it.  But If you expect it to show the shark in five minutes of the oppening credits. then you might want to skip it.  naaa watch it anyways to see how monster flicks should be done.  Without flashy special effects but with a little something called tension and suspense.The dvd is very good and a staple for any collection.  The picture is very clear for its age and the colors are bright.  Its got several trailers which are interesting to see since they are after all 25 years old.  Also included is a interesting documentary which shows how they got the shark to work.  Trust me its a must buy!	5.0	The movie that set the standard	2000-10-23	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A34R8Q9R9GSG6M	"Brittany Cable ""Breeze"""	Jaws was the movie that made Speilberg a great hit.  The suspence, fear, and brilliance it provided made everyone love it.  My parents liked it, but when I watched it with them, I could only ask, &quot;Where is the realism?&quot;The story of Jaws is simple: A Great White is terrorizing the citiens of Amity Island, and the mayor is too heartless to stop it, so three men must go out and face it.  Thrill scenes, screaming, blood, and all-around good qualities for a suspence movie could help Jaws if they would only give a little bit of thought to what a Great White really is like.The beginning of the movie was realistic.  It was dark, the girl was swimming like a fish, and the shark was active.  She was eaten, and was perfectly clear to be eaten.  And I suppose the fishing boat later on, since found in the dark, MAY have held some realism, since Great Whites will ram boats.  But most of the movie made me just want to shake my head.First off, would you be dumb enough to go into waters containing a Great White just because the mayor told you to?  I don't think I would.  Would you allow your kid into the water?  Probably not.  Heck, would you even go to the beach?  If you knew the danger, most likely not.  The behavior of the people in the movie was a little unrealistic.  The panicking while attacked was realistic.  Still going into the water was not.  People can be clueless, yes, but that bad?But the worse of all must be the shark behavior.  First off, Great White Sharks live in Australia.  Amity Island is up in New England, USA.  What's wrong with this picture?  Jaws may have been a rogue shark, but since when does a tropical shark survive in cold water?  The conditions may have been just good enough for the shark, but it is fairly unlikely.  Also, the movie said Great Whites were most active at night.  Then how come 50% of the attacks and action takes place during the day?  Explaination, please!Continuing on, Jaws gets shot who-knows-how-many-times during the last few scenes.  May I ask why his strength did not diminish?  Why didn't other sharks (yes, smaller sharks do live in that area) come along and at least try to chomp on him?  In fact, are there any fish there at all?  It seemed as if Jaws was the only fish around and that he only ate people -- Very unrealistic.  Believe it or not, sharks normally do not attack people unless provoked or if you are bleeding/swimming.  &quot;Jaws&quot; sort of kept to that concept, thankfully, but the amount of shark attacks within a few days was a little much for me.  Thank Goodness the shark was given a bit of cunning, but after bleeding for a while, I think the shark should've given out.There were also a few not-so-important-yet-still-annoying little things.  First off, during the last few scenes, the researcher declared that he couldn't move the boat's wheel.  The next scene, he was moving it fine.  Also, the ship would be sinking in one scene, then not be as far underwater in the next.  At some points the shark clearly looks fake, though I guess you can't expect much from the 1970s.Ultimately, I guess I don't have much to say.  &quot;Jaws&quot; did a good job with suspence and action, but realism lacked, causing its ratings to drop in my eyes.  If you want a suspenceful movie, look no further than this.  If you want a realistic yet suspenceful movie, I advise staying away.	3.0	Suspenceful, but where is the realism?	2004-03-26	17	2	15
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	Steven Spielberg's breakout film, Jaws is the quintessential summer blockbuster, creating all the horror, thrills, suspense, and special effects you would expect from such a film. Not excessively violent or gruesome like traditional horror films, Jaws nonetheless manages to create an icy frost in every viewer's veins. Based on the true story of a great white shark which terrorized the shores of New Jersey in the summer of 1916, Jaws is an ingenious adaptation of Peter Benchley's best-selling novel inspired by the incident. Jaws tells the story of man's eternal struggle against nature, a story so compelling it captures the imagination of every generation who hears it - from 1916 to 1975 to the present day...Jaws takes place in the small New England beach resort of Amity Island, the perfect summer getaway for Northeastern tourists. But this Normal Rockwell community paradise is about to be turned upside down. Late one night, a young couple decides to go swimming. But when the woman's mangled body is washed ashore the next morning, it's clear to local authorities that she isn't a typical drowning victim. The medical examiner informs Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) that the woman could have been the victim of a shark attack, but Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) refuses to speculate, fearing that public knowledge of a shark attack would kill the local economy.When another shark attacks occurs, this time is broad daylight, the incident draws shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to the area. Working with Chief Brody, Hooper postulates that a great white shark is responsible for the attacks, and the swimming population is in great danger. Meanwhile, a shark hunter named Quint offers to find and kill the shark for $10,000, but Mayor Vaughn believes that price is too high. More and more beach combers will have to be slaughtered before he'll agree to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem, and when the authorities finally decide to go after the great white, the really danger is only beginning...With brilliant direction and state-of-the-art special effects (satisfactory even by today's standards), Jaws is a true edge-of-your-seat thriller wrought with suspense. The unknown is masterfully woven throughout the movie with a crescendo effect that keeps the audience guessing until the end. Like any good story, the shark is never shown in the opening scenes. Instead, the movie begins with an attack in near darkness. The shark is alluded to... Even when someone is attacked in daylight, the audience is only privy to an exposed fin and the blood of the victim as it spreads across the water. This approach effectively combines fear of the unknown with the already present fear of the shark to create a chilling atmosphere for movie goers. Is it any wonder then that Jaws was a blockbuster hit?It's this high level of suspense that I like most about Jaws. Like a fine murder novel, the scenes draw the audience into the setting, forcing you to identify with the characters. In due time, you begin to fear for your own life. After watching Jaws, you may not swim at the beach ever again... And any movie that can have that type of effect must be good! That's why Jaws ranks as a definite must-see film...The DVD Report	5.0	You'll never swim in the ocean again...	2005-04-19	2	2	0

The acting is top notch, from the three leads (Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw) to the supporters, which includes Murray Hamilton as the mayor of  Amity whom you will wan't to slap by the end.  Spielberg's direction can't  be beat (even if the limited use of the shark was unintentional).  And I  don't care what naysayers claim, the shark in the first movie does not look  fake -- forget the sequels, they never happened.

It scarred me for life! I have always hated the ocean and been terrified of boats ever since then. I am terrified of large waves and salt water. I blame this all on seeing Jaws at such a young age. It's a super movie, mind you, and I can easily sit through it (and often do), but I can't bear to go to the ocean.I asked my mom why she didn't take me to see Sweeney Todd when I was also 3 - but she said I was too young. I'd rather she took me there - that way I would at least be scared of eating meat and loud operatic theatre - a much healthier phobia, I'm sure.	4.0	Scarred me for life!	2001-07-15	1	0	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AE42JLYPXUI45	"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)"""	In 1975, Steven Spielberg had taken Peter Benchley's novel entitled, JAWS, and made it the one motion picture that will continue to be one of the best films in all of Horror/Suspense history.The residents of AMITY ISLAND, NEW YORK are quite happy. They live on an island complete with a beautiful beach. Some of the young residents have a party on the beach. Two of those kids, a male resident, and a girl named, CHRISSY WATKINS (played by Susan Backlinie) leave the party to go swimming. As Chrissy strips down to being completely nude and swims off into the ocean, the guy passes out on the beach. She swims around, but she suddenly feels some pain on her legs. She screams as this unknown thing attacks her and finally kills her. What killed her was a great white shark.MARTIN BRODY (played by Roy Scheider), Amity Island's chief of police resides, obviously, in Amity Island with his beautiful wife, ELLEN BRODY (played by Lorraine Gary) and his two sons, MICHAEL (played by Chris Rebello) and SEAN (played by Jay Mello), where a few months ago, they had moved to Amity Island from New York City. He wakes up the next morning and gets a call about Chrissy's murder. He stops by the office where the medical inspector calls Brody and gives him the probable cause of death: shark attack. Frightened and concerned, Brody rushes out of the office and begins to find a way to put a stop to this. While trying to shut the beaches down, LARRY VAUGHN (played by Murray Hamilton), the mayor of Amity Island, doesn't want Martin to do anything that involves closing the beaches, for Vaughn is one greedy S.O.B., who wants nothing, but money. The next afternoon, while the town is lying on the beach, a little boy by the name of ALEX KINTAR (played by Jeffrey Voorhees) becomes the shark's next victim. Brody panics and finally decides to put a stop to this. He calls shark expert MATT HOOPER (played by Richard Dreyfuess). The two team up and find a way to put to end it. While in the middle of doing so, the town meets QUINT (played by the late Robert Shaw), a somewhat eccentric fisherman who requests that he be given the job of killing the great white terror for $10,000,000. Brody doesn't care how much Quint wants as long as he kills the shark. The next day, a bunch of Amity's local fishermen, led by Amity's local fisherman, BEN GARDENER (played by Craig Kingsbury), catch what they think is a shark. The type of shark they caught was a tiger shark, which means that they were nowhere near even catching the one they were after, for the one they're after is a great white. Later that night, Hooper stops over to see Martin. The two decide to go with Hooper's idea: Cut open the tiger shark to see if this is the right shark. The digestive system of all sharks is extremely slow, meaning whatever a shark has eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be within the shark. If they cut open the shark and happen to see the Kintar boy come rolling out, then they've caught the shark. They cut it open and find only two fish, a tin can, and a license plate. Tiger sharks are like garbage disposals, they'll eat anything in their paths. They concluded that the tiger shark is definitely not the killer shark. Hooper informs Brody that sharks mostly feed at night, so they head out to find the killer shark. Instead, the end up finding Ben Gardner's boat all banged up. Hooper investigates the boat by diving in the water and coming underneath the boat. But while checking the bottom of the boat, Hooper finds Gardner's dead body. The two try to convince Vaughn to keep the beaches closed, especially on July 4th, but as greedy as Vaughn is, he refuses.July fourth arrives and everything goes well until Michael, who is in a boat with his friends, is attacked by the shark. Michael appears to be okay and unharmed. He went into slight shock, forcing Brody to hire Quint to kill the shark once and for all.Brody and Hooper join Quint on the journey to kill what has been terrorizing the peaceful island of Amity for the past two weeks. They come close to getting him, but fail. By the next morning, the three continue on with their job. Hooper decides the only to actually do this is for him to get into a shark cage and stab the shark with a spear filled with poison, but that fails for the shark tears the cage up like it is nothing. As for the boat, it begins to sink for there is a huge hole in the bottom of it. The shark comes up onto the boat as it sinks even further. Quint begins to slide towards the shark as Brody grabs him, but he loses his grip, where Quint is killed by the shark. Brody, seeing Quint dead, thinking Hooper is dead, is all alone. He grabs one of Hooper's air tanks and throws into the shark's mouth. Brody goes back on deck, grabs a rifle, and prepares to shoot the tank, still within the shark's mouth. He begins shooting at the shark. He finally shoots the air tank and blows up the shark. Afterwards, Hooper arises from the water, still alive and unharmed. Brody and Hooper grab a couple of rafts and head out to shore, after putting Amity Island back into a safe haven for the residents and vacationers.Every summer when I watch this film, I never get tired of it. I mostly watch it during the summer when in Florida for two weeks. Everybody should have seen and own this film. No excuses whatsoever. None. If you don't have it, buy it.	5.0	Jaws (1975)	2005-06-11	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3AY3EV2MFRFGG	"Chadwick H. Saxelid ""Bookworm"""	Nothing else has had quite the effect on me as this movie.  To me it is nearly perfect, a well crafted monster movie that seems to effortlessly invoke a sense of phobic terror whenever anyone gets anywhere near, much less in, the water.  Although Roy Scheider is a delight as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss engaging as Matt Hooper, it is the larger than life characterization of Quint by Robert Shaw that owns the movie.  Mattey's Mechanical Shark isn't half bad either, although it's constant malfunctions kept it off camera for most of the movie.  A happy accident that only served to increase the film's already considerable power.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means do so asap.  They just do not make monster movies better than this.  An essential action/monster movie for any film buff's library.The disc is nearly as good as the movie.  It contains numerous deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards, and trailers.  Too bad the incredible making of documentary has been cut to about an hour in length from its original two hour running time.  Perhaps some day MCA will do another box set special edition for the DVD release and offer the restored documentary.	5.0	My favorite movie of all time!	2001-12-26	3	2	1

I was originally gong to get the 25th Anniversary edition but, when I saw the 30th Anniversary edition I bought that instead because it looked very promising and a good place to start JAWS. (I am saying that I am a Jaws first timer) I am very satisfied with my purchase. I like movies that are based on good books. I also recommend that you see the sequel JAWS 2 next, because it is very good too.

I am kind of startled that some of the scenes are so iconic that they have come to seem hackneyed to some younger folks. Jaws broke new ground...it was the original. The only thing that makes anything in it seem hackneyed is all the imitators since. As a teenager, I saw it in the theatre three times. The tension was stark throughout. All three times, when the shark is finally killed, the theatre would erupt in spontaneous applause. There were newspaper stories about that phenomenon. This was Steven Spielberg's breakthrough mega-hit. He knows how to go for what is primal, then pace it just right. A lot of action, but this was when Hollywood still understood that story is key and effects are only effective when they are the support for a powerful story.	5.0	Still a Classic	2014-06-14	0	0	0

After a young lady is attacked by a shark late one night, the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and the city fathers want new police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to keep quiet because ""we need summer dollars"". Brody reluctantly goes along until the shark attacks swimmers in broad daylight, ending the cover-up. Enter young oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who hopes to at least study the shark before killing it. But the shark situation soon turns desperate and they page professional shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Quint was a U.S.S Indianapolis survivior who hates sharks on a personal level. Quint readies his boat to hunt the shark accompanied by Hooper and Brody, who fears the water but goes along out of a sense of responsibility. Spielberg delivers some terrific suspense scenes but wisely never goes over the edge. Never has a movie made people fear the water like this, and twenty six years later this movie hasn't lost any potency. The 25th Anniversary edition includes a well done documentary with interviews with Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, and producers and crew members.

"All of our frustrations of the soulless, image candy of summer blockbusters like Godzilla and recent films like Fantastic Four can be directly linked to Jaws.

Not only is it a great Spielberg film, but it's a great adventure film period.A girl who goes skinny dipping(little note: if you look really hard, you can actually see nudity) is found dead and Police Chief Brody wants to shut down the beaches because of a possible shark still lurking around. The town mayor however knows that all their revenue comes from summer tourism so he opts not to shut down the beaches. 3-4 attacks later and he finally relents. So Brody, shark hunter Quint and Oceaniographic Institute scientist Hooper go on Quint's boat to hunt down the troublemaker: a 25 foot long great white shark.The film was plagued by a disastrous shoot that often times wouldn't get as many shots as Spielberg wanted, some days if any shots. The mechanical shark(nicknamed ""Bruce"" after Spielberg's lawyer) sank or would break down. But audiences got freaked then went back and it's the first film ever to surpass the 100 million mark. Sure Spiderman 2 did it in one weekend. But back then, this was quite a milestone.Oft-quoted lines, memorable images and performances and really good pacing makes this not only a Spielberg classic but a classic in general."	5.0	The original blockbuster and unlike typical ones, it doesn't suck	2005-07-22	2	1	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	-This review pertains to the Jaws: 30th Anniversary Edition DVD-In 1975, a young up and coming director named Steven Spielberg (DuelandThe Sugarland Express) became America's premier filmmaker with his motion picture adaptation of Peter Benchley's novel,Jaws. Upon its theatrical release Jaws quickly became a cultural phenomenon, embraced by critics and audiences alike. It's hard to believe, but it's been over thirty years since the film debuted and Jaws still keeps people away from the water. The film's brilliant exploitation (or exploration, depending on how you look at it) of our primal fears of drowning and of being eaten alive by a natural predator is still stunningly effective. And though the mechanical shark in the film may look artificial or quaint when compared to today's advanced CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery), the film remains a chilling and exhilarating adventure/thriller.When a Great White shark begins stalking the waters of Amity, a New England coastal town, and kills a teenage girl, Police Chief Martin Brody (who suffers from a fear of the water) wants to close down the beaches, but he is overruled by Mayor Vaughn. After two more fatal shark attacks Brody hires Matt Hooper, a wealthy ichthyologist from the Oceanographic Institute and an eccentric local fisherman named Quint, to hunt down and exterminate the shark. Brody says good-bye to his wife, Ellen and their two children, and he joins Hooper and Quint on a small, dilapidated fishing vessel called the Orca. It doesn't take this mismatched trio long before they encounter the deadly 26-foot shark, which repeatedly attacks their boat. Soon it becomes apparent that the hunters are the hunted and that this predator can, not only outsmart them, but outrun them as well. Even after numerous attempts to stop the shark, their efforts are thwarted time and time again. When the shark strikes their boat, creating a large leak, Brody, Hooper, and Quint realize that they are ill equipped to face this natural wonder of evolution, this perfect killing machine.The film features a superb cast including Roy Scheider as the neurotic Police Chief, Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as the charmingly sarcastic Hooper, Robert Shaw as the stubborn Quint, Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen, and Murray Hamilton as the persistently unwise Mayor Vaughn. The entire cast gives multi-faceted performances and Robert Shaw, in particular, is wonderful as the salty, cynical, and fiercely competitive Quint.Without minimalizing the talents of the fantastic cast, the film's greatest stars are those behind the camera. Steven Spielberg was aided by special effects expert Robert A. Mattey, experienced shark photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor, production designer Joe Alves, and director of photography Bill Butler. The film's screenplay was written by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb and benefited from unaccredited contributions by Howard Sackler, Steven Spielberg, and John Milius. As far as adaptations go, it's unusual for a film's screenplay to live up to the expectations of the fans of the source material. Often an adaptation of a book is disappointing, to put it mildly, but Jaws proved to be an exception. The film, in many ways, is superior to the novel, which at times drifts into the realm of pretentious melodrama.Jaws was also given a tremendous boost by renowned film composer, John William's brilliant score, which has become instantly recognizable.The original Jaws film was so successful that it spawned three sequels: the adequateJaws 2, the regrettableJaws 3, and the abysmalJaws: The Revenge. Apparently you can't keep a good shark down. With all of these indestructible sharks out there, it's no wonder that people are still afraid of going into the water.The 30th Anniversary Edition DVD includes the following bonus materials: the excellent two-hour documentary The Making of Jaws, deleted scenes and outtakes, From the Set vintage featurette, storyboards, production photos, Marketing Jaws, and Jaws Phenomenon image galleries.Now the film itself is worth the price and with the addition of the bonus material, having this DVD in your collection is a no-brainer.Also recommended:Close Encounters of the Third KindIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost ArkE.T. the Extra-TerrestrialJurassic Park: The Collection	5.0	Are You Ready to Go Back Into the Water?	2008-09-22	3	3	0

The performances are flawless, and the special effects are (for the time) quite good.Of course, &quot;Jaws&quot; is so frightening because the shark is no imaginary creature. As you swim in the ocean, you never know what is beneath you--sharks are the ultimate &quot;monsters under the bed.&quot; The shark in this film is a malevolent force of nature, preying on a small seaside town.&quot;Jaws&quot; had a famously difficult production, and the DVD features a decent recounting of the tribulations faced by the cast and crew. It's difficult to believe that such a cursed film turned out so well.The film looks great on DVD, and the bonus material is (for the most part) entertaining. Sadly, Steven Spielberg refuses to add commentary tracks to his films. Even so, &quot;Jaws&quot; is an essential addition to any DVD collection.	5.0	cousinpaco's top terrors: #1	2002-10-17	3	2	1

Like Hitchcock and ""Psycho,"" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching. The music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	Jaws is one of the few films that surpasses the novel from which it sprang.  Jaws is a very simple film, without the convoluted side-stories of the book.  A man-eating shark lurks off the beaches of a small island that depends on tourist dollars.  Three men set off in a boat to hunt down and kill the shark, but the sheer size of the animal makes it a struggle for survival.  The film works wonderfully, and is filled with great performances, great filming, and sure direction from Steven Spielberg.The film doesn't get the credit it deserves, in my opinion.  This is likely because it spawned a number of cut-rate sequels and imitators.  The filming and effects are superb, even by today's standards.  It is well-known that the mechanical shark did not work for most of the shoot, forcing Spielberg to film as a thriller where the shark is only glimpsed most of the time.  In fact, the film benefits from this method because by the time you actually see the shark, you are so immersed in the story that you don't notice the effect.The human performances are consistently good.  The trio at the heart of the action are well cast and have great on-screen chemistry.  The supporting actors are also good.  The photography, much of it on the sea, gives a feeling of menace (beneath the waves) and isolation (one ship on the vast ocean).  And, of course, John William's Oscar-winning soundtrack is a masterpiece of mood.Unfortunately, this DVD is not enough!  The picture and sound are as good as expected.  There is an hour-long documentary on the making of Jaws that is fun and informative.  However....  where's the director's commentary?  A film with as storied a history as this surely deserves a commentary from Spielberg and/or the producers.  There are a couple of cut scenes and outtakes on the disc, but they only fuel a desire for more, especially since the documentary has a number of clips that are not in the film or in the extra material on the DVD.  Therefore, I look forward to an even better DVD sometime in the future.	5.0	We're going to need a bigger DVD	2002-06-24	6	5	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	I remember when I first saw Jaws and what an exciting experience it was.  The now all familiar pounding theme music, the head popping out of the hole in the boat, the shark cage attack, the spectacular demise of the shark, and always Quint!  What had dimmed after all these years was the wonderful first half of the movie on Amity Island.  Seeing the family sequences again, and the struggle that the Islanders had in coming to terms with the reality of this predatory shark and what it meant to their financial survival is really quite touching and painful.In the fine feature on the making of Jaws on the disk, Spielberg discusses how not showing the shark adds to the drama, but he also admits that the barrels had to substitute for the shark because the mechanical shark wasn?t working very well.  Frankly, I am glad it didn?t.  We see the shark just enough.  Implying the shark is supremely effective.While the main three characters, Brody (Scheider), Quint (Shaw), and Hooper (Dreyfuss), are so brilliantly played they have become immortal roles, there are many other fine performances that are overshadowed.  Lorraine Gary adds a wonderful reality to Brody family trying to fit in as newcomers to Amity Island trying to fit in.  I am glad they changed the character from the book.  Murray Hamilton as the small town mayor Larry Vaughn who is simply trying to keep the Island?s economy afloat and doesn?t grasp what is really happening until disaster has finally struck full force.The character roles of the fishermen and would-be fishermen are wonderful splashes of color on the film canvas and add humor to relieve tension and set up the second half confrontation so well.This is a superior film that has been imitated so often that we forget how good the original actually is.  This is a good disk with a good copy of the film and extras that help us appreciate how the film came to be.	5.0	A superior film - good to remember how well done it was	2004-07-23	2	1	1

Spielberg did a fantastic job bringing the book to life. In many ways it's superior to the book (Spielberg removed a lot of the rough language and the sexual stuff that is found in the book) The acting in this film is excelent. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are all very believable. You can feel their fear, excitement, and anger. If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, then buy it now.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A5DIAZ5GT3MC	Crazy Jim	"Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking blockbuster about a killer great white shark loose on the beaches of a small summer tourist community is still one of the most terrifying experiences in cinema. While not necessarily classified as a ""horror film"", this white-knuckle thriller has kept beach-goers out of the water for nearly three decades now. Despite a handful of mediocre sequels and countless knock-offs, ""Jaws"" is still the measuring stick in underwater excitement. The 30th Anniversary Edition DVD, however, is hardly worth the upgrade. You're getting the ""Making Of Jaws"" documentary in its entirety (it was cut down for 2000's original DVD) and a few added scenes in the outtake reel. There's still no audio commentary, no theatrical trailers, and nothing on here that was actually recorded specifically for this edition though there is a sixty-page photo journal included.

I have never liked this film though it is in my legendary 5 year golden age of horror filmmaking.I will be the first to admit that Jaws is well shot, well acted, and well written.  But it is something even deeper that espouses fear during the viewing of this film.There isn't a reader out there who hasn't been out swimming smomewhere in the world and felt that nauseating fear: what the hell is down there, beneath me, swimming around ?THAT is the beauty of JAWS.  It feeds off that universal 'Jonah and the whale' fear that all human beings have experienced at one time of another.  Except now the whale is a giantic great white shark with rows of razor sharp teeth.As to why this film is so low on my list ?

Sutter	"In an age where everyone and their mother knows the basic plotline of JAWS and has seen this classic at least half a dozen times, I was very disappointed when I picked up this Collector's Edition to discover that half of the supplemental documentary was excised. These days, seeing 2-disc special editions is a norm, but back in 1998, more than one disc in a package was unheard of. So in order to be able to cram the entire movie, trailers and the documentary onto one single disc, the phenomenal 2-hour making-of documentary (directed by Laurent Bouzereau) that was produced for the JAWS: SIGNATURE COLLECTION Laserdisc in 1995 was condensed to a 50-minute ""featurette."" I really, really hope Universal takes heed to the cries of foul from the fans and re-releases this title one day as a 2-disc set, restoring many wonderful recollections that were cut out of the DVD's documentary (including Roy Scheider's recollection of the infamous night the entire cast and crew had a massive food fight and then all jumped into a resort pool to wash themselves off). Luckily, I still have my original laserdisc set and can see this documentary in all of its nostalgic glory. I'm very surprised Spielberg let them cut that much out, but being released in 1998, it was still the birth of DVD and thus forgiveness can be bestowed. This is why I give four stars out of five...four stars for the film masterpiece, zero stars for the extras. Universal, please give us fans what we want!

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2OSERGXBYMPJ0	C. T. Mikesell	"Jaws has something for everyone. It has a bit of the classic disaster movies of the 70s like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno."" It has a bit of the classic Hitchcock suspense films like ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds."" It has a bit of the teen B-movie slasher flicks. It's a buddy picture. It's a road trip movie. Now a lot of directors could take these elements and make a lousy movie, but Spielberg turned it into Hollywood gold.The casting and character development in the movie are excellent. Robert Shaw's Quint, especially, is unbelievably good as the salty shark-hunter. His monologue about the USS Indianapolis demonstrates in a couple minutes the depth of his character who, prior to that scene, was almost a caricature (the quote in the title of this review is an example of his charming wit). Dreyfuss and Scheider also create characters with nuanced depth. Spielberg even takes Murray Hamilton's character, Mayor Vaughn, who at first seems shallow and smarmy (""Amity, as you know, means friendship"") and in the hospital scene transforms him into a real person.Included on the DVD is an excellent documentary looking at the making of the movie, which does a great job at spreading credit for the film's success beyond just Steven Spielberg, as well as throwing in a lot of filmmaking trivia. The other extras on the DVD are a mixed bag. The deleted scenes are worth watching, though appropriately deleted from the final version. The outtakes were a disappointment (you'd think Roy Scheider would have test-fired the gun after it jammed the second time). The trivia game is nice once through. The Windows screensaver amounts to 5 still images (most of them mediocre) from the movie that endlessly repeat. A commentary or two would have been great ... maybe for the 30th anniversary.Jaws was one of those movies that was an instant hit and continues to impress. It's still in the Top 30 box office draws (even ahead of Monsters Inc., Batman, and Men in Black) - and with good reason: it's simply an excellent movie. If you've never seen it before, you're missing a thrill (literally). If you have seen it, but don't have it on DVD already, get it now; it doesn't disappoint."	5.0	"""Here's to Swimmin' with Bowlegged Women"""	2004-04-18	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"The dominance of the Hollywood summer blockbuster can be attributed (or blamed depending on how you feel about them) to two filmmakers: Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars. But Spielberg was there first with Jaws, an exciting adventure film about a great white shark terrorizing a small, seaside town that scared the crap out of millions of people the year it came out. The movie was a bonafide phenomenon, becoming the first one to ever surpass $100 million at the box office.Jaws holds up today because it is an adventure film that doesn't rely solely on exciting action sequences. Its foundation is a strong story and engaging characters with memorable dialogue (most notably the famous monologue that Quint delivers with chilling intensity). More importantly, we care about what happens to these characters and that is something a lot of Jaws imitators failed to copy successfully. Spielberg and co. essentially created a contemporary monster movie that works so well because it plays on a primary fear of being in the water and not having control of one's environment (i.e. drowning). As a result, Jaws has aged well over three decades while its numerous sequels and imitators have not.When Jaws was released on DVD to commemorate its 25th anniversary it was heavily criticized for including a truncated version Laurent Bouzereau's excellent feature-length Making Of documentary. For the 30th anniversary they've rectified this situation but unless you're a devotee it's not really worth the double-dip. Gone from the previous version is the trivia game, the Shark World documentary, the trailers and the screen saver so completists might want to hold on to their old discs.On the first DVD are 13 minutes worth of deleted scenes and outtakes. There is more footage of the crime scene of the first shark attack and a nice bit where Quint playfully mocks some poor kid for playing a clarinet in a music store.New to this edition is ""From the Set,"" a profile on the movie done on location. A British film crew follows a young Spielberg around and interviews him, providing an interesting snapshot of the then up-and-coming filmmaker.The second DVD features the real reason to purchase this edition (aside from the excellent movie, of course), a two-hour retrospective documentary restored to its full glory. It covers all the usual bits: the mechanical shark that rarely worked, the mercurial presence of Robert Shaw, the source of Quint's famous monologue, and so on. This is a fascinating, in-depth look at how Jaws came together, the challenges that a young Spielberg faced and the eventual phenomenon that developed as the film thrilled audiences all over the world.Also included are galleries of storyboards by Tom Wright, production photos taken on location, and movie posters and ads from all over the world.Finally, there is an attractive 60-page photo journal with glossy stills and quotes from cast, crew and the movie."	4.0	Worth double-dipping only for the completist	2005-06-22	6	4	2

I ran out of the cinema and back to our apartment when I seen the head scene. I had nightmares for weeks afterwards. Since then I've seen this classic countless times and I enjoy it every time. There's just something about the atmosphere in the film that I find infectious. The casting is the most natural I've seen. Each of the main characters is so believable, different and interesting in their own way. A tired middle aged cop from New York, a young rich scientist in love with his work, and an old weather beaten shark fisherman with scars to remember most of his encounters. I've yet to see interaction like this between 3 actors. The love\hate atmosphere on the boat is just gripping. I bought the DVD version for my kids. I'd rather the original because in the DVD version in the scene before they sing; `Show me the way to go home', the whale sound effect is smudged out and replaced with a more 90's politically correct whale sound. I thought the original effect added much more to the atmosphere of the film. But it is cool to see it digitally touched up. And what about the Score? Is there a more memorable score for a movie? Space Odyssey 2001 springs to mind but even that masterpiece borrows from the classical world. That music was not written for that film. I loved the book too, but I have to say the movie is better. I know it's strange but it's true. I love movies but I've yet to get the same level of enjoyment from a movie as I did from Jaws. And that includes E.T., Close Encounters, Star Wars and so on. Jaws is a marvel. I'm glad I was so young when I first seen it because it probably wouldn't have had the affect on me that it had had I watched it at an older age. Ok in hindsight and if you like nitpicking you can find a few things wrong with this film. Like the missing chair after the scene were they caught something with the fishing rod, or it wasn't really summer when the filmed it. Big deal! Movies like this are about imagination aren't they? These inconsistencies had to be pointed out to me before I could see them for myself. In my opinion a good movie with no directing or editing errors is not what makes it good movie. Jaws is King and very underrated in my opinion.	1.0	Still a classic.	2009-10-01	13	2	11
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2BSEFP405Q8ZB	"C. Walk ""CynicNerd"""	"When you are anticipating something so much, sometimes you don't get the right feeling for it at first, this happens to me a lot with Blu-ray. My expectations get set a little high. At first I didn't like what I saw, opening beach scene looked gritty, perhaps the lack of light was the big culprit. Even in the water when the girl is being attacked by the shark, still dark and grainy. Who knows, maybe it was shot on a crappier camera, but it doesn't matter anywho, that was me being picky. Come the next day when Brody is summoned to the beach you see Amity Island shine with glourious color and detail! I love the feeling of watching a movie I have seen SO many times before, come alive on Blu-ray because it really seems like I'm seeing it again for the first time. This is why I buy the format. The reason why I will own 3 versions of the same film (6 if its Blade Runner). The soundtrack is one of my favorites of all time! John Williams has never sounded better, the classic Jaws theme rumbles hauntingly with the awesome DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1! Wish I had that many speakers in my house, by my soundbar will suffice, FOR NOW. The only thing that irked me about this release was that Spielberg still has not recorded a commentary track, but I can get past that. People are always calling out for a remake. I say nay! You can never replicate the ""Hitchcockian"" vibes that ran beautifully through the film, instead you would get a gore fest in tune with films that are being offered now like Shark Night.It's almost difficult to fathom that this film is almost 40 years old, especially when it provides such a high quality video and audio experience! It really blew my mind! A movie that still holds its own today and will withstand the test of time, Jaws will always have a special place in my life. It both created great fascination and terrorized me at the same time! For this disc, I would go back in the water (and I hardly go in the Ocean).5 Stars outta 5. This is an example of where Blu-ray truly delivers! It will definitely make its way into my top 5 of 2012.~CynicNerd"	5.0	Jaws Blu-ray THE EXPERIENCE!	2012-08-19	10	9	1

People quibble about why it was so successful, but I tell you, it is just a brilliant film.  No other movie  puts the chills up a persons back better.  With all the advances in  technology today, this still outclasses them.  The acting was terrific.  The music was unforgettable.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH	"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I"""	Okay, I know I'm not alone when I say that 'Jaws' scared the crap out of me.  Not so much anymore, cuz I'm used to it, but show this to someone for the first time and they're sure to think twice about taking a swim, that's for sure.  The great thing about this film is the way Speilberg directed it, keeping us glued in suspence, never showing us the shark really until the very end...and don't even get me started with the theme music.  Just hearing that alone makes my skin crawl.  Yes, granted I was very young when I saw 'Jaws' for the first time, and yes this is 'outdated' sort-of-speak compared to todays graphics BUT the graphics are not what made this film.  Sure the shark looks fake, but you ONLY SEE HIM AT THE END OF THE FILM.  Up until that point you see a fin and blood.  Brilliance.The story is also great because, while it may be unlikly that a Great White of all sharks is gonna end up close to shore feasting on children, having lived in Florida I know that there are many instances when hammerheads and the like travel close to shore and attack.  Fact is that most shark attacks occur in waist high water.  That said the story of a Great White attacking a Long Island local beach is not too far fetched.  The reactions of the town folk, espiecially the mayor, is also pretty accurate.  I mean, what mayor is gonna bypass money?  So what if some people get killed.The final frames of the film are chilling...and I'm sorry but watching Brody and Hooper (Scheider & Dreyfuss) swim back to land made me anxious.  I couldn't have done it...be in the water after all that.  But that's just me.  All involved give great performances, from shark hunter Quint (Shaw) who offers to take Hooper and Brody out to find the shark...to Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) the entire cast is brilliant.  Like I said, while it may be 'outdated' it's still so superior to any 'shark' film released since...it really does stand alone as one of the scariest and smartest films to date!	5.0	Just when you thought it was safe to go in the water...	2006-07-24	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	Here is Steven Spielberg's best film, not surprising since it is also one of his earliest, a movie that reflects not only commercial savvy but artistic passion and a true love for the moviemaking process. This is Spielberg displaying as much virtuosity as Quentin Tarantino would later show in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill.&quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; is quite simply one of my favorite films, probably among the top 5. I just picked up a copy of the DVD and watched the movie again for the 40th or 50th time. It is staggering, the quality of this film. Spielberg's direction has done more than withstand the test of time; it shames the work by today's less-talented studio hacks like Stephen Sommers, Michael Bay, et al. Framing, pacing, camera placement, and every other tool in the director's toybox works to tell the story and give us information, not only about the shark's whereabouts, but the characters themselves.The characters, and the actors who play them, are the real magic of &quot;Jaws.&quot; The shark is a wonderful special effect, to be sure, one of the most effective movie villains ever, but Brody, Quint and Hooper are the real stars. Their conflicted interrelationships hold the story together -- after all, there is a lot of screen time given over to the dialogue among these three men, when the shark isn't even a blip on the radar. Spielberg had a lot of faith in the ability of his actors to compete with the special effects, a faith he does not display today (&quot;A.I.,&quot; anyone?). This is just one reason why &quot;Jaws&quot; continues to work so well after 30 years.A masterpiece of blood and guts (Quint's death scene is still hard to watch), &quot;Jaws&quot; is also underrated as a character piece. What a great movie this is.	5.0	Spielberg's best? Yep	2004-04-27	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2	"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru"""	that's going to have a heart attack when he sees what I brung him!&quot; So says Quint near the climax of Jaws, the first summer blockbuster and one of the greatest,  most exciting movies ever made.  Face it, few other  movies can match the intensity of the narrative, or the credibility of the  characters.  The shark, when it is finally seen, looks rather fake, but the  characters seem real and that is what sells this movie and makes it surpass  the likes of Armageddon. The scene where Brody (played by Roy Scheider) is  being mimicked at the dinner table by his youngest son, the scene where his  wife calms him down about yelling at his older son to get out of a boat,  only to change her mind after looking at a picture in a book Brody was  reading, the scene where 2 fishermen hook a roast &amp; throw it off a dock  to get more than they bargained for, all are strong examples of the  verissimiltude that this movie carries with it.But along with the  characters this movie also boasts scientific accuracy, at least as much as  will be permitted to let the plot function.  Territoriality, for example,  is a theory that has been applied to sharks, but there has also been  evidence to suggest that it is inaccurate.  In general, sharks do not  develop a taste for human flesh.  However, the anecdotes of the shark  experts ring true, &amp; provides insights of their different  personalities--Hooper chuckling over how a shark ripped apart his first  boat &amp; how it fascinated him vs. Quint's chilling narrative of The  Indianapolis.The picture has never been clearer than on this dvd (I  keep odd hours &amp; have roommates, so I must keep the volume down &amp;  therefore will not rate the audio quality)  The documentary is likewise  terrific &amp; makes up for the lack of audio commentary.  Some of the  deleted scenes were used in network broadcasts of the movie, others look  like alternate takes of scenes.  All in all, the only thing I found mildly  disapointing about this movie were the bloopers.  We only get 2.But  still, it's Jaws, the most exciting movie released this year (excepting  North-by-Northwest) whether it be the movie theater or video. And a  quintessential popcorn muncher.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	Jaws is not only the first blockbuster to gross over one hundred million dollars, a visceral thriller that showcases the art and craft of moviemaking at its finest, and a film that probably made millions of families rethink their summer vacation plans over the past quarter of a century plus, it is a cultural phenomenon that has become a permanent part of pop culture.  John Williams' theme to Jaws is immediately recognizable on both an intellectual and emotional level, whether you've seen the movie or not.  Major and minor problems alike are still met with the words, &quot;You're [or we're] going to need a bigger boat.&quot;  This twenty-fifth anniversary DVD release only furthers and adds to the legend, tossing extra features into the waters of our consciousness like so much delectable chum, and we are drawn to this aromatic feast of bloody entertainment the same way the star of this movie (which isn't Dreyfus, Scheider, or Shaw) is drawn to the smell of blood and the necessity of constant feeding as it slips through the oceans of our planet and, thanks to Peter Benchley, Stephen Spielberg, and others, the oceans of our very thoughts and fears.This movie works on so many levels.  First, we have Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a New York City transplantee who now polices an island despite his fear of water.  When a young lady is killed in the movie's memorable opening scene, pretty obviously by a shark, he allows himself to be dissuaded from closing the beaches by a slimy mayor who cares more for the holiday tourist season than the lives of the men, women, and children vacationing there.  When a boy is killed soon thereafter in front of basically everyone, Brody is rightly racked with a guilt that the mayor still doesn't understand.  A bounty on the shark brings all kinds of crazy people to the harbor, fighting each other in piddling little boats in a race to catch the killer.  It also brings shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and self-proclaimed shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to town.  A shark is captured, but it soon becomes clear that this tiger shark is not the rogue killer terrorizing the island; Brody's son is in fact lucky to survive the ultimate proof of this fact.  Eventually, Hooper and Brody go out on the Orca with the eccentric, roguish Quint determined to find and kill the great white shark whom we finally get a close-up view of well over halfway through the movie.  This first real look at the mammoth twenty-six footer is brilliantly shot; having been conditioned to expect the shark only after Williams' incredible theme song begins, Jaws decides to make his first close-up a memorable surprise to the audience and, most especially, Brody.  The hunters soon become the hunted, leading to an increasingly suspenseful, riveting conclusion.Many would view the shark as a monster, but if there is a monster in this film it is the mayor and local businessmen who sacrifice lives in the name of money.  The shark is just doing what he does naturally, feeding, and I cannot do anything but respect this remarkable creature.  The shark is nature's perfect killing machine, perhaps the most magnificent and certainly the most efficient animal on this planet.  This particular shark is as smart as he is huge, making him the most formidable of opponents for the Ahab-like Quint.  Certainly, such a rogue killer has to be either starved out or killed in the interest of human life, but I mourn the eventual defeat of this magnificent animal.This film was released in 1975, and the great white shark does not look terribly real today, but this takes nothing away from its magnificence and visceral impact on the viewer.  Spielberg shows his genius early on in his directing career by holding back our first look at the shark for so long; the early deaths are quite memorable and pack quite a punch as it is, with levels of blood and panic that make this a film that probably haunted the dreams of many younger viewers and a fair share of adults for many a night.  The final leg of the film is particularly extreme, making me wonder how this film got a PG rating.  One of the most compelling scenes of the film, however, does not involve the shark at all; Quint's absorbing account of his experience after the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis stands as one of the most emotionally enthralling scenes ever filmed.The anniversary DVD edition of Jaws is simply loaded with extras, featuring 75 minutes of bonus footage, including several deleted scenes and outtakes.  The main attraction, though, is the feature Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws, which delivers incredible insight on the making of the film.  After watching these interviews with important cast and crew members and behind-the-scenes looks at the grueling, exceedingly challenging making of the film, this viewer's respect for the cinematic wonder that was created here grew by leaps and bounds.	5.0	Nature's perfect killing machine brought to cinematic life	2003-11-08	7	6	1

The picture quality is near perfect. There is no signs of pixelation or breaks  in the picture (Anyone who saw highlander on DVD knows what a bad picture  looks like). The blacks are deep and solid and the colors are vibrant and  jump off the screen. It's amazing the work they put into this film to clean  it up from the 1970's print.Next, the sound... TOP NOTCH.. I'm not even  talking about the dts version.. the regular sound is good enough. The  scenes on the ocean sound fantastic, and the dum-dum score rattles the  subwoofer.As far as extras go, this disc is no fight club, however, for  a film that's so old, to have this much extra included is great. The  behind-the-scenes stuff is alot of fun and even the deleted scenes are a  nice touch.. The trivia game is short, but good for a few laughs.If you  didn't pre-order this DVD, you really should think about what kind of  movies you are buying if you passed this one by... do yourself the favor...  buy this, you'll be glad you did, and your DVD player will thank you.	5.0	Everyone knew this DVD should be perfect... it is	2000-07-13	0	0	0

One of Steven Spielberg's earliest films and his first true masterpiece from a directing standpoint and a box office success, this movie is rare masterpiece.  The premise is simple, a great white shark comes into the shallow waters outside the water of Massachusetts, and begins terrorizing people.  The local sheriff (Roy Scheider) works with a local fisherman (Robert Shaw) and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) to go after the shark who has fatally attacked several people, and the rest is history.  Not a horror film, but much more than a simple drama, JAWS is one of the finest films of the 1970s and one of the best films ever!!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	5.0	The Movie That Created Summer Blockbusters	2006-09-08	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	From the first killing to John Williams' fantastic theme, there has yet to be a shark movie that combines suspense, action and drama. What makes this so much better than the sequels and recent movies that feature killer sharks (and I know other people have said this but not me) is that they don't show the shark until the movie's almost over! I mean, you know what's killing these people but you have no idea of the size of this thing until it pops up out of the water when Schieder's throwing the chum. I think all the horror/slasher films need to take a lesson from this; don't show the monster all the time because the people will never get scared. People are afraid of the unknown, so if you show people getting killed off but don't show who or what's doing it, then you'll get a bigger scare out of them when you do finally show it. Anyway, enough prattling on how good suspense should be done. Roy Schieder gives a great performance as Chief Brody. He's an average person thrust into this extraordinary situation. Robert Shaw is off his is rocker as Quint (a complete opposite compared to his role in From Russia with Love). And Richard Dreyfuss is down to Earth and believable as Hooper. All three actors have great chemistry together when they're on the boat. The shark, while not sleek looking by today's standards of special effects (God awful CGI would probably replace the model if this film gets remade and we'd probably see the shark every waking moment), is very believeable in its few moments on screen. And I think the shark roars or makes some weird sound when it busts through the boat right before Brody thrusts the air tank in its mouth. I might be wrong though.	5.0	The Definitive Shark Film (And the First Real Summer Blockbuster)	2009-08-13	2	2	0

I was only ten at the time, but was very much aware of &quot;Jaws-Mania.&quot;  My parents wouldn't let me see the film, yet that couldn't keep me from fantasizing about the carnage and thrills of a shark eating people.  When I did see it in a re-release in 1979, I was amazed that it surpassed my expectations.  The film is a well-crafted suspense tale, directed by a green Spielberg with confidence and aplomb (in my opinion, Spielberg permanently lost it with and after &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;).  Owing much to Melville's &quot;Moby Dick&quot; as well as to National Geographic, the film succeeds in that much of the terror is in what the audience does not see as well as what it does see.  Only at the end, with Quint's demise, does the audience become aware of the plasticity of the mechanical shark.  Yet one is so caught up in the story, it doesn't matter.  And like 1933's &quot;King Kong&quot;, the shark in &quot;Jaws&quot; seems to get bigger in every scene, so by the end of the film he beats good ol' Moby measure for measure.  The DVD is great, with good extras and a good documentary.	5.0	&quot;I THINK WE NEED A BIGGER BOAT&quot;	2001-12-23	0	0	0

But, that having been said, I have noticed several bad reviews for this classic and I cannot sit still and take it.  This film was created at a time when audiences didn't need to have things jammed down their throats to enjoy a movie.  If Jaws was released today it would flop, and that shows you how dumbed down and lazy we have become in our movie preferences.  Everything from the music, cast, special effects, and limited viewing of the shark until near the end, is perfectly done.  How many other directors could create such fright and terror without showing you the ""monster"" until more than half-way through the film?  This movie actually made people think twice before swimming in the ocean.  It held a nation in fear of what lies beneath the ocean, and it is simply a masterpiece.  The first half leads perfectly into the conclusion, where three men are pitted on a boat against the ""monster"".  Think of how epic the screenplay was when you have Quint, Chief Brody, and Dreyfus on that rusty old clunker ""Orca"", battling Jaws.  The scene at night with the whales singing before the shark rams the boat is just haunting.  While I'm sure I will open myself to attacks from people who don't love this film, I will dare say it anyway.....You are either under 20 or have an IQ in the same range if you don't like this movie.  In the year 2050, Jaws will still be considered one of the top 10 greatest movies ever made.  You heard it here folks.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2B73CL3QSYWLB	David Baldwin	"It's interesting to watch how the career of Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today, has evolved.  In his second feature film, Spielberg seems to have taken his cues from the master, Alfred Hitchcock, most notably ""The Birds"".  On what was probably a limited budget and limited technology of the time, Spielberg elicits enough scares to put today's CGI driven film-makers to shame.  Spielberg utilizes cinematography, film-editing, and most effectively a great John Williams score to maximum effect.  Spielberg was also blessed with the perfect cast in Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfus.  Murray Hamilton even gives a good performance as the mayor who would sacrifice vacationers for the all-mighty dollar.  One of the more effective scenes in the film is the one where Robert Shaw as Quint, the shark-hunter, relates the story of the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.  I never read the book on which this was based but it was my understanding that it was kind of trashy.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AEQKC3T9VWGW3	"David G. Kelly ""David kelly"""	Jaws really is such an incredible movie the acting in this film is incredible. Jaws is such a scary film I mean its more realistic then most horror films in the regards that Sharks are real and they do sometimes attack people not just the Great White Shark but Bull Sharks, and Tiger Sharks all pose a great threat to Humans. Okay back to the review this movie is so scectacular I just love it. The two disc 30th edition is a must buy. It has loads of Special features. I really find the man who directed this movie Steven Spielburg to be one of the best altime movie directors ever hands down He can do an incredible job Directing a horror movie, Scifi film like Star wars or a movie like American Graffiti.So what I like about this film is that the plot is acually quit simple a woman has been eaten alive bya shark which nobody knows what kind so the Sheriff  in charge makes everybody close down the beach for a while until the shark that killed this woman and other people is killed.It takes the sheriff a little while to shut down the beach for good until the shark is caught cause the owner of the beach only cares about money and not the sake of the people but he does change his mind after he sees the effect that this has on the people of the beach so the hunt is on for the shark that did this. You wont believe the ending to this incredible film. A must see for anybody that likes not just horror films but Steven Spielburg's films. I withoubt a doubt give this film 5 stars.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	Steven Spielberg's ultimate shocker still holds up great after all these years for the exact same reasons it was a huge box-office hit back in 1975: amazing score, powerful performances from an extremely talented cast, great special effects, and perfect direction. It's simple story of a shark terrorizing the waters of a small beach may not be the most compelling material ever to come out of Hollywood, but the attention to character and the sheer terror of the shark attacks more then makes up for it. There is something undeniably terrifying about the thought of being dragged underwater by something huge, something you can't even hope to escape from, and the very first attack scene is true nightmare fuel. As is the most memorable scene in the film, Robert Shaw's speech about his experiences after surviving the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, a World War II cruiser that sank and left hundreds of sailors floating in shark-infested waters for more than four days. Shaw's delivery of the scene still chills to the bone and stands as one of the greatest moments in film history. The DVD edition of JAWS has been long-awaited and fails to live up to it's potential. The lack of audio commentary by the director and a handful of out-of-context deleted scenes are major let-downs. But a superb 'making-of' documentary and an extensive art and design gallery are nice additions. Still, this is the definitive version of a classic film, one that deserves to be viewed multiple times both on the screen and in your darkest nightmares.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1FDW1SPYKB354	David Von Pein	"You simply have got to admire Steven Spielberg's tenacity while mired in this seemingly endless project.  He just wouldn't quit until he had created the classic known as ""Jaws"".  And he pulled it off.  We hear in the making-of documentaries of how the mechanical shark would always be on the fritz!  And of the actors waiting for hours, or days, to complete a given scene!  It must have been hell!  Especially considering the locales!  But this, in the final analysis of this landmark picture, actually proved to ADD to the suspense of the final cut!  Because the darn maneater refused to eat, Steven was forced to shoot many a scene (intended to include the predator) without the shark...proving once more the theory: the scariest things are the things we CAN'T see!  And when we finally see those huge jaws opened for the first time....WOW! What an impact!  I still jump when I see it!This film has all elements that make up a classic thriller: tension beyond belief, suspense, great acting, and the occasional ""Oh Jesus!"" surprise shocks.  I wonder how many people who have seen this movie were scared to death at the very end when the camera follows Brody & Hooper toward the shore...thinking, just maybe, another ""bite"" was coming!  (I know I did!) Ever wonder what Jaws would look like if made today featuring all the advanced computer imaging??  Might have been interesting. But it certainly would NOT have had as much suspense as the 1975 Jaws, because no doubt the shark would have popped his head out of the water much earlier in the film.  Nah....You can't improve on a Classic anyway!  And Jaws is definitely that!The Universal Home Video DVD has some very nice Bonus Features on it too -- a great ""Making-Of"" feature, some deleted scenes and outtakes, trailers, and more.The Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer on the ""25th Anniversary"" DVD Edition is first-rate as well.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3FDHJWK54LHAO	"""dbzub22"""	First off, I really didn't care for how Universal decided to alter the sound effects of this classic movie, especially when there was no need for it. They could've just enhanced the original sounds for the DVD format, but no. Instead, there are completley new sounds replacing your old favorites throughout the entire movie.The changes that really got to me in paticular were the ones during the movie's climactic showdown between Brody and the shark. The new sound effects of Brody blasting his gun at the toothy terror, hoping to hit the air tank, that he lodged down its throat, sounded ridiculously weak, like a child fireing a cap gun. And the sound of the shark exploding when Brody administered that one final shot either made you laugh or want to cry. It sounded like someone dropped a coffee mug and it shattered into two peices. Now how climactic is that!?I also didn't care for the way this movie was presented visually. Though there was little grain and artifacts, this DVD was too dark! I already owned a copy of Jaws on VHS before I got a DVD player. So, I decided to run the same movie, on those two different formats at the same time, and on the same t.v., and the difference was staggering. You wouldn't believe how dramatic the difference was unless you saw it with your own eyes. The more I compared, switching my t.v.'s setting between t.v. and video, with just the click of a button, the more I wished I hadn't bought the dvd.All in all, this DVD proved to be a great dissapointment, and a movie this good deserves better treatment. It doesn't even have a commentary! All I can say is I hope Universal comes to their senses, and releases a definitive version of Jaws on dvd.  As it stands, Jaws 2 is a far better DVD than the original.  It wasn't a watered down laserdisc version. The deleted scenes were superior, the production photos were arranged better, showing all the shots of the shark first. I thought everything right down to the packaging of the Jaws 2 DVD was better than the first, and that shouldn't be.I'm not sure who was behind the making of the Jaws DVD, but I think they should re-release this title, and let the ones who did such a good job on the Jaws 2 DVD handle it.	2.0	The movie itself deserves 5 stars, but not this DVD!	2000-12-15	1	1	0

Jorgensen ""D C Jorgensen Sledking"""	Jaws is simply the greatest monster movie, and it is also a great film on many levels, and considering its worldwide notoriety, I wont go off on that tangent.Jaws 2 is simply a low grade remake.I have the distinct pleasure in saying that I have seen all the Jaws movies at the theater, some of them on opening day. As a fan of sharks and movies, its an addition I suppose considering that I have also rented everything at Blockbuster that has a shark on the cover or in the title. My expertise on the genre is admittedly self proclaimed, but if I get some business cards stating as such, maybe my following review with have greater credence.Jaws 3 is a very bad movie. Starting with the writing, production, acting, horrific 3D effects and most notably, a waste of a big shark gone amuck in Sea World. The hope that the shark will take control of the park is the only redeeming value of the story, but that is dashed. Why didnt the shark eat at least 4 of those show waterskiers? Because it is a very bad movie. The shark is right behind them when they fall, but they get out of the water just in time. The opportunity to turn the Jaws movies into a dynasty was destroyed here. Let the shark feed and live in a controlled habitat. Up until 2004, there had never been a great white shark held in captivity for more than two weeks. This movie could have served as a platform for shark observation and debauchery. This movie could have allowed the importance of shark preservation to be its theme, while showing numerous attacks of workers accidently falling into the water, the shark occassionally breaking out or maybe the brakes fail on a tour bus and it flies into the lagoon. Now thats entertainment with numerous possiblities. But noooo!Jaws 4 on the other hand at the very least has good people eating scenes. Granted this shark has issues and the motivation of the shark to seek revenge against the Brody family is laughable, it does at least provide laughs. And I suppose some food for thought, sharks are people too. It also provides Micheal Caine falling for Mrs. Brody, proving there is life after the unfortanate loss of Chief (shark killer) Brody, as well as letting us witness the grown Brody kid get eaten. The special effects are better than Jaws 3, and the attacks are more frequent. Shark movies need to have shark attacks, and Jaws 4 delivers. I give this 5 stars as only a comparison to Jaws 3, when compared to Jaws it gets ZERO.Sure its disappointing that the shark gets blown up in the original film, but this is argueably the only movie that is better than the book.	5.0	An overview of the Jaws films	2005-02-19	2	0	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2GLFKM6IBYRP7	Dean Sullivan	'Jaws' is a landmark, and very important piece of movie history.  Spielberg put his magic, along with a strong cast (including Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss), and a script which was original at its time (ok, since we've had the sequels, Lake Placid and  numerous other 'when animals attack' type movies) to make a film which  everybody in the World has at least heard of, and which had incredible  success at the box office.The script by Peter Benchley, was actually  loosely based upon a series of shark attacks which rocked a east coast  American beach in the early 1900's (Yes, history has left enough crumbs to  assume that the 'rogue' shark theory is not only possible, but very  probable). Benchley, wrote about the Great White shark, and there is good  reason why they choose this type of shark. The Great White is the most  impressive living creature in the planet today; it is the true master of  its domain, a perfect killing machine.The music by John Williams really  adds to the tension, and delivers maximum suspense. The shark does look a  little dated when compared to 1999's 'Deep Blue Sea' (a fun film), but this  has a lot more to offer. It's a pity Spielberg didn't do to 'Jaws' what  Lucas did to 'Star Wars', using the kind of effects used in 'Deep Blue  Sea'.This film is in my all time top ten, and always will be. It still  has me checking the water before I swim in the sea.	5.0	I'll catch him and kill him for ten	2000-04-28	75	50	25

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3UW23DBF2KHWC	Denis Vukosav	"The Jaws directed by Steven Spielberg is classic horror/thriller movie, released in 1975, about one summer on Amity Island when Sheriff Martin Brody discovered the remains of a shark attack victim. Due to his decision to close the beaches for swimming conflict with Mayor and several local businessmen will break out.  When another victim is found killed in same way and victim's mother puts out a bounty on the shark, community will become full of hunters and fisherman hoping to earn the reward. But a local experienced guy, Quint, offers to kill the creature and with help from Brody and the other guy, Matt Hooper, from the Oceanographic Institute they are going to start hunting the Great White shark. When first encounter would take place, Brody would realize this is the bigger challenge than he could ever imagine...Although considered as one of the Spielberg's less glorious works comparing to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T., The Jaws is still after almost 40 years passed movie masterpiece. Together with editor Verna Fields he managed to create an unbelievably good and thrilling atmosphere with immaculate pacing, resulting in story following such coherent line from movie start to its end. Although movie plot is fantastic, the movie excels with beautifully created characters played by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and even after all these years it's impossible to imagine any other actor playing their roles. Another outstanding movie element that contributes to the atmosphere is John Williams score which fits perfectly with the action on screen, contributing to the effect of fear and anticipation.On this edition, The Jaws appeared on single-sided, double-layered DVD in an aspect ratio of approximately 2.35:1. While most of the movie appeared sharp and clear enough there are some parts that look little bit fuzzy and indistinct with some noticeable softness especially in wider shots that revealed some edge enhancement. Colors are strong, black levels deep and shadow detail is acceptable considering that greatest part of the movie was shot in sunlight, helping in creation of nicely saturated and rich colors.Considering the sound, there is no original mono sound on this DVD, which is a shame because this is a collector's edition and you know, collectors want to have original feature as well. The 5.1 remixed track is using mostly the forward speakers but it displays very good range, while the rears are mainly used during underwater scenes. The DTS track seems a bit more active and it's giving much better feeling, the effects and music sounding more natural.Speaking about extras, this edition includes the 59 minutes long documentary ""The Making of Jaws"" that is more than half shorter from the original included in some previous movie editions. Included are also few Deleted scenes and Outtakes which were also shortened but they are still fun, and a 12-question trivia game which would test your movie knowledge.  On this DVD, collectors could also find the ""Shark World"" offering few screens of text information about sharks accompanied by photos, around 630 production photos and storyboards, three trailers and screen saver.Although this movie is a masterpiece, this DVD release is unfortunately not the right collector's one especially considering extras that could be stored on another disk if on first one was not enough space. Nevertheless for those who don't have Blu-Ray this edition could be recommended at least because of the movie with decent picture and sound.For all others new combined edition where Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and UltraViolet movie version are received is even more recommended."	5.0	Masterpiece movie with decent picture and sound, extras would not be enough for collectors...	2013-08-01	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	This movie is a classic and the mother of all sea animals vs. humans.  Sure there has been movies about killer whales, big snakes and other movies with sharks and also other &quot;JAWS&quot; movies but the first movie will always be regarded as the best out there right now.This 25th Anniversary DVD was one of the most highly anticipated DVD's out there.  Of course, there was a debate because although the movie won an Academy for best sound, purists cried foul when they heard the movie would be released in DTS and Digital Dolby instead of Mono.  Well, I prefer to watch my DVD's in the best sound as possible including this movie and thus the DTS version is the way to go.  You literally feel that you are swimming in the beach with the splashes heard all around you.  It's awesome!  So, the audio is great and the movie looks pretty good despite the fact that it has been 25 years.Also, this DVD is packed!  You get the documentary of &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot;, deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards and so much more that this DVD will keep you busy for the weekend.A highly recommended DVD!	5.0	A classic movie which sounds DTS great!	2001-07-03	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AZ1H3VLCDR298	Derrick Thomas	Jaws is on of the best horror movies ever made, dealing with a rogue great white that terrorizes a small beach community. The first half deals with Roy Scheider as the sheriff of the island trying ro maintain order after a couple were found, well, eaten. The second half deals with Sheider, Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert, and Robert Shaw as the old fisherman in charge of hunting it down. Like the main review, I thought the boat sequence was great, you realize it's the shark doing the hunting!

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AB1B71UDDKI5	"Dgreen2k5 ""Derek"""	"Kid, I suggest you start taking lessons on what great films are all about.  This is a great film under the cliches of modern films about this subject matter.  What this movie excells in is its suspense and control over the audience.  Spielberg insisted that the shark not be seen for the first hour because he knew that the audience reaction would be that much greater when the shark finally is seen.  It works very well and nobody can deny that it scared them when they first saw it, unless they saw ""Open Water"" or ""Deep Blue Sea"" first.  This movie can also be called the first summer blockbuster.  It was released during the summer in a time when it was thought that releasing a movie over the summer was not a good move, as people supposedly didn't go to movies during the summer.  It became the most successful movie of all time for good reason.  It gave audiences what they were looking for:  a good scare.  Today, it still has the ability to do that.  All aspects are great.  The acting from the supposed non-stars is terrific, the music has become classic, and the editing won an Oscar.  If you're looking for a great, scary movie that will entertain as much as it scares, this is a good one.  Concerning the DVD:  I'll probably buy the 30th anniversary edition, even though I already own the 25th anniversary edition.  I think it's worth it."	5.0	Terrific Movie	2005-07-07	5	3	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3L394733BYGYI	Dick Luzenski	Well, well, well, Spielberg has finally broke down and started to release movies on dvd...i was quite suprised to see this film available in the format, PLEASENTLY suprised.  I must say that the Jaws collector's editon  dvd is far superior to any other format available for this film.  The sound  quality is pleasing, but not the greatest, but when you've listened to the  film in mono for seven years, it seems quite refreshing. New sound effects  have been added in, but not to worry, the entire thing was done under  Spielberg's suprivision.  The very begining in which the pulsating theme is  first heard fills the entire sound field...a nice surprise.  And the sound  is directional often passing from right, center, to left.  Bass is toned  down a bit, but it actually sounds better this way.  The bass seems to have  more of a role whenever a victim is takin, and also durring william's  pulsating theme.  Picture quality is fine.  Most notable are the sound fx  for when the shark is finally detonated, and the rapid gun fire which  triggers it to do so.  Bass is greatly emphasized here.  great picture,  great sound, for a film thats 25 years old.  Cool extras too.  The  documentary is much longer than i expected.  The game is fun too.  a MUST  HAVE.	5.0	Wow...how refreshing	2000-07-14	4	2	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2RFR3QSF0VOVG	Disciple	A sci-fi, horror classic for the ages, Jaws is the first of many Steven Spielberg movies that rank as blockbusters. It has a musical score unlike any other (especially the opening sequence) by John Williams. Jaws stars Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss with co-stars Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton.

It has a great storyline that is backed up with great special effects for the time at which it was made along with great acting.  No one could portray a better captain that Robert Shaw.  Every aspect of this movie was put together nearly perfect to create a not only terrifying story, but also a fantastic movie.  It has all the great qualities that any movie critic would ask for in a movie which make this a must own movie, and the DVD only makes it that much better.  The special features added are quirky and fun.  And for someone who absolutely loves the movie, they are must have collector's items. I haven't seen the screen saver due to my lack of computer DVD rom, but I'm excited to try it out myself.  The movie was the first movie to ever break $1 million at the box office, and it still doesn't let any viewers down today.  It's still one of the greatest movies ever created and has definitely cemented it's place in movie history.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A11PTCZ2FM2547	"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here"""	"JAWS was one of the few movies I saw in the theater that literally had me white-knuckling the arms of my seat.  (Which meant the popcorn and pop tumbled out of my lap and onto the floor.)  What a great time I had, all those years ago in the cinema, as watching this thriller was one whale (shark?) of a gasp-fest; I remember walking out of the lobby thinking, ""This Spielberg guy might have a future in filmmaking.""Duh. . .But aside from all the obvious plusses (great story, suspense, characters, timing, musical score, dialogue, etc.) that make watching this film, over the years, such a delight, I tend to marvel at two noteworthy components of this instant classic.  The first is the interaction of the Big Three (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss); the way they play off one another, while rubbing elbows on that tiny boat, is a marvel to behold.  And Shaw's monologue--as his character relives his experiences as a survivor of the USS Indianapolis--is perhaps the most riveting monologue in all of cinema.The other component involves the mechanics of making the movie itself.  Just think of it:  The difficulties of simulating the power of a giant shark tearing apart a boat in the open ocean (with the limited technology at the time) must have been extraordinary, yet Spielberg and crew accomplish the insurmountable--and make it look totally believable.  Accordingly, JAWS is the product of filmmakers at the pinnacle of their craft, which makes it as much fun to watch today as the first time I spilled my soda.--D.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQWIC41BKO59Z	docbyrd@scsn.net	Jaws is a motion picture that was well ahead of it's time. The special effects displayed in this movie were not computer generated, but generated from the point of view of realism.  In 1975 they still thought they could  TRAIN a shark, and not create one.  And yet, in cinematic history, the  biggest money maker of 1975, there is a man made, larger than life sized  shark - caught on film in the movie Jaws.  A movie that went way over  schedule, and way over budget,and yet was produced and emptied the beaches  for the summer.  Not a mindless horror movie, but an intricate  psychological analysis of people and their environment.  Not a movie of  gore - but suspense and action!  This movie, can never be replaced or  topped. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER JAWS.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	Just goes to show that they just don't make horror movies the way they used to in Hollywood.  The thing about Jaws is that it goes beyond a horror film....it is a masterpiece.  While today's horror films continue to pour on the blood and guts and sacrificing B-actors and a poor story/script, Jaws shows us that a horror film can be big, directed well, contain a tight story and feature top A-list actors in Hollywood.  Chances are you have seen this film by now, if not, jump on in...the water's fine.If there is one negative surrounding Jaws is that it eventually produced some embarassing sequals.  If there is one negative thing about the first Jaws, its that the shark can look fake.  Ironically, it looked better to me than any of the sequals, and we don't really see much of the shark until the films end.  That's the beauty of the horror surounding this film.  We see helpless people swimming in the water, and then out of nowhere the screaming and panic begins, without even seeing the shark.  That is the real scare to this film.  In its day, there were definetly some intense scenes of blood (not so much gore except for a guy's leg falling off).  One scene still compete's today with any blood-filled horror film and that is near the end of Jaws, when the shark jumps on the boat and Quint (Robert Shaw) falls into its mouth, wrestling for about 20 seconds with his lower torso being chomped.What makes the film so accomplished in the end is much more than the horror.  The characters are superb, and the wonderfully written script is used so well by the actors.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw share incredible chemistry in this film, with scene after scene of frustrations, anger, joy and cooperation.  Watching these three in action is a show in itself.  Though not known for its comedy aspects, I found little lines and scenes here and there to be extremely funny, given the nature of things.What bugs me the most about the dvd, is when I have watched Jaws on television there are several extended scenes (not deleted scenes) that are not included on dvd.  I actually like these scenes too and miss them when I watch my dvd.Jaws is a 5 star classic - easily.  It has gone down as one of the greatest horror film accomplishments of all time.  It certainly is not the scariest movie you will see today, but it is an A+ in every regard.

In fact, there is nothing spectacular  about either the sound or the picture. But it will not disappoint. It is a  solid piece of filmmaking and a good quality DVD to complement it. Along  with the movie, there are enough extras to keep the viewer entertained for  several hours. An hour-long documentary offers a great many insights into  the making and marketing of the movie. And it's always fun to see the  appearance many years later of the actors and filmmakers from a 25-year-old  movie. Their comments reflect how well this film has aged. These types of  documentaries help ease the sting of no commentary track. The movie is  still as much fun as it was the first time we saw the shark rear its head  from the water and heard the police chief utter, &quot;You're going to need  a bigger boat.&quot; And with this DVD we learn the story behind all the  hullabaloo we've heard for years about the mechanical shark not working  properly.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2BEU7GPGNIG44	Dorrie Wheeler	"There have been a lot of people griping. Why release a 30th anniversary edition of Jaws when there was a 25th anniversary edition? Okay, so there have been multiple releases but this release is the grand daddy of them all and fans of the classic shark tale will be pleased. The two disc set is Jaws overload and a must have for the classic film collector. Jaws was director Stephen Spielberg's first huge blockbuster movie. It was the first movie to hit the $100 million dollar mark. This was a big deal back in the mid 70's. The film spawned sequels and even a amusement park attraction at Universal Studios in the mid 80's. The film also did wonders for Martha's Vineyard's tourism industry.Okay...you know what the movie is about. Big scary shark terrorizes people, man says, ""You're going to need a bigger boat,"" on to the extras. The best thing I like about the set is that it includes a full color booklet. Not a little mini book but a thick little black photo journal. The booklet includes pictures and details from the film. I like the book a lot. There are movie quotes and facts about the film in the book.The extras are what sets this release apart from previous releases. You have the choice between Dobly Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1 Aufio and Original Theatrical Mono Audio track. The set includes deleted scenes and out takes and a never before seen interview with director Stephen Spielberg. Disc 2 equally impressive. It includes a 2 hour documentary about the film. The documentary is amazing. Another feature on the disc is the Jaws Archive which includes production photo's, storyboards, and more.

By keeping the camera at water level it only hightened the suspence.  And the truth is that was all a  mistake.  We were supposed to see the shark, Bruce, throughout the entire  movie.  However the Bruce did not always work properly, but Spielberg had  to shoot something, so we get a classic.  The characters were unforgetable,  and so is this film.

Helping no end are a cast of seasoned professionals who gave Spielberg all that a Director could ask for. It never goes over the line to become too maudlin and, thanks to the performance of Dreyfuss and Shaw, ably abetted by straight man, Scheider, possesses the element of humor which saves it from being a horror film. Well worth watching another time if you saw it some years ago. Of course, if you haven't yet seen it, be sure to make the occasion to do so.	5.0	38 YearsOld and Hasn't Aged a Bit	2013-08-03	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2TWIZ33KJCQ54	"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP"""	"- - BECAUSE WE ARE ALL AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!IT BEGINS WHEN -----It begins when a ""summer girl"" goes for a midnight swim and, after being reported missing, is later discovered on the beach --in pieces. Is it a shark attack, a boating accident, or what? After all, all we saw were a few tugs and screams. But was there something hidden in the water? Or was it as the mayor suggested, a simple drowning followed by a collsion with a boat's propeller for the ""summer girl""?BUT THEN ---After a short and sweet coverup by the business-oriented mayor and town council, more swimmers and fisherman get mangled at sea and there are witnesses to some of these slayings, ending the chance of both a continued coverup and a lucrative summer business for Amity Island [flimed at Martha's Vineyard].During the Amity versus Jaws segment, we see more and more of the shark and more graphic depictions of the shark and its dining habits.AH --- BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING ---Then, the second and primary theme develops. Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a scientist from the ""Oceanographic Institute"", and Robert Shaw as Captain Quint, an off-the-wall sailor set sail to kill the ""Great White"" that is turning the water red around the seaside community of Amity Island.YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!This part of the movie is a combination wild buddy adventure and monster movie. However, the basic theme that has induced fear into audiences and all swimmers afterward is pervasive now aboard ship, during the hunt for Jaws. You see, no one sees Jaws until it is too late, if at all. The crew of three now simply wait for something to come up, out of the dark waters below, and literally crash onto their small fishing boat. Therein lies the charm of Jaws -- it can come out without warning and simply tear you or your loved ones to shreds. Even on a boat, a dock, or within shallow, patrolled beaches, we are all at risk of becoming a meal for a monster. When the film is over the risk still remains. If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain. This is what makes propaganda so effective, and here it is at its best -- YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER! Wherever did we get that idea from?IN THE END: [plot spoilers below]Spielberg gives us a very satisfying end which does differ somewhat from the book. Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting. Next, as the ship is sinking, Chief Brody, after repeated shots with a rifle does get the oxygen tank to explode in Jaws' mouth for a dramatic end to this bad fish. Afterward, Hooper makes a surprise return from what we assumed was a sure death within a mangled anti-shark cage. The film closes with the two buddies paddling toward the distant shore using two of the floating shark barrels to float on as they kick their way away from the camera and toward home.BUT ITS NEVER REALLY OVER BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT JAWS IS STILL OUT THERE!ABOUT THE DVD: [TOP PICK: 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN]There are at least 5 releases on DVD that I know of. In all cases, the film appears about the same, the differences being in the features and whether it is a Widescreen or Full-Frame Format. The last release is the 30th Anniversary Edition which differs from the Anniversary Edition [25th Anniversary in small print] only in the featurettes. One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release. Both Anniversary releases have some deleted scenes.

Afterwards, the shark kills a little boy and Brody becomes scared. This is where Quint (Robert Shaw) steps in. He offers too kill the shark, but for a lot of money. They don`t hire him, instead they do what they planed. They kill a shark but it`s the wrong one, and the mayor is too greedy too stop the people from going in the water. Then there is another attack, this time Brody`s son is witniss too it, putting him into shock. This causes the mayor too rethink Quint.

Jaws does have some great extra: a 12 question trivia game, deleted scenes, and a few outtakes; but I really wanted to hear  commentary.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2DABXVFYXC5JY	Eileen	That is one of the most classic lines in the movie, JAWS.  and along with  that the movie itself is classic.  From the brilliant screen adaptation of  Peter Benchley's book to the excellent direction of a young Steven  Spielberg to the chilling, all too familiar orchastra music by John  Williams ...I could go on forever about this film. One thing I forgot about  was just how great the acting was in this film, did Robert Shaw even get  nominated for an OSCAR? He should have won it!  and of course, Richard  Dreyfeuss is brilliant in everything he does.  The acting all around is  just great.  One other thing about JAWS is that it is just as scary now as  it was the first time I saw it.  It is full of great suspense, action, a  great story that gets you hooked in everytime.  I can see clearly that  Hitchcock was one of Spielberg's inspirations.  It is merely the suspense  of the movie that brings us to the edge of our seats.  The movie is almost  half over before we actually see the shark.  I think that is what makes  this film one of the best of it's genre.  Today there are too many gory  bloodbaths of films, we need to get back to the basics, or we could just  buy the dvd JAWS...I know I'm glad I did.	5.0	YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOAT....	2000-07-31	0	0	0

The casting is sheer perfection (especially Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper).  The dialog is priceless (""I hate the water.""  ""I can't imagine why."").  The music is beyond perfection (I put it up there with Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho).  The story is simple and to the point.  Fake shark and all, this is one fantastic movie.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A4FAPQKQQLJY1	Elite	"If you haven't seen this movie by now, then you must be living under a rock or in a deep, dark cave. ""Jaws"" is the story of a great-white shark that terrorizes the waters of a popular vacation town. The shark picks a few swimmers off one-by-one and the sheriff of the town (Roy Scheider) is put in charge of taking care of this problem. With the help of a biologist (Richard Dryfuss) and a crazy shark hunter (Robert Shaw), the three set out on a quest to catch the gigantic shark. Little do they know, they would become the hunted.""Jaws"" was made in 1975. This was the days before special effects. So, the shark had to be mechanical. Much has been made about how hard it was to make this movie. The shark kept breaking down and the film went way over budget. The end result is definately worth all the problems. This is the best shark film ever made and was genuinely scary, even to this day. This film literally made people think twice about going swimming back in the 70's, and it makes you think for a second even by today's standards.The story is from a best-selling novel. Apparently not much was changed from the book. The acting was very good. Scheider, Dryfuss, and Shaw carry the movie. Shaw, in particular, was amazing. His quirky portrayl of a shark hunter, is the highlight of the cast. Scheider plays the everyman role here well. He just keeps the movie afloat until the meat of the flick kicks in. I thought Dryfuss did a great job, as well.I don't think I have to go into this movie much further. Most people on this planet have seen it at least once. I think it is a classic and definately a must-own DVD. I enjoyed watching this movie again and reliving the fears that it brought with it.Special Features: There is a very good documentary about the making of the movie. There's some deleted scenes and a couple outtakes. A trivia game, shark world, and a few trailers round out the supplements."	5.0	Swimming?

Of course it put the fear of God in me back in 1975. But once I got over that is is just a great movie. I saw this at Emory in Atlanta a few years ago and the guy who was running the film for a festival they were having mentioned about all of the firsts that JAWS had done or set records for but he ended his speech with flat out it is just really a great movie I think that just somes it up. Plus I love watching all the young people still screaming there heads off at certain moments in the movie. Speilberg hit this one out of the park and set the standerd for others to follow.

I have to say also that most new titles in series usualy stink.Jaws is a great suspense movie and the edition is very very good. Sound, Picture, package and extras.If the evolution in special effects sometimes is great (Lord of the rings as an example) most of them just permit Movie companies to make stupid films, with stupid storyboards, with ridiculous representations.But go for me, this movie is before that time and so it relies on everything else, atnosphere, suspense, imagination and without compromising picture quality and sound wich are great.Go for this one.	5.0	Watch out for that Bite	2005-10-12	2	1	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQZH7YTWQPOBE	Enjolras	Jaws is a movie that needs no introduction. It has set the standard for creature horror movies for decades. I only recently saw it and have to say even after all these years it holds up extremely well. The movie creates compelling, realistic characters whom you actually find yourself caring about. This was (and is) a novelty for a horror movie. More importantly, the movie is subtle, partly be design and partly because of limitations in the special effects of the era. Viewers never really see the shark until the end of the movie, but the film does a brilliant job playing on the audience's suspense. Even when you know the shark is going to attack soon, you never quite know whom it's going to attack next. Overall, it's Spielberg at his finest and is a wonderful example of how a good script and careful editing can go a long way.	5.0	A genuine classic	2012-03-21	5	3	2

This is one of those old thrillers that you simply CANNOT miss. Yeah yeah, everyone knows that not all sharks are dangerous (we scare them more than they scare us), but this is a MOVIE. And boy is it a movie! It's not only the classic scares that make the film, but the characters Brody and Quint and Hooper are all equally interesting. It's almost a spectacle when these men of different backgrounds try to take down the big one in the second half of the film. Plus, the dialogue is easily recognizable (""I got no spit.""). The one thing that bothers me about this film is that the shark kills my favorite character near the end. What a shame.But other than that, this classic remains a classic. The sequels . . . meh.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2D8CUJPOSRPNA	Erik North	In the pantheon of all-time great horror and suspense films, JAWS is not merely a quarter-billion dollar box office blockbuster, but excellent cinema to boot.  From a popular novel by Peter Benchley, this quickly became a legendary film--and it's not hard to see why.  With Steven Spielberg as director, and a trio of leading men who give high-caliber performances, it's no wonder that this remains one of the top movies of its kind.The film's plot is well known: Amity Island is beset by a series of attacks carried out by a mysterious Great White shark, and the powers-that-be don't want to cause a panic and destroy the summer tourism season.  Roy Scheider is Amity's police chief Martin Brody, whose calls to temporarily shut down the beaches until the shark can be killed are thwarted by a mayor (Murray Hamilton) and a town council more concerned with making bucks than saving people's lives.  Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert who confirms the presence of a Great White in the local waters.  Robert Shaw is Quint, the local fisherman who is half-crazy from the start and just itching to have his own Moby Dick-like showdown.When the shark causes a total panic on the beach on the 4th of July, it is up to these three men to hunt down the elusive fish.  But once out on the open water, these three hunters also become the hunted; at one point, the shark jumps out from the water, and frightens Scheider so much that he tells Shaw, famously: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;After taking an endless pounding from the shark, Shaw's boat the &quot;Orca&quot; begins to flounder.  Shaw is eventually eaten whole by the shark, and Dreyfuss is temporarily lost under water.  It is up to Scheider, a man with a severe case of hydrophobia, to kill the shark.  He shoves a scuba tank into the fish's mouth, aims, fires, and blows the shark into a million pieces.The making of JAWS was extremely arduous and difficult.  Spielberg was faced day after day with problems involving the mechanical shark that was used on location; the thing refused to function properly half the time.  The budget and schedule swelled to the point that Spielberg almost got fired.  Ironically, even though the shark was to be seen throughout the film, because of the technical problems, Spielberg resorted to the tried-and-true method of mere suggestion.This turned out to be the smartest thing.  Now JAWS was no longer a standard-issue monster movie.  Like Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, it was now very much in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically the Master's 1963 film THE BIRDS.  Spielberg's use of Hitchcock's suspense-building techniques, combined with the fine performances of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfyss, helped to drive JAWS to the top of the box office charts and onto three Oscar wins: editing, sound, and John Williams' now-legendary, cello-driven score.Although followed by three vastly inferior sequels and a lot of lousy imitations, JAWS has lost none of its gut-grabbing power.  It is essential viewing to this very day, especially for horror and suspense film buffs.	5.0	The Film You Can Really Sink Your Teeth Into	2002-01-11	1	1	0

Not that it looked bad at all in the last special dvd release but wow what a difference the upgrade makes. And the sound is much better, too.And silly as it sounds, I love that they used the original classic poster for the cover. It is my favorite movie poster ever.What a pleasant surprise to find Roy Scheider narrated the documentary The Shark is Still Working. I wish he had lived to see its release, may he rest in peace,, but I was also shocked and saddened at a number of actors and others associated with Jaws that have passed.You also get the excellent two hour 'making of' documentary, which was on the previous 30th anniversary dvd. I should have realized it before but this was the documentary that made me understand just how incredible this undertaking was, to have a mechanical shark on the ocean and get it to work? Thirty-seven years ago?You get the blu ray, loaded with extras, a dvd copy, and you get a downloaded version (which I have not yet done and probably won't).I cannot say how much I love this film. It is my favorite. It always has been, always will be.I still get an indescribable feeling at the end when Hooper and Brody are kicking back to shore and that wonderful ending music by Williams is playing.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1S31XLRRB11US	F. Adcock	"I take issue with those who are grumpy about Universal's decision to re-release ""Jaws"".  It must be pointed out that having a new edition of a DVD released five years ago doesn't automatically mandate a purchase.  If a prospective customer chooses to hang on to that previous DVD incarnation and pass on this new one, so be it.  As new technology is invented, there will be other, future editions, I assure you.This new ""Special Edition"" sounds better than the former release on DVD.  The Academy Award winning sound has more bite than before, cleaner and more gripping. most noticable in the separation of voices from left to right.  Gunshots and explosions are more deafening now, and play better in surround mode.  The whale calls in one quiet scene have more distance in 5.1, although they are barely audible on TV alone.I agree that a feature commentary would have made this issue more ""sellable"", and there certainly was plenty of room to add trailors, premiere footage, interviews on the ""Today Show"" and whatnot.  But what we have here isn't bad.This new disc set includes the complete 2-hour documentary ""The Making of Jaws"", which was also on the former DVD, but whittled down to one hour.  To be honest, the one-hour version actually gives us everything we need to know, and is edited with great care.For anyone who has not purchased ""Jaws"" in the past, this would be a great place to start."	5.0	If You Don't Already Have It . . .	2005-06-20	4	3	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"""Jaws,"" which debuted on DVD five years ago in a silver anniversary edition, circles back with a 30th-year effort that chums the marketplace with upgraded extras and packaging. There are no noticeable improvements in audio or video quality.Steven Spielberg, as usual, provides no commentary. But the director has plenty to say in Laurent Bouzereau's fine documentary ""The Making of Jaws,"" created for the 1995 laserdisc. In 2000, Universal gutted the 125-minute docu to under an hour, so it remains basically unseen. The film launched Bouzereau's triple-threat career as a making-of specialist, now with more than 130 titles to his credit.The hard-luck shoot's history gets a full review, including the myriad problems with mechanical sharks. Spielberg recalls ""Jaws"" as a ""fun movie to watch, but not a fun movie to make.""Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider vie for camera time, spinning terrific stories. For the record: Scheider insists he never referred to the great white as Bruce, and never will. (Spielberg named the killing machine after his lawyer.)New to DVD is ""From the Set,"" a 9-minute British TV piece hailing from 1974. The 26-year-old Spielberg, hot off ""The Sugarland Express,"" is interviewed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. He looks like a pop star but talks like a savvy pro. (""Young, courageous and stupid,"" he later calls himself.) The high concept was ""Duel"" at sea.The anamorphic widescreen video (2.35:1) comes ported over from the older DVD, not really a bad thing. Images are reasonably bright and enjoyable, but typical of the era they're soft and grainy. Minor speckling surfaces throughout, a defect that will have to wait for the 35th year, apparently.Universal released two ""Jaws"" DVDs in 2000, one with Dolby Digital 5.1 and the other with DTS. The new DVD features both formats as well as mono for old salts yearning for the bad old days of 1970s movie audio. The surround tracks sound great, especially John Williams' thumping shark theme, its menace amplified by watery-grave lows from the subwoofer. Go with DTS if you have it."	3.0	No video upgrade?

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1XOZW9A8TL7JY	Four Star Film Fan	This is arguably the first great modern blockbuster and it had such a tremendous cultural impact. Who knew a rogue shark, a wonderfully chilling score, and an isolated setting off the east coast could send so many shivers up the spines of audiences. Jaws is the classic man vs. nature story and proves how deadly it can turn out. The movie that kept millions of people from going in the Ocean in the 70s, Jaws tells of a shark terrorizing a tourist trap off the coast of Massachusetts. The policeman (Roy Scheider) must team up with a marine scientist (Richard Dreyfuss), and a hunter (Robert Shaw) to bring down the monster. Together they embark to try to hunt down and kill this menace of the deep. Little do they know how dangerous this creature is. When they finally meet they are in for a few unpleasant surprises. It is evident that either man or best must win or die. There is no compromise when man goes up against shark. This early Speilberg film was a glimpse of good thing to come and successfully began his great career.	4.0	Jaws (1975)	2013-06-01	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3IKBHODOTYYHM	"fra7299 ""fra7299"""	I remember being very young and seeing this movie when it first came out, and being afraid to go in the water for awhile. I recently purchased this movie and watched it for the first time in years just to see if Speilberg's movie still had as intense effect on the screen as it did almost 30 years ago. The answer is: definitely.This was the first in the line of &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies, and, unlike many that flop today, this is a movie that has stood the test of time. The story of a Long Island town that is terrorized by an enormous great white shark is done with great direction.It is a simple story really, but the action and acting are not overdone, and even for it's time, the movie is still has great quality.  There is not too much of the mystery surrounding the shark given away in the first half of the movie, and this creates a good build up of tension and suspense that this genre of movie needs.The camera angles that are created add to the overall quality of the film. For instance, while Brody is on the boat we first get a glimpse of the sea from an overhead angle, and then a glimpse of the boat underneath. The suspense comes in waiting for the great white. Jaws is still a classic, and the kind of movie that you think about when you go to the beach and take your first step into the water.	4.0	Still A Classic	2004-06-24	0	0	0

Too bad I was very busy running a small business during the 1970s, I would have liked to see it in a theatre.But this is not a time for sadness, it's a time to celebrate the joy of seeing this rousing tale! I think the best thing about it is that it's about a shark. Sharks are very exciting, aren't they? Of course they are! So it only makes sense that a movie about sharks would be one of the greatest movies ever produced, and I don't say that lightly!Men on the sea battling a fierce eating machine, oh what a thrill! I can't wait to see it again and I look forward to seeing more movies about sharks. I understand there's a sequel to this movie out there, well I promise you that it will be joining its brother on my shelf.Evil it is that the highest rating that can placed on a product here is five stars.

As a kid I rented this film so many times I suddenly realized i could haved bought it. But now I do. &quot;Jaws&quot; is a classic movie. Packed with sheer terror, suspense, and the best score films could ever have. Who can forget it? It's 50% percent of the film's success. This blockbuster film adapted from Peter Benchley's novel has a huge killer shark terrorizing a New England summer resort. We know that. The people who are trying to stop is Chief Brody (Roy schiender, great performance), shark specialist Hooper (Richard dreyfuss, in fine and humerous form) and &quot;crazy&quot; shark hunter (Robert Shaw, I love this actor, he gives the best performance in this film, who can forget his USS Indianapolis speech?)How can I count the many infamous scenes in this film? But first I got to give nod to Steven Speilberg, he's the master of suspense (after Alfred Hitchcock).Back to my favorite scenes. I love the opening scenes with a pretty girl being chewed up by the shark. I also love the ending with Quint(Shaw) also being chewed up. Chief Brody also blowing up the shark is unforgetable. Luckily Spielberg didn't show the shark until half way into this film, it's pretty fake. But I'm not dissing the shark, it's the reason why this film was a blockbuster. In summary, it's one of the greatest movies of all time and should be in everyone's film library. Go &quot;Jaws&quot;!	5.0	THE BEST SHARK MOVIE EVER!	2003-12-13	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2HU94KJ4SUFR0	"Garrett Stiger ""Gar"""	Jaws is nearly perfect in every way. It was the first real summer blockbuster, and to this day it's still the best. Unlike most of today's blockbusters, Jaws was blessed with a superb cast, a fantastic director, and a good screenplay.Most of Jaws's success can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's masterful direction. He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less, thereby giving the audience more. By not showing the shark for the first hour of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more thrilling.Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written. Now granted, this is not a brilliant character study but the script is more character driven than most of today's blockbuster scripts. Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions.The cast does a fantastic job at giving life to the characters of the script. Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable. Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea-worn fisherman, Quint. Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist, Matt Hooper. Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife, Ellen. Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy mayor of Amity; the town endangered by the shark.Many people complain that the shark looks too fake. Do sharks really look all that life-like to begin with? I personally think the shark effects could have been much worse; they weren't that bad.Bill Butler's cinematography is first-rate. He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level.Although there are a few continuity errors, Verna Fields's editing is very fast paced. Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first hour of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.John Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason. His simple use of a few notes to characterize the shark was ingenious. He brings the suspense/action scenes to life with his energetic score.All of these fine qualities are why Jaws has remained one of my favorite films for quite some time.	5.0	Jaws is a fine example of film at its finest.	2000-03-15	11	8	3

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1G9FX1KV45N41	Gary Selikow	For years after this movie, people all over the world complained about a phobia of swimming.The opening scene with a beautiful young woman, Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie), skinny dipping and then being sucked under the water to her death, sets the scene and made Susan into a celebrity though she played such a short part (short but memorable).The movie always keeps up the suspense anytime anyone is swimming, and keeps one wondering always who the next victim will be.One can ask however why Chrissie could put up such a fight, while the shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) was swallowed up by Jaws towards the end of the movie pretty quickly.Good scenes at the beach, especially the mass panic that was created everytime the shark was sighted and all the bathers stampeded out the water.Although one could also ask why their were so many people in the water when the whole town knew about the shark scare.Also how could Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) have let his own kids anywhere near the beach knowing what he knew.Big break for Richard Dreyfuss as the excitable shark expert Matt Hooper.Good scene with the kids waving to the camera during a news report- seems like these were not trained extras but was a impromptu performance by a bunch of kids asked to pose for themovie, and of course wanted to get into the picture seen by the world.Fanatastic and chilling close ups of the Great White during the second half of the movie.This was a classic of the seventies, whatever anyone might say about the filmography with the hindsight of today's technology.	4.0	Some thoughts on the 1975 movie	2007-11-05	5	4	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A342AZPTC0QE57	Gaz	"In this world of rotten monster movies, where special effects dominate and hideous mutants rip off various limbs and cause havoc... it's nice to go back and be shown how it's really done. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, Speilberg directs masterfully, exhuding masses of tension from his principle trio and obviously from the shark itself. The creature admittadly has its technical limitations, but those are forgiven in the film's brilliant first half, where the shark isn't shown... merely it's camera-view and it's grisly results. This armed with John Williams' unforgettable score will get far more hearts beating than any CGI monster - one scene in particular with a fisherman frantically swimming back to shore as an unseen Jaws (dragging a huge chunk of a bridge) comes towards him. As his feet scrabble up the wood to safety, you'll finally realise how simple Speilberg's techniques are - in simplicity he's got your pulse racing, without too much gore or mess.There's a real human element here. These atrocities have consequences (shown by Mrs. Kintner) and we truly care about Brody (Scheider) Hooper (Dreyfuss) and Quinn (Shaw). The film's second half, as our trio head off to kill the shark, leaving the island behind and going pretty much one-on-one with the beast, is tension all the way. This time the shark's involvement is somewhat more visual, demonstrating it's rather bulky appearance... but even so, John Williams helps keep things thumping along. Even the little touches, like Quinn's Indianapolis speech, help put things in perspective and really make us hate the shark. That's what sets this apart, it's not all focusing on the shark, or who it kills... there are people involved, played to perfection by Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw.The three sequels could never come close to this, with silly modes of dispatching the shark, lots of standard-sequel added bits and Jaws: The Revenge's ludicrous ""shark with a grudge"" concept. It's best just to watch the original, be awed by a fantastic screenplay, some nailbiting direction and economic use of the titular monster, and really see where Hollywood's going wrong these days.

There are some continuity problems. When Dreyfuss is looking at the girls remains in the office he holds up her hand and starts to explain what happens when a shark attacks then it seems to cut off and he's talking about something else. Also, when Michael is in the pond and almost gets eaten, they cut out the shark circling him for a while, which is WHY he is in shock. They also cut out some of the dead girl on the beach, I think.

It perhaps takes a little too long to get them out on the ocean, we could stand for a little less small town corruption, I supppose, but the meat of it is so brilliant that it doesn't much matter.  The shark holds up very well considering how long ago it was, and the performances are first-rate, with particular note going to Robert Shaw as Quint, with his deservedly legendary monologue regarding his experiences on the sea in World War 2.This film works as drama, adventure and horror, and is still Spielberg's best film.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AI55O49KO9DZ0	George Guzman	There probably hasn't been a single movie in the last 30 years that has changed the psyche of moviegoers more than JAWS.  As I recall, people literally did not want to go back into the water!  Speilberg tapped into this fear and tapped into it rather well.As someone who had a certain fear of water, watching this movie on the big screen as a kid, you bet I was horrified!  Today, JAWS still remains a classic.To those who say that the shark looks fake and that a CGI one would've looked superior, well, I wish they would stop looking at movies through CGI-colored glasses.  Personally, I think Speilberg's Great White (though mechanical in close-ups) was truly interesting.  It had a certainly personality.  IMO, many computer-animated creatures today are rather uninspired creations.Besides, JAWS is much more than just about a shark.  The story of greed at the expense of human life is truly interesting to see.  It also boasts some great characters as well, namely, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw as Quint, the old shark hunter with a Captain Ahab syndrome.  And what can I say that hasn't been said already about John Williams now timeless score. It's just magnificent!Yes, JAWS does contain its fair share of frights, but Speilberg was wise in inserting genuine moments of humor as well to relieve that certain tension.  A movie shouldn't be all fright, all of the time.  Certainly, that scene with Chief Brody at the dinner table with his young son copying his every move was both humorous and quite touching.  It gave the movie heart.JAWS  was the first movie to crack the one hundred million dollar mark.  Today, many movies seem to crack that mark with ease.  Yet, many of them are nowhere near as good as JAWS.  Has the movie-going public been dumbed-down as to watch anything and make profits for these lesser movies?With all of this success, there was a downside.  JAWS did to sharks what another great monster movie, KING KONG did to gorillas - it gave these poor creatures a bad image and thus many were slaughtered.  Like I said, this movie really changed the psyche of people, in terms of fear of the water and a huge dislike for sharks.	5.0	Spielberg's Monster Shark!	2003-02-09	12	11	1

I liked its originality and the way the movie created an impact to water particularly swimming in beaches.  I also have to add the fact that this movie was made in the 70s and back then, there were no extraordinary special effects made possible in movies right now.The score made upon the shark's approach was great in keeping the mood creepy and haunting.  Overall, this is one of the most original movies of all time and any other shark movies will never compare to the wonder that is Jaws.	5.0	5 stars for a classic...	2003-07-09	1	0	1

However, my family will all watch Jaws over and over at least once a year, so go figure.My cool anecdote about Jaws is from a couple of weeks after it came out, I was skin diving near Newport Beach, and as we swam out from shore, the sea weed was swaying in the water, my friend and I both looked at each other at the same time and through our snorkels, we sang ""Doo, doo, doo-doo"" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina. It did keep us out of the water the rest of the week!So here's the deal, this is a scary movie, but don't look too close at the special effects, as they are pretty cheesy by today's standards, and on a side note, Myth Busters tried to re- create the Blow Up scene...

JAWS is my favorite film of all time, so I had high hopes for the just-released ""30th Anniversay"" DVD edition - OK, now I officially feel very OLD, since I can recall being scared sh*tless back in the summer of 1975 seeing the movie with my hand over my 8-year-old eyes at a drive-in!  Still, I cannot hide my extreme disappointment that, even though it's nice to have the fascinating documentary is restored to its 2-hour entirety (I saw it on LD, and you're not missing much actually) AND the original sound mix, this ""new and improved"" (?) DVD edition fumbles on two huge items: WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILERS?  WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL TV SPOTS I recall seeing as a kid all over TV in weeks up to the release? (JAWS as the FIRST studio movie to utilize a major TV buy to saturate the media to guarantee blockbuster box-office)?  Also, another fan pointed this out: WHY WHY WHY does Universal insist on RUINING the ORIGINAL classic ICONIC 70s one-sheet image by ""re-designing"" (ruining?) it with too-slick hologram cover art?

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"Amity is a small beach town that thrives on summer tourists, where the Chief of Police's biggest worry are kids practicing karate on neighbourhood fences.  Until a great-white shark arrives and starts killing beach-goers.  His new worry is how to get rid of a man-eating shark.  That's the basic premise of Peter Benchley's famous novel, brought to screen by Steven Spielberg with some major changes to the plot.  The plot consists of two halves: the first half describing the shark threat, and the second half describing the shark hunt.  The first half is the most enjoyable, as director Spielberg evokes a sense of fear from the outset with the gruesome discovery of the remains of a shark victim.  There is a constant and strong sense of impending doom: ""who will be next?""Unlike most modern movies, the fear that ""Jaws"" creates is not produced by graphic displays of blood and gore, which are reserved for the conclusion of the shark hunt in the closing stages of the movie.  In fact you don't even see the details of the first attack or the body of the first victim, and very little of the shark or its victims is seen in the first half of the movie.  Rather, splendid directing creates an emotional fear with small and brilliant touches throughout.  After a few false alarms on the beach, we as viewers start seeing the beach-goers as ""shark bait"" through the eyes of the Chief of Police and share his fear.  A most memorable scene occurs as the camera pans between him and the swimmers in the surf, and as he reacts first to an apparent shark which turns out to be an elderly swimmer, and then to the screams of a young couple which turn out to be innocent screams of fun.  Similarly, there are other scenes where his wife surprises him as he is looking at a book with pictures of sharks; and where the camera zooms in on a shark attack and pans out to show it is just a killer-shark video game.  Creating chilling fear in this emotional manner by suggestion rather than by sight of explicit gore is a skill that has largely been lost by modern movie-makers.  Fear is evoked more by what you don't see than what you do see.  John Williams impressive score with its recurring shark theme turns up the chills all the higher.The second half of the movie does not quite live up to the promise of the first half, as the shark hunt gets underway, complete with the memorable line ""You're going to need a bigger boat.""  But here two wonderful characters come to the forefront to join the police chief in the quest for the shark: the kooky shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and the eccentric shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is humorously and completely impersonal in his passion for sharks.  The conclusion is rather more graphic than a PG rating would suggest, but is quite satisfying.  (The PG rating is overly generous by today's standards, considering the incidences of blasphemy and graphic violence, particularly in the latter half).It's not hard to see why this is a landmark movie continues to stand out more than 25 years after it was made.  It's dated only in that it pictures people with 70s clothes and hair, and an artificial shark produced by 70s technology.  But there is certainly nothing old-fashioned about the sense of terror and suspense it evokes.  It is this spine-tingling atmosphere that has made the chilling story of ""Jaws"" an unforgettable classic that will continue to grab viewers by the teeth in years to come."	4.0	A movie that grabs you by the teeth.	2002-08-15	1	0	1

A small island town is under seige by rogue shark with a  hunger for what ever jumps in the water. Standing in it's way are a police  sheriff(Roy Scheider), whose has a deep fear of the water. A marine  biologist(Richard Dreyfuss), and an old sea captain(Robert Shaw) who both  want things done a certain way. What transpires is a frightening expedition  into hell, where the way to get out is to kill or be killed by a creature  with less mercy than the devil. A suspensful tale, top quality acting, and  a music score(composed by John Williams) that has become so familar, that  it's very composition, induces a nightmare vision in the minds of those who  have seen the movie.

It is a great film because of the story, the characters and the actors and actresses that make the film happen.This blue ray edition had included content, one of which was the making of Jaws. This was utterly fascinating. I had heard the story about how &#34;the shark is working!&#34; was a battlecry on set, but this making of talks about that and so much, much more.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	APASOUCF2UD42	Greg Curtis	"This restoration is not new!  The August 2012 Blu-ray release of ""Jaws"" includes a bonus feature about the restoration and shows how the beach scene, formerly yellow, is now bright and blue; how the scratches on the film when the mayor comes out of the building (chapter 4) were removed; how the shooting stars over the Orca are now visible...But all of these improvements were made for -- and are clearly evident in -- the 2005 DVD release.  Thus, the 2012 DVD version included in the combo pack is identical to the 2005 version.  And, with a Blu-ray player that upconverts, there is little difference between the 2005/2012 DVD and the new Blu-ray disc.

It did, and of course, the next thing I knew, I was on this unbelieveably heart-pounding, nerve wracking, and terrifying ""ride"" that I could not get off!It TRULY was/is the most terrifying movie I ever saw! I remember after it was over, just sitting in my seat and not moving for long after everyone else had left the theater...I just did not have the strength? energy? whatever, to rise and leave the theater, I just sat there. (this also happened after Easy Rider and Bonnie and Clyde, but for shock-value at their endings, and with Field of Dreams because of the subject matter touching me so very deeply).Now, I have not seen this particular DVD release of Jaws (one simply cannot keep re-buying these things), but I do own the last special edition of it. I would say that if you do not own the prior one, by all means go for this one. Regardless which edition you buy, of course, you are in for the most terrifying scare any movie can throw at you! It's funny, but after seeing this movie for (how many times) all these years, I still keep hoping that Robert Shaw is NOT going to go down the throat of the Great White, every single time!!!

Bad idea!The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.The police chief, played by Roy Scheider is suspicious that it is a GWS but the mayor, of course doesn't want to believe him until it conclusive, which it is fairly soon.  The police chief wants to close the beaches, but that would costs too much in economic terms so he is vetoed.All-in-all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.Throughout the movie the GWS is anthropomorphized so that we / the movie makers give him almost human intelligence.Not recommended for anyone who wants to swim in the ocean.

Unlike analog transfers of music to digital CD's in the 90's, the restorations of classic 70's films in particular, such as the the epic Jaws to Blu-Ray, are spectacular.The visual clarity, booming surround sound, and full-screen experience can be had once again just like you experienced it as a kid in the theaters a long time ago, and it doesn't lose a bit of its cinematic style or film-based patina and style.  I love to watch Jaws every few years, and this upgrade to what's been available for the last 30+ years is a joy to experience.As these classics of 70's and early 80's cinema are being restored, it's a joy to experience them again in Blu-Ray at home with today's technology, and that doesn't include the enjoyable extras and commentary you get as well.  Not sure there's much more to be said about this, it's a fantastic restoration that manages to somehow stay true to the original look, feel and style of the cinematography. Being able to re-live that era in such clarity again, from the objects, clothes, hair styles and elements, are amazing to see in this manner.

On the 'Updated' track several of the fog horn blows have been deleted. They are still on the original mono track however. There are other modifications and deletions as well.don't get me wrong please! I'm sure there are many fans out there who love this new soundtrack.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1G1CA1WXD2AE2	Harry Thomas	For once, I find myself agreeing with Leonard Maltin's short take - Jaws as a novel was a bubble gum read. Jaws as a movie is a terriffic thrill ride.Problems with the mechanical shark (named &quot;Bruce&quot;) led  Spielburg and his editors to cut the film so that the shark is rarely seen  on camera except for an ominious fin slicing through the water. This builds  up the suspense and terror, and is the main reason that Jaws was the  success that it was. If you doubt that, go to your local library and look  up the back issues of your local paper or Time magazine. They'll tell you  the story of how the success of the film kept people out of the water at  the beaches that year (which had towns that run beaches hopping mad because  no one was coming to their beaches and they were going broke).The  strength of the three leads is also one of the pillars of this film.  Scheider, Dreyfuss and the late Robert Shaw are all extremely believable in  their roles.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A26HFSVLAGULIM	"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi"""	"IT ALL STARTS WHEN -----It all starts when a ""summer girl"" goes for a midnight swim and, after being reported missing, is later discovered on the beach --in pieces. Is it a shark attack, a boating accident, or what? After all, all we saw were a few tugs and screams. But was there something hidden in the water? Or was it as the mayor suggested, a simple drowning followed by a collsion with a boat's propeller for the ""summer girl""?BUT THEN ---After a short and sweet coverup by the business-oriented mayor and town council, more swimmers and fisherman get mangled at sea and there are witnesses to some of these slayings, ending the chance of both a continued coverup and a lucrative summer business for Amity Island [flimed at Martha's Vineyard].During the Amity versus Jaws segment, we see more and more of the shark and more graphic depictions of the shark and its dining habits.AH --- BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING ---Then, the second and primary theme develops. Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, a scientist from the ""Oceanographic Institute"", and Robert Shaw as Captain Quint, an off-the-wall sailor set sail to kill the ""Great White"" that is turning the water red around the seaside community of Amity Island.YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER!This part of the movie is a combination wild buddy adventure and monster movie. However, the basic theme that has induced fear into audiences and all swimmers afterward is pervasive now aboard ship, during the hunt for Jaws. You see, no one sees Jaws until it is too late, if at all. The crew of three now simply wait for something to come up, out of the dark waters below, and literally crash onto their small fishing boat. Therein lies the charm of Jaws -- it can come out without warning and simply tear you or your loved ones to shreds. Even on a boat, a dock, or within shallow, patrolled beaches, we are all at risk of becoming a meal for a monster. When the film is over the risk still remains. If and when we return to the beach at the ocean, we will find ourselves suddenly reminded that we are not at the top of the food chain. This is what makes propaganda so effective, and here it is at its best -- YOU AND I ARE AT RISK OF BEING EATEN ANYTIME WE ARE NEAR SALT WATER! Wherever did we get that idea from?IN THE END: [plot spoilers below]Spielberg gives us a very satisfying end which does differ somewhat from the book. Quint goes the way of Captain Ahab, right into the beast's mouth, still kicking, stabbing, shouting and fighting. Next, as the ship is sinking, Chief Brody, after repeated shots with a rifle does get the oxygen tank to explode in Jaws' mouth for a dramatic end to this bad fish. Afterward, Hooper makes a surprise return from what we assumed was a sure death within a mangled anti-shark cage. The film closes with the two buddies paddling toward the distant shore using two of the floating shark barrels to float on as they kick their way away from the camera and toward home.BUT ITS NEVER REALLY OVER BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT JAWS IS STILL OUT THERE!ABOUT THE DVD: [BEST BET: 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDESCREEN]There are at least 5 releases on DVD that I know of. In all cases, the film appears about the same, the differences being in the features and whether it is a Widescreen or Full-Frame Format. The last release is the 30th Anniversary Edition which differs from the Anniversary Edition [25th Anniversary in small print] only in the featurettes. One is longer and is touted as being new and improved over the last release. Both Anniversary releases have some deleted scenes. Again, the biggest extra feature on the 30th Anniversary edition is ""From The Set: An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws"" which features a ""never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg"". Okay, that is about the biggest difference, but though I have seen both Anniversary editions, I am staying with the ""Anniversary Edition"" in Widescreen from 2000. However, if I were now in the market for Jaws on DVD, I would buy the new ""30th Anniversary Edition"" from 2005.CAST - CREW - AWARDS !!!!----- CASTRoy Scheider  - Chief Martin BrodyRobert Shaw  - QuintRichard Dreyfuss  - Matt HooperLorraine Gary  - Ellen BrodyMurray Hamilton  - Mayor Larry VaughnCarl Gottlieb  - Editor Meadows----- CREWSteven Spielberg  - DirectorDavid Brown  - ProducerRichard D.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3U3JFW7VQYB2	Heath McKnight	And that is in my opinion, of course.  JAWS affected me when I was only 5 years old when I saw JAWS 2 on television while living in Colorado.  I soon saw the original JAWS movie and loved it instantly (funny thing is, they  never scared me much--E.T. was about the scariest thing I've ever seen).  I  have always been a huge fan of this movie and still get a jolt out of  seeing certain scenes, and am horror-struck still when Quint becomes shark  food (the only time I think pan and scan worked EVER was there when the  shark first bit down on him and he screams--it takes up the whole TV screen  and shocks you into silence).  The characters are believable and more real  than most people I know!  I can only hope to strive for that like Spielberg  did in 1973-74.  Sure the shark is a bit fake by today's standards, but  only showing the shark little bits at a time out of neccessity really  helped with the fear factor for me--I use my imagination and fill in the  blanks; less is more (JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING is one example of more is  more).  The directing, writing, cast, and even the effects make it the  greatest film ever (in my humble opinion!).	5.0	The greatest film of all time	2000-06-05	1	0	1

WOW! It looks better now on hi-def Blu-ray than it probably did when it first came out. Everything just pops. Picture clarity is razor-sharp, colors are lush and vibrant, sound rumbles and screams beautifully. Everything about this release is just plain AWESOME! I've had this film taped off a cable broadcast, factory VHS, then DVD. Well, none of them compares to this pristine Blu-ray transfer. THIS version is the one to own. Robert Shaw's USS Indianapolis monologue should be required viewing for anyone considering getting into acting. THIS is what true acting is all about. All the man does is tell a story for about five minutes. Nothing else. But WOW! he is absolutely RIVETING to watch. You cannot take your eyes off him and you're hanging on his every word.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2O1C9EGYQVS1K	hunter_aran	I don't think I need to justify how great or important this film is, so I am just going to note some interesting and pleasant details on the bluray release. This bluray release is amazing and a must own for bluray collectors. The frame-by-frame restoration they went through took a ton of work and really made the film look new again. You can see the details on how they did this in the special features. The special features also include a 2-hour long documentary about how they made the film and although this is in SD it looks fine and was very interesting. I was extremely pleased when I realized that in the digital copy you get the SD and HD versions and extras that include the documentary! They really served customers right in getting a decent digital package unlike the featureless SD disappointments that usually come with bluray purchases. The ET bluray I just purchased is also giving me the same type of digital downloads as Jaws so I have to say I am very happy and hope other studios follow Universal's lead on this.	5.0	Amazing restoration and HD digital copy included with Bluray!	2012-10-13	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A13V2MTMAV9K2	"""jackvaldez"""	I was only 5 when I first saw this movie, and I credit it for being solely responsible for all the countless shark nightmares I've had since! I've been fascinated with the subject from then on and have amassed quite an  extensive collection of shark-related books and videos through the  years.I think that even the recent advances in computer-generated  imaging and special effects (best evidenced in the recent film &quot;Deep  Blue Sea&quot;) will fail to dampen the overall &quot;shock and scare  effect&quot; of this 25-year old film even for new viewers (the suspense  build up brought about by John Williams' now classic score really helps!).  I hope that they eventually relase an upgraded version of this though, like  the Star Wars remastered trilogy - perhaps they can insert CGI scenes of  the shark attacking the killer whale or something.Apart from this  reason, the DVD gets 5 stars in my book because of the following:1. Low  price (relative to other new DVD releases).2. Lots of bells and whistles  (e.g. commentary, featurette, etc.).3. DTS audio track - based on  Amazon's advanced info, there's practically no difference in price or  special features between the DTS and non-DTS version, so I don't see why  one would settle for the latter.My two cents' worth : This film has been  bashed on several occassions for having singlehandedly perpetuated the  monster shark myth, which has partly inspired the indiscriminate slaughter  of sharks (even non Great Whites) worldwide.  Some well-intended parties  attempt to overcompensate however by promoting sharks as more or less  harmless creatures who oftentimes are indifferent to man's presence (e.g.  guided &quot;shark petting&quot; diving tours). Personally, I think that  sharks are unpredictable forces of nature, undisputed masters of their  underwater domain, and totally deserving of our respect most especially  when we decide to enter their realm.In a nutshell: BUY THIS!  Not only  does it provide rewatchable and timeless entertainment, but  &quot;Jaws&quot; certainly stimulated my interest in the subject of sharks,  which has thus far proven to be a personally rewarding one.	5.0	Provides more than just entertainment!	2000-05-07	3	2	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1BATHNY2QAZI2	"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime"""	JAWS remains a classic tale of adventure featuring one of the best 'monsters' in film history. It has an excellent script, characters, action sequences and a great villain - the 25 foot shark.  But, what truly makes this film a classic is the aura and feeling created by Steven Spielberg. He perfectly crafted a movie from a great adventure book (written by Peter Benchley), presented characters (beautifully and emotionally portrayed by a mixture of veterans and newcomers (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Murray Hamilton), dramatic conflict between man and beast (nature) and a story of fear of the unknown and uncontrollable.  Add to this a menacing villain (a monster shark) and you have a classic thriller which is one of the best films of all-time. We get a sense of time and space as the film moves from land to sea. We see the conflict grow from man and man, man and beast, man and nature and ultimately man versus man's emotions. Finally, Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss form a bond through their gestures, dialog and shared quest like few ensemble casts have been able to do so on film.  I consider this a film of perfection thanks to Spielberg, Joe Alves (technical) and Carl Gottlieb (script) and the incredible cast. I remain a fan of this massive undertaking by the makers of the film.  I still consider this one of the top twenty films of all-time.	5.0	Gut-wrenching and exciting action thriller classic	2013-07-18	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A4Y233WXK7DQ3	James D. Eret	There are few sounds more terrifying than hearing someone screaming &quot;Shark!&quot; at a beach or from the water, whether it be in real life or the movies. A young Steven Spielberg went out and milked that scream for  help for all it is worth and more: made a classic Adventure-Horror movie.  &quot;Jaws&quot; is great in every department. The acting is flawless, with  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw &quot;bonding&quot; in their  search and detroy mission of the ultimate great white shark. So powerful is  Jaws that almost any picture since has taken little bits from it, unable to  escape from its enormous shark shadow. Spielberg, from the opening night  sequence shocks us(one of the most terrifying in history) when we don't  even see the shark, but see the first victim from the shark's eye view and  John William's brilliant soundtrack telling us the terror is just starting.  Spielberg has made many great movies, but none scarier than Jaws, none that  has its combination of terror, adventure, high spirits, great acting and  superb technical achievement of editing, cinematography and sound. With  this masterpiece, Spielberg, at a young age, set the bar higher for horror  and adventure films, and showed he was a genius in making action movies. It  still holds up well, much better than digital movies that are pale in  comparison, sloppy and incoherent compared to the great unity of Jaws.  Steven Spielberg might have made movies after Jaws that were as good but  none better. Jumping beyond its genre , it is on my list of top twenty  movies ever made.	5.0	Jaws: A Classic in Action and Horror Genres	2000-06-07	16	14	2

But this particular video presentation does not present the movie in it's original form. This DVD does not contain  the original, oscar winning sound effects. Instead, this DVD contains a  bunch of newly re-recorded sound effects. To me, this is the equivalent of  re-writing Shakespear's plays, re-writing the novels of Dickens, or tearing  up the Mona Lisa and painting a new one. Besides, the DVD format allows for  up to 8 different audio track to be included, so even if they did record a  new one, why not also include the old one? I guess George Orwell was right.  History is indeed being re-written. What a shame. Hopefully someday they  will issue a DVD that contains the origianl soundtrack to this movie.	1.0	Great movie.

I also love the background music as that  also helps add to the excitement of the movie. It also prepares people for when they go into the oceans to swim.  Thank heavens I can't swim.  I'd most likely be the one to be attacked by a shark. The acting was very good and the scenery too. The mayor in my opinion, although he was suppose to be on the negative side to make money for the town, was very dislike by me. He had the kind of face profile that even turned me off, although he may be a very nice person. Once scene that I had a problem with was where the great white jumped onto the boat and the guy slid into his mouth.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQ01Q3070LT29	James McDonald	"Released by Universal. Directed by Steven Spielberg.This film must be seen in a movie theatre.  It was made for the big screen.  On television, it looks quite tame.  The people of today just don't get it.I saw this film twice in a theatre and the last time I saw it then, I was sitting in the very front row because of a (now-former) friend demanded to see it up front.  I was so scared.  I was young.  I had nightmares and couldn't sleep. I had to sleep in the living room with the lights on.  Now that I'm around the same age as Roy Scheider in ""JAWS"", I can sit and watch this film every time I see it on.Tom (Jonathan Filley) and Chrissie (Susan Backlinie) just met each other at the beach campfire.  They decide to go for a moonlite swim--skinny dipping.  Chrissie already has her clothes off as she runs to the water.  Tom is having a bit of trouble undressing because he is drunk.  Chrissie enjoys the water, but suddenly something tries to pull her under and then violently moves her around.  She is terrified, screaming to God. Then she is pulled down to her death.  Tom has heard nothing.  He has passed out.Later, when a shark kills a boy (Jeffrey Voorhees) in the beach water, Chief Martin brody (Roy Scheider) realizes he really has a problem on his hands.  With the help of Quint (Robert Shaw) and Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), Brody must find and destroy the biggest, most dangerous shark he has ever seen.Also in the cast: Lorraine Gray, Murray Hamilton, Jeffrey C. Kramer, Chris Rebello, Jay Mello, Lee Fierro, Fritzi Jane Courtney.  Writer Carl Gottlieb is ""Meadows"".  Writer of the ""JAWS"" novel, Peter Benchley is an interviewer on the beach.Amity is actually Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Sound.What this film started was a mass hysteria, if you will, of people afraid of going to the beach and in the water.  yes, tiger sharks can bite a chunk out of you.  Surfboards can look like a seal to eat.  Blood and meat attracts sharks too.JAWS was nominated for Best Picture and won the Academy Award for Best Sound, Orifinal Music Score--John Williams and Film Editing.The falling star you see in this film is a trademark of Spielberg's.  You can find it in other Spielberg films.The tv version, edited down, has a longer running time of 2 hours, 10 minutes. Some of the gore has been cut out for television.Disc One includes Bonus features, 14 deleted scenes, 4 outtakes and a British documentary.Disc two is the documentary ""The Making of JAWS"".There is no audio commentary.Followed by: Jaws 2 (1978)Jaws 3-D (1983)Jaws: The Revenge (1987).Their are other films you might enjoy, SHARK! (aka MAN-EATER) [1969] with Burt Reynolds.  ORCA (1977) with Bo Derek.  DEEP BLUE SEA (1999).GREAT WHITE (1981) aka EL ULTIMO TIBURUN, aka LA MORT AU LARGE, starring James Franciscus, Vic Morrow, was pulled out of release after two weeks over copyright infringement.  It too closely resembled JAWS (1975).  It has never been released on any video format in the USA."	5.0	The Scariest  Summer Movie	2006-08-31	4	1	3
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1BL65ZJPWJW5J	James M. Hawk	JAWS -the one and only, June 14, 2005Reviewer: James M. Hawk (columbus, ohio United States) - See all my reviewsI do not know whether to be mad or happy. I think this might just be the 3rd go around? for this movie. mad!, why does it take these companies 2,3,4,5 times to get it right?. DOUBLE DIPPING and GREED. this time however it appears that they finally have done it justice. the movie is the same as the 25thyr edition and they have included FULL details that were shortened on the 25th edition. the films presentation is the same but why couldn't they try to remastered it again(try to cleanup the GRAIN that can be seen). very interesting bonus features with details about on set and filming. if you have any other(s) editions of this movie--you may want to keep them anyway. some minor features did not transfer to this updated version(important?)--not really but completists take note. also, this is a minor quibble by this reviewer. in the 25th edition you got a 4 page booklet keepsake in 1st flap of dvd the 4 page booklet really contains nothing but scene selections and with this new one, you do not have the keepsake--HOWEVER: they do give you a very nice 60 pg booklet which is what we all wanted anyway. I kept my booklet and transferred it to the upgrade(I just like having as much as possible). I just get so disappointed when companies give us stuff and then when we upgrade-the stuff is gone. *I am sure the movie companies have major and minor trinkets that they could have given us(souvenirs)when the film was originally released. the price for this reissue is affordable, but I for one--would not hesitate to pay more if they had more to give us. I guess, there will be for 35th edition, 40th, 45th, oh, and lets not forget the ULTIMATE EDITION on the 50th--etc.........	5.0	JAWS -the one and only	2005-06-14	8	4	4
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ACVCDIUEX1YSQ	James Nemeth	Jaws - The 25th Anniversary Edition is a superb example of what the DVD format can do.  First, the movie.  All the action, thrills and shocks are still there, no matter how many times you've seen this film.  The  quality of the image is excellent.  And if you're lucky enough to own a  home theater system to allow the full impact of the sound/music hit home, a  huge extra dimension is added to the viewing experience.  John Williams'  excellent score turned up to a high volume will help drive up  the tension.There are amusing outtakes (not nearly enough), deleted scenes and a  fun trivia game.  Highlighting this entire package is an excellent  &quot;making of&quot; documentary, benefitting hugely from the  participation of director Spielberg.  Included are remininscenes from  actors and crew.  Fascinating is learning all about how the shark and the  scenes involving it were done.A truly excellent job. All movie  companies should look to this edition to realize the capabilities of the  DVD package/experience.	5.0	Superb	2000-07-24	5	5	0

This movie still in the top 10  all time .At 25 years of age Jaws is still my favorite movie and will  continue to be, this tribute to Jaws is well over due,if you have never had  the chance to own a DVD this should be your first. the original jaws VHS  was recorded in Dolby mono-this one in DTS (digital theater sound), will be  so incredible you might want to join Quint at the table for some apricot  brandy. this movie has single-handedly effected more people of my age than  any other movie in history,(Psycho comes in second for my moms era).

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1EBJ93E1T50RT	Jason A. Miller	"This review is not a critique of Universal's questionable DVD marketing strategies.  I only bought this summer's ""Special Collector's 5th Anniversary Edition of the Last DVD Release"" version of ""Jaws"" because... well, five years ago, I bought the 25th anniversary edition of ""Jaws"" on VHS.*crickets chirp*At any rate, having previously seen most of the specials features on this set courtesy of the electronic miracle of the video cassette player, I didn't spend a lot of time on the added extras.  I bought ""Jaws"" on DVD because it's ""Jaws"".  On DVD.  And I didn't have it before.  True, I'd have preferred some sort of text trivia track, or a cast and production crew commentary, even if Spielberg wasn't going to contribute.  Surely there were some audio interviews with Robert Shaw that could have been located and incorporated?The movie itself remains one of my enduring favorites, even though I discovered it relatively late, through repeat airings on Turner basic cable in the mid to late '90s.  ""Jaws"" is atypical for a blockbuster in that the second half of the movie is basically a stage play with a cast of two scenery-chewing masters, a mechanical shark, and Roy Scheider.  Witness (several times) the nine-minute sequence set in the cabin of the Orca, which begins with Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw comparing scars... then transitions to Shaw's captivating speech about the U.S.S. Indianapolis (which he reportedly wrote himself)... followed by a slightly drunken sing-along... interrupted by a shark attack in mid-chorus.  Spielberg was only 26 when he filmed this, and it's easy to see why he stuck around.The first half of the movie has almost no relation to the last, but even in different tempo, Spielberg captures the bucolic intensity of Amity Island with a master's attention to detail.  In any other film, Murray Hamilton would have stolen the show as the earnest, buffoonish, soon-to-be-deflated mayor who insists on keeping the beach open even after two people are dead.  And even in the midst of the comic actions of the islanders, Spielberg still pushes Ben Gardner's disembodied head through a boat hull when the audience least expected it (and repeated the trick 20 years later with Samuel L. Jackson's arm in ""Jurassic Park"").While Lorraine Gary is given a bit of a thankless role, and drops out of the movie halfway through, it's amazing that she had time to make an impression at all, what with Shaw and Dreyfuss trying to outdo each other in every scene -- both successfully.  And even though the nominal hero, Roy Scheider, seems to be lagging 15 seconds behind Shaw and Dreyfuss (watch the cabin sequence again and see how passive he makes Chief Brody), he still saves the day when Shaw's working-class fisherman act and Dreyfuss's hi-tech gadgetry both fail to stop the great white.It's great to see ""Jaws"" still kicking hard 30 years later, in the way that ""War of the Worlds"" probably won't do in 2035.  From the recent ""MythBusters"" special on ""Jaws"", which even took time to debunk the deleted scene with Shaw buying piano wire... to Bryan Singer's effortless rehabilitation of Scheider's nonsense line, ""That's some bad hat, Harry"", I would find myself watching ""Jaws"" on DVD even if the Special Edition had nothing on it but the movie.Even so, put together that audio commentary so I can buy the Commemorative 5th Anniversary Edition of this current release in 2010."	5.0	Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain	2005-07-19	9	8	1

I love this movie; that's why I'm so disappointed that Universal is only offering the nifty Anniversary edition in Pan and Scan.  Where is the widescreen tape version?  I know that the DVD is widescreen,  but I buy movies for the video store I work at, and many of our customers  don't have DVD yet.  Universal has even taken the old widescreen VHS  version off the market.  This is a shame, because this movie really  deserves the widescreen treatment.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3NP0PO6HUJUXT	jason miller decremer	For those of us who grew on '70's movies this is one that can not be left out.  Literally creating the summer blockbuster season, Jaws is one of the most entertaining films ever made.  Speilberg took a mediocore book and  turned it into a true classic.  The characters, especially the three leads,  are fully realized and developed.  Each of the three men are different in  every way.  Yet, it the final act when they are on the Orca they all must  come together and do battle with the man eating shark.The story never  lags and the tension never lets up.  The first two acts set the final forty  minutes up flawlessly.  With the addition of John Williams and his classic  score and the supberb editing of Verna Fields, both won Oscars, it is  perfect is almost every way.  It is hard to pass this up.  It is the film  that made Speilberg and he has not looked back since.On DVD the film has  never looked and sounded better.  Williams' score can finally be heard for  what it is.  The picture quality is great and the widescreen image make  this complete.  A must for DVD fans and fans of classic movies.	5.0	JAWS as it was meant to be	2000-07-17	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1E13TP94S5KUD	Jazzy	Probably one of the most terrifying movies in history, because it can(and has) really happened. Spielberg was brilliant to not show the shark for the better half of the movie, which lets the viewer use his/her imagination.  Plus, William's score is without a doubt the best picked score in relation  to a movie's plot. Heck,if anyone started humming that tune, a beach would  clear out! Deep blue sea may have had better sharks just do to the fact  that technology is far more advanced than it was in 1975. But the acting?  Come on! L.L going down a corridor yelling &quot;You killed my bird&quot;  doesn't compare with the chief's line &quot;you're gonna need a bigger  boat&quot; which by the way, he ad- libbed. Now, that takes talent, and  &quot;Jaws&quot; is filled with it! The dialogue, the score, the sheer  terror.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2NF1RY31JF0HE	"J. Buettner ""Jaws Fan"""	Jaws is the best movie ever made. I will spend the rest of my review explaining why.I have yet to see a movie be so many different types of films and be effective at all of them. Jaws is a thriller, a horror film, a drama, an adventure, it has comedy and tragedy.  It has elements of a revenge movie and it has elements of redemption story. The film succeeds on all these levels and it did so by accident.Jaws went into production without a script and without the actual shark. Just to keep busy in Martha's Vineyard the crew wrote and shot material to have something to do. Carl Gotlieb spent evenings writing material for the next day with Spielberg. This shifted the focus of the movie toward the characters, not the shark. It also gave the crew ample time to continue to develop these characters. By the time the crew of three sail out to see to hunt the shark, each character is fully developed and realized. The movie never looses site of the human emotional side of the equation. They don't let the audience forget that the sharks victims are sons and daughters, friends and relatives. The victims aren't just props in the story but they are real to the characters in the story.Also the fact that the mechanical shark did malfunction actually improved the movie. The shark was much scarier off screen than it was on. Spielberg and the crew also were very good at getting the most out of visual representations, such as the barrels and the unforgettable score by John Williams. In addition I contend the shark is a very compelling character of the film too. The shark seems to be hunting Hooper, Quint and Brody as much as they are hunting it which adds a very compelling dynamic to the film. And in regard to the shark effects, it is my opinion that this film features better effects work than any shark related film made after it, including the cgi sharks of Deep Blue Sea (which is a bad movie incidentally).Jaws was a horrible film shoot but may have had one of the finest crews in movie history with Verna Fields editing, John Williams score, and Steven Spielberg directing his second feature. Let's not forget Zannuck and Brown who still produce some of the finest films today. The collective talent on this film pulled off a miracle and changed the way the film industry marketed films for better or for worse. This is also the lone movie I can think of where the film actually exceeds the quality of the original book. A flawless example of storytelling, Jaws has remained and will continue to be my favorite movie of all time.	5.0	A flawless example of storytelling	2004-12-04	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A25VLEKF48I32K	jbut37 (jbut37@worldnet.att.net)	Jaws was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I consider it more of an adventure movie than a horror movie even though some parts were truly frightening. I wonder why this movie is not on DVD. It would be great to  hear the directors commentary.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A31EMBD9W2JZMX	J. C Sallows	So Mr. Spielberg has finally finished drying his tears after the collossal failure of DIVX. He wants to make it up to us by offering up this DVD (among others, like MIB). If anyone out there has seen the JAWS Signature  Collection LD, you've seen this DVD. OOOH! A screensaver! After all of  these years you'd think he could find a couple of hours to do a commentary  track. I guess I'm still angry about DIVX. What a shameful proposition.  Charge the American public over and over again for proporty they already  own, lie to them consistantly regarding the quality (single-layer only)of  the players and the validity of the format. There are now thousands and  thousands of people that got scammed into buying low-grade equipment and  discs that are now coasters. In any event, I'm sure the Jaws DVD will be  just as good as the LD set, which is pretty good. One thing to think about  though, you can get the LD set for $10.00-$15.00 on EBAY, and it comes with  a book and CD, but sorry no screensaver.	4.0	Some new stuff, but after all this time could have used more	2000-05-10	0	0	0

The casting is spot on, the acting is amazing and the pacing is perfect. If you've ever seen the mechanical shark at Universal Studios, you know how fake it looks. Spielberg shows just enough of it to scare, but not enough that you can see how awful it looks. There is also quite a bit of comic relief moments that are very funny.The remastering on the blu-ray is top notch.

My pleasure in this movie was almost sapped by an American Studies Professor assigning a class in the American Horror Film to read her  study: Jaws as Patriarchal Myth.I just wanted to take this opportunity  to share some Jaws trivia:&gt; Jaws was the first summer blockbuster,  the first summer movie released as an event (same-day national release with  saturation advertising).&gt; &quot;Bruce&quot; the mechanical shark used  in the film worked so poorly Spielberg was forced to shoot around it.  By  doing so he delayed the appearance of the shark until so far into the movie  that there was unintended suspense.  Any viewer will tell you that suspense  makes the movie work very well.  This creative improvisation on Spielberg's  part is evidence of his strong, strong talent.&gt; Robert Shaw's story  of the Indianapolis is true.I recommend making a viewing of Jaws a  Spring tradition, also Bull Durham.

Roy Scheider plays the ambivolant Chief Brody with ease and finesse.  Richard Dreyfuss plays the  tussely-haired Marine Biologist Matt Hooper in what had now become his  trademark halting delivery style.  Robert Shaw's performance as the gnarly  old sea captian Quint becomes haunting in his famous speech about the  tragedy on the U.S.S. Indianapolis.The film is really two different  films.  The half of the movie that takes place on land, and the half that  takes place aboard the Orca...hunting for the shark.  One could not exist  without the other.  The direction is expert, courtesy of Steven  Spielberg.  The dreadful shoot, delayed by the faultering mechanical  sharks, turned out one of the greatest films ever made.  The pacing is  perfect, following a slow-build pattern that ends with an incredibly tense  climax.It's one of my favorite movies ever...always will be.

Everhart	"Steven Spielberg, we know him from various movies like E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones series, War of the Worlds, etc. There is another timeless classic that launched him into stardom released in 1975, Jaws. It takes place on a fictitious resort known as Amity Island and begins when a college woman went swimming on the beach one evening and was attacked by a shark. The next day, the Chief of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), investigates the shark attack with the help of his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary). Martin tries to close the beaches, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) overrules it to make a profit on the 4th of July without fear of a shark attack. After the shark attacks a kid, his mother places a $3,000 bounty on the shark, starting a shark hunting frenzy and gets the attention of shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), who offers his services at a meeting. Martin hires ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to do an autopsy on the shark's first victim and determines this. By the 4th of July, beaches were full of tourists. When a shark joke creates a false alarm and distracts the city officials, the real thing arrives, kills a man, and nearly takes the life of Martin and Ellen's oldest son Michael. Martin, Quint, and Hooper team up to kill it at all costs. They get to the shark on the ""Orca"" and lured it with chum. They shot tracers on the shark. After the engine gets damaged, Hooper gets in a cage to tranquilize it, but breaks the cage. The shark jumps on the boat and kills Quint. Martin tosses an air tank in the sharks mouth. He gets on a pole and shoots at the shark and causes it to explode. Hooper catches up to Martin and they paddle back home. I saw it with a friend some time ago and it was timeless. It has a little blood and gore, but not much. It mostly relies on suspense by not showing the shark much until the climax. The acting was splendid, the shark looks pretty real, and the score by orchestra legend John Williams is so powerful, almost on par with Star Wars. If you are a fan of Spielberg, Williams, and sharks, I would check it out. You will be pleased. This is another example of a film that didn't need a sequel, but I will get to them eventually."	5.0	Thrilling start in Steven Spielberg's career with this classic	2010-01-02	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3TKL7X26QKKMO	"Jeremy Brackeen ""themetalbeast"""	Jaws is not only a great movie, but a sensation as well. Directed by Steven Speilberg, this phenominal movie helped paved the way for the three sequels and other sea monster movies that were to come. The storyline starts off with a young womam going for a night swim, and before you knew it, she is attacked and killed by the infamous shark, to the 4th of July attack on the public beach, to the climax ending where Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) destroys the beast by shooting a scuba tank that he tossed inside the shark's mouth and exploding into a million pieces. Roy Scheider is great as Police Chief Martin Brody, Richard Dreyfuss is outstanding as marine biologist Matt Hooper, but the real knockout of the movie is none other than Robert Shaw who plays Quint, the colorful shark fisherman. That one scence I really found unique was when Shaw's character was retelling Brody and Hooper the sinking of the U.S.S Indianapolis which was taken out by torpedoes from a Japanese sub back in World War 2, and how the 316 people were taken out in shark infested waters. Anyways, this movie is phenominal, and it'll never ever get old, no matter how many times you've seen it, it's a classic gem.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A5MF52CROEBG6	Jesse Watts	Steven Spielberg's breakthrough hit gave audiences a glimpse at the future of one of the best directors in Hollywood history. A man who almost single-handidly made movies what they are today.Jaws is still considered his best movie by some fans and critics, it's acting, pacing and suspense are something movie fans should never forget, it's too bad films like Deep Blue Sea couldn't capture the magic quite as much as Spielberg did on this movie. Perhaps it was because Spielberg hid the creature so well and the fact the creature was a classic movie monster, a fake reality, whearas today's CGI is becoming too cartoony. Back in 1975, Jaws utilized a mechanical shark, which was often noticable, but still a reality, and far more realistic than the sharks in Deep Blue Sea. I don't think some filmmakers today are really making great movies like they use to, I think the movie scene is kind of falling apart, where people are interested in seeing Drama movies with boring resolves, instead of great entertainment. Spielberg is one of those who knows how to give movie fans a good time at the movies, and Jaws will forever hold a candle up for blockbuster-filmmaking.	5.0	Spielberg's classic shark-fest-and-save-the-shrimp	2002-02-12	0	0	0

Speilberg managed to put an intense fear of the ocean in the entire population, i still have a twinge of fear walking  into the breakers.The shark effects are brilliant. The anticipation that  builds up before you can even see the shark turns into amazement when you  get your first glimpse. The film crew did a fantastic job on  &quot;Bruce&quot; the mechanical shark (unlike Jaws 2, 3 and 4). I would  have loved to see what speilberg could do with this movie using todays  advancements in computer generated technology.This movie still  terrifies, even 25 years after its release. Ben Gardner's head popping out  of the hull of his boat still gets me to this day. Little Alex Kitners  death at the beach is as disturbing as ever. Jaws has everything from top  to bottom.

National news reporters are on the scene,yet no request for Coast Guard intervention takes place.Finding and killing this stupendous shark is farmed out to Shaw, using his own boat, probably not safe in a swimming pool.Police chief Schneider and shark expert Dreyfus hop sboard to help save lives and the movie's credibility. They succeed thanks to terrific acting, frighteningly good photography, a lightning pace, and great background music by John Williams. Ironically, it's Shaw who's consumed by pride and stubborness, while the novices reap the joy of victory.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	"28 years ago this summer, an almost-unknown director named Steven Spielberg, at the ripe old age of 25, released a film that caused a stampede at the box office and single-handedly started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster with ""legs"", the movie you had to see again and again and again.  Even after all this time, the ominous opening music from ""Jaws"" still sends a delicious tingle down the spine.  Spielberg's genius lay in turning Peter Benchley's mediocre novel into a well-acted, well-directed, terrifying classic horror movie.  He omitted all the boring side dramas that cluttered up the book and stuck to the bare bones; i.e., the primeval battle between man and a monster fish packing two hundred teeth and an attitude.""Jaws"" has more than a little in common with ""Moby Dick"", especially in Quint's fatal error in making his battle with the shark a personal vendetta, as Ahab did in his hunt for the white whale.  Just as the whale does in ""Moby Dick"", the shark turns the tables on its hunters and begins hunting them.  We see all of Quint's hubris brought low from the time he swaggers onto the deck of his own boat, monarch of all he surveys, until he ends up being relentlessly chewed up and swallowed by his nemesis.  Spielberg brings all this to us in vivid detail and reminds us that, after all, sharks will be sharks.Spielberg has a gift for humorous touches as well, and he's a master at contrast.  I still crack up over the scene where the two boys scared the bejesus out of several hundred people in fake shark outfits; the laughter turns to horrified gasps immediately in the next scene, in which a hysterical girl points out the real shark only a few hundred feet upstream, ready to chow down on an unsuspecting guy in a rowboat.  The scene with the boneheaded mayor goggle-eyed in outrage at a defaced beach poster, blind to the reality of the threat out in the water, is a howler.  And the scene in which Quint smashes the boat's radio with a stick, effectively cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece; the dawning terror in Quint's eyes, when he realizes that it's just them alone with the shark, and he finally realizes what an unequal contest it is, underlines all the folly of setting himself up against a power so much stronger than he is, that he can't hope to understand it, let alone defeat it.So how has this film stood up over the past quarter-century?  Leave the mechanics of the shark's workings out of it; sure, they can do it better now with better technology.  The film still delivers on its premise; it's still one helluva horror movie."	5.0	The movie that sparked the summer blockbuster phenomenon	2003-03-02	4	4	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1W6AMIGHPX3UQ	J. Merritt	Unless you've been living in a cave, you know this movie well by now and you know whether or not you like it, so I won't go on about that. What's important here is the extras; do they make it worth replacing the DVD copy you already have? The answer, unfortunately, is no, not really.The extras on the 30th Anniversary edition include deleted scenes and outtakes (already on the Anniversary edition issued in 2000), a documentary about the making of the film (the version on the 2000 edition is better and more to the point), and production photos, storyboards, and marketing materials (only slightly more expansive than the production photos included on the 2000 version). The only new features are an interview piece with Spielberg that was shot during filming (and is thus quaintly and enjoyably archaic) and a booklet of photos from the film which is spotted with quotes from Spielberg and the stars. This is a nice print piece, but it's highly debatable whether it makes the re-investment worthwhile.Mind you, I love the film, but I'd say buy this only if you don't already own a quality DVD print of the movie. If you do, just stick with what you've got. It's a great film, but this new edition just comes off as a slight repackaging designed to make the principles wealthier than they already are rather than bring us any new appreciation for the movie itself.	2.0	Stick With What You've Got	2006-02-26	6	3	3
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AL9WKVMRI6GFB	JMM	Note: This review is forJaws [Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet] (Universal's 100th Anniversary)Not only is Jaws being digitally remastered for this blu-ray release, but they also went back and performed a full frame-by-frame restoration of the original negative.  That means that any scratches, dirt and debris were cleaned up, and the color was re-balanced to ensure that the image would be optimal for the HD television setup.  Basically, this means that the Jaws blu-ray will have the movie looking as good as (if not better than) a fresh film print that you would have seen in the theater in 1975!The blu-ray will also have an upgraded sound mix, in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround sound.  Those who have a 7.1 setup in their home will be even more immersed in the sound effects and John Williams' haunting score.And to those worried about the artistic integrity... Spielberg monitored and approved the blu-ray picture and sound during this process.Here is a list of the Blu-Ray bonus features (taken from the Universal press release): The Shark is Still Working: The Impact & Legacy of JAWS: All-new feature-length documentary featuring never-before-seen footage and interviews with cast and crew including Steven Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider. JAWS: The Restoration: An all-new, in-depth look at the intricate process of restoring the movie. The Making of JAWS: A two-hour documentary featuring interviews with key cast and crew. From the Set: An insider's look at life on the set of JAWS, featuring an interview with Steven Spielberg. Deleted Scenes & Outtakes JAWS Archives: Take a peek inside the JAWS archives, including storyboards, production photos and marketing materials, as well as a special segment on the JAWS phenomenon. Original Theatrical TrailerAlso included will be a standard DVD, a Digital Copy (compatible with iTunes), and an UltraViolet streaming copy of the film.And if you want that nice-looking Universal 100th Anniversary slipcover, I suggest you buy this as early as possible - because the slipcover will only be available for a limited time.	5.0	Finally...

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	Never before or since has a movie taken hold of the American conciousness like &quot;Jaws&quot;.  To this day, people are scared to go near the water because of it; and the famous score is perhaps one of the most widely recognized pieces of music in the US.The beauty of this film is that it's subtle; you don't even see the shark until halfway through the movie.  The viewer isn't just scared of the shark, they are scared of everything that is unknown and uncontrollable.  The superb acting and camera work only enhance the tension, and the fact that the action takes place in a summer paradise creates an uncomfortable dichotomy that pushes it over the top.&quot;Jaws&quot; is one of the great films of all time.  The fact that it is a genuine crowd pleaser makes it all the more special.  For these reasons the bonus feature on the making of &quot;Jaws&quot; is all the more interesting, because it shows how a movie that seemed almost cursed became a hit.A great movie, and a great DVD.

""Jaws"" is one of the true great ""monster movies"" ever made - it may be the best of the genre since ""King Kong"", and it hasn't been surpassed.  The really great thing about this film is how laughably terrible it could have been (just look at all of the ripoffs that followed - even the ""Jaws"" sequels after ""Jaws II"").  Somehow, though, everything fits together, from the strong performances from every actor involved (except for Bruce the mechanical shark,), to John Williams' score (I've heard that Spielberg laughed when Williams first played the score for him, thinking Williams was joking, but those couple of notes are as scary in their simplicity as the ""Psycho"" score).  I'm sure this film is constantly dissected in filmmaking classes - even as a casual viewer, I catch something new every time I watch it.  ""Jaws"" is a textbook example of effective moviemaking, and a great rollercoaster ride of a movie."	5.0	One of the True Greats.	2005-01-01	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	Sure, the mechanical shark looks phony at times, but the edgy performances and Spielberg's flawless (and shameless) audience manipulation more than make up for it. You will believe a robot shark can eat people!Police chief Roy Scheider battles not only the hungry Great White, but also the manipulative mayor, the town's entepreneurs who want to save their tourist money, his own conscience and his aqua-phobia. Marine biologist Richard Dreyfuss lends a hand; so does Robert Shaw as the salty local captain and survivor of the horrific U.S.S. Indianapolis sinking.This is the movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; wants to be when it grows up, because it's as much about the people as it is the animal. Scheider and Dreyfuss bond in the way instant friends do, even though they have nothing in common- but there's a tension between them, a competitiveness, that underlies the scenes on Shaw's boat (in the book, the Dreyfuss character beds the chief's wife and there's a lot of social and class warfare involved, too- but Spielberg wisely leaves that out).Robert Shaw's cantankerous captain dominates the film's last third- if you saw him in &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; or &quot;Battle of the Bulge,&quot; you'll be surprised this is the same guy.  Think Captain Ahab with a foul mouth and a love for beer, and you'll get the idea.  Absolutely perfect!Beyond that, &quot;Jaws&quot; is one scary movie. John Williams' creepy shark theme has become iconic- after the first scene, it will drive you crazy with suspense every time you hear it. Spielberg's direction has less flash than in some of his later movies, and this allows the performances to draw the viewer into the story; these are shark attacks with consequences, and people get hurt who haven't been bitten.And then there are the first-person (or first-animal) point of view shots as the shark stalks its victims. Almost every 80s slasher flick copped this little trick because it's so effective.With Lorraine Gary as the chief's wife and Murray Hamilton as the shifty but ultimately tragic mayor.	5.0	Let It Take a Bite...

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2W7C9WIYIWWPC	Joe Oliver	You will generally be pleased with this DVD edition of one of the all-time greats for just about everybody. Picture transfer is O.K., and it's great to see it in full wide-screen after all these years; the picture does have  some artifacts in it throughout (those little sparkly things you see on  older films), but its not enough to be distracting, especially after the  shark arrives.  A buyer of this DVD should be prepared for what is not  included:  no director's commentary, writer's commentary, or isolated music  track--all of which seem artistic naturals for this release.  My guess is  they're already planning another release to include more outtakes (there  really weren't all that many) and probably Spielberg's commentary--I notice  they are careful to call this release &quot;Anniversary Collection's  Edition&quot;; I'm sure there will be other versions in the future.  Also,  be prepared for a little odd-ball fact and maybe disappointment related to  the sound:  5.1 sound is just fine, I'm sure.  The stereo, 2-channel  version I found very lacking in depth and separation; and, most notably,  you can't select Dolby Digital Sound (the older 4-channel surround sound)  unless you also choose subtitle captions--this is strange.  Finally, the  picture, with also about 75 minutes of additional features (making of...,  etc.), is dual layer on one side. Sure wish they would give us something on  the other side of these DVDs--even a modified TV version would be  appreciated and a better comsumer value.  But, on balance, DVD is worth the  price.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it--but don't take it near the beach.	4.0	Come On In:  The DVD's Fine!	2000-07-13	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A59EAODMJ673M	John Gentile	Before the PG 13 rating existed, producers of Jaws placated the MPAA ratings board by adding &quot;May be too intense for younger children&quot; after the PG. May be should be changed to MOST DEFINITELY. Jaws broke box office records BECAUSE people of ALL AGES found it amazing. Jaws may seem quite tame today, but in 1975 it kept all age groups out of the surf.  It succeeded because all aspects of the filmmaking process were done excellently.  First, the script. Speilberg wisely jettisoned the affair between Hooper and Ellen. He softened the characters making them more likable.  He obviously changed the ending to make it more spectacular. Next, the acting.  Perfect casting choices all around, from the 3 leads to the smallest part (secretary Polly is a riot with that voice). Location shooting was right on the money.  Beautiful beach is made ominous at night. Effects: Speilberg may complain but the mechanical shark is very convincing when it is on screen (mostly near the end). Lighting, editing, and of course the most famous musical score of all time are the icing on the cake. Top it off with an eye grabbing movie poster, and how could you NOT succeed.This is one of my favorite movies, I usually watch it around the fourth of July. The DVD is excellent, however the 75 minute documentary was cut by about 45 minutes (which was included on the laser disc). That aside, enjoy this marvelous film that will make you feel you are on that boat, that beach, or most chillingly, in the water.	5.0	May be too intense for Younger Children	2004-07-14	0	0	0

Can you remember a film that actually touched a nerve with the public? Beaches were full, but the water was vacant in the summer of 1975, filmgoers stretched for blocks, and Jaws mania was on. Yeah the shark looks phony in a few scenes, but they didn't have cgi computer effects then, and my opinion, the shark,(Bruce),looks a heck of alot better then the ones in Deep Blue Sea."" Without inflation and years gone by,I guarantee Jaws would still be in the top 5 all time grossing films. I remember tickets for $1.25 then. This Dvd is a must own, if you have the 25th anniv. edition and don't care for extras, save your money. But come on, you can always sell it and shell out 16 bucks for this. Just wish they had the original poster art on the cover, hey, it worked then, why not now. Purchase this classic thrill a min. and enjoy the reason people escape into movies............Just picked it up tonight, new deleted scenes, new bloopers, full documentary, 60 page booklett,nice packaging, 15 bucks, Walmart, cheaper then taking a date to see a cheesy movie like Hope Floats. I've been to the Vineyard twice, met people in the film and can gladly say I'm a Finatic. People, quit your bitching, if your pissed, DON'T BUY IT, watch a rerun of ""Happy Days"", when Fonz jumped the shark. Get over it, 15 bucks?

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AZZO3D8KP3COC	John M. Anderson	Jaws is one of those movies that is ALWAYS entertaining to watch, no matter how many times you watch it.  I have to see at least part of it every time I pass it on TV.The fear factor is always there in this movie.  The shark appears out of the deep unexpectedly, and still makes you jump.  But the suprising part of this film is the humor.  Bordy pulling up his shirt of look at his appendix scar when Quint and Hooper are showing off their scars.  &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;  Hooper making faces at Quint behind his back.  Very well acted by all parties, and what can you say about Speilberg's direction?  It is all very human.  Quints telling about the story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the greatest speeches in any movie, emotionally powerful.The Widescreen DVD is incredible.  The print is clear, and the sound clean.  The extras on the disc are a great asset, and only make a great movie better after watching them.  A definite buy for anyone who likes movies.5 stars for sure	5.0	Thrills and Laughs Galore	2001-06-22	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A5I8OWSLWM1MF	John Michael Kain	JAWS is one of those movies that really strikes the viewers as classic. It is one of those movies that you will remember long after you watch it.It is a horror thriller movie...in other words, action with a bit of fright. The scenes are really (well, its really a matter of opinion) really tense and, at the least, suspenseful. Such as the classic 'shark attack' music.I would strongly recommend this movie if you like the whole action-thriller genre.	5.0	a classic	2005-04-19	1	0	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ACNKNZSZQGZ5Q	John Moulis	Jaws directed by Spielberg is so well known it hardly needs an introduction.  When you think of the 1970s this film always comes to mind.  Saturday Night Fever may have been the favorite of the trendoids but this  was undoubtedly the greatest film of the decade.  In Australia it came out  prior to the summer of 1975.  There was a radio ad featuring the classic  quote by Richard Dreyfuss &quot;a shark is attracted to the exact kind of  splashing that occurs when every human being goes for a swim, you cannot  avoid it&quot;.  I remember being on the beach and the radio was playing  over the public address system.  This ad came on and within 2 minutes  almost everybody had left the water.  It speaks volumes for the film that  every film production class studies it at one time or another.  It strikes  a chord with everybody who sees it.  Brilliantly directed with competent  acting performances this is a film which automatically qualifies for the  time capsule of the 20th Century.	5.0	THE film of the 70s	2000-02-04	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"Like all of you I dished out for the 25th Anniversary Edition of JAWS, and was disappointed in the features. The transfer was nice but the extra features weren't fantastic.This is the second time they've double-dipped, though, with no real great content.JAWS: 25th Anniversary Dolby 5.1JAWS: 25th Anniversary DTS 5.1JAWS: 30th Anniversary ""Special Edition""--Available subtitles: English, Spanish, FrenchAvailable Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)--So they've given us the DTS and Dolby this time. How nice. But I must ask - why not the first time? Why must we wait through three different editions for something we should have had the first time?On top of that this new ""30th Anniversary Edition"" doesn't have a new transfer or new sound mix, they just put the stuff from the previous versions and stuffed them all on here.The special features aren't too overwhelming either:--The Making of Jaws For the first time ever on DVD, viewers will get a complete glimpse into the making of Jaws with this 2-hour documentary.--Wow, a two-hour documentary versus the one-hour documentary that chronicled everything about the making of the film from pre-conception to post-production featuring interviews with the star and director that was available on the previous DVD... I can't wait to shell out $20 for a documentary that they should have included on the previous release, but didn't, and instead included a shorter but equally comprehensive one! (End of sarcasm.)--From The Set An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws, featuring a never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg.--This is where you've gotta be careful. As a DVD consumer with over 460 titles on my shelves, I've seen this happen before: ""a never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg.""Technically speaking, ""interview"" could be a three-second clip of Steven Spielberg saying ""yes"" to a question. It doesn't say new interVIEWS with Spielberg, it says interVIEW. And it's part of a documentary, which means -- you guessed it -- it's not anything to go hog wild over.--Deleted Scenes--These were on the previous DVD.--Outtakes--So were these.--Jaws Archives Take a peak inside the Jaws archives including storyboards, production photos, and marketing materials, as well as a special segment on the Jaws phenomenon.--Hmm, I smell a fish. Storyboards were on the last DVD, as were production photographs. Marketing materials means trailers and TV spots - that was on the previous DVD, too.It's another case of the manufacturers re-wording previous content to make it appear fresh and new. By using words like ""marketing materials,"" you're being duped into thinking it's something that it's not.Overall this DVD is a waste. It has less special features than the previous disc, which included another documentary, a trivia game, and one or two other small features.On top of that, the artwork on this case is identical, only darker, and it has the words ""30th"" instead of ""25th."" If they were truly trying to satisfy the consumers, they'd have released JAWS: The Definitive Special Edition 2-Disc Set, with new documentaries, new interviews recorded exclusively for the DVD, an inner essay/booklet (like Criterion does), new artwork, a new branching version of the film (that includes the deleted scenes instead of putting them under special features), and commentary by someone, maybe the cast or a film historian. (As Spielberg is greedy and refuses to do commentaries on his films.)This is getting on my nerves because I like Spielberg but he's not helping to refute claims that he's greedy here. He releases about a gazillion special editions of each of his films, and never releases DTS and Dolby together on one disc. (E.g. Saving Private Ryan, Saving Private Ryan Collector's DTS Edition, and D-Day Commemorative Edition, which didn't even include the DTS track!)It's clear as day that the companies are just after money, and Spielberg's popularity is letting them do this.Be wise, investigate before buying this new DVD."	1.0	Beware false marketing.	2005-05-13	67	36	31

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQ7V1UO19U1N9	John Rossi	"How can I do this movie justice? Well let's see... I'll try my best. Since my high school days I have read Peter Benchley's novel JAWS upon with the movie is based many times. While the book DID have some suspenseful moments in it, by-and-large the novel is an overly-gory sex-filled hunk of bodice-ripping, political commentary garbage with a shark thrown in for color and flavor.Enter Steven Spielbery, Carl Gottleib, John Williams and their band of merry men. These people trimmed a lot of the aforementioned gore and sex and political malarkey from the book and what they came up with a very lean, tight and gripping suspense story. THAT is where the movie version of JAWS absolutely EXCELS. It is driven by SUSPENSE. The terror is largely pschological.  We are more terrified by what we DON'T see than by what we do see in this film. You don't even get to see the shark in his entirety until well over an hour into the film, and the fact that the shark's first appearance is preceeded by a very funny line of dialogue makes the effect triply powerful. This film does of course has it's ""blood and guts"" moments. The death scenes are well done and dramatic and shocking (particularly the death of Quint, at least for me), but they are not overly gross or over-done as in the novel. They ARE gross though. This is NOT a movie for young kids.Peter Benchley and Carl Gottleib wrote the script here and the dialogue is 100% compelling and effective. There is not one wasted word and none of the lines sound forced or fake or rushed.Enter Roy Scheider (Brody) Robert Shaw (Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper). No matter how good a script is you NEED good actors to pull it off. These three men were PERFECTLY cast in their roles. The chemistry they have on screen is evident. They gave such life to the characters on the written page that you could CARE about these characters and laugh at them and with them.You could even grumble under your breath if you want. I LOVE these guys! Brody is the normal guy we all identify with that goes above and beyond the call of duty to save his town and conquer his fear of the water. Hooper is a young, wise rich-kid know-it-all that comes across as a bit of a goofball. And Quint is the crusty old foul-mouthed sea dog that you LOVE to hate but he's cool in his own way and you sympathize with him as he faces his destiny in the film. Even Quint is a hero, albeit a tragic hero.Of course I cannot forget the contribution of Star Wars maestro John Williams to this movie. The theme he wrote for the shark is of course, classic stuff. When you hear it you get a chill because you instantly know that SOMEBODY'S in trouble! But there is more. This score is NOT a one-hit wonder. It crackles with tension and adventure. The scene where Quint tells the story of the USS Indianapolis going down features a light and ominous string and harp melody with other soft instruments that absolutely REEKS of suspense and coming danger. The scene for the preparation of Hooper's diving cage features a brilliant cello melody that gives a real sense of ""Okay, now we bring the war to the shark, go get 'em Hooper!"" The music throughout all the beach sequences and the final hunt for the shark has touches of lighthearted playfulness, nail-biting horror, and lots of rousing adventure and mystery. Kudos for a job well done.In short this film has everything a great film should. A very intense and involving story of man vs. a force of nature gone totally berserk. A top-knotch musical score. A wonderful script and some of the BEST acting to date in ANY horror, suspense, drama, or adventure movie. If you want GRAND entertainment of the highest order, do NOT miss Jaws. Even though this movie scared me to death when I was younger, I have grown to love it, and I think you just might love it too.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1P2NBM3P3TS2X	"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason"""	A few years ago, I and a few thousand other laserdisc fans plopped down  $150.00 and change for the super duper Signature Collection version of JAWS  on laserdisc.  It came with all the extras: -- bonus footage, outtakes,  interviews, marketing goodies, the CD soundtrack, novelization, and a few  other bells and whistles.  Now, some 4 or 5 years later, you lucky DVD  owners can get basically the same thing, minus the soundtrack and  paperback, for a fraction of the cost.  AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!  If this isn't your favorite movie, I'd be rather curious to know what IS!  The TNT network has run this film many times over the last few years, and  the copy they show has been beautifully restored and the color  &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit.  So just think of how great the DVD version is  gonna look!  And sound! Granted, and by Spielberg's own admission in the  laser's and DVD's accompanying interview footage, JAWS turned out as well  as it did almost by happy accident.  Spielberg initially was counting on  getting a great deal more footage of the mechanical sharks in the film, but  it was not to be (as a few humorous production stories in the interviews  will attest).  So JAWS had to take on a rather Hitchcock-ian feel instead  --  &quot;less is more&quot;, if you will.  Precious little shark footage  until the third act, and virtually every usable piece of mechanical shark  footage that was shot wound up in the film.  So it begs the question:  Is  JAWS as great a film as it is IN SPITE of itself?  Probably.  But who  cares?  Even if you are only a casual fan of this film, you owe it to  yourself to check out all the bonus features that come with this 25th  Anniversary set.  While not boasting as much bonus material as many other  DVDs have (THE ABYSS, ALIEN, the upcoming TERMINATOR 2 COLLECTOR'S  EDITION),  JAWS does have the advantage of being a very big part of  American pop culture, and the insight you can gain to this film from the  DVD extras actually draws you further into an already exciting movie  experience.  Now if we can only convince Universal Pictures to re-release  this film to theatres for this 25th Anniversary year. Even with the bonus  DVD and laserdisc features, this film will always play best in a big, dark,  crowded theater.  We should be able to let our kids experience it that way,  much like George Lucas did when he re-released his trilogy a few years ago.  There is at least one generation of people who never got to see JAWS 20  feet high and 48 feet across. And I challenge you to play this DVD will  full THX or  DTS Surround and NOT GET GOOSEBUMPS when John Williams' score  kicks in!	5.0	Sink your teeth into this!  (Bad pun, I know.

The scenes of shark attack are brutal, and based on true-life attacks. The trio of seamen that attempt to  destroy the beast is perfect filmmaking. 3 men at sea, an oceanographer, a  salty fisherman, and a cop-lanlubber, and a 30 foot 3 ton monster. All I  can say is that the scenes where Quint is killed will give anyone  nightmares, and make you think twice about hitting the surf. Scary stuff.  Audiences scramed with terror in the 70's.

So many of us are still afraid to go into the water!  I got to see the mechanical shark that was used in the movie at Universal Studios back in '76.  This movie has good acting, the movie is frightening, the characters are memorable, and the script is excellent.  And did I mention the special effects?

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A24Q40NN7O07GK	Jon Morris	"What can I say about ""Jaws"" that hasn't already been said a thousand times?It is a cinematic masterpiece. A perfect marriage of mystery, suspense, action, horror, and romance. Yes, I said romance. The romance of Chief Brody and his wife Ellen. The romance of Hooper and the ocean, and even the romance of Quint and the shark. Hell, there's even a romantic element of the mayor with the town of Amity.The film is a breathtaking homage to Hitchcockian thrillers. A psychological scarer that still makes people hesitate to go into the water, 37 years AFTER its initial release. It taps into our deepest, darkest fears about not knowing what is out there, the unseen leviathan in the depths and darkness, lurking, just waiting for its chance to attack.""Jaws"" was my favorite film as a child and still ranks as one of my all-time greatest films. It does so many things right, that it's hard to find flaws or pick at small imperfections. It is said that had the shark worked half of the time, that Spielberg would have produced a completely different picture. The shortcomings of the mechanical shark ""Bruce"", which at the time seemed like a detriment, might have saved the film from becoming just another monster movie aimed at making big bucks at the summer box office. The sharks failure to work on many occasions forced Spielberg to employ different methods of shooting scenes, choosing instead to imply the presence of the shark using unique angles and water-level camera shots, thus creating an instance where the audience had to creat the shark in their own minds, which is far more frightening than seeing the creature on film. Alfred Hitchcok famously spoke about the essence of suspense and horror. He described a scene showing a man being held at gunpoint, and two different ways of showing the same scene. In on scene, the man with the gun holds the gun, and shortly after pulls the trigger, firing a bullet into the man and killing him. The second scene shows the man being held up, but this time we see the gun and focus on the cocked hammer and the gunmans trigger finger, trembling on the trigger. The suspense builds and builds and builds, yet the man does not fire. Hitchcock further explained that the firing of the gun, although progressing the story, releases the audience from the suspense, and it is Hitchcock's goal to keep his audience in suspense and thus is the reason why he would not let the gunman pull the trigger in the scene. Sometimes, it's scarier to imagine the hunter than actually seeing it, and that is what makes ""Jaws"" such an amazing film.The Blu-Ray throws the experience into 2nd gear. Words can not describe how nice this transfer looks. It's not quite as good as current high definition film transfers, but considering we're talking about a movie that was filmed nearly 40 years ago, the blu-ray picture is amazing. The colors are rich and vibrant, and the fine detail that is present is incredible. I have personally seen 'Jaws' well over 100 times in my lifetime and I can easily say that the film has NEVER looked better."	5.0	A Spectacular Blu-Ray experience.	2012-06-26	6	3	3

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1B8HI3VREI1H3	Jorge A. Zarco	"Jaws(1975) is a classic Steven Spielberg movie based on the suspense novel by Peter Benchley. Sheriff Brody(Roy Scheider), shark hunter Quint(Robert Shaw), and marine biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) hunt a shark that's preying on people near Amity Island. Jaws was a critical and commercial success and it spawned three sequels. The filmmakers put most of the emphasis on the shark while the novel had many subplots. Hooper had an affair with Martin Brody's wife in the novel. In the Jaws movies, Ellen Brody is a more sympathetic character. The scene where ""Chrissie"" is killed by a shark while swimming was spoofed in Steven Spielberg's 1941(1979)! Jaws has been spoofed in movies and TV shows. There's a Jaws spoof in the 1976 Hong Kong comedy Mr. Funny Bone(Lo Fu Ji). A boy wears a Jaws T-shirt in Picardia Mexicana(1978). Jaws was ripped off in Great White(1981) and Shark Attack 3(2001).

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A186WNXTN6MBJ2	Jorge Ruben	First off I have to say that this is my FAVORITE film of all time. It is an excellent adaptation of a pretty good book. Now on to the DVD. Universal has put together a very pleasing presentation of this classic film. Aside  from the film (presented in an excellent anamorphic format) the disc  includes 3 trailers, a TON of production photographs, and some really  awesome storyboards that show not only scenes that were filmed but scenes  that ended up on the cutting room floor. Along with that, we have a 60  minute documentary, &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot;, which includes  interviews with Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider &amp; Richard Dreyfuss and  deleted scenes with outtakes.Like I said previously, the film is  presented in an anamorphic widescreen format, with very natural looking  colors and few artifacts; this is simply the best the picture has ever  looked. The soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 &amp; dts  5.1. Both soundtracks sound very good, with the dts soundtrack having an  edge in the low frequency effects and surround activity.The extras are  well presented. The trailers look good, and the numerous production photos  will be enough to whet even the most ravenous appetite of any JAWS fan.  Crew &amp; Filmmaker bios are included.Perhaps one of the most  anticipated parts of the disc is the documentary. Fans of the 25th  Anniversary laserdisc will recognize it; it's the same one that was on the  laserdisc, except truncated by about an hour. It includes most of the  better parts of the original documentary, but it still would have been nice  to fit the entire 2 hour one on the disc.Although some fans of the  original will complain of the new sound effects (needed to make the 5.1  surround sound more dynamic) I for one was pleased after the short  getting-used to period of the new sound effects. Since so much information  can be stored on the disc, the argument can be made that the original 1.0  mono sountrack could have been included (to placate the fans of the old  film). The only other thing I would have liked to see was the documentary  in its entirety, but after the aberration that was the  &quot;making-of&quot; on the anniversary THX videotape, this one was more  than welcome (as a matter of fact, why wasn't the DVD THX certified?) On  the whole, an awesome disc that should be in every film fans' collection...  kudos to Spielberg &amp; Universal for an excellent job!	5.0	One of the best of all time	2000-07-11	1	1	0

Most of my review will discuss the digital formats of the Universal 100th Anniversary package.I purchased the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital+Ultraviolet.  Redeeming the Digital and Ultraviolet copies was relatively straightforward, although it did require I sign up for an ultraviolet account, as well as an account with an ultraviolet partner (I was provided three choices; vudu, flixster, and universal).  There were a few options for the Digital copy as well, and I elected to use Amazon.  I believe itunes was another option, as was windows media.  The Amazon option provided me with a 9.99 credit to be used towards Jaws on Amazon instant streaming, which provides you the standard definition copy labeled ""with deleted scenes"" (the HD version does not appear to be for sale at this time, only for rent).  I can't pick out the scenes that had been deleted previously, though it did feel like some scenes had more to them, but I've always watched ""edited for time content"" on TV so that's to be expected.  Both the digital copy and the ultraviolet copy have ""redeem by"" dates in 2015, which is a lot better than previous digital copy limits I had seen in the past.I was personally disappointed to only get the standard definition copy from Amazon and in Ultraviolet, but that is all the insert promised.  I have read other reviews that indicate that the itunes digital copy comes with both the HD and SD versions, as well as an ""extras"" download.  If you have and use itunes, that may be a better avenue for you.  Given the chance to choose again, I'd probably still pick amazon, because I buy a lot of digital content from Amazon, and I don't use itunes at all.  I may consider holding onto my redemption code, however, to see if the HD version becomes an option, though if when you get around to it the code is either expired, redeemed, or somehow bad, there is probably less that you could do to right it."	4.0	Ultraviolet and Digital copy	2012-08-17	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3OH101U0CPUC7	Joseph Boone	The New England island community of Amity is gearing up for the summer tourist season with high hopes.  The 4th of July weekend is rapidly approaching and the businesses are all eager for the dollars that will get them through another year.  And then a young woman goes swimming and gets ravaged by a shark.  The series of events that follows leads to police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) closing the beach and calling in oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to supply information that could help deal with the problem.  Finally, the two of them join the grizzled Captain Quint (John Shaw) on his boat to hunt the great white shark... but the hunters become the hunted.Jaws was a major blockbuster in its day and still holds up pretty well.  The acting is strong whether talking about the stars or the supporting cast.  John Shaw attacks his role with particularly gusto and the script offers him many of the best lines.  The story is a touch slow in some respects during the first half, but once Quint and company go out on the water, the tension builds quickly.The plot has its weaknesses, primarily the extreme stupidity of the nearly every human in the story.  The mayor and town council willfully ignore sign after sign that the beaches need to be closed turning the situation into a true bloodbath.  Yes, they were worried about money but setting up tourists to be slaughtered wouldn't do the community any good in either the long or short term.  Even Quint, largely shown to be savvy and shrewd, allows several feet of water to swamp his boat and does nothing to pump it out.  Then he recklessly, seemingly purposely, burns out his engines leaving the boat to founder helplessly.Jaws isn't perfect, but it is an enjoyable film.  It was one of the films that created the whole concept of summer blockbusters and those who haven't seen it should check it out just for its historical significance.  Beyond that, it's second half provides a suspenseful thrill ride as the struggle of man vs. shark unfolds.	4.0	Entertaining classic	2007-12-28	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3BKQN4NREWI0E	Josh Terrell	Most center on the shark when the aspects of this film's plot go even further towards shore.  The film is about a town.  It is about a traditional sea of income, and the shark swallows the hope of needy men and women.  This need brings out the greed in the mayor.  The shark is playing its role by doing its part in leading the characters out to it through starvation.  When both begin to starve they find one another.  Man's survival through another's decline is one significant theme.  One man loves the shark, another despises, and this one indifferent, yet wants justice and peace.  All are selfish as is the town's prime function to unite for lives.  I could call this film a satire, but it isn't one.  IT certainly is a gold mine for an intellectual, because it isn't about a shark.  The shark, I believe can be symbolic for a moment. I love questions.	5.0	An Alien Plot	2001-08-07	2	1	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1LVZOK9F7K4CN	JR Pinto	What can one say of the movie Jaws?  It is an icon--as much as the Statue of Liberty or The Empire State Building.  I've noticed some people dump on the special effects as &quot;pre-CGI&quot;.  This movie is the argument AGAINST CGI.  Don't believe me?  Watch &quot;The Deep Blue Sea.&quot;As for the DVD itself, a lot of the material was all ready included on the 20th Anniversary VHS--notably, the Spielberg interviews.  However, that was just VHS.  This also contains many of the deleted scenes which (although clearly left out for a reason) are still quite enjoyable to watch.  This DVD sounds like no other broadcast version I've heard; compare this whale-song to the one on VHS.  Also, this is a completely different movie seen in widescreen format.  If you're a Jaws fan, you have to own this DVD.	5.0	One of the best movies ever!	2001-08-31	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1AKLZBTXAT5HZ	"J. Schroeder ""Jesse"""	In my opinion one of the greatest movies of all time.  My personal favorite (The Exorcist a close 2nd). A book and movie that hit a nerve.  What is worst than being eaten alive while out of your element?  To this day Jaws is still part of our American culture, especially the music.  A fast paced movie, a complete movie with great acting.  How was Robert Shaw not nominated for best actor or even supporting actor?  How was Spielberg not nominated for best director?  A disgrace.  Pretty much based on the 1916 shark scare at the New Jersey Shore and the capturing of a 18 foot, 5,000 pound great white shark off Montauk, NY in 1964.  This movie is a realistic account of a rogue shark terrorizing a New England resort (in book its a Long Island town) that is scary, full of suspense and fun.  While the ending with the oxygen tank is very Hollywood, its simply a movie for the ages. (Also anyone that might say the shark does not look real, professional people familiar with Great White sharks designed the shark from an actual great white.  And look at pics of actual great whites, they don't look real. For example with shark week and all those jumping great white shots and others photos, compared them to some shots in Jaws and even the outtakes.  You will see what a good job they did.  And the cage scene that is mostly a live white shark.  5 STARS!!!	5.0	My favorite movie of all time.  5 Stars!	2007-12-29	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1S2261MW4EU4S	"J. Stillman ""Movie Man"""	"""Jaws"" is definitely one of the great summer movies of all time.  Though the shark looks fake, there is character development and genuine thrills in this film that most modern-day movies lack.I have the 25th anniversary edition, but unfortunately, like many other reviewers, I was disappointed and infuriated when I bought the 30th anniversary DVD only to find it offered little more than what the 25th anniversary DVD offered.  I also don't like how the sound was remastered, especially at the end with the big explosion, which sounds muffled and weak.  And a number of choppy scenes and cuts still remain in this version, which is upsetting, given the film won an Oscar for Best Editing.Like other reviewers, I am angry at Universal for releasing this edition only five years after the last DVD, with little to show for it.  I felt pretty duped when I realized that the 30th anniversary edition was almost identical to the 25th anniversary DVD, but with more attractive packaging.  The studio could at least offer a rebate on the DVD for those of us who bought the earlier edition.I guess I'm a little stupid for buying this edition, but I can't help it, I'm a loyal ""Jaws"" fan and always will be."	2.0	Jaws, But Not Much Else	2005-10-07	29	21	8

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1ROZ9P38V7E4T	J. Victor	My first encounter with Jaws was back in 1978 when I saw Jaws 2 as a 7  year old. A year or two later I got to see the original Jaws when it was  re-released during the summer. I was genuinely enthralled by this landmark  classic as a kid and to this day Jaws hasn't lost any of its bite!It's  simply amazing what Steven Spielberg pulled off despite the legendary  problems that was faced throughout the production of the film.  This  adventure/horror story based on Peter Benchley's original novel, is  exciting, terrifying and even funny. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the  late Robert Shaw made a unlikely but highly memorable team as they went  about hunting down a 25 ft 3 ton Great White Shark named Bruce. Jaws is  filled with memorable images and scenes from the opening credits to the  very end. One that always stands out to me is watching the Orca set sail  through a  set of shark jaws hanging over a window in Quint's studio.A  combination of skilled direction and editing, terrific acting, and a highly  charged and unforgettable music score by John Williams create of the  greatest films of all times.  This upcoming DVD looks to be the definative  edition to watch this groundbreaking film for many many years to come.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1VZLLDNLURGJB	Keith Mirenberg	"Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition) (1975) was a great five star film that little more needs to be said about.  It was an early example of Spielberg's great work and even greater work to come.  I remember seeing this film in the summer of 1975 with my wife and a group of friends who all felt we had watched something very special at the time.This was one of the first films to take advantage of full size ""robotic"" animals, but it was good film technique and editing that made the movie work as the mechanical shark was very difficult to operate.  Something I did not know was that the shark was designed by the same technician that developed Disney's Giant Squid for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That early mechanical monster was also very difficult to work with but Disney stuck with it until it looked credible on film. A good documentary was included with this package."	5.0	Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition) (1975)-Steven Spielberg Gold!	2009-06-24	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AWXBY70IZVIML	"Keith Paynter ""videoplusdvd"""	"So this version marks the 30th anniversary release of Jaws.  It only seems like 5 years ago that we had the 25th anniversary edition...For those of you complaining about the turnaround on this title, consider how many people have DVD players today that didn't five years ago.  It is a worthwhile re-investment to hardcore fans like myself who found that the previous edition actually came up short on features compared to the lavish 1996 laserdisc box set that had a US$ list price of $130.  That version featured the original mono soundtrack, and the complete two-hour documentary (abridged on the 25th anniversary DVD), and the lack of these features was a sticking point to expectant fans of the first release. This has finally been rectified for the new version, and for folks like me who were disappointed in the remixed/re-recorded soundtrack and the abridged documentary, this disc is well worth the double-dip.Few people ever really complained about a re-marketed VHS title, simply with new box artwork, and possibly some cross-promtional tie-in material. The content potential of DVD has become a plus and a negative to the modern home video consumer at the same time - ""why couldn't they include this feature last time"", etc.  Some titles get even re-issued with less content to bring the price down, so there is no win-win situation.  You have to be your own judge.Disney was notorious for re-issuing its animated classics every 7 years both theatrically and on home video for a new generation of potential fans, so don't be so quick to judge any studio that uses a number to re-issue a classic film for a new generation of consumers.Universal is shortly re-issuing The Blues Brothers in a dual-cut edition (Theatrical and extended on the same disc), and I'll be investing in that, too, because while the expanded version was interesting, I still like the flow of the original.  It's what I prefer."	4.0	First-timers & hard-core fans: this is the version you want	2005-06-09	9	7	2

Now that's when u know if a movie is worth buying or calling a classic.  And this movie is a classic!  No doubt about it.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1KT1GWCW8F80	K. Gittins	&quot;Jaws&quot; is literally the original blockbuster movie. Spielberg did a good job in building the suspense by not overtly showing the shark in the first half of the movie, only its victims (or remnants of them). In this regard it is as good or better than any Hitchcock movie. There is no big message in the movie, no big concept. It's pure entertainment.As a one-time surfer in Hawaii, I remember being creeped out for a week or two after seeing the movie.All the actors did a tremendous job. Roy Scheider (police chief), Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and Robert Shaw (boat owner) are stand outs, but the supporting actors, such as Murray Hamilton (mayor) are good, too.Famous for the line &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat&quot; and the cello-based score that only requires 2 notes to define it.The reasonably-priced DVD has the widescreen movie, a good &quot;making of&quot; documentary, deleted scenes and out-takes, and some other minor extras. The movie is currently #83 on the IMDB list.	5.0	Suspenseful Spielberg	2004-06-17	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"With JAWS, Steven Spielberg burst upon the Hollywood scene, coincidentally inventing the summer blockbuster (for a while it was the highest-grossing film in history, breaking the $100 million mark), and laying the predicate for a whole series of wildly successful science fiction/adventure films that dominated the late 1970s and early 1980s, films like the STAR WARS trilogy, the STAR TREK series, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, E.T., RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and its sequels, a slew of uneven remakes of 1950s classics, and a host of less-than-memorable gadget-monster knock-offs.Lest you wonder, JAWS is sci-fi: A trio of intrepid explorers/monster hunters (Quint, Hooper and the Chief) travel to an alien world (the ocean) to take on a supernormal sentient beast (the shark) which has been threatening Earth (in this case, the fictional Amity Island).Just as trivia: JAWS the novel takes place on the South Shore of Long Island in a town called Amity; this brought notoriety to the real South Shore town of Amityville, notoriety which was confirmed with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR a few years later.Luckily for Spielberg, JAWS was and still is a wonderful entertainment experience, belieing its history of horrendous cost overruns and production problems, a history which would have sunk Spielberg's career before it ever started, had JAWS been less successful.We never get to see the shark until the third reel; however, John Williams' classic ""Da-dum da-dum da-dum"" theme is familiar enough a part of popular culture to make swimmers look around nervously 'til today. It's a character in itself.Robert Shaw turns in a masterful performance as Quint, the salty, snarly, obscene Ancient Mariner come to life. Richard Dreyfus plays Matt Hooper, a college-boy ichyologist caught up in a hilarious contest of machismo with the barnacled Quint, in which the two crush beer cans (Quint) and styrofoam cups (Hooper), trade barbs (literally and figuratively) as the hunt goes on, and eventually bond in their shared Ahabian quest against the shark. The Buddy Film quality of JAWS is immortal.Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody, the seafearing New York cop who always wants a bigger boat. Every sailor knows the scat dialogue, ""Get away from that radio!"" never actually shouted by Quint as he smashes his marine radio to bits after the nervous, completely-out-of-his-element Brody calls mayday after just seeing the shark for the first time.Murray Hamilton turns in the best performance of his career as the gregarious, disbelieving Mayor Larry Vaughan, who refuses to accept that his town has become a seafood buffet, albeit from the wet side of the tide line. His doubt nearly consumes him. It DOES consume several of his constituents.Quite possibly one of the ten best films of all time, JAWS entertains immensely even a third of a century later."	5.0	"""Mr. Hooper, that's the USS INDIANAPOLIS."""	2007-07-28	7	6	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1OZAYRJQAERTK	Larry Benjamin	The problem with sharks is that they're just too sharp. If only they could be captured safely, their teeth filed down a little to blunt them, and released, they would then only gum their human victims. This strategy is left unexplored in &#34;Jaws,&#34; lauded as the first great summer blockbuster, and the highest-grossing film of all time until it was supplanted by &#34;Star Wars&#34; two years later.The first problem is the title, so general as to be meaningless. Doesn't every animal except the lamprey have &#34;jaws?&#34; As Steven Spielberg pointed out, the word was familiar but not in regular use at the time. This allowed the film to appropriate the word and become inextricably linked with it.I can't comment on the DVD, Blu-Ray, VHS, or streaming version since I only saw this film once, in the theater, shortly after it was released. I also read the book. Spielberg made the decision to scrap most of the sub-plots in order to concentrate on the shark, the shark, the shark, a cutting-edge animatronic robot named &#34;Bruce.&#34; It's a shame, because one major theme of the book was that unmentionable topic, class differences. The novel was my first exposure to the concept of &#34;summering.&#34; No one where I grew up &#34;summered&#34; anywhere, and no one else &#34;summered&#34; where we lived - it was an East Coast phenomenon. The book made a clear distinction between &#34;summer people&#34; and &#34;winter people.&#34; Spending the summer in the Hamptons was a mark of status; living there year-round was not. The wife of the town police chief had met him years before when her date was driving too fast, when the future chief, an officer at the time, pulled them over. She was a &#34;summer person,&#34; but fell in love and moved to Amity permanently, despite the scorn of her upper-class friends who sneered at her marriage to &#34;that policeman.&#34; When the shark begins its depredations, an ichthyologist from Woods Hole is called in as a consultant. It turns out that the wife knows him - she used to date his older brother. He reminds her of the world of wealth and privilege she left behind. The &#34;winter people&#34; of Amity are totally dependent on the income generated when the &#34;summer people&#34; visit, and the shark's presence threatens to disrupt this. The initial resistance of the town's leaders to take any precautions, in the hope that the shark will just go away if they refuse to acknowledge its presence, comes directly out of this economic dependence. This tension runs through the entire book, and is a major theme - in fact, the shark can be viewed as little more than a device to set up this conflict. Leaving it out makes &#34;Jaws&#34; the film little more than a monster flick, to quote the poet Antler, with &#34;doors springing slimy buffooneries.&#34; It could have been so much more.The other problem with the film is the casting. Robert Shaw as the professional fisherman, brought in to slay the shark, is perfect - he is every inch the grizzled, salty sea captain. However, Roy Scheider as the police chief is too professorial - he looks more like an accountant. Surely James Caan or Dennis Hopper was available? Someone with a tougher, more dangerous appearance was needed.But the real problem is Richard Dreyfus as the ichthyologist. Without the romantic interest, maybe a handsome, dashing fellow, like Lee Majors, or even Bill Bixby, wasn't required, but for anyone familiar with the book, casting Dreyfus in this role would be like replacing Brad Pitt in &#34;Legends of the Fall&#34; with Jon Lovitz. The filmmakers evidently wanted to make sure that the audience knew he was there to study the fish, by God, and nothing else.Nevertheless, &#34;Jaws&#34; left an indelible imprint on the popular consciousness. Despite the fact that one is far more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark, the idea of an implacable predator rising from the deep and terrorizing the innocent beachgoers caught the national psyche. The shark is only a danger if we dare to enter the water, land animals tentatively intruding into his mysterious domain. At the city's edge lies an impenetrable wilderness, as yet untamed, and ruled by a king as old as the earth itself. &#34;Jaws&#34; reminds us, as the Egyptian priest remarked to Solon, &#34;you are but children.&#34;	5.0	The problem with sharks	2014-06-16	1	0	1

Where do i start this movie had a really interesting, suspenseful plot that scared allot of people [including me] into staying out of the ocean. The shark looks kinda fake but i don't really care it must be pretty hard to make a 25 foot long model of a shark look real [especially since this was made in the 70s]. In some ways i recommend the 30th anniversary widescreen edition rather than the fullscreen anniversary collectors edition because the bonus features in the 30th anniversary widescreen edition are longer. jaws grossed $470,653,000 which shows why this is probably the best shark movie get it.jaws:10/10 awesomejaws2:8/10 pretty goodjaws3:4/10 badjaws the revenge:1/10 waste of money	5.0	great movie!	2010-07-31	1	0	1

Really, it's a masterpiece of story telling and as director Steven Spielberg often states, full of happy accidents. So when you see my 1 star review, what you need to understand is my review is not of the film, itself. It's of this edition.The sound mix in this film is awful. Remastered in 5.1 with new effects added. Effects that are just plain bad. Effects that sound like they were taken from free MP3 clips on the web bad. Poorly excuted, muting the effect of the intended scenes, screwing up or altering how well dialogue can be heard and just plain ruining the film.

I first saw the film in DECEMBER 1975 after months of playing in theatres, and when I walked out of the theatre (Sunrise Mall, 2nd floor,  Massapequa, Nassau County, Long Island, NEW YORK)-theatre is no longer there, I had to walk around the mall a few times to get the ""dizziness"" out of me; I had NEVER been so involved and so effected by a movie before in my life (I was 15 years old).  I also like ""Jaws 2"" but not as much.  ""Jaws 3"" was so-so, and ""Jaws 4"" totally SUCKED!  (They should make that National Lampoon's ""Jaws 5, People 0"" now!)  I have even been to Martha's Vineyard where ""JAWS"" was filmed (in 1992)! I had to go since ""JAWS"" is my favorite, but will probably miss out on the 30th Anniversary celebration in the Vineyard this year!  I have EVERY edition of ""JAWS"" (EXCEPT the videotape!).  I have ""JAWS"" 5 times: 3 LD's (laserdiscs) and 2 DVD's:  regular edition of the movie on laserdisc in CLV, another edition laserdisc but in CAV, the BOX SET Special Edition on laserdisc which cost a ""pretty penny""! (over $100 U.S. dollars), and ""25th Anniversary of JAWS"" DVD, and now yesterday, bought the ""30th Anniversary of JAWS"" DVD.  ALL in Widescreen / Letterbox!  This format is the BEST way to go, best way to watch a movie, especially with a 60-inch t.v. screen!  Fullscreen / Pan-and-Scan / Full Frame (FF) SUCKS!  If you're a die hard fan of movies, WS (Widescreen) is the best way!  That is the way the movie was presented in the movie theatre, and what the director had intended for people to see!  (As one person wrote once, talking about Fullscreen: FOOL Screen!  People like Fullscreens are fools!)  You can tell that I am a GIGANTIC FAN of ""JAWS""!  And a big fan of Steven Spielberg!  I even have ""DUEL"", ""1941"", ""E.T."" twice each, on laserdisc, and the special editions on DVD! And have many other Spielberg flicks on laserdisc and DVD (I met Spielberg in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles, California at the Academy Awards ceremony in March 1987 on the stage after the ceremony, and was able to converse with him; no one around; just me and him, and someone with him; he is short; I am 6 feet.  I even got to hold an Oscar that night!  Caught him while he was running up the steps onto the stage, and I said ""Mr, Spielberg"", he turned around, I shook his hand, and just told him that I think he is the greatest director and that he is my favorite, and to keep up the excellent work!  He said ""Thanks""! Of course!)  Anyway, before the movie ""JAWS"", I used to swim WAY THE HELL OUT, until I could not see anybody on the shore (I did this when I was 12, 13 and 14 years old); after the movie came out, I won't swim out that far, the bottom of the sea (sand below) is not more than 8 feet below me, AND I have to swim -or have to be- around people!  BUT!  The movie made me become interested in sharks and the history of sharks and anything about sharks, even other movies about sharks, I will buy.  I am fanatic about sharks now!  And also with earthquakes!  Anyway, I know the ""suits"" (executives) want us to BUY,BUY,BUY every edition!  Usually I only buy one, say, with ""THE GRUDGE"": I bought Special edition ONLY because I had ""JU-ON"", so why buy the regular edition of ""GRUDGE"" when it is the same movie as the Japanese version?!  I am a sucker for ""JAWS"", and probably will buy the NEXT version, next Anniversary edition, and the next, and the next....  If you LOVE the film as I do, or do not have any versions from before, buy it!  (Even though I had the laserdisc with the FULL documentary, I still bought the newer version: has movie in Spanish.... know people who speak it, and a couple other extras, even though most extras were on last edition ""the 25th"".  I intend on keeping ALL my editions of ""Jaws"", and not selling!  Maybe collectibles one day!  I know I am one of the suckers, but what can I say!  This film WILL scare you!  The BEST (if you want to call it such) HORROR movie!  At least THE BEST Action / BEST Thriller / BEST Drama movie ever!  This movie ""rocks"", it is EXCELLENT, and THE BEST .... EVER!  And I will argue that point to the day I die!  Buy it!  (It is cheap, compared to editions in the past!)  Thank you very much!  And keep on .... chomping!  LOL  duh-duh,duh-duh....

Spielberg continually criticizes his choice to film on the sea & even the making of the film but I believe that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagaination. I personally feel that it was great that the shark did not have lots of ""Screen Time"" because that is what makes JAWS a truly terrifying movie. I have seen the movie over 125 times and I am still scared when the head of Ben Gardner pops out of the boat and when the shark leaps onto the ORCA. THAT IS WHAT MAKES A GREAT HORROR MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The suspense, the feeling that something big is going to happen, something that really hits home (it could really and truly happen.)  When you compile the best Horror movies of all time there are some great ones... Dracula, Frankenstein, Halloween and scores of others.  The one that really stands out in my mind is JAWS (the original.)The Original worked not just because of a great story written by Peter Benchley but because on a great cast of actors.  Every scene in the movie is very believable and is just captivating.  When I watch it at home when I have to stop or pause the movie I hate doing it because I get so caught up in it."	5.0	BEST HORROR FILM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2011-03-31	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"In 1975 ""Jaws"" was a phenomenon. The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing ""Jaws"" had lines for every showing for weeks and the movie was in the theater for months.The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie. Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking...just...below...the water. The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations; menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC! Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.In its own way, this movie combines the drama of ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie. This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.It is amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror. Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical. Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster. Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach where millions journey each year. Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration). The audience knows what is coming and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.The final sequence in the movie is excellent and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow. This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie. In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark. Can Chief Brody conquer his fears? How will he do it? The suspense is just killing me! Here comes the SHARK!!! LOOK OUT!!!This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 30 years after its release. One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1R1792GNPXNUJ	Maddy Johnson	Lets face it, even the people who haven't seen JAWS are still humming that unforgettable eerie theme. DUN DUN, DUN DUN, DUN DUN DUN DUN!!! And thats not the only thing America isn't forgetting. It's that feeling watching JAWS gives you. That tense, anxious, painfully exciting, agonizing joy where you can feel your heart pounding right through your chest.Speilberg's JAWS, is a down-right brilliant film. You'd assume so too because the summer of the film's release, tourism in beach towns went WAY down.The plot is fairly simple. A happy summer beach town gets hit with a leathal shark attack just off it's beach. Since then, 2 more occur, causing Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) to worry. Resulting in the classic trio of oceanographer Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman, Quint(Robert Shaw)teaming up to go hunt down the famous deadly shark. I apologize that my summery of the plot is really just a breif overview, but I fear that nobody will read it unless I keep it snappy.All in all this is a great film, filled with thrills, romance, comedy....but mostly thrills. It's a true american classic that is to be shared with generations and generations to come. I highly reccomend it.	4.0	Wonderfully Cheesy, yet Undeniably Thrilling!	2006-08-14	2	1	1

For $15 at your local Best Buy or Circuit City, you can get the widescreen version of the movie (or fullscreen if you have no taste), you can choose to either listen to the movie in 5.1 surround, DTS (if you have a convertor, and incidentally, these two formats were only available on separate discs previously) OR the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL MONO mix which was not previously available on any DVD pressing of this film. The last time it was available was on the laserdisc. This original mix has all of the ORIGINAL sound effects before they were tampered with on the substandard 5.1 mix (specifically the old whalesong when Quint finishes the Indianapolis Story). This presentation, with the uncut 2 hour classic documentary from the collectable laserdisc along with deleted scenes and a slew of production extras, AND a collectible book. FOR $15? and you people are COMPLAINING?!!?!? Give me a break.  Complaints about no commentary. Why do you need a commentary? The documentary interviewing everyone (including Spielberg) is over TWO HOURS!!! What more do you hope to learn from an additional commentary? THIS DVD is a true deal and I am VERY happy that I made this purchase, and yes I did buy the previous edition (which I will sell off shortly). If you love this film, I highly recommend picking up this DVD. For the amount of extras and presentation of the film, along with the low price, it is quite a deal. As for the double-dipping controversy, I side with those that say if you don't want to buy the new version, then don't buy it. There's no such thing as a definitive edition of a movie on a particular format. The formats are going to be constantly changing and new editions are going to be getting released and re-released. This is less of a black and white issue than  ""the money-hungry studios are out to get me!!!"" DVDs have gotten so cheap now, that an upgrade to a new edition can easily be justified.

Let me explain why:First off, it totally changes the original sound of the movie.  It has new special effect sounds and other stuff, but at some points you can't even hear what the character says.  It shouldn've given you a choice between the old and new.  Next, all the delted scenes and outtakes are not shown.  Then, they CUT DOWN the 2 hour documentary.  What?  Because they were TOO LAZY to put it on two discs.  (Same goes with VHS).  The 20th anniversary laserdisc included it all.Anyway, the movie is great.  I think it's Spielberg at his best.

Gionfriddo	"Regardless of whether or not you are upset about this new edition coming five years after the last (which seems perfectly reasonable to me considering there are a lot more DVD players now than there were in 2000), ""Jaws"" will remain an amazing, classic movie with plenty of historical firsts.  The first summer blockbuster;  the first movie that used a handheld camera for just about every shot;  the first movie that relied almost completely on complicated mechanical contraptions for the main protagonist;  the first movie filmed on Martha's Vineyard;  the first movie that elevated ADL into a bonafide career move (well-known character actors were used for the background dialogue looping, like Howard Hesseman, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean and David L. Lander). And other than the three starring and two supporting roles, it used a cast of unknowns, mostly islanders.I'm unsure if anyone's mentioned this already, but one of the likely catalysts for the new edition may have been the highly successful ""JawsFest `05"" held on the Vineyard a week and a half ago.  (Which came first, the edition or the festival? Probably the festival- which earned a big blessing from Universal.  They provided all the equipment for a huge outdoor screening.)  It was an incredible opportunity to find out about all facets of the making of this classic and to meet the production people involved, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  In their review of ""JawsFest `05"", the LA Times reported that movie festivals and other related splashy events are becoming the new way that studios are releasing (and re-releasing) their product.Back to the 2 disc set: the nine minute UK interview with Spielberg, taped on the second day of what would become a much longer and way over budget shooting schedule, shows a director still at ease before all hell would be breaking loose shortly thereafter.  Although it is short, it's very interesting to hard core Jaws fans. The 60 page booklet has a lot of behind the scenes photos I hadn't seen before.  There are a few bits of additional deleted scenes and outtakes which have been added to what we got five years ago.  It is nice to have the complete two hour ""making of"" documentary now.  As for the movie, having three audio mixes is fabulous.  The DTS is very special, but the purist in me really enjoyed the mono from the good ole days of 1975 when I first saw the film.It's up to you if you want to upgrade to the 30th Anniversary edition.  For me, the multiple audio choices made it a no-brainer."	4.0	Jaws 30th makes for a 'sound' investment	2005-06-17	0	0	0

"30 years later it is difficult to write words to conjure up in the minds of a ""Jaws"" novice the effect that this film had on American and world cinema back in 1975.Steven Spielberg was essentially unknown when Peter Benchley's shark book rocketed up the bestseller lists.  CGI wouldn't be invented for 2 decades.  John Williams had not yet written the musical score to Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and dozens of other instantly recognizable melodies.Jaws hit America in a way that wouldn't be equalled until a few years later - when Spielberg did it again with ""Raiders"" and ""E.T.""I envy the person watching ""Jaws"" for the first time.  It's a thrill-ride of the highest possible magnitude.  Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw bring their vivid characters to life - the police chief who moved to the small beach community to escape the excitement of New York, the geeky scientist shark-expert and the salty old fisherman.Are you tired of thrillers where 2-dimensional characters engage in inane dialogue and behavior before being summarily killed? In Jaws we have characters that we come to know and care for - then send them into the mouth of the beast.  The results are edge of your seat, white knuckle tension.All of these principles made other fine movies - but there has NEVER been another ""big bad fish"" story as thrilling as ""Jaws""."	5.0	The First Summer Blockbuster	2005-05-08	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2EXPMMJ11MBW	"Marlene Martin ""Seth"""	Jaws is a classic seaworthy tale of a dangerous man-eating predator. It' set on Amity Island in the summertime. Tourists are repeatedly attacked by the monster until chief Brody must hunt him down.Jaws has spectacular effects for that time. Even though the shark is mechanical, it throws a sense of terror into you whenever it opens its gargantuan mouth. Especially when he jumps out of the water and onto the boat!If they ever make a remake of Jaws with computer special effects, I will personally diss the heck out of them. As much as I absolutely love computer effects, you can't replace the horrifying shark named Jaws.	5.0	Classic	2005-01-06	2	1	1

Speilberg's cocky youthful directing mixed with a juicy plot and a divinely inspired performance from Robert Shaw make for a timeless film. My friends and I are lifeguards at a  pool in the summer and we conquer boredom by quoting Jaws extensively. We  can do entire SCENES - lines, facial expressions, even LAUGHS! We idolize  Quint and revere Shaw for giving him such life. The must-have of  must-haves. Don't settle for the edited, commercial infested version TNT  always plays.	5.0	Classic	1999-01-13	1	0	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1PZRQM4UKYYWT	Marvin	Ignoring the fact that this is a great film, I'd just like to affirm what others are saying.  Having seen (annoying) 16x9, crappy HD versions of the film on various cable channels for years, I noted that blu-ray.com was raving about how great this blu-ray restoration looked, so I finally sprang for it.  Not only was it nice to see the film in the wider aspect ratio, but it just looks stunning.  In the close-ups you can &#34;count hairs and pores&#34;, and unlike so many older films, the colors are not washed out, but are (with a few exceptions) vibrant and natural.  (This is based upon viewing on a 75&#34; screen size, where imperfections would be far more obvious.)If you've wanted a version of this in your collection, this one shouldn't disappoint.	5.0	Fantastic restoration for blu-ray.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1Y2APTD829A7J	Matthew P. Forrestall	"What else can I say that hasn't already been said about Jaws? Over the years, this movie became my #1 favorite movie of all time, supplanting Star Wars.If you only ever saw Jaws when you were younger and still think it is simply a summer blockbuster action/horror movie with no depth to it, then I urge you to revisit the film with an adult mind. The performances in this film are top notch. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and especially Robert Shaw expertly bring their characters to vivid life.  There's more going on underneath the surface of this movie than simply a shark terrorizing a resort town. I won't bore you to tears with my thoughts but suffice to say, this movie is an interesting look at the intricate relationships that form between people living in a small town, and specifically the relationship that grows between the three main characters as they embark on a mission against a ""remorseless eating machine"" that tests them to their very cores.The Blu Ray video is excellent and the sound is top notch. I would highly recommend upgrading to the Blu Ray for the documentary ""The Shark Is Still Working"", which is included in this package. Narrated by Scheider, it provides an in-depth look into the trials and tribulations of the making of the film and how Spielberg turned what could have been a complete disaster into a masterpiece."	5.0	Blu Ray is exceptional for an exceptional movie.	2012-09-06	4	4	0

The scene in question is where 'Hooper' inspects the remains of  the first victim. The audio and picture edit made here is just so bad. I  have seen this once before on a UK TV Broadcast back in 1983. However since  then I have never seen it on any UK sell through material.

I read one reviewer say that it is on the tv all the time and that people should get a life?  Have you thought that there is a reason that it is on all the time?  The fact that it is on all the time should not be the reason to give it a bad review.  This movie set the standard for the summer blockbuster, in fact, it created the summer blockbuster event.  Make no mistake, this is an action/thriller, but it has a lot of humor in it and the characters grow, evolved tthroughout the movie and you get to feel for them.  You see Martin Brody go from being dominated by the mayor and suffering the consequences to demanding to resolve it his way.Spielberg keeps the shark hidden until near the end portion of the movie.  Up to that point, all you see is hints and clues of its presence.  If it was being made today,  They would show the shark all the time.  See 'Deep Blue Sea' for example.Get it!

"After the sad death of Roy Schneider, there was a special screening of this, on Easter Sunday, strangely enough. Shockingly, the cinema was only just half full I would have said. I've only seen Jaws once, and that was many years ago, and my friend and me spent the entire time talking throughout it. And it was shown on TV. Hardly great quality. My mum loves the movie, and she owns the sequels, but I've just never got round to watching it.The print we watched wasn't the greatest quality. It was grainy, and jumpy at times, and one important bit was completely missing (the bit where the shark comes out the water for the meat, and Brody says ""We'll need a bigger boat."") The famous line was kept in, but it completely skipped the shark, so one of the most important scares of the movie wasn't there. Disappointed, slightly, but the rest of the movie was still good.I am not going to go into the plot of Jaws. Duh, it's perfectly obvious. Yes, it was 1975, and it was a Steven Spielberg movie (I haven't seen many, I really need to educate myself), but it hasn't dated that badly. Not as badly as I was expecting. Brody, played by Roy Schneider, was excellent, as was the supporting cast, although I didn't know any of them. It did start off, in my opinion, like a really bad slasher movie, with the two teenagers stripping off, and going skinny dipping, but it did get better.The shots from the shark's view were really creepy. I think that's what made the film for me, as it would have ruined the film more, if the shark had been shown more than it was. There was only a couple of very brief glimpses here and there of the shark, towards the end it was shown more. It's good when horror etc movies do that, cos I do have the impression it ruins it otherwise. Predator for example, is a lot more scarier, than if we'd actually seen the Predator more. The thing with Jaws is it's scarier/creepier what you don't see - I tell you, my imagination was making up some awful images when Hooper was looking at the first girl's remains. Bleurgh.Jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful. I wasn't even around (never mind thought of) when it was first released, and I enjoyed it. Jaws will always be loved by generations old and new.

""Gorehound"""	There's not much I can say about Jaws here that has'nt already been said before, so instead I will talk more about why Hollywood used to be cool and why now....IT IS NOT.Jaws is pretty much a perfect movie in every way possible. The casting and acting are perfect. The actor's and actressess in this film all seem like normal people you would see walking down the street and you can really realate to (the average Joe), and I think it really help's the movie quite a bit. Their performances are not too over-the-top, and not only do the actor's give great performances but you actually start to care and feel for them unlike many movie's nowaday's. Personally I think I know too much about big Hollywood actor's personal live's now to actually take them seriously (if I just seen Brad Pitt on the cover of People magazine the day before crying about his fight with Angelina Jolie, how am I supposed to beleive his role as a bad-a** secret agent? Nothing against Brad Pitt, just an example). It's not necessarily the actor's or actress's fault, it's just how pop-culture and Hollywood is nowaday's.The dioluge in Jaws is perfect but not too perfect, there is awkward pauses, sometimes character's are uncomfortable, and don't alway's say the 'right' thing.......like real life. Not like actor's now with corny catch phrases, perfectly timed scentences, and that ALWAY's know the 'right' thing to say. My point is, Jaws is a realistic film that, like real life, is not alway's perfect.Now I will talk about my favorite thing about Jaws; THE SPECIAL EFFECT'S! Speilberg uses a mixture different technique's to pull off a real (and very angry) killer great white. Mixing shot's of real life footage of shark's, puppetry, prosthetic's, and editing to make a very scary and beleivable shark. That's right folk's...no GGI here, the actor's and special effect's are actually on screen with the actor's and actresses, they are not in front of a green-screen reacting to something that is not even there like so many movie's now. In other word's....it actually took some talent to create realistic special effect's.My other favorite thing about Jaws that I think help's a lot is the music. It add's a lot of suspense to an already suspenseful movie and is some of the best music in movie history.On a last note, one of the greatest thing's about Jaw's is that it can either be veiwed as a horror film, an action film, or a thriller and there is not many film's you can say that about. It is in the eye of the beholder and personally, I veiw it as horror.* I notice a lot of people complaining about this 30th anniversary edition because of the realease of the 25th special edition a 5 year's ago with basically the same special feature's, except for the DTS audio track's and a 2 hour documentary. STOP WHINING, they are alway's going to re-release movie's with more and more extra's as they come along. For myself (a person who has not purchased Jaws until now), why would I buy the 25th annivarsary edition when I could buy the 30th anniversary edition with DTS (better audio), and more features? It's a no brainer. If you already purchased the 25th edition then this release has nothing to do with you and that suck's for you, but for people like myself who have not purchased it yet, of course I would like to have the 2 hour documentary and best audio of one of the greatest movie's ever made. So stop whining about a release that has nothing to do with you and please stop writing bad reveiw's for it. It can be very misleading to people like me who have never purchased it and are looking to, or people who have never seen it.	5.0	One of the scariest movie's of all time.......PERIOD.	2007-11-20	6	6	0

I'm so glad Universal went back to the ORIGINAL NEGATIVE and restored it before striking a first-generation print for this beautiful transfer, as this is truly one of their landmark, groundbreaking, legacy releases. There's a REASON this film scored record-breaking box-office, Oscar accolades and critical reviews. It is a timeless classic!The 7.1 surround sound is expansive. There are now 360-degree splashes happening all around you during the 4th of July Amity beach panic scene (YES!!!), something that was sorely absent from the previous, overall excellent, 5.1 surround re-mix for DVD. Several ""legacy"" sound-FX, from the original 1975 mono mix that were sorely absent in the previous 5.1 surround DVD mix, including the original whale sound behind the guys at the dinner table in the Orca at night, and the final  rifle bullet ricochet off the scuba tank in the shark's mouth at the end, have, happily, been reinstated!For purists, like myself, the original 1975 mono soundtrack is also included (it is English 2, 2.0 Mono, in Settings, from the Main Menu, under Audio)! John Williams' ""Da-dum..."" music is MUCH LOUDER, CLEARER, MORE PREVALENT OVER SOUND-EFFECTS, in the mono mix than in the 7.1 surround mix! In the 7.1 surround mix, while expansive and atmospheric, John Williams' music, which is so much a part of the impact of Jaws, has been way too artificially reverbed, sounds thin, and tends to get drowned out by sound-effects. It's still a great-sounding mix overall, but many Jaws fans, like myself, will actually PREFER the mono track, for really hearing John Williams' music, and for restoring Jaws to its classic, legendary, ""nightmarish summer of 1975 horror film"" status.All the extras (except the ""teaser"" trailer, with animated ""teeth"" chomping down on bathers legs in several underwater shots over John Williams' tell-tale ""thump thump"" music, and text saying ""This summer...when the beaches are open...and the water is warmer...you will be taken by...JAWS"") are included from the 25th and 30th Anniversary DVDs.There is a new and delightful documentary, ""The Shark is Still Working"", which was apparently compiled over many, many years, and which includes new interviews with the entire cast and crew, many of whom (Roy Scheider, Peter Benchley, David Brown, and now, Richard D. Zanuck) are, sadly, deceased. None of us are going to live forever, and these guys have collectively created a classic that IS immortal, that WILL live on, as long as there are sharks in the water!The Shark is Still Working documentary chronicles many, many new facets about the plagued production and the Jaws phenomenon never-before-seen. Especially amusing is JawsFest, a reunion at Martha's Vineyard, where fans got to meet cast members, touch the mechanical shark in its original mold, and see Jaws projected on a giant screen right in front of the water, the docks of ""Amity"", where Jaws was filmed! Hearing die-hard fans recite their favorite lines with the film, Rocky Horror Picture-style, is a real treat! JawsFest is the Star Trek convention for die-hard Jaws fans!Pump it out, Chief, and throw some chum in the water.

Spielberg made a movie that makes any other movie about sharks since look like trash.  I've  seen this film countless times and it's one of the few films that I can  watch over and over again and right when I finish watching it, I want to  watch it again.  If you are an aspiring filmmaker and do NOT like this  movie, please change professions now.  We don't need people like you trying  to make movies when you don't like one of the finest.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2HIBAJEMRFX3W	"Michael Rogers ""Mego73"""	I've been reading, with some amusement, the chagrin about a new DVD release of JAWS, 5 years after the original one.Wow. Considering the way the DVD industry operates, I think this rerelease after 5 long years shows restraint in a world of superduper special editions coming out months after the original releases these days.Beisdes, when the original came out, many fans of the movie were demanding an re-release of it right away because:1. The movie's original soundtrack was supplanted by a 5.1 remix. The remix actually used different sound effects and foley work than the original. For fans of the film who know it like the back of thier hand (you can count this author as one of them)the changes were readily apparent and distracting. I have no problem with 5.1 remixes. Most of them take the original sound effects, music and dialog and give some spaciousness to them. But I want them to remain an option instead of a replacement, especially when the soundtrack is as radically altered as JAWS's track was.2. The documentary carried over from the laserdisc was cut in half to fit it on the same disc as the movie. I had access to the full documentary so it wasn't too much an issue for me.So, when a re-release was announced all I wanted to know is if the DVD had the original soundtrack and I would buy it. If it didn't, there was no reason to buy it.Which is, when you think about it, a good process for all double dipping releases. If the additions float your boat, go for it, if they don't, don't complain about it.So, I got the DVD today for less than $14.00, it includes 60 page booklet in it which is nice. I'm happy because the soundtrack I got to know JAWS with is on the DVD.So, in short, this re-release after 5 years corrects all the issues that fans of the movie had with the first release and has a nice little book to go along with it.I'm not complaining	5.0	Worth the upgrade for true fans	2005-06-15	3	3	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A33HPVEXTKENQZ	Michael Steinbacher	The five stars I'm giving this DVD is for the movie itself, which translates very well to the small screen in this letterboxed edition (at  least if you have a big enough television and a kickass sound system). This  impeccable DVD release brings vivid image and crisp sound and makes the  experience of watching it exciting and thrilling. Have you been watching  this in reruns on TNT for the past 10 years? Do yourself a favor, cut it  out and add this to your library. Its magic is timeless.Having said  that, I was a little disappointed at the deficit of extra features this  &quot;anniversary edition&quot; included. There WAS a little, like some  documentary footage and a lame trivia game (and the requisite trailers) to  sweeten the pot, but in general the whole package is somewht of a letdown.  However, this is THE edition to have for the Jaws or Spielberg fan thus  far, and who knows how long it will be till something better comes  along?Get it.	5.0	Come On Steve, Give Us More!	2000-08-04	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	After his 2nd feature film, young director Steven Spielberg took up the task of filming &quot;Jaws.&quot;  Though he had major headaches with ever-changing weather, an ever-changing shooting schedule and a shark that didn't work, Spielberg did finish it, and used his images and John William's 2-note &quot;warning&quot; that had everyone scared out of their seats in 1975!  After watching this film, it's no wonder it does so well.Our story takes place on the island of Amity, a small community where peace and tranquility reign, that is until the mangled corpse of a young woman is found on the beach.  Investigating the case is Amity's Chief of Police Martin Brody.  An early autopsy seems to indicate a shark attack, which Brody plans to take seriously, until the mayor (Larry Hamilton) tells Brody that he's mistaken.  This is mainly due to the fact that the peak of tourist season is about to arrive on Amity Island, and the townspeople need those dollars to pay through the winter months.  The chief tries to keep it under wraps until a young boy is killed, and then the aid of Oceanographic Institute member Matthew Hooper (Richard Reyfuss) comes to the island to confirm that a shark is indeed in the waters, and has to be killed.  The mayore is still skeptical and nothing can deter him, except when Martin and Matt enlist the aid of a fisherman named  Quint (Robert Shaw), to catch the great white terror.The movie works great because of what we don't see. Throughout the entire movie, the shark only appears for about 5 minutes.  The rest is left to our imagination, the music, and the shark fin in the water.  The character's are also played to perfection.  Roy Scheider plays Martin Brody as a man who is the Cheif of Police, yet afraid of the water, and Larry Hamilton plays the mayor as a man who seriously won't let the possibility of a shark attacking tourists keep the islanders from making a buck during the 4th of July.  Richard Dreyfuss as MAtt Hooper also plays up well with great lines, and one of his best roles to the time (his last being in American Graffiti.All in all, the DVD extras could use some more tweaking, the making of footage isn't all that great, outtakes are less than mediocre, as are a couple of cut sequences that definitely belonged on the cutting-room floor.If you really want to see a summer movie before they turned into $100 million pieces of garbage, see this film.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	Say what you will about Steven Spielberg, but a lesser filmmaker would have been far less gutsy about this film.Can you imagine a film being made today about a killer shark...and having the filmmaker resolutely  refuse to show you the shark until the film was 2/3 done?That's what  makes &quot;Jaws&quot; so effective - we don't know anything about the  shark at all. It's a complete mystery. That makes it a true protagonist in  a dramatic sense...and a great counterpoint to today's action films, in  which silly one-liners and overacting count as great villainy.It shows  great faith in the intelligence of the moviegoer on Spielberg's  part.&quot;Jaws&quot; has other charms as well. The performances are  excellent, especially Robert Shaw's turn as the crusty, slightly crazy and  ultimately very likeable Quint. The scene in which he describes his  experience with the sinking of the USS Indianapolis is absolutely  riveting.The John Williams score is a classic, and it's a tribute to the  craft of the filmmakers that very few of the film's special effects  (including the shark) look the least bit dated today.All in all, this is  a classic, but I don't need to tell you that...you've probably already seen  it a few dozen times yourself.	5.0	Classic action/adventure film...and great filmmaking	2000-06-20	14	10	4

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR	"Mike London ""MAC"""	JAWS stands as one of Hollywood's most important moments, being a certified blockbuster and ushering in the age of big thrills and terrible monsters.  Although monsters had been around a long time in the movies, Spielberg, with this being only his second theatrical release (following the commercial flop THE SUGERLAND EXPRESS, although critically it stands as a very fine moment in Spielberg's career), wisely tempers the monster with a first rate story and an uncanny sense of realism.  As he has only had one directorial film theatrically behind him and one TV movie called DUEL, this stands as even more impressive.Although shooting this film soon progressed into a nightmare, with the budget ending up past the 10,000,000 mark, and the fear that this would be a failure, made Spielberg very conscious of the fact that if this was not handled correctly it would abruptly end his career.  Dreyfuss got lost at sea for several hours, and the ocean did not want to cooperate.  The shark, nicknamed  Bruce, only gave the crew more problems.  After all the footage had been completed, what did Spielberg do?  He wisely cut out all of the scenes where you actually see the shark and instead built suspense around the unseen creature.  This adds greatly to this movie, because had he allowed the audience to see the shark until the very last battle it would have greatly hampered their suspension of disbelief.  When we finally do see the shark, we realise it's a mechanical shark, but by this time it doesn't really matter because Spielberg has succeeded in scaring us out of the water anyway.Indeed, this film had such effect on the swimming habits of the USA that it literally scared droves of people out of the water.  That is a credit to Spielberg.  The story is grisly and realistic in setting and tone, although when you know the true habits of sharks you realise this is very uncharacteristic of them and they would not behave that way in nature.  But to Spielberg's credit, this does not matter.  He meticulously crafts this to be a first rate thriller, and this, along with STAR WARS two years later, would pave the way for what is now called popcorn blockbusters.  Its influence on the movie industry cannot be overestimated, as it essentially invented the phenomena of &quot;blockbusters&quot;, and, according to AllMovies.com, was the first movie to return 100,000,000 dollars to its studio.Just so Spielberg doesn't get all the credit, the cast turns in a great performance as well.  Robert Shaw makes a wonderful Quint, who adds that local colour to the movie, and the interaction between Sheider and Dreyfuss works magic on the screen as one who loves the water and sharks and the other who hates it.  The mayor also stands as a good post-modern character, who, although he can be viewed as a man with dubious character, is acting in the best sense of the town, or so he thinks, garnering both sympathy and dislike as well.  Truly a suspenseful movie and very well-made movie..  It also shows what a talented movie-maker can do when the technology is not there to support his vision of what the movie should be.  And it also proves that technology (read STAR WARS: EPISODE I) proves no substitute for skillful movie making and a first rate story.P. S.  The DVD version adds some nice tidbits, but nothing real substantial.  Of interest is a deleted scene between Roy Scheider and his wife, played by Lorraine Gary.  Other than that, it is nice to watch it in wide-screen format.P. P. S.  I don't know how this happened, but I forgot to mention John Williams, who has scored several of the top grossing films in our culture.  Although most will not know anything other than the classic theme, Williams turns in yet another great score.  Everyone who knows even a little about movies will recognize the main theme.  Kudos, John.	5.0	One of the most historically significant releases from CA!	2001-06-15	2	1	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1WJLWDFXJF66P	Mike Spear	Not just a monster movie, although gory enough, JAWS is a fantastic story and a monument in film-making. Watch it again and pay attention to my favorite parts: 1)you never even see the &quot;monster&quot; until 2/3 of the way through the movie...the suspense builds. 2)the cinematography of Chief Brody's view of the little Kitner boy on the raft as the shark pulls him under (an amazing use of the camera as Roy Scheider's view of the water is changed as people pass through the shot) 3)the score (the apex of John William's music arrives when the shark does) 4)Robert Shaw telling the story of the USS Indianapolis, (one of the most moving and telling moments in film ever) this speech was written and rewritten with the final version written by Shaw himself. So that ,in a nutshell, is what makes JAWS one of the best.	5.0	One of the Best of All Time	2001-02-27	2	1	1

The picture and sound quality is amazing with numerous scenes that were omitted from the original VHS versions.  The added goodies to this disc is almost worth the purchase price on their own.The &quot;Making Of&quot; is very interesting and with interviews from most of the people involved gives it the added touch.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3K8OWCZYJBJ1E	"M. McM ""AOTT-TMF"""	"Five years ago, Universal commemorated the 25th anniversary with an excellent DVD release, loaded with extras. Two versions were actually released (one had a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, the other had a DTS 5.1 mix), but everything else was the same.Now, five years later, they've released the 'definitive' DVD edition for the 30th anniversary...So what's different? Not the video transfer - it's the same as the 25th anniversary DVD.The 30th anniversary DVD DOES have more audio options: it includes BOTH the Dolby Digital AND DTS 5.1 mixes. Even better, it includes the original mono soundtrack, which has never been issued on DVD before. It also has 5.1 mixes in Spanish and French, and it has new subtitle options, also for Spanish and French.As for the rest, there are more bonuses. The 25th anniversary edition was a single DVD - this 30th anniversary edition is two DVD's, and the extra disc can now accomodate the full-length ""Making of JAWS"" documentary that originally ran for two hours when it was first released on the LaserDisc edition of JAWS (which is long out-of-print). A truncated, one-hour version was used for the 25th anniversary edition. It's an excellent documentary, worth seeing in its entirety, but if you're already well-versed in the making of JAWS, you may be underwhelmed. Furthermore, you can probably rent the bonus disc on this 30th anniversary DVD through Blockbuster of Netflix, so if you're only going to see it once, that's the way to go.Also new is a 9-minute featurette ""From the Set,"" included on the first disc. Produced in 1974, you get a few words from the cast, crew, and Spielberg as they film JAWS, but it's not very interesting. There's also a nice 60-page commemorative booklet (the 25th anniversary edition had a very skimpy booklet), an added movie poster gallery on the bonus disc, and a new bonus feature called ""The JAWS Phenomenon"" that looks at how JAWS was marketed around the world. They also add one extra deleted scene (very minor, it features Quint, shortly before they set sail in search of the shark), which is placed on the first disc with the other deleted scenes.Some of the minor bonuses from the 25th anniversary edition have been ditched for this new edition, including a trivia game, a ""Shark World"" educational piece, a screensaver, etc., but otherwise everything else on the 25th anniversary edition was carried over to this new edition.So, who should buy this new, 30th anniversary edition? Purists who absolutely prefer the original mono mix, viewers who are much more comfortable with Spanish or French, viewers who want JAWS on DVD but do not own it yet, and die-hard fans that already own countless editions of JAWS for the sake of collecting.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2PMO6E76SR72O	M. Morgan	Most people have seen Jaws and know the story, so what I'm reviewing is the 'quality' of the Blu-ray edition.  I was really happy to see such a fantastic job of the production team to clean up the picture for HD.  The visuals are stunning - much better then on the standard DVD.  I was also really impressed with the quality of the 7.1 sound.  Every small sound was heard and crystal clear.The only criticism is that I'm tired of purchasing Blu-ray movies and being forced to buy the DVD version in the same package.  I already have 2 copies of Jaws, so another doesn't make sense.  I would assume that most people purchasing Blu-ray versions of classic movies probably have the movie on DVD.  I wish we had the choice to purchase just the Blu-ray copy.	5.0	Better then ever	2012-09-06	3	2	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1E15WYG9C47X1	"""mobby_uk"""	White Death, Great White Terror and Man-Eater are all names that have entered public vocabulary to describe the Great White Shark, one of the most efficient predators of the oceans.Yet, surprisingly, only very few people have actually encountered one, and fewer still had had the misfortune of been attacked by one, yet why is it that the name alone is enough to strike terror in our hearts and inspire awe and fascination?The answer is simple,Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg.The collaboration of a best selling author and a director at his creative best resulted in one of the all time classics of cinema, an original film that has spawned dozens of imitations, and one responsible for keeping a lot of viewers out of the waters for a while, afraid of Jaws.The success of Jaws is due to many factors, all as important:The direction of Steven Spielberg is flawless, pushing the right buttons at every turn, starting with one of the best ever opening scenes in cinema history, then keeping the suspense brewing till amazingly appx. the 81st minute before the shark shows its toothy grin! The fact that this 'monster' was unseen for the largest part of the movie was a genuis decision from Spielberg and contributed to tickling our imagination, and increasing the tension.The acting was another factor to Jaws's success,Spielberg could not have chosen to cast better actors for his film:Roy Scheider,the reluctant hero Chief Brody,Lorraine Gary,the supportive and concerned wife that adds a needed comforting and homely feeling to the film,Richard Dreyfuss, the scientist that mixes a sense of  scientific and logical direction with a much appreciated humour,and of course, the great Robert Shaw,( interestingly not Spielberg first choice, as he wanted Lee Marvin or Burgess Meredith).It is by sheer good luck that Marvin and Meredith declined to take this role for varying reasons, for in my opinion no one could have played the experienced, weary and tough fisherman Quint better than Robert Shaw. You just have to listen to his speech about the 1945 Indianapolis shark attacks to know what I am talking about,it is one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed.The success of Jaws is also due to the soundtrack.Surely the musical themes of films like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Godfather and Dr Zhivago are instantly recognizable classics the world over, but John Williams score is in a league of its own.It is an integral part of the movie, as if a character in its own right. The opening strings are not only an accompanying or background tune, but the shark itself!! It gives life to the animal/character like no other music managed to do before or after.Another element of success lies in the fact that Benchely's book touched a very interesting and sensitive nerve: Monsters that prey on humans.This has always fascinated and scared people since the dawn of history, and many books and tales have imagined countless such monsters in the oceans,mountains or jungles.The fact that people are vulnerable to another predator in an environment they do not or can not tame, have always  been a source of fascination and fear.Of course, the Great White has had a very bad PR because of Jaws, (in reality the Bull and Tiger sharks are far more responsible for attacks on humans than the Great White) something author Benchley has tried to correct years later.But while science has increasingly blown away most of the myths that surrounded this animal for too long, still that name alone and that music will forever give us a cold chill down our spine,look at the ocean with slight aversion, for somewhere down there surely lurks Jaws.And this is exclusively  due to the success of the film and the creative genuis behind it,Steven Spielberg.	5.0	The Oceans Will Never Be The Same..	2003-10-19	0	0	0

When I was younger I was afraid of being in water just because I'd thought a shark would attack me. But since I've grewn older,  I've realised it's just a comedy horror, if you will. A kind of horror that  gets you jumping up in your seat. And Steven Spielberg is the expert, he  truly knows how the scare the hell out of people. He enjoys, we enjoy it,  it's truly entertainment. Some people have complained how the shark in the  movie looks. Of course, there's no chance they could train a live shark.  Because the shark has no brain muscles. And I love how they build a fake  shark, it really looks like a real one.Anyway, I got some good news for  all DVD fans. Universal Studios is releasing a Jaws SE on DVD for the first  time. I'm very excited and I can't wait to see it on DVD.	5.0	A classic soon out on DVD!	2000-04-26	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"It has been often said that what Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" did for women taking showers, Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" did for ocean swimming.  Spielberg was recruited, for this his 3rd film, by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown after purchasing the rights to Peter Benchley's first novel and runaway hit of the same name.  To this day, Spielberg says it was the hardest movie he ever made.  Shot on location around Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts this is reportedly the first film primarily shot at sea.  With typical location issues already in the mix, Spielberg had an uncooperative mechanical shark to deal with.Arguably the first film that could be called a summer blockbuster opens with the now famous 2 note cello that still haunts the film today, but instead of a mono track we get a pristine 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  More on that later.  This restored blu ray version is a remarkable achievement to say the least.  It can be first appreciated in the opening sequence when a gaggle of college kids are gathered around a campfire on the beach.  One comely lass (Susan Backlinie) coaxes a drunk boy to go with her skinny-dipping.  He complies of course as they run down the beach.  He stumbles, she rips off her clothes and dives in.  When I first saw this film in the theater and in numerous subsequent versions, that scene, which includes the now famous shot from below the surface looking up toward the young woman, seems to imply she is dipping skinny.  This new Blu ray would seem to confirm it.  The transfer is that good.For those not familiar with the plot, Ms. Backlinie's character is but the first victim of a huge Great White shark, trolling the shoreline for a meal.  The police chief, Brody (Roy Scheider), a recruited shark specialist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled experienced fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) go looking for the big fish in a boat not quite big enough.  Between the ominous John Williams score that opens the film to the exciting conclusion, Spielberg grabs the audience and never lets us go.  It is a perfect thriller.As far as the blu ray transfer, it comes with a resolution of 1080p and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is quite amazing.  With input from Spielberg himself, the film has been restored to better than new as previously noted.  The colors, in particular are just spectacular.  Even the nighttime scenes carry more frightening weight.  Excellent blacks, startling blues and their various shadings.  As noted earlier the audio track is superb.  With the 7.1 mix of an original mono audio there might be issues, but the dispersion of the surrounds is conservative and not distracting.  The beach scenes should be enveloping and they are.  Williams score couldn't be more appropriately reproduced.  If you want the original mono track, it is also available.  Subtitles are in French, Spanish and English SDH.The special features include two length documentaries.  The first called ""The Shark is Still Working: The Impact and Legacy of Jaws"" runs 101 minutes and comes from a 2007 doc about the film and technical difficulties.  Another is ""The Making of Jaws"" and runs 123 minutes which has also been released earlier.  There is about 13 minutes of deleted scenes and outtakes, some archival info, a trailer and more.

When home video came out, this was the first videotape I bought. It just wasn't the same movie until Laserdisc introduced us to Speilberg's widescreen version. Now that's the movie I remember! DVDs would come along over the years and now blu ray. This blu ray is like seeing the movie through new eyes. I have NEVER seen this film look so beautiful. The colors are finally what they need to be and not dull like the past releases. My jaw (no pun) dropped when you can finally see the detail of the night opening shot. All the versions in the past were way too dark where you could barely see a thing. That was just the opening! Rest of this masterpiece looks just as brilliant. This is the version we fans have been waiting for! I am so glad Universal waited until their 100th Anniversary to properly restore this classic and not just upgrade an old faded print from years past. I fell in love with this brilliant movie all over again! Even if you have an old copy of Jaws on DVD, do yourself (and your eyes and ears) the favor by upgrading. If not the blu ray, get the newest 100th Anniversary DVD. Better yet, if you don't have blu ray yet let this title be the one that gets you on the hi def bandwagon.If Speilberg were to do a commentary, I wished it would be this breakout film for him. But really, this great film doesn't need much explaining. We have these great documentaries on this blu ray for that.I had to break down and get the one with the book on it.

The fully restored 1975 version? not so much. it means picture and sound only, but if you are a die hard film buff you will know this is an edited version used for the first transfer on DVD. It cuts a part of quint's death scene and the line Smile you son of bitch was reduce to  Smile you son of a, before the Shark explodes. This for me changes the emotional impact of the film's ending. I would have gave it 5 star if it was the original 1975 version.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2XRZV63X79YSJ	"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector"""	Jaws was the film that change the movie industry.  Summer was always thought of as a waste land for the movie industry.  No films of substance were released during the summer because no one went to the films during the summer because they were on vacation.  That is until Jaws came through and broke Sound of Music boxoffice record.That is the importance of Jaws, not that it is a great film. Everyone knows the story.  Big shark terrorizes little beach resort but the big wigs don't want to cancel the big holiday event.Spielberg is a technical director.  He is best at scenes that do not involve words and emotion.  He is best at minipulating the audience through camera angles, editing and music.  But when it comes to the acting, these scenes are only as good as the actors in it.  And in this we have the great Robert Shaw who steals the movie as the rustic shark hunter.  The rest of the actors flounder in the mediocrity of the script.You might ask why am I writing this review, it was on my recomended by Amazon list and I am just warning people like me that it would be better to invest in Alfred Hitchcock films than this.With that said, this is a film to watch when you want something mindless.  This is not a film classic but a fun classic.	3.0	The Hidden Menace	2006-03-25	5	2	3

Although the popularity of some horror/creature movies may fall by the wayside, the 1975 film has stood the test of time.  This Steven Spielberg movie successfully combines the fear of the unknown with a plot that stays within the borders of realism.  The result is one of cinema's enduring movies that is effective today as it was when it was first released.It's the height of tourist season on Amity Island when a body washes up on the shore.  When Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) investigates and determines the woman was killed by a shark attack, his results are overruled by Amity Island's governing body.  Another attack quickly ensues, this time leaving a young boy dead.Amity Island has two choices:  close the beaches which would result in the town going bankrupt or offer a bounty on the shark's head.  Soon Amity Island is swamped with overzealous shark hunters trying to cash in on the award.In the meantime, Brody has called in shark enthusiast and scientist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), who confirms that not only is the culprit a shark but also an enormous Great White.  His findings, however, fall on deaf ears as the citizens of Amity Island prepare for their biggest celebration of the year.  This time the result is a shark attack during the festivities.Now it is up to Brody, Hooper and a crusty seaman, Quint (Richard Shaw), to track down the man-eating shark and destroy it.  While traveling on Quint's old boat, The Orca, the trio soon find their lives in peril.  Will they be able to destroy the shark that hunts them?""Jaws"" proves that not seeing a creature in every scene makes a movie scarier.  Although we assume the shark is near when we hear the music or see a fin darting through the water, we never actually see the entire shark until the end of the movie; proving that sometimes less is more.The movie, although a little slow in a couple parts, moves along quickly.  Each of the actors plays a convincing role to keep everyone watching intrigued.  This is particularly true of the scene with Brody, Hooper and Quint reminiscing on the Orca right before the shark attacks.""Jaws"" does stray a bit from the book by Peter Benchley, preferring to focus only on the story of the shark that brings terror to Amity Island.  Other than that minor point, the only thing that the film could have included would have been more interaction between Brody and his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary).  Her character became more defined in later films.Despite the overwhelming production mishaps, ""Jaws"" is an exceptional movie.  A beachgoer will never look at the ocean quite the same."	5.0	Stands the test of time	2005-06-23	3	1	2

It's drinks all round to Universal Studios on their passion and commitment to restore Jaws to a visual and audio level never to have been witnessed before.  Yes, this is the ultimate release of this movie, a new beginning so to speak, to a movie which has never lost it's appeal.  This Blu ray looks better than what Jaws looked when it first projected in 1975, it's a hand sweating HD Blu ray experience, as stated by Steven Spielberg himself on the restoration process.  UK buyers can indeed pick this one up from the US, the Blu ray disc is Region free.  The DVD disc is Region 1, NTSC, which is only to be expected since this is a US release, but I would imagine that won't really be much of an issue for most people in the UK because the Blu ray disc is the main reason for purchase.Tremendous care with shipping and handling here, and it usually arrives well before the expected date given on the web page.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ	Mr. A. Pomeroy	A simple, well-executed horror / action movie that combines winning performances, some memorable quotes ('We're going to need a bigger boat' is  on a par with the 'You've gotta be kidding me' from 'The Thing'), and a  great score, 'Jaws' touched a nerve in the 70's and started off a wave of  cheaply-produced 'nature-vs-man' films, none of which (especially not the  sequels, although '2' had its moments) even remotely approached the level  of craftsmanship and belief exhibited by this film. Characterisation and  acting are excellent - the heroes are far from being superhuman, and even  the soon-to-be-obligatory Mayor character is not evil, merely  short-sighted. Enormously popular - one of a handful of films to gross more  than 100 million dollars in the 1970's, along with 'The Godfather', 'The  Exorcist' and 'Star Wars' - and responsible for all kinds of great things,  'Jaws' is foremost great, crowd-pleasing entertainment, the kind of film  that you can watch any time and it's still fun. Cineastes have read a  wealth of depth into the film, but at heart it's a very simple tale of  great white hunters going off to tame the wilderness, and finding that the  wilderness is not so easily tamed.	4.0	Munchacious	2000-08-09	1	0	1

We were first in a very long line,the film would not disappoint anyone there that night! We were so impressed we went back the next night, with a few more friends in tow. We just wanted to see our unsuspecting friends and the audience lose there precious popcorn every time Bruce the shark would briefly appear. The famous head scene is the biggest jolt and it scared the you know what out of everyone in the theater! Living in Wildwood N.J. one block from the ocean, made the film all the more real and it kept most of us from enjoying the ocean for quite some time. To this day, over 30 years later! I do not feel completely at ease when I'm in the ocean and my feet leave the ocean floor! That is some impact for a film to have over a man who has watched so many really scary movies.I own both the 25th and the 30th anniversary editions and I watch one of them almost on a yearly basis. I have a 10 foot screen in my home theater and it is almost like opening night every time I watch it! One of the best films ever made and probably the scariest. The 30th anniversay edition is the better edition with original mono soundtrack and complete documentary, but beware!... the 30th ann. edition does not include the theatrical trailer! This is inexcusable! Even so, the extra length of the documentary and the original and DTS soundtrack make this a worthy upgrade. If you don't own the 25th ann. then the 30th ann.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2INWZTJZZ3S0V	Mr. Paul Morris	What can I say? Could this be Steven Spielberg's greatest masterpiece? I think so. It's a classic! A true horror story that unearths your deepest fears. Carl Gottleib and original novelist Peter Benchley certainy did a  most congratulatory job on the screenplay, and John Williams' music  score-well- that's just a classic into itself. Who else but Roy Scheider  could have done a more memerable role as Amity's Police Chief Martin Brody?  He fat into the part perfectly, playing it with such wit and humour,  especially in the scene of the &quot;tiger shark stomach contents (two  fish, a tin can and a licence plate)&quot;. The young ichthyologist Matt  Hooper, played by the renowned Richard Dreyfuss, developed a real  friendship with Brody which was one of the film's real strongholds. Robert  Shaw, as the colourful shark fisherman Quint,provided us with more dry  humour and played his role knowing he had the upmost respect from the  audience. Together, these three men couldn't of made a better team.  Straight from the very first attack-poor old Chrissie Watkins-right through  Alex Kintner, Ben Gardener and finally (and unfortunately) Quint himself,  the thrills never stop. Just when you think the 25-footer Great White has  finally left the dying Amity, up he pops to devourer another hapless  swimmer. The audience is left screaming in their seats. When Ben Gardener's  body falls from his wrecked boat in front of Hooper, when Brody catches his  first glimpse of the menacing beast, when the shark attacks Hooper  underwater in the shark cage, when the pier drops out beneath the two fools  with the holiday roast-all of these moments will haunt you forever. Pick up  Jaws just before midnight, stick it in the VCR, and by morning you'll never  want to go in the water again.  The supporting cast are excellently  portrayed, from Brody's wife Ellen, played by Lorraine Gary, right through  to Deputy Hendricks, Harry Meadows of the Amity Gazette, played by  screenplayer Carl Gottleib, Polly, Brody's grosteque secretary and of  course, the shifty medical inspector.  And who could forget that idiot  Mayor Vaughn, who jeopordises the tourist's lives by leaving the beaches  open to save the island's economy. It's a wonder that the islanders kept  Vaughn on as the mayor.  The finale aboard Quint's forty-foot cruiser  &quot;Orca&quot;, is probably the most exciting part of the film. The  barrel chase, the Indianapollis story, the cage attack, and the boat's  destruction are portrayed toghether marvellously to produce one of the most  outstanding films of all time. To Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider and the  rest of the cast and crew, congratulations on making the most remarkable  thriller ever. To anyone thinking of seeing Jaws, trust me, it's worth it,  but I warn you; be prepared to scream!!!	5.0	Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water!	1999-10-22	1	1	0

Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) loved those fascinating, majestic fish - sharks. I started reading, learning and collecting everything I could find on sharks. I learned their Latin names, even though, obviously, I didn't speak Latin yet! I filled many copybooks with my notes, my drawings (and I *could* draw :), sketches and cutouts - everythingI still have mixed feelings about this movie. When I first saw it - on TV, in about 1985 - I was 9 years old. Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) love those fascinating, majestic fish.

I filled many copybooks with my notes, my drawings (and I *could* draw :), sketches and cutouts - everything I could find on sharks (And the task wasn't so easy for a 9 year old - these were 1980s and it was not USA with its superb libraries available!) I was fascinated by sharks - to this day they remain among my favorite animals and remember everything about them, even though I'm as far from biology and zoology as can be! And then I learned that most people's reaction to &quot;Jaws&quot; was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of &quot;Jaws&quot; was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of &quot;Jaws&quot;!To sum it up - I think I would give the movie 5 stars for its value entertainment and 0 stars for what it did to sharks. My final verdict - four stars. *Only* for its entertainment value. As for the advice, I would tell you to read a few good books on sharks and watch a few good documentaries before seeing &quot;Jaws&quot;, especially if your opinion on sharks is not favorable.	4.0	After all these years, I still have mixed feelings about it.	2000-09-22	4	1	3

I love this movie and appreciate the effort that Stephen Spielberg puts into his films.  This movie plus E.T. gave Mr. Spielberg a major jump in his career of directing.  If you want to own a classic movie that is guaranteed to entertain, thrill, and keep you in suspense, then Jaws is one to own and put into your movie collection, plus with blu-ray it enhances the movie.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A13NZZR8IA5782	Musicfan	Well, I bought the DVD dts and I think you'll like the extras such as the outtakes, deleted scenes, and especially an excellent documentary.  You'll get the behind the scenes from Spielberg, the actors, photographers, and  the producers.  In today's film world this movie could be made rather  easily, but back then you'll see the tremendous undertaking that went into  this production.  The movie itself, of course, is just amazing.  At one  point Spielberg says that the shark is the star, but the scenes on the boat  will show you 3 stars at the top of their game.  The sound quality is  outstanding and exact, but I do have one complaint.... on the 5.1 DTS their  isn't much activity from the back 2 speakers. The sound coming from the  front 3 is great, but they could have done more.  This movie is just as  suspenseful as when I saw it in the mid-seventies.  I hadn't really watched  it in awhile and I had forgotten the outstanding acting performances by  Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw.  Shaw's USS Indianapolis speech is about as  good as it gets, while Scheider's everyman performance really rings true.  You'll enjoy this DVD and it's at a good price.  A good bargain.

It is at this point in the film that we really, for the first time, see the shark, who is actually the star of the film. Roy Sheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw offer outstanding performances in this Steven Spielberg classic that has stood the test of time for over twenty-five years.The DVD is loaded with features that make this worth buying such as a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, a photo gallery, outtakes, trailers and more.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ	Nicholas Stix	"Simplicity. That's what makes this Steven Spielberg's best movie. Just four years earlier, he had made his mark with the TV movie, Duel, which consists of automobile driver Dennis Weaver being terrorized by the unseen driver of a diesel truck.For over half of Jaws, the viewer similarly does not see ""Bruce, the shark.""  But he gets to see increasing evidence of the works of Bruce's ... jaws.""It's a short season."" That's what my old man, a retired contractor, always says of summer in the tourist trap Martha's Vineyard, where he has lived for forty years (and where I used to spend my summers). Jaws was filmed on the Vineyard (specifically, the cheesier, nouveau riche, Edgartown end), which is called ""Amity"" in the movie. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script, adapting Benchley's novel, perfectly uses the attitude my father expressed: When a series of early season swimmers disappear, the town worthies (led by its mayor, played by Murray Hamilton) fear a business disaster. For business' sake, rather than the public safety, a price is put on the shark's head. Sounds like the Vineyard to me.Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw play the odd trio that seeks to kill the shark: the local police chief, a university shark expert, and a veteran fisherman. What juices the story, is that the shark has something else in mind. (If this sounds familiar, it's only because Jaws has since been ripped off so many times.)John Williams' visceral, Oscar-winning score is the sound of the hunt, the sound of fear. Bill Butler's cinematography is so unobtrusive, as is Verna Fields and Spielberg's editing, that you're unaware of them -- at least for the first few viewings. You lose yourself in the story. (Fields won an Oscar for her work; Spielberg did not credit himself, and thus went unrewarded.)The acting, particularly by Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss, is similarly naturalistic. The most understated performance is by Roy Scheider, who is perfect as Police Chief Martin Brody, an uprooted New Yorker whose facade of restraint belies a nervous nature. But it is the late Robert Shaw who steals the show as Mr. Quint, an Ahab-like fisherman whose obsession with sharks goes back to his experience as a seaman on -- and ""off"" --  the USS Indianapolis at the end of The War. Shaw's soliloquy -- which he co-wrote with screenwriter John Milius (Patton) and playwright Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope) -- on the fate of the Indianapolis' crew is spellbinding. (In addition to being one of the most powerful character actors of his day, Robert Shaw was a novelist, screenwriter, and the author of the acclaimed play, The Man in the Glass Booth.)As good as some of Spielberg's recent work -- most notably Saving Private Ryan -- has been, none is as good as Jaws, because he now strives for ""importance,"" ""significance,"" and ""symbolism,"" and for satisfying various constituencies (think Schindler's List), rather than for telling a great yarn. Let us hope that he can someday recapture his early simplicity, and wed it to the technical savvy he's since learned."	5.0	The Sea, a Shark, Death	2003-05-01	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ATI88FQCKANGI	Nicolas Lavigne	In 1974, Steven Spielberg was basically an unknown director who had just directed his first motion picture, THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS. The movie came out on April 5th, 1974 and received glorious reviews but failed at the box-office, earning $7 million domestically. The producers of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS were disappointed at the box-office, but they knew that Steven Spielberg was a director to watch. Meanwhile, a script of the novel JAWS by Peter Benchley was being written and the producers of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS got an advance copy. Steven Spielberg, while visiting the producers at their offices, noticed the script of JAWS on their desk. Thinking that the script was about dental work, Spielberg was not interested, but brought the script with him. After reading the script, Steven Spielberg flipped out for it and called the producers to inform them that he was interested in directing the movie. The problem was that there was already another director attached to the project. So, Steven said that if the director would drop out, he would direct it. After the release of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, Steven got the call from the producers saying that he was hired to direct JAWS. The three male lead roles were handed out to Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Principal photography on JAWS began on May 2nd, 1974 at Martha's Vineyard. The cast and crew had many difficulties during the shooting, especially the budget, which was of $9 million at the beginning, but by the end of the shooting, it was of $12 million. Universal Pictures almost cut the production many times, but the shooting was fininshed by the end of the summer of 1974. The movie had it's first screening in March of 1975 and it was getting some big buzz. Many of the cast thought that the movie would fail commercially, but they were proven wrong when JAWS opened in June of 1975 and quickly becoming the highest-grossing movie of all-time by making $261,2 million domestically. JAWS was also the first movie to pass the $100 million mark. After JAWS was released, Steven Spielberg became the most popular director in Hollywood and started production on his next picture, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. In March of 1976, JAWS was nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture. Though it did not win the Best Picture Award, it won three awards. Through the years, JAWS has stayed has one of the biggest success in movie history and proved itself to be an american movie classic. In 2000, JAWS was released on DVD with loads of extra features and became one of the most popular DVD's of all-time.	5.0	Steven Spielberg's first big hit scores high!	2003-12-20	1	1	0

It just gets inside your soul and you can't help but think about it anytime you get around the ocean or Gulf. It is one of the three best creature movies I have seen in my life.The thing that really makes this movie is the psychological terror when it becomes apparent that the shark is actually hunting the men instead of the other way around. It offers everything that a great horror movie should have: the psychological tension, the building suspense, the sudden appearance that makes you jump and scream, and enough gore to make you cringe.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ACMOLKXVKQ06Z	N. Schoenfeld	Amazing.  This is considered to be the very first blockbuster ever made.  It is also considered to be one of the best.  After all this time, this movie still has the power to scare many people, and it works like a  charm.Through Speilberg's genuis, as we watch this movie, the tension  builds up all the way to the heart pounding climax.  It was also very smart  not to show the shark until the 2nd half of the film because what scares us  most, is what we DON'T see.This is a rare film that combines tense  action moments, with the art of good filmmaking.  It was also infuential,  it made people scared to go in the water for years after it was released.  25 years later, it's about to do that all over again.  Both the normal and  DTS DVDs are wonderfully packed with features.  Most Highly Reccomended.  This is a movie you need in your collection.	5.0	25 years later:  Still Great.	2000-07-18	2	0	2
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AI9AFNGL34D9O	Nysocboy	Even after 25 years, after an endless succession of sequels, parodies, and intertextual references, it is easy to see why this became the highest grossing movie in history, and it remains the best horror movie ever made.  And it's not because of the shark -- though the shark is big and scary, providing much more heart-pounding suspense than some guy in a hockey mask slicing up campers.It's because of the trio of precisely realized heroes drawn from Moby Dick -- Martin Brody, the by-the-book Ishmael with a troubled past, who hates water but lives on an island; Matt Hooper, the effervescent shark-chasing Queequeg, who offers Brody a chance for salvation; and Quint the sea-chanty singing Captain Ahab. Their bonding is intense and exhilerating, and at the end of the movie one feels that Brody has finally been redeemed, and Hooper has finally found a home. There are dozens of wonderfully-drawn minor characters, like the stammering mayor or the dumpy housewife whose son is eaten by the shark, and Amityville is a character in its own right, beautifully photographed and absolutely real -- its nice to see a beach for once populated by actual people, not gym-toned eye candy.The movie ages well, with only a bit of slang and some ludicrous leisure suits to place it in the 1970's.  The DVD could use more extras: there are hundreds of rather dull production photos, a few shark facts, and a short documentary, but the best horror movie ever made needs a full scene-by-scene commentary.	5.0	The best horror movie ever made	2003-09-07	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AD0J5KK4WQXNS	OverTheMoon	Unfortunately Jaws has not aged that well, thanks to a prop that looks like a great big hunk of painted gum with teeth. Even Speilberg has pretty much said in interviews that the shark pained him and working on the beast was a nightmare. He is rumoured to even have consulted with ILM on a CGI make-over for a new edition of the movie. Thank God that the shark does not actually appear in close-up until the end of the film and when it is on the screen it is only there for a few moments and the actors manage to perform circles around it so that we are never fully concerned about the quality of the giant swimming condom. If it wasn't for them, this would be B-Movie hokum for sure and the Berg would probably just be any other director looking to making it big.No, even the film transcends its central eight ton human killing prophylactic to bring us a story that is just so much more about the people and their social issues than the monster on the loose. Let's face it - Brody is a depressing lazy ass cop who is pretty inept in every department except for that Last Shot. Quinn IS certifiable and Hooper is a ladies man with an inferiority complex. When you put them together in a boat for days out at sea then there is going to be plenty of half-witted power playing to keep us all tuned in... but let's back up a bit.Even before they get together for that second part of the film, back on shore the town of Amity has its own problems. Girls get beaming drunk and go swimming as if it is a good thang to do! Their lovers take twenty minutes to get undressed and usually just collapse into a sleep in the process. Hell, I want to go to Amity! The local doctor squirms at the sight of blood. The town mayor is a defunct corrupt fifties swinger who is mostly surrounded by ambulance chasers. Brody's deputy is far from bright and the local gang of fishermen have just appeared out of the movie Deliverance with boxes on TNT - sixty men to a five foot boat too! Amity is Sharkville for good reason. Then we have a marine biologist who knows more about pathology than the Doc and who thinks it is a great idea to take a dip in the water at night with a big shark swimming around. Brody's kids even sit in boats two inches away from the water during the height of the attacks. Man have they got it commin'! The inbred population of Amity have an IQ of a dead slug on fire. When you couple the dummies stupidity with a monster on the loose you got yourself heaps of suspense! How could anything not go wrong!Yes the Berg pretty much got it right on all counts. Jaws is essentially akin to throwing a cat into a room full of rats and watching the mayhem that will ensue. Here the Berg gives the rats' great dialogue to play with and shoots the whole sequence of events from quite savoury angles.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1K45NFZYYVOYB	P. Ammon	"In ""Jaws"" you are placed in a sleepy little seaside town on Amity Island off the coast of Massachusetts some time in the early 70s. A group of teenagers is partying on the beach and one of the girls goes off for a swim. The guy who just tried to pick her up is too drunk to follow her into the water and collapses on the beach. Now the camera shifts to an underwater perspective, there is something menacing there, it's closing in on the girl...Jaws is basically divided into two parts, the first half shows life on Amity and focuses on the struggle between the new chief of police Martin Brody and the townspeople lead by Mayor Vaughn. Brody is a city person from New York, who was looking for a quiet life in Amity and now has to confront his own fears of the ocean, while his sense of responsibility leaves him with no alternative but to call for a hunting expedition for the Great White Shark that will include him. As Brody tries to convince people around him that there is a killer shark out there that has to be hunted down and the mayor stalls, afraid to lose more summer business, the number of victims continues to rise, finally forcing the mayor to act.In the second half of the movie Brody, the 1960s student movement type ocean researcher Matt Hooper and veteran fisherman Quint, the prototype of the anti-hero, set out to catch and kill the beast. Soon they are confronted with something far bigger than they expected or Quint's rickety boat was designed for and the hunters become the hunted, locked in a life and death struggle with a 20 foot shark, all communications to Amity cut off.Jaws is one of those movies you can watch again and again. The reasons for this are a compelling storyline, convincing acting and an excellent job at editing the movie down to only include scenes that are absolutely essential to developing the plot, this movie is literally not a minute too long, no section is superfluous.In contrast to present-day movies you don't have spectacular and unrealistic CGI generated action sequences, both the human actors and the shark are believable. For the first half of the film you don't even get to see the shark directly, you just feel its menacing presence, much the same way a swimmer at the ocean may.Personally I also enjoy being transplanted back to the US as it was 30 years ago, when in a town like Amity you could still leave your house door and car unlocked."	5.0	Spielberg's Best	2006-05-01	3	3	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1D663YD036KNH	paperbackriter	Anyone old enough to remember the Summer of '75 will recall the sheer terror caused by the 20-foot mechanical shark in Steven Spielberg's classic horror film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Not only did this flesh-ripping Great White take a huge chunk out of the worldwide box office, it also put a dent in the profits of beach towns on both coasts. No one wanted to go anywhere near the ocean! Heck, you couldn't even jump into a kiddie pool without some prankster breaking into a couple bars of the classic &quot;Jaws&quot; theme. (Da-Dum-Da-Dum-Da-Dum...) The media, in fact the whole world, was caught up in a stupifying feeding frenzy of Shark-Mania. You see, &quot;Jaws&quot; wasn't merely a movie; it was an EVENT! It was the original Summer Blockbuster. But, unlike the majority of mega-movies it spawned, &quot;Jaws&quot; was worth every penny of the $3.50 we movie-goers forked over in 1975. In a stroke of genius, Spielberg kept us squirming by not allowing us to see the toothy, blood-lusting shark for the first hour of the film. We only witnessed the bone-crunching damage that this monster had inflicted. When the Great White finally surfaced, a collective gasp could be heard throughout the theatre. Nevertheless, we had faith in Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider -- the heroic hunters who set off to sea in a small fishing vessel named, ironically, &quot;Orca&quot;. But, alas, we knew that indeed they'd need &quot;a bigger boat&quot;. The inevitable showdown between man and maneater was more horrifying than anything we'd ever seen on the big screen. But, ultimately, in the end, we let out a whopping round of applause and got right back in line to see it again. (Well, some of us unemployed youth actually hid in the bathroom between shows!) Everything about &quot;Jaws&quot; worked. The suspense, the music, the chemistry of the stellar cast and, of course, the big rubber shark kept us coming back for more. Finally, after years of suffering through heavily edited pan and scan versions on Cable TV, we are treated to a beautiful widescreen version of &quot;Jaws&quot;. This DVD is truly worth it. The print itself is crisp and clean. The entire soundtrack, most notably John Williams' chilling score, is greatly enhanced by the DTS. For my money, the &quot;Making of Jaws&quot; documentary included within is worth the price of admission alone. Overall, a job well done and quite befitting of this all-time classic. Highly recommended.	5.0	Take a Bite Out of this DVD!	2001-09-02	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AJUEE2C2EJ0V3	Paperbackstash	The most frightening water flick EVER splashed on screen, Stephen Spielberg's Jaws will remain one of the best horror tales of all time. I'm telling you, the man should stick with more horror after the success of this and Poltergeist. The tension and buildup is all there, the terror, the shocking violence. We begin with a detailed, drawn out death and end with a gigantic explosion. What could be better?Roy Sheider as Chief Brody rocks the screen. He is the main character, not the shark. A man with a wife (Lorriane Grey) and two kids, the chief of police of an island with a fear of water, he has a pretty well established set of morals and is the first the comprehend the large disaster that could be laying in wake. But small beach towns need money and he encounters resistance in closing the place down, mainly in the form of Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). Time to bring in the shark expert, marine biologist Matt (Richard Dreyfus). After the death of a little boy and the autopsy of what's left of Chrissie, a teenaged girl, the two together show us scenes that will forever remain in memory. The final throw in is Quint, a shark hunter by profession.Spielberg shows us why he became such a blockbuster director with shark POV shots, cleverly not giving the shark much screen time to enhance when it is shown, and a long character driven story. Instead of focusing on just a killing machine he focuses more on what people go through in dealing with the predator. Tension is tight and riveting, attack scenes drawn out just right but not weighed down by too much melodrama, and the score complements the scenes perfectly. Effects wise Jaws doesn't look like a giant ball of rubber, and they were wise to keep his appearance to a minimum for this reason. So much better than CGI handicaps, a shame the prop was destroyed by deteriorating by Universal's lack of care.The first half is on land; this is the best part of the flick. Seeing the attacks, the reactions, all great. But when on the boat the movie remains well-done. Quint's (Robert Shaw)long speech about his past experience with the white bellied, black eyed beings was classic. I especially enjoyed the touch of the killer whale in the background; it weaved together for a truly haunting effect.Some genuinely tense, scary as hell scenes, a score that should go down in the books as one of the greatest, perfect chemistry among cast and injections of action and troubling imagery when it's needed the most. Sum it all up and it's easy to see why it added up to such a dynamic hit.	5.0	Du-Du-Dum!	2013-09-20	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3W28FJBC5VBAM	Patrick	IN the mid 70's, every man woman and child who lived next to a beach and went in it every day suddenly thought about what lurked in the misty waters.  Jaws is such a horrifinly real movie that there is no argue to why it was such a big success and still is. It takes a good movie to clear the coeans for pretty much close to a year and even beyond.In a small mcommunity town bodies are being discovered on the beach pointing to shark attacks. Nothing is said because the 4th of July weekend is coming and buisness with surly die if talk or a giant shark is rumored, so its kept under wraps by the mayor and sheriff. Still bodies continue to pile up and a reward is offered for who ever can bring in the shark. So this takes 3 mean on a trip into the sea to come face to face with the shark that has haunted the town. Now its man against nature in this all out fun ride.Very good adaption from the book and it will surly make you think about swiming before you step into teh ocean again. Did for swimming what Psycho did for showers and TCM did for meat eating. Very good movie.	5.0	Do you feel up for a swim?	2003-12-29	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3I4EX7TBWUT1U	"""patrick_mcknight"""	"Was there ever a better suspense thriller than Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws""?  There can't be very many films that have matched the thrills and quality of this film.  ""Jaws"" became the biggest moneymaker up to the date it was released (1975) and helped to create the summer blockbuster.  It also made a young unknown director into Hollywood's golden boy, a position that Spielberg has kept for the past two and a half decades.Spielberg's detractors have claimed that Spielberg ruined Hollywood by churning out ""juvenile"" blockbusters, but I demure.  Spielberg's films are so much better than the junk that Hollywood regularly makes.  ""Jaws"" is better written and directed and has better characters than almost all thrillers made since.  Spielberg can't help it if so many inferior directors try to copy him by turning out inferior films.Roy Scheider stars as Martin Brody, the chief of police of a small town on Long Island.  Brody thought he was getting away from it all by moving here from New York City, but instead finds his problems are just beginning when a young girl is found devoured by a shark.  Brody must find a way to close the beaches and kill the shark to keep further people from becoming the shark's next meal.  Unfortunately, the town's slimy mayor and deadbeat locals are determined to keep the beaches open to take full advantage of the upcoming fourth of July weekend (""We're a summer town.  We need summer dollars."")Finally, after several more deaths, Brody teams up with shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) on a Moby Dick-like quest to kill the beast.Spielberg's direction is quite taught.  I particularly liked little touches like that scene where Brody is nervously watching people swim in the ocean while people pass him obstructing his vision.  There's also little humorous touches as when a person stops to talk to Brody over a trivialty cutting off his view, and when Hooper and Quint get into a contest by showing off their scars.Certainly the characters are more interesting than in your average thriller.  Roy Scheider manages to exude just the right amount of masculinity and vulnerability as Brody.  I found it interesting learning about Brody's fear of the water.  ""It doesn't make sense for someone who's afraid of the water to live on an island,"" Hooper says to Brody.  ""It's only an island if you look at it from the water,"" Brody points out.  Brody's confronting the shark will be his way of facing and overcoming his fears.  I also really liked Richard Dreyfuss' nutty performance as the eccentric ichthyologist.  But it's Robert Shaw who steals the show as the salty, hard-bitten sailor.  I thought the speech that Shaw gives about his experiences with sharks after the sinking of the Indianapolis to be one of the highlights of the film.  It gives some insight into his character as well as to his apparent death wish.Not to be overlooked is John Williams' now classic score.  Who doesn't now recognize the ""Jaws"" theme?  Spielberg would collaborate successfully with Williams in many subsequent films.The ending is also very satisfying.  Unlike a lot of horror thrillers that leave you feeling unnerved and upset, this film's ending leaves you feeling happy and exhilarated.  Spielberg is said to have improvised here, uncertain as how to end his film.  Bravo Spielberg!"	5.0	"""We're going to need a bigger boat."""	2002-09-02	0	0	0

I think that the casting was a little lame -- the people in the roles are pretty much ""as expected"" and I thought that took away from the movie. I didn't see any newer actors ""develop a future"" thru this horror vehicle.2. It's a good story, a great white shark plagueing a resort town, and the subsequent political and other conflicts between the mayor, the police chief, the marine biologist and, the shark hunter.3. The suspense was really great -- few movies, short of ""The Birds"" achieve this level of keeping you on the edge of your seat. The creepy  soundtrack probably accounted for 50% of this actuality.This movie isn't for everyone but I'd watch it again."	4.0	Pretty Good	2007-10-18	6	4	2
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1H8LMYXWTYYTI	"Paul Bubny ""Paul Bubny"""	"When ""Jaws"" was released on DVD five years ago, the package skimped on extras, provided a whittled-down version of an originally two-hour documentary, and scrapped the original, Oscar-winning sound mix in favor of a surround-sound modernization that was often less effective than what moviegoers heard circa-1975. There was an online petition a few years ago signed by many ardent ""Jaws"" fans (a/k/a finsters) calling for a better DVD issue. I'm one of the ""Jaws"" geeks who signed that petition, and this DVD set is for us.Anyone buying ""Jaws"" on DVD for the first time with this set will get a choice of the original monoraul mix, or DTS or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mixes (both of which include some cheesy new sound effects not heard in the original) along with the full-length documentary originally produced for the 1995 laserdisc edition, and some additional extras. Still not as many extras as there could have been, but this set is more generous in that regard than the 2000 release. Picture quality is identical to the earlier DVD, which looked fine for the most part. Finsters naturally will opt for the mono soundtrack and sit through the entire documentary, reveling in the story of one of the most problem-plagued Hollywood productions ever. DVD consumers with less of an emotional attachment to the movie will question the need to invest in this package over the one-disc DVD from 2000, and I can't say I blame them.Whichever DVD you buy,  though (and stick with the letterboxed version, please--panning-and-scanning wrecks the movie's visual coherence), ""Jaws"" has long since become an inadvertent classic, with at least two of its best characteristics--Steven Spielberg's emphasis on implied threat rather than overexposure of the giant shark, and the lead actors' nuanced performances--forced on it by the endless special-effects delays. Summertime blockbusters, of which this was the first, have improved on the effects since then but have generally declined in storytelling ability compared to this."	4.0	Score one for the finsters	2005-07-27	5	3	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A11XF4X94GGEK0	Paul	Not even kidding. This movie changed movies forever. A 24 year old Stephen Spielberg and a mechanical shark made thousands of people afraid to go into the water, playing on people's deepest fears - fear of the unknown. It's not about what you see in Jaws - it's about what you don't see. Spielberg did a great job in using devices to resemble the shark without actually showing it - a fin, a plank of wood, fishing barrels...leaving the viewer to imagine great horrors underneath. I'm not sure if he did that intentionally or if the mechanical shark just wasn't working, but either way, it gave viewers the most palpable, horrifying feeling. That's the same feeling you have when you're treading water in the Gulf of Mexico and you feel a fish hit your foot and you scream like a little girl. In reality, it was only a tiny little fish, but in your mind, it was a 5 ton 30 foot great white ready to drag you underwater and just eat you. So you spend the rest of your day hanging out on the beach and 'tanning,' and when your girlfriend asks why you're not in the water you have to say it's because you're getting your tan on and you don't like swimming much anyway. It's overrated.All of these new shark movies never ever even touched what this movie did. Watch it.Oh, also the acting is superb.	5.0	JAWS is one of the greatest movies of all time	2014-02-03	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1THYVYW49R566	"Paul Simanauskas ""I shall name thee &#34;Stab..."	A young, up and coming director, Steven Spielberg took an ambitious book by Peter Benchley, a turned it into one of the most memorable films of all time.  John William's title score is so recognizable, only two notes are needed to instantly instill fear in the hearts of anyone venturing into the ocean (or even your backyard swimming pool!)  Roy Scheider plays the everyday hero, a reluctant, scared-of-the-water police Chief, Martin Brody.  Faced with a series of shark attacks on the island he recently just called home, he battles not only nature, but the politics of Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton.)  With the help of a young Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a salty old sea dog, the mysterious Quint (Robert Shaw), the three set sail to battle a fish unlike anything they've ever seen.  The haunting performance by Shaw is capped by his memorable &#34;Indianapolis Speech,&#34; while Dreyfuss' youth and stubbornness lend well to his character.  Perhaps one of the unsung stars of the movie is the town of &#34;Amity Island&#34; (Martha's Vineyard, MA) where the local townsfolk, the scenery, and the quaint New England mood make this more than just a horror flick, but rather a sea-faring epic of the ages.  The bonus footage, including the stellar documentary &#34;The Shark Is Still Working&#34; make this a must have for any cinema buff.  &#34;The Shark Is Still Working&#34; is the not-for-profit, love of Jaws documentary which explains why this film is such a legend in film.  The documentary goes on to explain how the film was the first true summer blockbuster, and the highest grossing film at the time.  Still to this day, sharks are called &#34;Jaws&#34;, the familiar &#34;dun-dun&#34; of William's theme is widely used today.  Get this remastered, superb audio and visual treat, and be sure to watch The Shark Is Still Working to appreciate how truly unique of a film Jaws really is.	5.0	Quite possibly one of the most perfect films ever made.	2013-01-29	2	2	0

This guy is scooping chum into the water to attract the shark, talking over his shoulder, and when he turns back to face the sea, the open maw of a giant white shark is all he sees, and the critter is about to take his arm off.

We're gonna need a bigger boat.""It's SO PERFECT.I loved this film when I first saw it a billion yrs ago, back when the earth was cooling, and I love it still. It's about a big shark that these guys are stalking so their peaceful little tourist town can resume business as usual. But then things turn hairy and scary when they realize that, actually, the shark is stalking them. Benchley's original book is pretty faithfully rendered in Spielberg's screen version. Especially well done are the scenes that pit the scientists and level headed sheriff against the politicians who just want all this nonsense downplayed so they can start making money again.I slept just fine after watching it, but my husband had nightmares about sharks coming thru the bedroom walls all night for the next several nights, so...viewing discretion advised for those of tender sensibilities.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP	Phil Berardelli	"I was walking out of the theater after introducing a friend of mine to this movie (something I often did that summer), when I noticed he was white as a sheet. When I asked him why, he said: ""I grew up in Daytona Beach, Florida, and we used to go swimming in the ocean at night all the time. I had no idea there were things like that in the water!"" Another friend heard the following remark as he left a theater after a screening: ""Man, I've seen scary movies before, but goddamn!"" Those were typical reactions among moviegoers during the summer of 1975. Jaws genuinely terrified people. They didn't know it at the time, but they were witnessing the beginning of a phenomenon: the summer blockbuster craze. Jaws launched a trend that has continued ever since, as people flock to the movies during the summer to be scared, thrilled or tickled to death by the best effects and pop-spectacle that Hollywood can deploy.Everyone should know this particular story by now: A great white shark stakes out territory in the waters off the popular but fictional New England island of Amity (it was shot on Martha's Vineyard) and starts munching on swimmers. The local chief of police (Roy Scheider), a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and an obsessive shark hunter (Robert Shaw) set out to catch and kill the beast. They do find it but in the process get much more than they bargained for. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb took Peter Benchley's rather pedestrian best-selling novel and, with the help of Verna Fields, the veteran film editor, the brilliant music of John Williams, and the tremendously appealing performances of the three lead actors and the entire supporting cast, streamlined it into an express train of a thriller. It grabs you from the very first deep bass-violin stroke of the score that made Williams a legendary composer - and about whom Spielberg wrote: ""He has made our movie more adventurous, gripping and phobic than I ever thought possible."" Some of the mechanical shark scenes seem dated in this age of CGI, but there's still no denying its power and sense of adventure - and its surprising amount of humor. This many years later it remains one of the very best of the summer blockbusters.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)"	5.0	The mother - literally - of summer blockbusters	2013-10-14	3	3	0

I wasn't disappointed. The film looks better than I've ever see it before. It is almost as if extra lighting was placed in some of the scenes. The picture is crisp, colorful and pops off the screen. The moonlit scenes, chiefly the opening sequence, is stunning in its clarity. I also noticed how incredible the sound is. The scene where Quint runs his nails down the chalkboard never really bothered me before but here it is excruciating. Plentiful extras include 2 documentaries, the best being the most recent ""The Shark is Still Working"" which contains fascinating interviews with actors (even those in bit parts) and an intimate look at Verna Fields studio. The older documentary is a bit sluggish and repetitive but sill worth a look. Unfortunately, no commentary. This Blu-ray edition is a must have for fans!"	5.0	A new classic restored	2012-08-27	4	3	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ACMAUJEBY6GJF	Pl Amundsen	"This is another classic from my childhood, it was scary then, and so it is now. Perfect actors were cast for this movie, in fact I doubt the movie Jaws would have been as good as it actually is if it hadn't been for the ""dreamtheme"" Spielberg, Shaw, Scheider and the wonderful Dreyfuss. I adore these three actors in Jaws, and Spielbergs' directions is the early work of a genious in progress, you know, I find Jaws among Spielbergs' best work ever - the best before Schindlers' List (though very uncomparable) - and the hard work he and his collegues had to put themselves through making the movie (see ""The making of..."" : Special feautures) was definetively worth all their frustrations until the movie were finally ready for the theatres back in 1975, and in the years after on vcr and then finally on dvd.Jaws is a movie with soul. Unless it would have been old-fashioned long ago. But the action-adventure-thriller-elements behind the story captured on screen are so facinating and impressive and unlike anything else ever made, the effects are ""simple"" (like the barrels) but function extremely well, and still today - now that we have got all sorts of computer-animated-effect-monsters (call it whatever you want) - what I mean is that ""Deep blue sea"" (the movie) could never be compared to ""Jaws"". In my opinion it is too simple, though perhaps twice as expensive as Jaws ever was. And that probably because is a movie much more than just a horror movie about a great white shark. It is more ""realistic"" - and about a small Island-society turned upside dow and against eachother when the tragedy strikes their usually tourist-season-based beaches, and how the tragedy splits the towns' inhabitans in two sides when the question lingers on wether they should close their beaches and risk their tourist-reputations, or keep them open just for the sake of earning money. Anyway, the movie is still impressive, just as entertaining and loveable.I think Robert Shaw earned an Academy Award for his role in this project, a great actor."	5.0	One of the best movies ever made...	2004-10-24	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Jaws was Stephen Spielberg's first hit and after his initial reluctance to release his movies on DVD, it finally makes its DVD debut.  We all know the story, a great white shark terrorizes the waters off of Amity Island. The  movie is based on Peter Benchey's best-selling novel.  This is one of the  rare instances where a movie is actually better than the book it was based  on.  In Mr. Benchey's novel, there is are some extraneous sections such as  an affair between Ellen Brody and Hooper that really don't add to the  story.  The movie streamlines the book and the changes made bringing it to  the screen actually improve on the book. The performances of three stars  are superb.  Roy Scheider plays Chief Brody as an everyman.  We can all  relate with him as he is just trying do his job and the right thing but is  caught in the middle.  He wants to close the beaches to catch the shark,  but the people he is protecting want them opened as the water is the source  of their livelihoods.  Richard Dreyfus adds some comic relief to the film  as the wise-cracking oceanographer, Matt Hooper.  The late Robert Shaw  takes what could have been a cartoonish role of the shark boat captain  Quint and turns him into an obessive, vengeful man in the mold of Captain  Ahab.  The real star of the film could be its score by John Williams.  The  music adds tension and fear to the suspense much like the music from  Psycho.  The DVD contains some extra material including deleted scences,  trailers and best of all a documentary on the making of the movie.  This is  a must see for all fans of the film.  We learn of all the problems the crew  experienced while filming on Martha's Vineyard, some original casting  choices and other behind-the-scences tidbits.  These are nice bonuses, but  the movie's first appearance on the DVD format is reason enough to buy it.  After 25 years, this movie remains a classic.	5.0	Finally On DVD	2000-07-12	68	59	9
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQ2UN38CMK119	P. Mann	Steven Spielberg's 1975 masterpiece shows what &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; could have been if Spielberg had been serious about the dinosaur film.  &quot;Jaws&quot; owes much of its success to a superb cast with three-dimensional rles to fill and the power of understatement.  While the conclusion is riveting with the shark in full view, it owes much to the build-up, in which the shark remains elusively out of view for so long.  And it doesn't hurt that John Williams added a masterful score.  This is one of those rare cases where the film is better than the book.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AWOIHKJGC58HF	"""poppiestwist33"""	As everyone knows this June 2000 will be the 25th anniversary of the original release date of one the best thrillers ever made. Universal or Speilberg if you're reading please won't you make available Jaws on DVD  with a remastered digital 5.1 soundtrack and also add the deleted scenes  that were on the laserdisc. These scenes should have never been deleted in  the first place in my opinion as they add character. Also the deleted scene  of the dying estuary victim pushing Mike Brody out of harms' way as a  sputter of blood gushes from his mouth is one of the most terrifying attack  scenes of the movie that I remember from childhood. It also illustrates a  noble dimension to the estuary victims' earlier question to the boys of  &quot;...are you guys alright over there...?&quot; He saves Mike Brodys'  life in his dying moments. This movie richly deserves the DVD transfer and  a remastered version of John Williams' score. Having this movie available  on DVD would also be just in light of the fact that already existing on DVD  is its' pathetic and ridiculous sequel &quot;Jaws: The Revenge.&quot; Why  anyone would waste their time and budget giving that movie DVD treatment is  beyond me.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A29L2RN5D8C0HM	"Prism Light ""Prism"""	"""Jaws"" is about an island whose popular beach's reputation is threatened when shark attacks suddenly begin popping up out of season.  With the 4th of July coming up, the mayor refuses to close the beach.  But with more and more attacks coming in (all of them fatal) his only option is to send the chief of police, a shark expert, and a shark fisherman on what may be the greatest adventure of their lives.This movie is what started my phobia of sharks.  I saw a few clips showing the shark when I was young and I was instantly traumatized.  For a long time I was very frightened of sharks.  I could harldy look at pictures of them without getting chills.  But believe it or not, Jaws actually helped me get RID of my phobia...I think.  I thought it would be a terrifying movie, but it wasn't as scary as I thought.  Yes, it would be disturbing for kids or people who get sick at the sight of blood.  But the shark actually wasn't as realistic and violent-looking as I remembered it.  It's eyes were glazed over a lot of the time and it's movements were sometimes kind of unnatural.  Now if that movie had been made today and I watched it, I would probably be curled in a corner shaking with fear.  But the special effects just were not as realistic as I remembered, and I think it helped me let go of part of that fear.  I guess it will be put to the test this summer!I recommend this movies to those looking for a good movie that keeps you in suspense.  It's actually the music that's the scariest part.  It builds up the anxiety.  I guess that's why that ""ba-dum...ba-dum...ba-dum"" is so popular now whenever people are talking about sharks or trying to convey something really scary."	4.0	Good, but Not Scary	2006-02-06	6	0	6

The best part was when that shark fed on that human!  What a feeding!  I saw this movie when I was an embryo, and it still excites me to this day!  After I saw it, I immediately wanted to go into the ocean and become a feeding for a great white shark!  The blood and gore and graphic depiction of human flesh being torn apart and swallowed by a large shark was first rate.  Some poeple say this movie glorifies the violent nature of shark feeding, but I think it is a wonderful, natural process which is part of the whole balance of nature.  It's ""responsible violence"", unlike some of Spielberg's later films. I myself have been a shark meal over eight times!  Being eaten by a shark was the best thing that ever happened to me!  It amazes me that Spielberg, who had never been eaten by a shark, has given us such a human-eye perspective on being fed upon.  He should be eaten, just like his characters.  I love this movie!  You know, when the shark fed on that human, it was stunning!  And the best part was that you didn't know what was going to happen!  I mean, you're sitting here, watching this nice movie, and then BAM!  A shark comes out of nowhere and feeds on this human!  I mean, how random!  How did Peter Benchley think of that?  It was so thrilling that, i believed, the next time in the movie that the shark fed on another human, I wouldn't be as excited.  But I was!  There is no shortage of shark feedings here, and that's what makes a good movie.  I mean, look at Armageddon!  NO SHARK FEEDINGS. Bad movie.  Buy this DVD, for all your shark feeding needs.  This movie also has a large sense of comic relief.  There's this part where this human is fed upon by a shark, and then it cuts to another shot, and Brody and Richard Dreyfuss' character are getting drunk.  Funny!  Then they go out on their boat, and they uncover another shark-fed-upon human.  Laugh out loud!  Spielberg truly develops his characters in this cinematic masterpiece.  In another part of the movie, the shark feeds on this human, and you can really feel the hunger of the shark and his need to consume food.  Anyway, I saw Deep Blue Sea, and I hated it.  Lots of sharks feeding on humans, but the acting sucked.  See JAWS!  It is the ultimate shark movie!  In fact, of all the shark movies ever made, I would have to say that JAWS is number one!  It's so good that I'd say it's better than all the other shark movies.  In fact, no other shark movie comes close to matching the brilliance of JAWS.  If you like sharks feeding on humans, rent JAWS.  It's #1!  (see my review on ""Out Of Africa"".)"	4.0	Jaws - The Review	2012-08-18	22	2	20

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AWJUPCUTCXLXF	"Ramon Varela ""pcrossland"""	"Forget the water. After seeing ""Jaws,"" you'll be afraid to go in the shower! At the ripe old age of 26, Steven Spielberg managed to redefine the economics of Hollywood forever (ushering the era of the Summer Blockbuster) AND create an all-time classic at the same time. Even without ""E.T.,"" the Indiana Jones movies, ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" this film alone would make Spielberg's resume significantly better than that of 95% of Hollywood directors (I checked my figures of course).A quiet New England summer town is terrorized by an enormous Great White Shark whose appetite for human flesh seems to know no limits. The new police chief (Roy Scheider), bending to pressure from the Mayor and City Council, fails to close the beaches even though he knows there is a shark out there. As a result of his negligence, a little boy is killed. Racked with guilt, he becomes obsessed with killing the shark and immerses himself in the study of the animals, aided by an icthyologist from the mainland (Richard Dreyfuss) who comes to provide expert advice.When a smaller shark is caught and mistakenly believed to be the aggressor, the Mayor orders the beaches to stay open for the 4th of July weekend, with predictably disastrous results. The cop and the scientist must then team up with a salty local fisherman (Robert Shaw) to go hunt and kill the shark, which results in an exhilirating battle of will, wits and guts.The three leads all deliver unforgettable performances, but the real star of the show is Spielberg, who deftly plays on the fears of the audience to create a thriller worthy of Hitchcock (yes, I realize how original it is to bring this up when talking about this movie). Cranking up the suspense by more than a few notches is the classic, inspired soundtrack by John Williams.Even the fact that the long-awaited appearance of the shark turns out to be something of a letdown does not detract from the overall effectiveness of the film. Spielberg manages to create an atmosphere so tense that the mere sight of the ocean is almost enough to make you jump out of your seat. Having seen it only on video, I can only imagine how chilling it must have been to watch this film in a movie theater. Not only does Spielberg trim away all the pedestrian melodrama from the novel, but the last act of the film, in which the three men hunt the shark (or is it the other way around?), once it kicks into overdrive, never lets up.The subsequent appearance of ""Star Wars"" often makes people forget that the Blockbuster mentality was actually an aftermath of the success of ""Jaws."" It's just as well, because this is a true classic, regardless of the bastardizing effect its box office had on Hollywood films. Spielberg has said that although he hated making the film, he loved planning the film, implying that the mere thought of scaring the bejesus out of the audience was an immensely enjoyable experience for him. Well, it shows, and for that we should all be grateful."	5.0	You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat!	2000-04-25	0	0	0

I'm calm now.  Okay, I'll just admit it.  I love sharks.  I think that they are the most beautiful animals on the planet.  And it digusts me that people kill them for sport, or for that matter, any reason at all.  In fact, when I was three years old, I used to watch Jaws, and cry when the shark got blown up at the end!  But, lets survey the facts here...Jaws was made at a time when, obviously, the fear of sharks was present.  And, Jaws struck fear into the hearts of all beach goers.  The great white is not a creature hungry for human flesh, as slightly depicted in the movie (they never actually state that its after humans), and the great white does not deserve to be given that reputation.  But, take a look at movies like Shark Attack 2 and Jaws IV (no, Spielberg did not direct that).  Those movies are a disgrace not only to film, but to sharks!  Jaws is a great movie!  And you people say that it made sharks hated.  It was such a success, that in the later movies, bad as they were, people were rooting for the shark!  Yes, you heard it right, the SHARK!

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ	"R. Gorham ""RCG2"""	Where do you start? Benchley writes a bestseller. Young, relatively  unknown, mastermind director Spielberg directs. Support from a wonderful  cast: Roy Scheider (the town sheriff), Richard Dreyfuss (the out of town  shark expert), and the late great Robert Shaw (the fisherman &amp; his  boat). This movie follows the book for the most part with the exception of  Hooper (Dreyfuss' character) living and not being a statistic at the  movie's end. Some memorable scenes... The opening scene of the first victim  taking a skinny dip at night, 2. a mother dressed in black talking to the  sheriff after her son fell prey to the shark, 3. Hooper almost gets eaten  while diving in the cage, 4. Quint (Shaw) meets his demise, and 5. Brody  kills the shark. Some memorable lines... Mayor Vaughn: &quot;We have caught  and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.&quot;  Brody: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot; Quint: &quot;The thing  about a shark, it's got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When  it comes at you it doesn't seem to be livin'... until he bites you, and  those black eyes roll over white.&quot; Some tongue &amp; cheek humor mixed  in with high drama and suspense. The only drawback I saw with this movie  was the ending. I thought it was a bit corny at first. But after watching  the movie for about the 50th time I noticed that the book on sharks that  Brody is flicking through features a shark with a diver's tank in its  mouth. This movie is tied together very well - from beginning to end.  Awesome &amp; ahead of it's time. Essential in any movie buff's library.	5.0	Top 10 All-time Suspense Thriller	2000-07-27	6	6	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2IYUCI5A26O82	R. Hansen	Sometimes it's not simply that a movie is great, it's also the memories that surround the first time you watched it. For me one of those great reminisces is when my older brother Rick took me to see `Jaws' in the summer of 1975. This was a big deal to an eleven-year-old kid. I doubt if he remembers, but I always will. Just like I'll remember how I wouldn't swim in the neighborhood pool for the rest of that summer after watching this Spielberg classic.I also recall the precedence that this film set in the horror genre by opening the movie with a scene in which the monster claims a victim. This was such a revelation that I remember telling a friend about the movie and he was totally aghast at such an iconoclastic beginning. `You can't do that' he exclaimed, `you have to have clues leading up to creature, then something happens!' Even at that age I realized that this was shaking things up. Soon a slew of nature vs. man flicks inundated the market and each had a creature (be it grizzly bear, piranha, etc) start the movie off with a violent episode.Of course this is a fantastic scare-flick, but the reason it has stood the test of time (and the shame of ersatz sequels) is that is more than a frightening movie. The dialogue is smart and the characters are interesting and very well developed. From the central troika of Brody, Hooper and Quint to lesser characters such as the chief's wife and the mayor the players satisfy and represent what we want them to. Not to mention the clever nuances (during the scar-comparing badinage Brody slightly lifts his shirt and glances at a scar that you can tell he wants to mention, but obviously decides not to-and this leaves the moment more fulfilling by what is not said) and the side bars (the implied conflict between Brody and his wife and their current residence, the disparity between Hooper and Quint, etc) that add verisimilitude to the work. Also adroitly included are adumbrations such as the `Welcome to Amity' sign, and Quint sailing by with a large grin as the fisherman hang the tiger shark up thinking they have caught the beast in question (we share this irony with Quint and it's very enjoyable) as well as quick scenes (the overweight lady heading into the water) that we like as we watch the movie but don't remember when later on we try to explain why we like this film so much.	5.0	Great movie!	2004-08-05	0	0	0

Now that i am 14, the movie is just awesome and well put together. I think after 30 years, this movie is still really amazing. Not to mention that the ""fake"" shark (also called Bruce by Steven Spielberg) Only worked for about 5 minutes to 6 seconds on a normal film day. It is so cool to watch the movie that pretty much catapolted the three main actors, and Spielberg's carrier. I reccommend this movie. But, don't show this movie to the littler kids, unless you like them seeing lots of blood and hearing swear words. Also, one kid gets eaten. I think everyone should see this movie.And for all you shark lovers information. I am fasinated by sharks, this movie made me want to learn more about them. So, if you watch this movie, don't think this is what sharks are really like. I think Spielberg made this a film from the book, becaus he thought it would make a good story.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1TTVW8UU2TFWT	Rich Ralbovsky	I recently purchased the Spielberg classic 1975 film Jaws, on DVD. And I must say, I was excited to see this film finally digitally, I say I was excited until I listened very closely to the sound effects. The film is  crisp and clear, and letterboxed the way it should be, but certain sound  effects are not the way they were or should be. I compared the DVD with the  THX VHS version and I must say for the sound go with the THX VHS version.  If you are obsessed with the theatrical trailers, documentary, or behind  the scenes footage(as I am) and you dont mind listening to some of the new  sound effects created for this, go with the DVD. I myself have had a hard  time finding the THX, version in stores lately. When is Universal going to  realize that they should leave well enough alone when it comes to sound  effects in their DVD's. Now for the film review, As we all know, this film  opens wonderfully underwater with John Williams spooky score done  brilliantly. The small island town of Amity is being threatened to do no  summer business because their beaches are being haunted by a giant killer  great white shark. Of course after a few deaths, one being the opening  attack and devouring of a cute female swimmer, and the other being a water  loving little boy, the towns chief played wonderfully by Roy Scheider wants  something to be done, mainly close the beaches and hire someone to kill the  beast. The towns greedy mayor and other higher ups dont feel the shark is a  problem and hesitantly decide to only close the beaches for 24 hours. Of  course after the shark reappears and kills a few more the chief decided to  hire Quint who is a little crazy to go and kill the monster, but not alone  as he decides to go along on the mission along with the wonderful shark  expert played to perfection by Richard Dreyfuss. The films chase scenes  between the men and the shark are done expertly and professionally. And we  generally feel at one point as if the shark has won, leaving the ending to  be truly explosive. Spielberg knows how to direct a great cast and this  film will leave you thinking twice about returning to the water trust me...	4.0	DVD disappoints with soundtrack	2000-07-10	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2W81H1D8YBE8T	Rick Ansgar	This movie is a good thriller.  It staggers the imagination as far as how well it has succeeded.  I am in agreement with Robert Shaw, the British actor who played Quint (which Amazon has amazingly left out of the actors listed for the film).  Shaw didn't believe the film would do well, so he took a flat fee for his role, rather than the percentage he was initially offered.  A mistake, in hindsight.  However, I agree with his initial instinct.  This film is fun, but flatter than a pancake.  The most interesting part of the movie is the character Quint, which, by the way, Shaw added to by creating interesting lines for his character.  Shaw was not just a great actor, but a very fine writer as well.  Here's to the memory of Robert Shaw--you are greatly missed, Robert!	3.0	Basic Thriller	2007-05-02	3	1	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3HWIMIBAAQSXO	"RICK ""rdthomp17"""	When Steven Spielberg finished making the smash hit action film DUEL, he began venturing to make another film, scarier, more exciting, and, as well, a money maker. Recently, there was a book written by Peter Benchley called JAWS. Somebody handed it to him, Spielberg read it, and he was interested in making a movie out of it. And that's what he did.JAWS: The Movie is simply amazing. Scary, exciting, and overall, enjoyable. If those of you like seeing the monster every five seconds, go look at Godzilla, but this rocks.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	ALD1CRUBY1365	R. L. MILLER	"It's a bit like that old axiom of journalism; ""Dog bites man, NOT news. Man bites dog, THAT'S news. After all, when a man eats a fish, he's just a Red Lobster customer. But turn it the other way around and, well...Let's face it, this film became a genre in its own right. Anybody who was anybody was required to discuss it in some detail or something had to be wrong with them. It even affect the James Bond series in the person of a scary guy named...uh...""Jaws"". Which kind of explains why there were two sequels, of descennding quality. Spielberg wanted no part of the last one.But in this first offering, you've got Roy Scheider as a burned-out NYPD cop who takes a job as chief of police on a New England coastal resort island. One night a partying teen decides to go swimming and washes ashore mostly munched-on. Shark attack, sez the coroner. BIG shark attack. Chief Brody decides that the beaches should be closed down until further notice, which goes over with the mayor (Murray Hamilton) like a lead balloon. The Holiday weekend is coming up, after all. The mayor decides that Brody is exceeding his authority. Which gives Brody his first experience of how politics can really screw up police work. Probably didn't get much direct experience with that on the precinct level down in the Apple. A modest reward is offered for anybody who can get rid of the shark and a brash sea dog type (Robert Shaw) named Quint insists that he's the only one who can do it--for more than three times the reward offered. So Brody calls in a scientist in the person of the nerdy, intense Cooper (Richard Dreyfus). Meanwhile tourists are rolling in for the holiday weekend in everything from faded Country Squire wagons to Rolls Royces and the body count rises. Some of the attacks are even seen from shore. We learn that just being in shallow water gives no immunity from shark attack. We get a crowd shot including one tourist--a rather obese woman who isn't really shown as being attacked, which might disappoint the modern-day viewer who sneers obsessively over New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight as if having major weight issues makes a person subhuman, one of the ""new nerds"". So Our Three Heroes cast off in Quint's battered Nova Scotia lobster boat to ""git that big bad fishie"". Maybe I'm guilty of a bit of a spoiler here, but this particular shark turns out to be a match for a middlin'-size fishing boat. Nuff said on that.I had forgotten that the score for this film had been done by John Williams--somehow that ominous ""DUNT-dunt-DUNT-dunt-DUNT-dunt"" ostinato whenever the shark approaches seems simplistic for the man who scored Star Wars and Harry Potter. But in its own way it has become as signature a piece of movie music as that string section thing that played whenever the Wicked Witch rode her broom in ""Wizard Of Oz"", or the twangy guitar thing as James Bond turns towards the camera and fires his Walther in the intro. Cliches, yes--but ones that people often vocally imitate."	3.0	Man Eats Fish--NOT a thriller. Fish Eats Man--a thriller...	2012-09-01	11	0	11

The way the movie can morph from drama to comedy to action in a nanosecond never fails to impress me. Sometimes you don't know whether to laugh at Quint or be a little frightened.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	"""Jaws"" is simply the best nature-gone-awry horror movie ever made. I read the novel and was marginally stirred by it, but the cinematic adaptation brought the true horror potential of a giant rogue shark home is a primal way that other films have sought to imitate, but could never duplicate.Steven Spielberg was unarguably the genius behind the execution of the film, but everyone from the excellent cast, to the special effects gurus (remember this was done before digital special effects were even dreamed of), to the editors and sound effects people coalesced to produce an amazing film.I am sure that everyone knows that the film is about a giant rogue shark terrorizing a resort community, and the man-versus-beast battle which ensues, but to me the real genius here is in the development of the lead characters into real, believable people thrust together in a very trying situation. I personally believe that Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider are the true stars here. Shaw's ""USS Indianapolis"" monologue is one of the most effective in film history (the ""Making of"" feature discusses this at length in an interesting segment), and Roy Scheider's ""bigger boat"" adlib is possibly the best line in the entire film.There are many extras, including an interesting ""Making of"" feature, which is highly recommended viewing, even if you normally don't enjoy such things.Although this film has been repackaged many times (and undoubtedly will be again), to me that doesn't detract from the film itself: buy the cheapest version of ""Jaws"" you can find on DVD. Forget the extras if you wish: this is a film worthy of being called a true cinematic legend."	5.0	"""I Saw One Eat A Rockin' Chair One Time..."""	2005-07-20	5	4	1

Collette ""rcollette"""	Let me get right to the point.  &quot;Jaws&quot; is a classic, a masterpiece, the standard by which all modern horror and action thrillers are measured.  Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of Peter Benchley's celebrated  novel may well have ignited a new era for the movie industry at that time:  the era of the &quot;Summer Blockbuster.&quot;  Sadly, it's an era that  seems more intent upon marketing commercial products and visual effects  over substance and innovation, as many of Hollywood's bigwigs (Spielberg  included) have sold out to produce brainless, demographically inspired  trash like &quot;Con Air,&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West.&quot;  Remember  when going to the movies was fun?  Remember when you could expect a healthy  blend of crisp and original storytelling, attention to character  development, and a plot that didn't insult your intelligence?  &quot;Jaws&quot; manifests each of these essential ingredients to a quality  movie-going experience, and the result is one of the greatest films of all  time.The residents of Amity Island, Massachusetts have one thing going  for their livelihoods: summer tourists and beach goers.  So what do you do  when a great white shark threatens to bring an untimely end to the summer  season, not to mention the lives of several unfortunate bathers?  This is  the dilemma that's brilliantly played out between the rational-minded  sheriff (Roy Scheider) and the politically motivated town mayor (Murray  Hamilton).  The quarrel is finished when a series of tragic events compel  that the shark be killed by any means necessary.  Enter the best  shark-hunting trio ever assembled.  Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert  Shaw formulate such perfect chemistry that we can't peel our attention away  for even a moment.  In fact, the movie's final hour may be one of the  finest ever filmed in terms of drama, suspense, and sheer horror.  All  performances are commendable, the dialogue at times is brilliant, and the  mechanical shark (Bruce) is as terrifying as any &quot;computer  generated&quot; effect from that moronic film &quot;Deep Blue Sea.&quot;  John William's score ranks among the best ever composed, on a par in terms  of ground-breaking significance with the themes from &quot;Star Wars,&quot;  &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;West Side Story.&quot;  The movie  was followed by three sequels, each increasing exponentially in banality.	5.0	The Standard Has Been Set	2000-06-16	8	8	0

However, we were certainly not prepared to be as frightened we were by several scenes. (Those who have already seen this film know which ones.) If  I recall correctly, this was the first film which Steven Spielberg (then 27) directed and clearly established him as a master storyteller. Several of his crew received an Academy Award (for editing, sound, and musical score); both Spielberg and the film were also nominated.As does John Mulligan with the character Salvaje in The Stalking Moon, Spielberg brilliantly conceals or only partially reveals the great white shark, thereby requiring us to use or imagination. This strategy increases our anticipation as well as the emotional impact of each encounter with what shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) calls ""the perfect eating machine."" When recently seeing this film again, I was again jolted by moments which I had first seen 28 years ago. This time around, I paid more attention to the basic conflict between the importance of public safety advocated by police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and the importance of economic development (i.e. tourism) to Amity Island advocated by mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton). I still do not recognize the dialect used by Quint (Robert Shaw) but was again entertained by his interactions with Brody and Hooper, especially one night aboard Quint's boat Orca as they exchange ""sea stories"" and compare scars.This is an especially entertaining ""horror movie,"" possessed of crisp and sure direction, solid acting, and an effective integration of cinematography, musical score, and special effects. Having seen it so many times, I now prefer to see only certain scenes while watching it again. I am curious to know how members of a focus group would respond to it if (a) they knew nothing about it, (b) were placed in a private screening room, provided with refreshments of choice, and (c) asked to see it for the first time.  My guess, obviously only a guess, is that their reactions and comments would be essentially the same as my own were in 1975."	5.0	The Menace Below	2003-07-29	0	0	0

A couple leaves the group for a midnight swim...The silhouette of a woman is seen in full flight toward the sea... Her dress, bra, and panties fly toward her drunk admirer who can't make a fist to catch them...In a delicate splash, Chrissie goes swimming in the cold ocean, drawing herself into deeper water...When a wave of pressure lifts her up and eases her down, her face begins to show a certain fear... Her eyes go to the beach where her friend, too drunk to stand, is struggling with his shoe...Chrissie turns and starts for shore... But her expression freezes... Something terrible is hurting her underneath... She struggles with all her forces, but she is soon submerged in a horrifying scene...Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) reacts quickly to the news of shark attack, and emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, paint and brushes to close every beach on the island...But as Amity is a beautiful summer resort with clean air, clear water, and beautiful white sand beaches... Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) tries with his town officials to convince the insecure police chief to file the incident as a 'boating accident.'Brody reluctantly agrees, but later regrets his decision after few more fatal incidents... The shark has claimed Amity Island as his territory...Quint (Robert Shaw), an eccentric old shark killer, offers to kill the menacing Great White Shark for ten thousand dollars...Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), an arrogant young oceanographer, proves that the giant shark that killed Christine Watkins is still on the loose... 'They caught a shark. Not the shark,' he determines... and predicts future outbursts of attack activity in the area...Brody, Quint and Hooper become allied in a life-and-death hunt... They go after the monstrous creature with rifles and poison pistols... They try to tire him, slowing him down with coiled ropes and barrels... They fight him with everything, harpoons, poles, gaffs and compressed air tanks...Shaw is absolutely convincing as the colorful master fisherman whose obsession for destroying sharks was triggered by an actual incident in World War II...Scheider is quiet likable as the dedicated family man who doesn't even like the water, swimming or boating... His line to Quint ('You're going to need a bigger boat."") suggests a specific cause...Dreyfuss manages to humanize the picture while stealing it...Spielberg alarms us with unexpected twists, and heart-stopping scenes wonderfully engaging... His grasp for sustaining the feeling of terror comes not only from what we see, but from what we're afraid we're going to see...Spielberg uses an imposing classical score to prepare the audience for something really scary that is about to show up...With every breath, every thought, heart beat and movement, the realism of the increasing menace is present from the opening to the end... And believe me, we are never allowed the relief of looking away from the screen..."	4.0	Spielburg takes us on a wave of terror, scaring us to death...	2007-01-02	3	2	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2310PLAY0SQHF	Rob Vollmar	It had been a while since I did a full non-broadcast viewing of this film and it did NOT disappoint. The suspense that builds in this film is so visceral and real. The characters are so fully-realized without long expository sections trying to explain who they are. The best scenes in the film are ones that, ironically, I had forgotten about so, when they hit, it was like a surprise boat oar to the gut. My only complaint is that the score is mixed so much loud than the dialogue on this edition that I was having to constantly adjust the volume to accomodate. Otherwise, a flawless film of the highest calibre.	4.0	Timeless	2012-09-06	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1OP4R6VADM8KQ	ROBZILLA	This is, quite simply,one of the best horror films ever made.Spielberg effectively meshes stark terror, a bit of realism,and a little humor to create this excellent film version of a rather horrible novel. I'm sure  everyone knows the plot,so no need to go into that.Superb acting,superb  direction,superb score,almost everything worked about this film. As a  refreshing change,Spielberg chose to present each of his characters as  completely fleshed out human beings, and not just fodder for the  shark.Truly excellent filmmaking.This movie really scared me really,REALLY  bad as a child,and as a result I think the PG rating is a bit lenient. It  really should have been rated R.It really is too intense for young kids.	5.0	One of the best	2000-06-25	0	0	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3P1AHO95I5HAQ	"""rogue_7"""	I just saw Jaws for the first time last night, and I loved it! From the opening scene, the suspense was right there next to me, who is gonna die next?  The cinemetogrophy is wonderful, there are several scenes that just  plain work. The plot is a rarity in a modern movie, cohesive and well put  together. This is no &quot;lets have a big monster eat people&quot; movie,  it has a group of characters who are struggling against a threat, a threat  the size of their boat! The slimy Mayor is just one of the great parts, and  they all fit together seamlessly. The reason this did not get 5 stars is  quite frankly that it is not perfect. It is very good, with suspense,  laughs, and some popcorn spilling frights, but it still is not perfect. Do  not let that deter you, it is still a GREAT movie, one everybody should  see.

It remains an infinitely entertaining adventure story, populated with wonderful characters and a captivatingly simple  premise, via Peter Benchley's clever but soppy book.  Roy Scheider, Richard  Dreyfuss and especially Robert Shaw command your attention, and make an  irresistable trio of sea-faring hunters.  John Williams' Oscar-winning  score succeeded so brilliantly you forget that someone somewhere actually  CREATED that ba-da, ba-da shark theme that will forever resonate in our  minds -- and call forth the thrills of this expertly made movie. And  although the special effects do not hold up, Spielberg's directorial hand  invents a shark that is far more terrifying than the one we actually see in  the final reel -- it is that first attack, where the shark is not visible  at all, followed by a series of attacks that reveal the shark in bits and  pieces, that guts you.  I think about this movie every time I go to the  ocean, every time I look out on the waves.	5.0	SPIELBERG ARRIVES	1999-12-17	0	0	0

That said, everybody knows about this movie so there is no point in rehashing all of that. This is short and sweet for people like me that have the DVD and wonder if it's worth the upgrade to BluRay. Yes, it definitely is. Most noticeably to me, in the opening sequence I have always felt it was too dark when the girl is out in the water awaiting her fate. Either they lightened it up a notch or just the higher definition brings out the detail to it. The rest of the movie follows suit. Great clarity, color and definition. I'm not a videophile but the picture and sound are much better to me than in previous versions, so for me it was well worth the upgrade.	5.0	Blu Ray worth the $$	2012-08-27	3	3	0

But if you want the original version as it appeared in the theaters back in 1975, you won't find it here. Even though this edition of JAWS is billed as being from the original 35mm print, it's not. This is still the same version that has been in previous DVD releases and VHS tape releases with the chopped up opening theme music, the chopped up opening credits. When JAWS appeared on TV for the first time, the opening titles and credits had to replaced with smaller versions that would fit the TV screens (they didn't do letterboxing back then). And since that time, JAWS has never been the same. They've always released this TV version. Will we ever see JAWS on DVD or BluRay as it originally appeared in 1975 in the theaters? I'm beginning to wonder of anybody has a copy of that version any more.	3.0	JAWS Still NOT in Original Theater Print	2012-08-14	17	3	14
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AHHI57HQ9OKP0	"R. Smith ""RBSxiii"""	I bought this video to watch with my son.  As my first experience with JAWS was a seminal event in my life I wanted to share that experience with him.  Unfortunately, and this is no way part of the product review, watching it on a TV--even a 55-inch LED flatscreen--couldn't have come close to seeing the film in a theatre.  The fact that I saw Jaws in one of those old-time theaters with only one--giant--screen, I think deepened my sense of failure even more.  But, forgetting all that nitpicking, my son LOVED IT!!!  It really is a remarkable film and it deserves to be part of that canon of life-changing films--even ones in the genre of summer blockbusters--that should be handed down from one generation to another.  I'm not sure my son had the same reaction as I did the first time, and this may be part of TV's limiting value, because we were interrupted by mom calling us to dinner (don't tell her but I wanted to scream at her for undermining our male-bonding moment).  Nevertheless, my son couldn't stop talking about the movie.  To me, what makes a film great and why JAWS deserves that distinction, is not just because the action and the characters are so vividly and perfectly realized, but because the film is truly timeless.  Watching it 35 years after I had first seen it six times that summer (it played on that one screen for the entire summer), I was truly impressed at how it didn't feel dated at all.  It is a testament to Spielberg et al.  Knowing more about films now, my only criticism is not one at all: I wish the movie were longer and especially that there was more intrigue and detective work in Brody discovering what was killing those bathers on Amity Island.  I think it would have made the movie even more phenomenal if there was that element of mystery with Brody offering his theory up against the stonewalling of the mayor and his cronies.  Just a thought, but I think it would have worked without changing the movie...  Regardless, please watch this movie again and pass it on to your next generation!!!	5.0	Still Sharp After All These Years	2011-11-25	0	0	0

For all the &#34;newly restored from original 35mm elements&#34; hype, the 2012 region-1 DVD is significantly blurrier than the 2005 (30th anniversary) region-2 DVD I already owned. The new edition is superficially &#34;cleaner&#34;, yes, but the boosting of contrast and noise reduction resulted in a very noticeable loss of overall detail. The two stars are for the botched new DVD transfer, of course. But this is the product I'm reviewing here. This really should look very different, new &#34;HD&#34; master and all ...And, this is not about the limits of the DVD format either.

This movie is both incredibly dramatic and horrifying and at other times it is just hilarious. I feel the suspense in the opening scene when Chrissie Watkins becomes the first victim in the nude swimmer scene. I feel  the suspense when Charlie falls in the water as him and his buddy use the  wife's holiday roast for bait.(Its also pretty funny too. The chances of that happening are slim-to-none yet the scene was still engaging. I can't  even catch a bluefish offshore with even the most expensive bait. Maybe I  ought to try the holiday roast) The main characters are very well acted by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfus, and Robert Shaw. You really can believe that Roy Sneider is the Average-Joe police chief Martin Brodie and Richard  Dreyfus as Matt Hooper seems to actually possess a great deal of knowledge about sharks.  Robert Shaw as Quint steals the show with hilarious tirades about his fair Spanish Ladies. ""Here lies the body of Marylee; died at the age of 103; kept her virginity til the age of fifteen; not a bad record for this vicinity""(My  absolute favorite Quint line.) Lorraine Gary's (As Brodie's Wife) reaction to Quint was also amusing in that scene. How dare she be disgusted with such hilarity? The  supporting cast was also believable. All the actors were believable for that matter. That makes all the difference in the world in such an unbelievable movie. Good acting can  make the unbelievable actually believable. I thought the twist of irony in Quint's death was engaging because it kind of made him like those that lost their lives on the U.S.S Indianappolis. It was like now he was closer to them somehow. The ending made this movie. From the smile you son of bitch line to the final line of this classic script. The final line is what  explains the purpose of the movie as well. ""To think I used to  hate the water,"" Brodie said. ""I can't imagine why,"" Hooper  answers to close the movie. The movie is about not being afraid of the  water. It is an example of what won't happen in all likelyhood. From the start of the classic score in the opening scene until the final scene this movie is truly a classic in everyway. God bless Spielberg for releasing this sucker in DTS digital surround  on DVD. That's something Mr. Lucas is a long way from doing with any of his Star Wars films."	5.0	A True Classic With A Great Sense of Ironic Humor	2000-05-02	1	1	0

There are many fims over the years I have seen and loved and watch repeatedly but none more than this. This film has it all. Superb acting from the three main actors, Spielberg at his best and a score that defies belief and which has never been bettered. For all the movies I have seen and loved over the years, this is the only one I can remember everything about the day I first went to see it, Queueing around the block at the ABC in Liverpool and panicing as I thought i wasn't going to get in as the cinema was nearly full. Then the feelings during watching the film itself. This is the only film I have seen where the I can remember the audience all standing and cheering at the end when the shark is killed. So what if today the effects look poor. Modern film makers think that horror equals CGI. If you have good graphics, you can get away with anything. They should take note of how the suspense is built in this film despite the way its villain looks. An absolutely perfect film.

So you could understand why no one expected Jaws to be a hit.But it was, becoming the first movie to gross more than $100 million at the box office and firmly cementing Speilberg's place as a filmmaker.  Not only did he create an effective and terrifying tale.  He created a movie that still gives some goosebumps 30 years later.Still as refreshing as the day it was first shown, Jaws is a classic.  The DVD features a two hour making of feature and a few deleted scenes.  It also has a documentary and a few other fun things.  The big draw will be the 60 page Commemorative Booklet.

It is not an all out horror film, not a all out drama, and not even an all out comedy, it's just &quot;Jaws.&quot; A fair adaption from Peter Benchley's terrifying best seller, Jaws was the first of the summer blockbusters, earning $100,000,000 at the box office.  Okay, the effects may not be Lord of the Rings worth, but let's face it, it was 1973.  Other movies previously before Jaws delivered the shock horror value without brilliant effects (example: The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) The film is definately a cinematic classic, with a eye-popping opening, and a edge of your seat ending.

I have throughly enjoyed this movie time after time, in fact, I am watching it right now! This is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion. I STRONGLY suggest for ANYBODY, except children under about 7, to watch this movie. DVD:WONDERFUL VHS:WONDERFUL PERIOD.	5.0	Jaws is one killer shark.	2001-11-09	1	0	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AP0R9UZK7W5UB	Sandra L. Rigas	Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, Jaws centers around the events depicted in Benchley's book where a great white shak terrorizes the beach resort of Amity Island. Its up to local Police Chief Martin Brody, icthyologist Matthew Hooper, and salty shark fisherman Quint to kill the beast. Easily the best shark film ever made, Jaws was a box office blockbuster and placed rightly so on the American Film Institute's 1OO Greatest Movies.In the lead role, Scheider rightly underplays Chief Brody, displaying admirable charisma with a sense of darkness. Richard Dreyfuss brings in much of the film's comedy as a bright but somewhat naive Oceanographic Institute student sent to help deal with the problem. Robert Shaw is simply excellent as Quint, giving off a sense of ruggedness and intimidation. He emits a commanding presence especially during the Indianapolis and courtroom sequences. Lorraine Gary does a fine job as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton portrays stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn just right.Spielberg's direction is excellent, he was snubbed at the 1975 Oscars when he didn't receive a Best Director nomination. The script by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb is occasionally spotty but overall well done. Bill Butler's cinematography is beautiful, it captures the suspense and the terror very well and was suprisingly not nominated at Oscar time. Joe Alves' production design is small-scale but simply brings out the aura of an old-fashioned town like Amity. The soundwork by John Cater and Robert L. Hoyt won the Oscar as well as Verna Fields' sensational editing. I can remember in the documentary in the special edition  saying that the sound crew's boat was sinking once and one of the crew members was yelling to save the equipment.John Williams' music score is one of his best work along with, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Star Wars films, and the Indiana Jones films. It brings out the horror and suspense perfectly while displaying beauty and genius.My favorite scene in the entire movie would have to be the night sequence on the boat with Quint's USS Indianapolis speech, the exchanging of the scars and singing, and the gut-wrenching finale with the shark pounding the boat. The end-shot is beautiful, with the boat silohoutte, the water sparkling, and the music and the shooting star. Overall, Jaws is Spielberg's best film and is my second favorite film of all time. Highly recommended.	5.0	Jaws	2000-11-28	9	7	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A27NTH2Y9DAR31	Schuyler V. Johnson	I saw Jaws when it debuted in 1975 and we were late getting in because of parking issues; however, we made it to the interior and couldn't see to find a seat having just come out of sunlight into dark so we waited and while we were waiting, the opening credits ran, accompanied by that MUSIC.We stood there until the girl had her nighttime encounter with the shark and our knees turned to rubber (sorry, buit the cliche fits) and were thankful when the scene changed to daylight and we could grope our way to our seats.The audience was blown away as were we, and the biggest shocker came when Hooper (Dreyfuss) is taking the tooth off Ben Gardner's boat and that HEAD comes out; everyone shot out of their chairs and screamed; it was and is a truly shocking moment, We are expecting the shark to come from behind Dreyfuss, not for something to pop out of the BOAT so this was brilliant (TY SSpielberg)and the actors are all so good. LOVE Robert Shaw, but as Quint he excels himself and turns in a great performance, esp the relating of the story of the USS Indianapolis. I had never heard of it before and subsuquent research was not only enlightening, it was appalling.Roy Scheider was solid as Brody, a vastly different interpretation from that in the book, thankfully, and Lorraine Gary was wonderful as Mrs Brody.The quality is superb, better than I've ever seen, but the real value here is the extras, notably the Making of, which is the best I have ever seen on any disc of any moive; this was almost as riveting as the movie itself. It is quite lengthy and provides many fascinating factoids and gives a new light and dimension to the movie. HIGHLY recommend.God Bless and RIP Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw, and TY for so many excellent performances.	5.0	A CLASSIC WITH EXTRAS	2008-05-28	2	2	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A158FT94CJNGRO	Scott Lester	What can a person say when he is confronted with the incedible task of reviewing one of the most influential movies of all time. To this day Jaws is leading cause of the fear of sharks. Openly displaying a man eating killing machine that seems overwhelmingly impossible to defeat. Robotical tricks crafted by the movie master, Steven Speilberg, bring Jaws side by side with Star Wars.Amity island was a peaceful summertime island until a girl was lost underwater late at night. And then a dog went, and then a boy, until the shark had become a major problem for the mayor and the town. Amity lived off the summer tourists coming to the beach, but without the beach Amity wasn't much. As I said the mayor was anxious to quickly disperse this problem as quietly as possible. Offering a hefty payout, Amity recruited a solo shark hunter (Shaw) and a marine expert (Dreyfuss), and the town police chief tagged along for the ride.A stellar preformance was delivered by each and every cast member on board. The music is truly one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard come out of a movie. A familiar name comes to mind with these marvelous compositions, Jon Williams. Jaws has lived through 2 and 1/2 decades as one of the leading movies of all time, I am overwhelmingly confident that it will continue to shine bright as the ultimate showcase for Steven Spielberg's incredible talent.	5.0	Speechless....	2002-04-15	3	2	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1J03J0HZ7KU5T	Scott T. Rivers	"When future generations examine the Steven Spielberg canon, three motion pictures will stand out: ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""E.T."" (1982) and ""Jaws"" (1975), the director's breakthrough thriller. More than 30 years later, the film remains a textbook example of storytelling and characterization - somehow managing to transcend Peter Benchley's source material. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss make a formidable ensemble while Spielberg keeps a tight grip on the watery suspense. No matter how many times you see it, ""Jaws"" still packs a powerful cinematic punch. Far superior to the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster."	5.0	Spielberg at His Absolute Best	2008-11-17	4	4	0

What's the point in me going in to detail about other scenes?It would spoil your'e enjoyment of what must be,one of the greatest films of all time.In addition,this Universal DVD presents Jaws in it's original aspect ratio (2.35:1),and because the full width can now be seen,greater detail is visible.The actual picture ranges from sharp to extremely sharp-the daylight boat scenes look exceptionally clear.The Dolby Digital 5.1 track on this DVD,is,in a word,awesome.That classic,haunting Jaws theme is re-produced crystal clear.Great film,great extras,great everything.To date,one of the best DVD's out there.	5.0	A rare,lasting quality.	2001-04-26	0	0	0

After several deaths, Brody, Ahab fisherman captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and icthyoligist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) head out to kill the murderous white pointer.This movie ROCKS!!!! It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I love this movie because of the unbearable suspense and excitement it causes.  The gore is rather grisly, but that's the main part of it!  To scare the hell outta ya!  There are some scenes that make you jump and cringe, but that's the fun of it!The only bad thing about it is the shark looks ocassionally fake, but that doesn't matter.  This movie is, on my behalf, almost perfect.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A39MRCY591HIHB	"Sean Lehman ""Sean Lehman"""	When reading all these reviews the first thing you should note is that Amazon has for some reason combined comments for previous releases of this movie with the new 2012 Universal's 100th Anniversary Release.  Many of the comments you see here are actually for an older release which is not very smart of Amazon.The 2012 release on Blu-ray is excellent.  It has to be one of the best transitions to Blu-ray from an older movie that I've seen.  It also comes with a DVD version which I have not looked at.  How it compares to previous releases I'm not sure.  It is my understanding though that this is the first Blu-ray release and it appears to be of Blu-ray quality, not just an older DVD version slapped on to Blu-ray.  I'm not sure how the extras compare to previous releases.  It could possibly have some of the same extra's.If you don't already have this movie on Blu-ray then get it.  If you have an older copy of this movie on VHS or Beta then definitely get this.  Even if you have an older DVD copy of this, the Blu-ray is beautiful so get it.  If you have already gone and bought a million upgrades to this movie and are tired of spending money on new releases then no one is forcing you to get it.  It is however worth getting if you are not satisfied with your older copy.	5.0	Jaws (2012 Blu-ray version)	2012-08-17	6	2	4
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1EUFMNIC40BFL	"""serpico1000"""	Jaws is a lot more than just a premeditating-psycho-shark-movie. it is a beautifully made piece of cinema and a great story. Essentially, for those few who don't know, a great white shark of mammoth proportions is eating  residents of and visitors to the little holiday island of Amity. Three men  climb on board a boat and set of to kill it. And thats about it... on the  surface. Actually the three men are three broadly defined examples of men  in general, a cross-section of western society. Quint is the physical,  working class man. Hooper is the intellectual, softer, upperclass variety  and Chief Brody is the everyman, some brains, some brawn.  Together they  must defeat this abomination of nature. The shark doesn't quite match up to  todays computer generated effects but this films so good you won't care and  I assure you you will jump once or twice and it will by the end be real  enough for you to not want to be there in the movie with them. Its even got  a good sense of humour and the music by speilberg regular John Williams is  just first rate. There isn't much left to be said except that this was the  worlds first real summer blockbuster and it is stiil as much fun to watch  today as it must have been in 1975. Jaws is a remarkable film whose stature  and reputation have been marred by a plethora of poor sequels.

Whether this is true or not this film is amazing.  If the tension and horror in this movie is done by accident, then you would have to imagine what can be done on purpose.  The fact that you don't even see the shark until the last 30 minutes of the film is ingenious.  All the performances are unforgetable.  Robert Shaw's speech is one of the greatest deliveries ever captured on film.  The documentary on this DVD is very good and covers everything during production, check it out.

First, this newest edition has more than just a couple of features not found on the 25th Anniversary Edition. The original sound mix is worth buying it! 5.1 Surround Sound isn't always the best way to watch a movie, especially one that wasn't recorded in that format to begin with!Second, is somebody holding a gun to these reviewer's heads to make them buy this edition?? If you are that miffed about the newest edition, then DON'T buy it! As far as spending the money, I don't think it's such a bad investment to pay 14.00 (Walmart's price) every five years for a classic movie, even if it only has a few new additions to it. I thought the booklet that was included was very ""special"" and worth the price alone.So...if you are having a heartattack over the 30th Anniversary Edition, just keep on walking when you see it on the store shelves. Universal won't miss your money.p.s. How great will the JAWS Unleashed videogame be??!!!

I have to hand it to the production team for their role in planning the sequences.It tells the story of three men, hunting a great white that terrorizes the swimmers and people of a quiet beach town in New England and of the tourists coming to celebrate 4th of July.Some of my favorite were1. ""We're gonna need a bigger boat""2. ""farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies..""3. ""Hooper, stop playing with yourself""!4. Scene, when the Chief is shovelling the meat into the water and when he turns to look and talk to Quint, the Shark emerges from the water.5. The reflections of the ocean water against the glass of the captain's cabin6. The shot of the feet of the three people when they cross the boat along the sides.7. Quint's monologue on the USS Indianapolis.8. ""Smile you sonuvab***h""!But the best part was the award winning score by John Williams, becoming a part of pop culture in reference to any shark or animal stealth attack.I cannot think of any person who has not seen it and very few who do not own it in their collection.This is termed as a ""classic"" , no uneccessary adjectives or anything, just a classic"	5.0	"""We're gonna need a bigger boat""....."	2008-04-15	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1OOYXSUI4Z943	"""sideshowmatthew"""	"""Jaws"" is a classic masterpiece about an ominous great white shark that attacks unsuspecting beach-goers at Amity Island. Chief Brody thinks it is wrong to keep the beach open while a shark is in the vecinity, but the mayor doesn't want to shut the beach down. Brody embarks on a journey with an experienced seaman and a shark expert to destroy the evil shark once and for all. This film is filled with suspense, action, and horror. Of course, it itsn't the scariest movie, since special effects are far superior nowadays, but it is still quite horrific hearing the terrified scream of the first victim in the dark, eerie night, or seeing the shark swimming towards Brody, ready for his next meal. The real nail-biter of the story is the suspenseful and haunting score. Spielberg is a marvelous director! I definately recommend this film for horror and suspense fans.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A13IKSGDYNBNQS	S J Buck	This film invented the Summer blockbuster, however unlike some that have followed this is a classic movie. Directed by Spielberg and with a fantastic cast, how could it go wrong? What we tend to forget now, is that Spielberg in 1975 hadn't had a blockbuster yet, so this was not a dead cert for success. However I think word of mouth and the quality of the film soon guarenteed its place in history.Roy Scheider is the Police Chief who's convinced there is something in the water, but is confronted by town officials only interested in not spoiling the tourist season. Scheider gives us a quietly determined man, whereas Robert Shaw's performance as Quint, a grizzled fisherman, is loud, aggresive and energetic. Richard Dreyfuss completes a great trio of leading actors. The mixed chemistry between them is perhaps the strongest point in the film.The film won 3 Oscars, most noteably of course for John Williams evocative music score (which also won a BAFTA as well). If you weren't born in the 70's, the DVD gives you the chance to see a great film in widescreen 2.35:1 with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, which will be somewhat better than seeing the panned and scanned version frequently shown by many channels.

Jaws is a movie that no one will ever forget. For a 1975 movie, Jaws still remains a classic. What a great movie for the decade. As many times as I've seen Jaws, if I see it playing on t.v., I can't help but watch it again. Great acting, great special effects, great writing, great everything. There are not many movies that people talk about 31 years later, but Jaws is one of them! There are sequels to this classic but none of them can beat the original Jaws....... the movie that made you scared to go into the water!!! Excellent movie!!!!	5.0	A True Classic!!	2006-03-03	2	2	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3T76K4CI7RSDD	S. Miller	Why Jaws is a study in perfect storytelling:1. It's paced to perfection.(You can't take your eyes off it for the duration)2. It makes you care about the characters and their predicaments.(an art almost abandoned in filmaking these days)3. It's a thriller first & a monster movie second.(If they can scare you with a big rubber shark then it has to be)4. It has countless memorable moments(pick your own favourite)5. Half the dialogue is quotable / memorable(ditto)6. It set the bar for all subsequent blockbuster films (it was the first after all), few of which have even come close to matching it for entertainment value.7. It has a beginning, a middle and an end.(Beginning  - Is there a Shark out there or not? , Middle - The Shark's coming to get you!/Let's get the Shark , End - Confrontation with Shark & Resolution)8. The roles are well conceived and have character depth, and the acting is first rate.9. It is believable as a story.Many people point out just how bad the sequels were. Let's face it, the concept of a sequel to Jaws is a non-starter anyway. However, I would like to recommend that you see the third Jaws sequel, entitled Jaws the Revenge. Why? Because it is a perfect example of what happens when you remove / do the opposite of all the the above points in making a film. It is remarkable it that it manages to do this, and just has to be seen if purely as a comparison to Jaws.To explain, Jaws the Revenge is:1. Paced to ensure that you lose interest within the first five minutes.(You can't stop taking your eyes off it)2. Not only do you NOT care for the characters, but by the end of the film, you're actively rooting for the bloody shark!!)3. It's not a thriller or a monster movie. It appears to think it's a geriatric romance addressing family dysfunction, peppered with scenes involving rubber sharks doing acrobatics and leaning on boats.4. It has no memorable moments apart from the end when the Shark expolodes for no apparent reason (really!)5. The dialogue is banal and largely irrelevant to the plot(!?)6. It set the bar for awful awful films7. It has a beginning and then just meanders until its time to finish the film with the worst ending of any film you will ever see.(Beginning  - There's a Rubber shark out there! , Middle - A series of unconnected and boring events to pad out the 87 minutes running time  , End - Confrontation between Rubber Shark and crap actress ends in hilarity!8. The roles are conceived in the pub on the back of a fag packet and are all badly acted except that of Ellen Brody, which is overacted.9. It's insulting to the intelligence as a story, is illogical and has the largest plot holes of any film i've ever seen.Comparing the two should be done, as it makes you appreciate Jaws as a fine film, and also shows you the depths to which Hollywood sunk in it's wake.	5.0	A study in perfect storytelling	2004-04-21	0	0	0

For anybody who loves Jaws, then this blu ray is amust buy. And of course if you have a BD player. This blu ray is set to come with a boat load of bonus material (including some of my personal favorites The Shark is Still Working and the Making of Jaws.)I am furious that they only included the 1 hour and 40 minute version of The Shark is Still Working instead of the 3 hour version. I think universal wants to make a lot of dough so they keep holding back the longer better version of the shark is still working. But you know who am I to say they won't in the future, hopefully they do. Anyway, since they restored the film I think everyone should check out the Jaws the restoration 9 minute documentary in which they give an in depth process on the restoration of Jaws. Many people will want this blu ray so I pre ordered mine yesterday. This ""New"" ""Cleaner"" version of Jaws is supposed to be enhanced by the HD blu ray and have a 7.1 mono mix. Now isn't that exciting. This new Jaws be like watching a fresh new print so crystal clear it will be like picture for today's movie standards. Now, don't get me wrong Jaws could never have been a movie approved in this day and age because the special effects weren't that great compared to today's CGI crap. That is what makes Jaws a great classic. It was made in an age where there was no CGI and that's what made movies wholesome and great to watch back in the day. But, anyway, Jaws has held up all these years because it tapped into people's fears and made them scared of the water and sharks.It really was known to be the title that was first called ""The Summer Blockbuster."" The actors also give amazing performances and put all there hard efforts in to this film and making you believe that there is a dangerous shark that is out there killing people and the shark has to be killed. Hollywood better not ruin this movie by doing a remake because you cannot remake Jaws and have a good outcome on the people. People have been inspired by this movie to study sharks, go into the movie business, and even become film makers because of this one great, scary, and glorious classic movie.

This one, while not a particularly scary movie, is suspenseful and filled with great characters who acted very well by this cast. JAWS is one of those movies that I see audiences enjoying for a few more decades because of the solid writing and the restraint to use special effect in the mid 70's. A great movie that if you haven't seen it, you will understand why it is so beloved.

It also includes the original Mono Soundtrack, which was what it sounded like in theaters.Picture Quality is the same, but that is not a bad thing because it is quite clear.Special FeaturesEverything is the same except for the documentryIn the 25th Anniversary DVD we got a 50 minute Documentry, in the 30th Anniversary DVD we get a 2 hour documentry, it's the same documentry but with an extra hour and 10 minutes.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AAS25PZSI4N29	Stephen M. Glaister	"A beautiful dvd version of both the image and the sound clarifies what's great about the film.  Jaws hit like a bomb in 1975 because it's the perfect fusion of old-style Hollywood suspense story-telling (with Hitchcock's Birds and Psycho being important models - e.g. the opening scene with the nightswimming gal combines elements of Psycho's shower scene with Tippi Hedren's ""trapped in the upstairs bedroom"" scene from the Birds) and all the new ideas flowing in from Altman and others.  The overlapping dialogue in and apparently loose framing of various early town and pier scenes really anchors the whole tale in (something like) reality, and it's pure Altman.  Great.  The other tellingly (then) new  Hollywood thing is just how much of Jaws was shot on location (which is usefully clarified by the ""Making of"" extra).  Where Hitchcock would have shot, say, the beach scenes in a studio.... here the Easy Rider ethos of just getting out on location rules.  And yet DP Bill Butler and Spielberg get control over the frame and color, e.g., while shooting from the water-line a hundred yards off-shore, that Hitchcock would have been proud of.  Genius.  And finally, obviously there's *that* score by John Williams.Jaws was a film that changed the game in Hollywood but not always in good ways or for the right reasons - I've heard Alan Rudolph say (with some plausibility) that Jaws killed off dialogue in American movies: that Jaws ""ate the words"".  This dvd clarifies that for all its regrettable influence, Jaws itself is nearly perfect, and will for all sorts of good reasons be watched and studied for as long as people still like to watch films or aspire to make films themselves."	5.0	Why this movie is so good	2004-01-03	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AI0MXXUR866II	Stephen Pospisil	A rare movie indeed, suprassing not only the original novel by Benchly, but also the rocky beginning it suffered.At first, this tale of a Long Island town terrorized by a great white shark had about as much chance as  making it to the screen as an action thriller starring Barney.The  floppy, original mechanical shark suffered serious flaws during the  production of the film, resulting in a number of scenes that came out,  well, pathetic. Spielberg and crew feared the movie would wind up campy and  distorted and the areas that were meant to be a character study (the entire  second half of the movie) would be broken apart by a humorously obscure  chunk of floundering rubber meant to resemble a shark.How did this  movie finally make it to the screen then? How did it turn out so crowd  pleasing and simply terrific? Most credit the great editor Verna Fields  (who passed on not too long ago if I remember, a tragedy) with its  stupendous results, having carefully gone through and scrutinized the movie  for quit sometime, removing every scene that held it back and forcing the  re-shooting of others.An example of her work can be noticed at one of  the more elaborate attacks, where the shark decides to take a bight out of  Shaw's rickety old ship. In the original takes, too much of the shark came  above water, revealing serious flaws in its design, including tears in the  rubber and bent metals.Whatever troubles this movie was forced to  undergo (including the studio's initial hatred of it), it finally erupted  onto the big screen, and became an immediate classic. Held up by strong  peformances from Schnieder, Dreyfuss, and an exception Shaw, as well as  clever dialogue and a unique usage of camera angles, Jaws defies its  original horrid pretense and instead blossoms in the American film history.  A rare breed of film is this, one to be collected and admired for years to  come.	5.0	Defying A Rocky Foundation	2000-05-02	1	1	0
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1FNES0QEBJZD1	Steve Douglas	Okay, here we have a film released in 1975 that scared the pants off of me and made me jump out of my seat, completely blowing my cool in front of a 1st date.  Amazed that she hung around for a 2nd date.  I have the previously released Jaws on Standard Def with DTS 5.1 audio which I thought was pretty decent.I guess I didn't know what I was missing and though it went against my frugal nature, I paid full pop for this new Blu Ray release.  The video transfer to Blu Ray is just about the best you can or will find anywhere and is completely demo worthy.  The details in each frame, the coloration of the entire movie are totally outstanding.  Even the extra which documents the reproduction of Jaws onto Blu Ray was interesting and informative.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, making of and many more extras are included.  A DVD SD copy is included which I haven't viewed and probably will not though I am sure the color correction and clarity are probably amazing for Standard Def fans.The audio is now DTS 7.1 and though some might disagree,  I would not say that the audio is demo worthy for anything other than excellent clarity and a broad soundstage across the front 3 channels.  Except for the underwater scenes and a few other foley effects, the rear surrounds are not really used very much as discreet channels.  The chaos on the beach could have easily used the rear channels some more,  Never the less, Universal wanted to stay true to the original release and I understand why the rears were not employed very often.  I am just saying that if I want to show off the audio section of my home theater, I would not use this release.  My home theater is fairly esoteric and hi end and audio is something I am always aware of.In some ways, Universal has cut its own throat.  If they can reproduce such an old movie resulting in a film better seen on this release than they saw originally in the theaters, then there is no excuse for such sloppy releases of old movies that are being  transferred to Blu Ray.  Universal.....if you can do it here, you can do it for any of your films.A great release, a must release.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks	5.0	Jaws Universal 100th Anniversary on Blu Ray	2012-08-18	4	3	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A12A8LU93A132U	Steve	This DVD is a decently produced collector's edition DVD.  The extras are fairly good, but not great.  The bonus materials include an hour long documentary that is very good with some recent interviews with the major players.  The deleted scenes weren't very interesting, mainly consisting of family scenes with Scheider's character.  The outtakes include one where a close-up of Scheider where his handgun keeps jamming and another with Shaw's character where he spits fake blood in his eye.  Both are not very interesting or funny.  The trivia game consists of 12 questions with clues available by jumping to the relevant scenes.  Not very interesting or fun since once you do answer them, then what?  The production photos were mostly in black-in-white and I never find these interesting, especially the case here where most of the photos are black-in-white.  I did find the storyboards interesting, not usually the case, because they consisted of scenes that were never shot or changed in the film. Most of the storyboards were scenes in the book that weren't in the film. Finally a few paragraphs on sharks, the production and cast are included that could have been excluded and not missed.  I got this movie in my collection because I remember that as a kid it scared me silly.  Now the shark looks really fake and it's not as scary, but the video is good and sound adequate for such and old film. Worth having in your collection if you like the movie or for nostalgic reasons.	3.0	A DVD review	2000-10-02	1	0	1

Anyway, the excellent transfer on this movie has to be seen to be believed.  I can tell that Universal spared no expense in restoring this movie.  It was worth it.  I really hope this movie continues to attract audiences, both new and old.  Believe it or not, Jaws still reminds me that shark attacks can and will happen and nobody is immune, not even Quint.  I will never forget his last stand when he met his match with the great white shark.  That scene makes me cringe every time I watch it.  I admire the painstaking effort of the cast and crew that went into the making of this movie and I especially applaud Steven Spielberg for sticking his neck out and making movies like this one and Saving Private Ryan.  This movie was the first summer blockbuster and it's in a league of its own.  Kudos to Universal for releasing such a mint copy of the film with extra features.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2RHQMV5GD18Z8	Steven Aldersley	Jaws (1975)Thriller, 124 minutesDirected by Steven SpielbergStarring Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and Robert ShawAs I continue working on this 100 movies project, I am realizing that my tastes are all over the map. It ranges from 50's black and white dramas set in one room, to foreign language films, to recent blockbusters. In a way, I'm happy to find that I'm open to all types of film. Today's entry falls into the blockbuster category and was the highest-grossing movie ever made in its day.I remember a conversation with friends when I was 13 telling me that I had to see Jaws. They talked about the shark more than anything, and people being torn apart. I caved and ended up seeing the movie and then I read the book. There are plenty of people who have never lost that fascination for deadly creatures. Would we have Shark Week without Jaws? Why do we want to watch such a creature?Actually, that's not why I like Jaws.Jaws works for me because of the quality of the acting and the suspense created by wondering where the shark will strike next. The first hour of the movie sets everything up. Although there's nothing particularly bad about the first half, it's far from remarkable. We see a few attacks and meet the main characters.Chief Brody (Scheider) is my favorite character. He's intelligent, sensible, practical and calm under pressure. Hooper (Dreyfuss) is a marine biologist who thinks the problem can be solved through the use of modern equipment. The most colorful character is Quint (Shaw), who is experienced and outspoken. This group ends up tracking the shark on Quint's boat and it's here that the movie really takes off.The movie was made at a time when special effects had to be created by using models and machines rather than CGI, so the shark doesn't look at all realistic by modern standards. Spielberg did his best to overcome those limitations by showing the creature as little as possible. We are shown the attacks, but the camera focuses on the victim rather than dwelling on the shark itself. The fear exists in our minds and we fill in the gaps.The best scene in the movie takes place on the boat. All three men are drinking. Hooper and Quint begin showing each other their scars. It's a moment of release and humor while they wait for the shark to appear. Brody looks bemused by the whole exchange, but it's clear that the group is bonding. In a lesser movie, all we would see is action and more frequent and bloodier attacks.Another thing which should be mentioned is the music. John Williams created such a simple score, and yet we will never forget those two notes every time the shark is poised to attack. How often has it been used over the years, I wonder? The movie picked up two Oscars in the technical categories, and also won for Best Original Score.Jaws deserves its place in movie history. I hope nobody ever suggests remaking it to update the effects. The plot is simple and predictable, but the execution is superb.	5.0	We're gonna need a bigger boat	2012-02-29	7	6	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AHNT97DWEAQUY	"Sumbudy ""buriedatlantis"""	Forget Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers or even that Scream guy.  This is the movie that scared the pants off me as a child.  I used to absolutely hate watching horror movies or any other movie that would scare me, but Jaws was so good that it was the only one that I would watch.  Back then, all I knew was that it was scary.  Now, I have a better understanding of WHY it's scary.  The way Spielberg stages the shark attacks, John Williams score announcing the approach of the shark, the fact that you care for the characters.Another thing I notice now that I didn't notice when I was little, is the great chemistry between the three leads.  These are three TOTALLY different characters drawn together by this, and it's fun watching them interact.  Brody, the police chief that's scared to death of the water, yet lives on an island. Hooper, who studies the inhabitants of the ocean and is bent on understanding this shark.  And finally, Quint, the rough and tumble shark hunter who's a bit off his rocker.  Watching these three together is magic, and it keeps this movie from being yet another &quot;people get eaten by monster&quot; flicks.  But as a &quot;people get eaten by monster&quot; flick, this is undoubtably the best.  This and Jurassic Park are the top two in that catagory and it's no shocker that they both florish under the magic touch of Spielberg.  Really, there's not a whole lot to say about the movie besides the great direction, great scares, great acting and the classic score, so let's move on to the DVD, and how does it measure up.Measures up pretty dang good, if you ask me.  I'm loving these hour long documentaries on the last couple of Spielberg discs.  This one is way informative about all aspects of production with interviews with the producers, actors, production designers, shark photographers, and Spielberg himself, this baby lets you in on the trials that went down to make this movie.  A couple of outtakes and deleted scenes are also in there, along with trailers and a trivia game, with some DVD Rom features.  These are all worthy.The only thing that's missing from this is, as with all Spielberg's films, a DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY!!!  By danggit, we better get one if the Indy Jones flicks make it to DVD.But all in all, this is a more than excellent feature to add to your DVD selection, if only to see the movie in DVD glory.	5.0	Go ahead.

I finally watched it this week and though the movie did make me jump a couple of times  the images of blood and guts are about the same if not milder than what you would see on a typical CSI episode.  The film is a true landmark in the horror genre  mostly because the three main characters (the marine biologist, the police chief and the shark hunter) are so well developed with complete back stories and very well portrayed by fine actors.  The plot of the story is rich in themes that go well beyond the man vs giant toothy sea monster we usually think of when someone mentions the film JAWS or hums the trademark theme song.  JAWS has truly earned a lasting position in our popular culture.	5.0	Classic Suspense Flick That Should Be Seen By All Movie Lovers	2008-06-06	2	2	0

Twenty-five years later, this classic among classics retains its thrilling charm and status as a true (among other things) nail biter!  Funny now to know that the technical crew was often so frustrated because the mechanical shark worked only intermitently.  The DVD is over-rated but NOT the movie.

For the most part, DVD's are so inexpensive now (the new Special Edition 30th Anniversary of Jaws is only $16.99 at Amazon) that they're practically throw-aways after a couple of years (when the newer special edition comes out).

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F	"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard"""	"""Jaws"" was really the first Hollywood film that started the tradition of Hollywood releasing blockbuster movies during the summer. The film, as many know, is about a great white shark terrorizing a seaside community in Cape Cod, and its up to the police chief, Sheriff Brody, played by Roy Scheider, to stop the killings and destroy the shark.I first saw this movie on television in the late '70s, and it terrified me to the point of not be able to sleep for nights, so I wouldn't recommend it to children under 12 because the film is extremely graphic for its time. It is however an excellent film in the horror genre.Steven Speilberg had his first hit as a director of this film, and it would be his work on ""Jaws"" that brought him to the attention of other movie studios. The haunting theme music, composed by John Willimas, still remains the most chilling movie theme in history, and it won Williams an Oscar for Best Original Music for a film.""Jaws"" is also one of those rare Hollywood films that made the cover of ""Time"" magazine in 1975. It became a worldwide phenomenon and made millions at the boxoffice. It stayed in the Top 10 of the highest making films until 1997, when ""Titanic"" became the biggest grosser.There have been many sequels to this blockbuster, but only one is worth watching and buying: ""Jaws 2"", released in 1978. Nowhere near as great as the original, ""Jaws 2"" is a worthy sequel, also starring Scheider. Forget about all the other ""Jaws"" films out there: they are cheaply produced and horribly written and directed.This DVD comes with a ton of bonuses, but the jewel here is the documentary on the film, with neat info and great anecdotes."	5.0	"""Jaws Is A Blockbuster"""	2009-04-23	1	1	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1WPYY2XLOKAT8	The Completist	"The Blu-ray transfer of JAWS is nothing less than astounding. There are shots so crisp and clear they look like they were shot with a RED Epic last year. I can actually read the labels on the bottles of the medical examiner's office. This title easily competes with the magnificent Blu-ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR and THE SHINING as one of the best possible Blu-ray transfers of all time. It's even better than THE GODFATHER and CHINATOWN Blu-rays, which were slightly softer from age. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE: a few occasions where the shot is underlit, the grain has a strange fuzzy texture to it, but only in a handful of shots where the camera is shooting with conflicting brightness (the coroner's office when Hooper says ""Well this is not a boat accident!"" is the best example). Otherwise, night, day, exterior and interior shots are exactly as they should be.The film gets 6 stars in my book. The supplementals...not so much.The supplementals are mostly upscaled transfers from previous editions, and all with subtitles, so there's that. Unfortunately, aside from the 9-minute Restoration Process vignette, there's not much to get excited about. None of the other extensive documentaries--not even the 2011 History Channel restrospective--is included.The most painful part of this Blu-ray is the TREMENDOUS LETDOWN that is THE SHARK IS STILL WORKING documentary. After 7+ years of tireless, dedicated work by true hardcore JAWS fans that put ME to shame, the original 180+ minute cut that covered the vast cult of JAWS fans worldwide is a mere 100-minute History Channel-esque series of vignettes that merely grazes the larger picture. Some vignettes are better than others, but scores of material that has been available on the Internet for years during the assemblage is completely absent. I think that Universal has meddled too heavily in the final product. Perhaps the most painful thing of all is that this intended monument to the cult of JAWS borne out of true love for the film is a highly compressed upscaled 360p-480p mess. The resolution is barely better than the quality of the outtakes/deleted scenes. I was deeply hurt and disappointed by how this film has been treated.And all these supplementals are crammed onto the same disc as the film. So that means that the additional 25GB that could have been dedicated to more glorious image & sound data is instead dedicated to squishing a handful of RE-RE-REpackaged supplementals that were thrown in there with the care of a used towel. With all the extra stuff about JAWS made over the years, a bonus BD-50 containing them would not have been much to ask.Overall, the Blu-ray is worth buying because the movie transfer is so fantastic I can't give it anything less than 5 stars. Unfortunately, the disc itself is so callously indifferent to the fanbase and collector potential of the film that it gets a paltry 3 stars.That brings it up to the 4 you see above."	4.0	Magnificent Picture...but Shafted Supplementals	2005-06-16	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2J00K3J9KPQD3	The Dread Pirate Pastor Muppets	"Alfred Hitchcock once said ""blondes make the best victims. They're like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints."" Think for a minute about arguably the most famous females in Hitchcock's films: Marion Crane in Psycho and Madeline Elster in Vertigo. They're both blonde, and they both suffer terrible fates. Steven Spielberg was obviously influenced by these two films, and the proof lies in the fact that his first victim in Jaws is also a blonde young woman.This is the most Hitchcock-esque of Spielberg's films, and arguably it's also his best motion picture. Famously, it is often acclaimed and sometimes blamed, along with Star Wars, as the death of ambitious American filmmaking. Is this the case? Or did Spielberg and George Lucas see to re-invent ambitious American filmmaking in the form of a summer blockbuster?Although there are a handful of great blockbuster films, Jaws is arguably the greatest. It is greatly supported by its three lead actors, it showcases some of the finest editing in a motion picture, and it has a score that, according to Spielberg, is the reason for half the film's success.Based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same name, a shark is violently harassing Amity Island, and kills two people before the mayor of the town decides to do anything about it (he claims he doesn't want to close the beach on the Fourth of July weekend). Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), the chief of police, is appalled that the beaches weren't closed immediately after the first victim.His luck turns when a Marine biologist called Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) shows up to investigate. A great white shark is identified as the underwater devil, and when it has its share of a third victim, the mayor finally gives in: he closes the beaches and allows for an expedition to kill the shark, which is undergone by Brody, Hooper, and a professional shark hunter called Quint (Robert Shaw).Some of the power of Jaws lies in the relationship between the three men: Quint is stuck up and proud, while Hooper takes many pre-cautions and will hardly crack a joke. Their personalities clash, and had it not been for Brody simply being there, the shark might have killed both of them. Brody is the man standing in between them, the one that holds everything together. And what also makes this trio work is the character acting, as this has perhaps the strongest acting of any of Spielberg's films.It would also help that Jaws has a really strong screenplay. It is not Sunset Blvd. to be sure, but it has perhaps the most accomplished dialogue and character dynamics of any blockbuster film. Every character that needs to be strong is strong, and Spielberg's direction is intense and heightens an already great experience. And the pacing is excellent, clearly the best in a blockbuster film. There is almost no delay, and the first two attacks come swiftly and then almost evaporate. It shows off what a phenomenal director Spielberg was, and it shames all blockbusters made today.Another lift from Hitchcock is the dolly zoom effect. In Vertigo, it is used to show Scottie's acrophobia. In Jaws, it is used almost as brilliantly: when another shark attack occurs in the broad daylight, the effect is utilized in a close-up on Brody's face for reasons of fear after a wonderfully suspenseful buildup. (Disney would also use this in The Lion King for the stampede sequence.)The third lift from Hitchcock is the scene in which we see the shark for the first time: up until about the last 20 minutes or so, Spielberg only shows the shark's point of view or a few fins. But when all is calm and Brody is making a joke aboard the boat, the shark appears for about a split second in all of its glory, prompting the film's most famous line: ""You're gonna need a bigger boat."" And for the benefit, this is continued until the climax, where the shark is exploited and we already know how much of a threat it is.The facts are these: the shooting schedule was only supposed to be 55 days, and filming concluded after 159 days. Imagine what editor Verna Fields had to deal with, having so much footage to put together into a two-hour motion picture. Her work was honored with an Oscar for Best Film Editing, and that is a sign of where the Academy made the right decision.Then we have the score, and this is (at least the argument I'd make) the film's most valuable aspect: this was the first of many amazing scores that John Williams would write (the long list includes Star Wars, Superman, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., and Return of the Jedi). To say it's one of his three best scores is the equivalent of calling Hamlet one of Shakespeare's three best plays: an honor that is not to be taken lightly. The dissonance in the main theme of a minor second (E and F) creates as much disturbance as the shrilling strings in the music that supports the shower murder in Psycho. And the interval is played on exactly the right instruments (basses and cellos, if I'm correct, and as the music intensifies, it is also played on violins, violas, and at the end, trumpets).Often times, Spielberg is criticized for sentimentality. There is no such thing as sentimentality in Jaws, and one of the reasons is because this is not a fantasy. In the trailer, one of the taglines is ""none of man's fantasies can compare with the reality of Jaws."" In this film, there is no sugary treatment, and that's what separates it from the rest of Spielberg's works: it is the epitome of his action/adventure films, and it is his best film because it plays out like the most real adventure of all time.Still the question stands, though: did Jaws and Star Wars destroy great American filmmaking? I would say no, particularly in the case of the former. And the main reason is because all of the elements of the film, especially in the screenplay, are handled with such care, and a good screenplay is seldom seen in today's blockbusters. Both films shed light on a new opportunity for filmmakers, but most of the care is in the action: it can be frivolous and big, but there must be something justifying it. In the cases of Jaws and Star Wars, there was absolutely more than one thing justifying action and visual effects."	5.0	A masterpiece, quite simply	2013-04-01	2	2	0

The tail...., the whole damn thing.""- Captain Quint gives a hint at what will be the daily special at the Amity Fish Market the day after he catches ""Jaws""Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, ""Jaws"" has the small coastal community of Amity under siege by a great white shark feeding off of swimmers, & boaters alike. Its up to the town's Chief Of Police (who's afraid of the water), an ictheoligst, & a modernday Ahab to take down the shark.First off, I will always give ""Jaws"" its much deserved five star rating (hence the rating above). Its still, after thirty years, one of Steven Spielberg's best films.What I don't condone is what ""Universal"" & for that matter, all home video companies are doing with there titles. Basically, taking great movies and releasing them every other year, on DVD, in different packaging, telling the consumer of the new features when their aren't any. It sucks, its false advertising, & its some sort of prostitution. As a consumer & film buff this is bulls*it, plain and simple (the latest release to ""First Blood"" is also a good example).The new 30th Anninversary two disc release to ""Jaws"" should have been retitled ""Flaws"" because ""Universal"" can't seem to get all the material on one film together in a definitive & final edition.Disc one has the film in all its glory with the exact same ""interactive"" menu from the 25th anniversary edition. All the audio tracks are here with Dolby Digital 5.1, 2.0 Mono (people actually wanted this!), & DTS 5.1 (the DTS track was sold seperatly last time. Assinine, right?). The film is the same transfer as the previous release & still looks good.Disc two is where the real problems lie. The menu isn't ""interactive"" (no movement at all) with the sound of the ocean & seagulls playing on the audio track (this is really cheesy).The complete unabridged documentary is finally released & it is good. The problem here, is that the documentary is from the 1995 special edition laserdisc release to ""Jaws"". Thats right this documentary is ten f*c*ing years old! This is pathetic, because at the recent ""Jaws-fest"", to celebrate the film, Peter Benchley, Carl Gottlieb, & others gave interviews during the festivities, & they look different then they did 15 years ago.  The deleted scenes are included & are the same as the previous release. The trailers & the trivia game are gone (these were cool features, & I truly can't understand why they were omitted).The new nine minute featurette that was newly discovered in England is nothing to write home about, but, I think, this is the only behind the scenes footage that might exist to ""Jaws"".The packaging is even the same as the 25th anniversary release with a few changes. The slipsleeve & coverart has a black foreground & has a photo-journal that contains photos & quotes from the film. The artwork isn't even the same as the artwork from the classic one-sheet to ""Jaws"".If you don't have this in your DVD collection, get the 25th Anniversary Edition. That has a bit more bite to it. As for this edition, stay away from these waters."	5.0	"30th Anniversary Edition of ""Jaws"" Is All Gums - Stay With The Previous Release"	2005-07-01	10	7	3
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3AUECYM0M0YSX	The Man in the Hathaway Shirt	It almost feels pointless to review the movie here: unless you've been living on Neptune for the past 25 years you've probably seen it, probably can quote lines from it, probably know it inside-out. And that's why I'm partly annoyed by this new DVD release. The music and sound effects have been reworked for modern home stereo systems, which is not bad in itself, but while John Williams' justly famous score is greatly enhanced (in gorgeously clear stereo; the theatrical mastering was rather murky and of course in mono) some of the sound effects have been re-recorded or re-created. (Few movie viewers realize how many sound effects--door slamming, footsteps, even background voices--are overdubbed long after the scenes are shot) I assume this re-recording was because the sound elements had to be be remixed to give us stereo, but with a film this old it's probably impossible to find all the original bits of sound after all this time. So many of the sounds are new to this release. To someone who's not that familiar with the film it's probably not a big deal, but some of the new sounds are oddly chosen--the shark doesn't explode with much of a bang now but with a dull thud; there's a bright side, though: the bullet no longer ricochets!) The sound as the shark smashes through the glass window of the boat near the end is closer to a coke bottle breaking than a large window shattering. Some sound effects are missing completely: a car door in Mrs. Kintner's second scene, the gun being cocked as Brody's about to fire on the shark at the end of the film. The whale sound they hear inside the Orca at night has been *completely* changed--they didn't even try to find something that sounded like the original whale! The splashing and thudding as the shark is ripping the cleats out of the boat has been toned down considerably, and the ripping sound as the cleats give way is absent. We hear the dialogue in the scene better--something I never could do either in the theater or on VHS--but it also makes the event less ferocious. Some of the music cues are actually different takes than those used in the original mix, with slightly altered orchestrations and entry-points. (It's not unusual for composers to rework orchestrations on the spot while they're recording the soundtrack.) Some sound effects have been added that enhance nothing and seem to be there just as stereo effects to make the movie feel more contemporary.  The most annoying to me personally is the scene where Mrs. Brody is quietly trying to clear the table after dinner while her husband sits deep in thought and troubled.  She's obviously trying to not make noise, yet they've added loud stereo &quot;scraping&quot; of plates being lifted off the dining room table.  Spoils the wonderfully pensive mood of Williams' music at that point and is completely unnecessary.  It feels like they just have to remind you every moment that can that this is a STEREO remastering.  Woo-hoo.This may seem picky, and many won't notice or care, but at the same time I don't appreciate them messing with a classic, especially when they don't offer a choice of a second audio channel with the original Dolby mix, as is given with many DVDs. And I don't hold with the trend when remastering movies today of making ordinary gunshots sound like cannon fire.  (And one of the new gunshots is actually not synched with the smoke that comes from Brody's gun.)If I've harped too much on the negative, I should say the video part looks beauiful (a cinematographer's small gaff with the aperture has even been fixed--I assume digitally--for this version) and the music has been, as I said, superbly restored. (This is particularly effective in the underwater music when they find Ben Gardner's boat.) But some key sound effects were dealt with poorly, and I'm surprised 1) the film received such cavalier treatment, and 2) nobody but me seems to have noticed.The disc also includes several theatrical and TV trailers, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary, and the usual goodies--production photos, storyboards, etc. There are outtakes (just a few and I know there were far more than this in the film) and deleted scenes, including three scenes that *were* included when the film was shown on network TV to add extra running time. But even one of these scenes is not complete on this DVD. I'm referring to Quint's original introduction, where he hums the Ode to Joy while a schoolboy plays it on a clarinet. That scene starts not where the DVD begins but with a shot of Quint exiting his truck, which has his name painted in big letters on the door. This is shown on the DVD as a production still but not in the deleted scenes themselves, for some odd reason. I just wonder why they give you *some* of a deleted scene but not all.As for the story itself, a few things stand out: this film had some terrific dialogue and insightful scenes of family life, throwaway bits that show Spielberg once had a heart and soul. He'd never direct the film like this today, with 2/3 of it over before we get any real action and with endless pages of character exposition. Perhaps this is why I haven't been interested in a Spielberg movie in 20 years. The shark looks very fake in some scenes, but somehow we never seem to care--it still works. There are the usual maddeningly irrational plot points in a Spielberg film: why does the police chief go out with Hooper to look for the shark (when they discover Ben Gardner's boat)? Why does the mayor make such a big deal out of the fact that Hooper can't produce the giant tooth when there's a boat that's clearly had the crap chewed out of it by something? Why does the chief go out with Hooper and Quint at all in a town filled with professional fisherman who cold serve as deckhands? And once on the boat with an increasingly mad and unreasonable Quint, who is endangering everyone, why doesn't Brody put Quint under arrest and with the help of Hooper guide the Orca safely back to shore before Quint trashes it? Would a law enforcement officer really be so passive in that situation?Well, the answer to all of these is because otherwise we'd have a far shorter film and less fun with the shark. Most people will just be thrilled to have Jaws in widescreen (this was the first VHS cassette I ever bought, many years ago, and the dub was horrible), and in larger-than-life sound. So am I, but I wish they'd preserved the original soundtrack mixdown as well. (Note: Watch for quick cameos by author Peter Benchley as a TV reporter and &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; director John Landis as a skinny denim-shirted fisherman who's one of those trying to win Mrs. Kintner's bounty.) (This review refers to the Widescreen 20th Anniversary stereo edition, NOT the DTS edition, which I have not heard and have no knowledge about.)	3.0	Strange and somewhat unsatisfactory remastering of a classic	2002-01-12	8	2	6
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2M597GCCE1N2S	"the one and only ""david"""	"Jaws is one of those instant classics that affect anyone who watches it in any new generation. Just watch, 20 years from now people are going to be just as scared as they were 31 years ago. The movie is what TRUE horror movies are, with the Alfred Hitchcock style of not really seeing the blood and gore during most of the movie, as well as terror and suspense at an all time high.When a young woman's remains wash up on a beach by a Long Island town named Amity, the only person who suspects something more sinister than a boating accident is the chief of police [played by Roy Scheider. He thinks it was a shark, and the only person who believes him is a shark expert [played by Richard Dreyfuss]who concludes that it is a Great White who is responsible.Instead of listening to the warnings to shut the beaches down, the mayor of the town continues to hold them open. After all, the next day is the Fourth of July, and they really can't shut the beaches down on the biggest tourist attraction event of the year can they?So the beaches remain open and the worst happens. A young boy is attacked by a shark and killed. After several decisions and arguments on what to do, the one thing agreed on is that an expedition needs to hunt the shark down and kill it. In enters an old mariner named Quint [played by Robert Shaw] who leads the Sheriff and Shark Specialist in a hunt for the shark to kill it.The sequence on the boat during the second half of the movie is worth the price of the DVD alone. The three men realize that the shark is hunting them, instead of the other way around. Despite shooting at it, harpooning it, and even trying to drag it home, what happens in the end is what made people respect horror films for what real movie making is.As far as this ""Speical Edition"" goes, you're better off buying the normal DVD set because you're not missing much. A second disk with a 2 hour making of documentary is the same as countless TV specials I've seen over the years. Also the only thing worth checking out is the 40 page commemorative photo journal of the movie and the documentary.Besides that, if you havent seen the movie you have no idea what you are missing.

The performances of the three main characters, the Chief (Roy Scheider), the scientist (Richard Dreyfuss) and the sea captain (Robert Shaw) was awesome.  I enjoyed, especially, the fun they had together aboard the fishing vessel before the shark attacked.One and all, I recommend this movie.

It's the Michael Jordan of cinema: there will never be another ""Jaws"", simply because the film so profoundly changed the way movies are made and marketed.  Based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel, ""Jaws"" centers around the fictional North Atlantic resort island of Amity, which finds itself terrorized by an enormous great white shark. Our hero is Martin Brody (Roy Scheider in the most underrated performance of his career); a New York cop who took the job as Chief of the Amity PD to get his family out of the city and then finds himself in the midst of an unprecedented crisis none of his prior experience has prepared him for. The remains of young Christine Watkins (Susan Backlinie) are found on the beach, the apparent victim of a shark attack (Chrissie Watkins' death scene at the opening of the movie is one of the most legendary in the history of film). Chief Brody wants to close the beaches, but is refused permission by Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) and the Amity selectmen, all of whom fear that news of a shark attack off of Amity will threaten the summer tourist trade, on which the town depends for its very survival. The Mayor and his lackies persuade Chief Brody that such incidents are always isolated, and, inexperienced in such matters, he grudgingly agrees to keep quiet.  Consequently, the shark kills again (and again), and Chief Brody eventually finds himself dealing both with his own moral guilt for agreeing to hush up the first shark attack and with an enormous human and social catastrophe which appears to be his sole responsibility. Help comes first in the form of Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss, in the role that propelled him to stardom), an ichthyologist and oceanographer dispatched to Amity to lend his expertise. Together, Hooper and Brody struggle in vain against both the shark and Mayor Vaughan, who is certain that keeping the beaches open for the sake of the town's economy (and his own real-estate business) is worth the gamble.Finally, Brody and Hooper charter an expedition with the enigmatic, vaguely malevolent Quint (Robert Shaw), Amity's most feared and respected shark hunter, to find and kill the shark and save the town from financial disaster. What ensues is an epic, archetypal man vs. beast quest that would make Herman Melville and Joseph Campbell proud. Our shark, it turns out, is way above average size, terrifically swift and powerful, and uncannily smart, to boot. Hooper, the scientist, is awestruck at having encountered the Bigfoot of the sea; Quint, the crafty fisherman with a serious chip on his shoulder against sharks, realizes he has met the ultimate test of his skills; Brody, who swims poorly and is afraid of water, must overcome abject fear and disorientation just to maintain his composure. Robert Shaw's Quint is one of the greatest anti-heroes the movies have ever seen. He is funny and frightening all at once, and the famous soliloquy in which he recalls the tragic sinking of the USS Indianapolis, where, over the course of a week waiting for rescue, at least 90 US Navy personnel died from shark attack wounds, is one of the most chilling and unforgettable performances ever committed to film.'Jaws' is the movie that made Steven Spielberg's career, and it's among his finest. It's easy to forget because of his enormously successful blockbusters that Spielberg is a phenomenally skillful and artful director. His timing is superb, he mixes horror with comedy to brilliant effect, he gets great performances out of his actors, and his love for special effects has never overwhelmed his understanding of the importance of story and character.  That said the most brilliant aspect of 'Jaws' was a serendipitous accident.  The special effects team had yet to fully troubleshoot 'Bruce,' the mechanical shark; by the time filming was to begin. Under tight budget restraints and enormous studio pressure, Spielberg had no choice but to press on while his crew labored vainly to make the shark work in the cold and corrosive north Atlantic seawater. To compensate for the absence of the non-functional fake shark, Spielberg used shots from the shark's point of view and John Williams' famous two-note theme to create the illusion of the shark's presence in the early scenes. Fortunately the crew was ultimately able to get Bruce into operational status in time to film the big showdown, and some of the scenes are filled in with live-shark footage filmed by Australian underwater video pioneers Ron and Valerie Taylor. Consequently, the audience's fear is magnified by the fact that, for the majority of the film, they cannot see the shark, creating suspense towards the climax of the confrontation between man and beast on Quint's fishing boat.  ""Jaws"" succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable (if the shark looks a little fake, remember that, at the time 'Jaws' was released, 'Space Invaders' was on the cutting edge of computer graphics design and there was no such thing as 'Shark Week on the Discovery Channel'). Roy Scheider's Brody is a quintessential everyman, an average guy beset by fear and guilt who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances and rises to the occasion. Dreyfuss' Hooper is brash and brave enough not to come off as nerdy or self-righteous, and his friendship with Brody becomes the backbone of the movie (Spielberg and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb wisely deviated from the novel in regards to the character of Hooper, who was originally Brody's nemesis). Robert Shaw's Quint is a modern-day Captain Ahab, a worthy foe for the malevolent shark. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie much more than a summer blockbuster."	5.0	Jaws  (1975)	2006-01-18	7	5	2

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3ALRSNTHF97VP	Thialfi	JAWS needs only to be made to look better and sound better, as this Blu-ray version manages to be even better than the 25th anniversary DVD. Refined - but never remade. It's on a list of untouchables that includes Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Lawrence Of Arabia - and amazingly enough, Hollywood has kept its respect for the film and Steven Spielberg - who got vaulted up to the greatest of heights after this, and has a place on Hollywood's Mount Rushmore to this day - and has never considered remaking it (Sequels? That's another issue...) This is the film that inspired fear of sharks, and the ocean, like no other film since - but also fascination. Sharks get more study and protection now thanks to this film, though there was a period of ignorant killing of them after the film's first release. It's the story of abnormal shark behaviour (this is important to remember, for the critics who question it - the inspiration for the story coming from the famous Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916) as a monstrous great white shark comes to the beaches of Amity Island and refuses to leave. Killing several random bathers, the dramatic stakes get constantly raised as the town gets divided over the best response, with the Chief of Police (Roy Scheider, in his best everyman mold) championing public safety by closing the beaches vs. the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) championing tourist dollars and the town's economy coming first. It all comes to a head in the last act, as the Chief and two shark experts hunt the shark at sea and have a confrontation every bit as epic as Moby Dick. It's a adventure ride that hooked me as a young man and never let me go.	5.0	Nothing needs to be said - still the all time classic that never ages	2013-09-14	2	1	1

The music that is played when the great white shark is about to attack is first rate. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job directing this movie.

This movie has scared so many people in the world.  This movie is a very scary thriller .This movie is about a shark that is attacking and killing people near the shore of a beach, and so the only way to stop the attacks is to close down the beach.  The mayor doesn't like this idea though because a big town holiday was coming and everyone usually swims on this holiday.  So he hirers three people to get the shark in time for the holiday.  What they think is going to be an easy capture, they are wrong and they are in for the thrill of their livesSo if you like thrillers, shark movies, and great classics, check out JAWS you'll never want to go in the watter again.	5.0	BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED	2003-01-01	1	0	1

Your kids won't go swimming after seeing this, so wait until they hit the teen years.Its kind of strange calling this a horror movie, since there are no ghosts or supernatural occurences, but a horror movie it is. In fact, it is the BEST horror movie ever made (Exorcist comes in #2). For sheer scares and tension throughout the movie, Exorcist can't compete with Jaws.

But this DVD transfer, dear friends, ain't it:This DVD has less information (albeit 2 deleted scenes that were not in the 1995 LaserDisc, but fewer overall) than the LD, and although the picture quality is sharper MANY SOUND EFFECTS ARE NOT FROM THE ORIGINAL TRACK!  All the truly gut-wrenching sound effects in the last third of the film, from the shark splashing to the Orca's engine exploding and shattering the hull, to the boom holding the shark cage crashing to the deck--have been replaced.Whether this travesty was deemed necessary for the DTS medium or not, it is historical film revisionism akin to the disasterous mess that was Star Wars: The Special Edition.  The DTS is muddy and the new sounds are uninspired.  For a DVD you get surprisingly few extras, when one considers the fine transfer and wealth of information included on the LD Boxed set.  Finally, any extras you get have indeed been transferred directly from that LD Boxed set (their fuzziness in the high-definition DVD is a dead giveaway).I will crack my DVD case henceforth for stills and the occasional dialogue check only, and leave the last third of the film totally alone.  Universal is definitely not high on my hit parade.I strongly urge you to buy the 2012 JAWS (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) if you want the original JAWS for your home library.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	**** Who hasn&#65533;t heard of Jaws?  From the legendary theme from John Williams to the image of a monstrous shark approaching from the depths, Jaws is a classic, a legend, and a masterpiece.In case you haven&#65533;t heard the story, Jaws focuses on Martin Brody (Scheider), the hard-working chief of police on Amity Island.  After a girl&#65533;s mutilated body is found on the beach, Brody calls in oceanographic scientist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) to examine the body and tell the town what&#65533;s happening.  What&#65533;s happening is that a monstrous great white shark is looming in the waters, driven by some unseen force.  Now it&#65533;s up to Brody, Hooper, and certifiable sailor Quint (Shaw) to track the beast and kill it&#65533;before they kill each other.Jaws has all the elements of a masterpiece.  Spielberg&#65533;s visionary directing is, as always, outstanding, driven by a bubblegum-story-turned-action-packed-masterpiece script (phew!) by Benchley and co-star Gottlieb from Benchley&#65533;s exciting best-seller.  Who can say enough about the great cast (including a classic performance by Shaw), not to mention the perfect score by Williams?Jaws is the type of film you&#65533;ll want to watch over and over again.  The fast-paced action, complete with likable characters and even some lightheartedness just adds to the experience.  Even you haven&#65533;t already seen it (how could you not?) than drop whatever you&#65533;re doing and watch it now.	4.0	**** 1/2 [out of *****]	2003-05-25	2	1	1

As far as tension in a suspenful thriller type of movie goes, this one follows the one simple rule.  Don't show too much, imply the source of tension, in this case the shark.  But it isn't just the lurking presence of the fish, it's also the tension and conflict among the three main characters that really drive the film along.  You have Brody's fear of not only the shark, but the water itself, Hooper's even keeled logical attack of the problem, and Quint's Ahabian obsession with the shark.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	In the beautiful quaint beach resort of Amity Island, something hideous, something so deliciously evil has vanquished the tranquility and shattered the peace. First, it violently took the life of a young girl, leaving her mangled remains rotting on the beach, her echoed screams cursing the night skies. Next, it moved its attention to the children, ripping and tearing as blood turned the calm waters red. Then, just when they thought it was safe to go back in the water, it struck again, mercilessly rampaging in the estuary and attacking the piers where the fisherman unknowingly sat waiting for a catch. Now, something must be done, before it returns to feed. With the Amity tourist board and town Mayor Larry Vaugn determined to keep the beaches open for the Summer Season, its up to Police Chief Brody, marine biologist Matt Hooper and colorful fisherman Quint to hunt down the 200 Pound White Death and put an end to the bloodshed. 'Jaws' succeeds on almost every level. It is terrifying without being grotesque, and spectacular without being unbelievable. The suspense is potent and the action thrilling, but the humor, emotion, and character development make this movie entertaining.	5.0	Jaws (Full Screen Anniversary Collector's Edition)	2010-01-28	1	0	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A36D94ZAIRFAA1	Trevor Wright	Settled into your seat at home, you flip on you're newly aquired &quot;Jaws&quot; DVD, after the FBI warning there is the Universal logo. In the back ground you head little pings and pangs, quiet and soothing while  you see the ocean opening up to you. Then DAA-DU, DAA-DU, the most famous  music cue brings you in as the words &quot;Jaws&quot; comes on the  screen.Jaws is the ultimate it in horror/thriller movies. Steven  Spielberg works his directoral magic in new and moving ways, like in the  first shark attack when we see a girl swiming in the ocean, as she is  attacked, the audience is put head level with her. In a place that we will  feel most vulnerable and afraid. This redefined the meaning of terror,  proven through the fact that many great white sharks were hunted down and  killed after this movies release. Even if you think that this movie is  corney and doesn't scare you, there has not been a movie since it about  sharks that stands on it's own (&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; springs instantly  to mind) and has been satired as much as &quot;Jaws&quot;.&quot;Jaws&quot; is also has a deeper meaning, brace yourself, I'm gonna  get really deep. At the time of this movie, America was involved with the  Vietnam War, the character of Roy Scheider plays a lone man, married a lady  from the island, and is an outsider to the town even though he is sherif,  soon in the movie, he is the only one who will stand up to the shark and  fight it, very few of his family or allies will help him, as America was in  the war. Also, &quot;Jaws&quot; incorpates another deep seated fears. Fear  of water, is an obvisious one, but also the fear of the unknown. We don't  see the shark till near the end of the movie (which also saves a bundle on  special effects). Nothing scares an audience more than not seeing a killer  in a scary movie. The shark also looks very realistic even today, at least  I found it most realistic then the sharks in &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; (I  know, I don't like that movie and it shows).John Williams, Steven  Spielberg's right hand music man, provides a soundtrack that gives such  dynamic effect. Today, not too many people don't regonize the  &quot;Jaws&quot; theme when it's played.Bottom Line: The ultimate  psychological thriller that will still scare you, even if you know what  happens in the end.	4.0	Jaws: Love it or hate it, you can't ignore it!	2000-07-10	0	0	0

The Movie that scared you out of the water and on the edge of your seat. Based on real shark attacks and Peter Belenchy's Best Selling novel is the story of New York Island town Amity Island, that is terrorized by a 25 foot Great White Shark and It's Up Cheif Martin Brody(Roy Schieder),Scientist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) and Shark hunter Quint to go out to sea to kill the beast. This film is nonstop terrifying thrills,breathtaking and spetacular. Chomping Good fun. This is the most terrifying animal ever on the screen. If it wasn't for King Kong and the Birds there be no JAWS. A Movie so legendary that it got it's self a thrilling ride at Universal Studios Orlando and Hollywood and I have been to both of them.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A3V8VZF9K8PRYE	Vista Verde 5th Grade	The movie Jaws is an amazing movie if you like horror movies, especially shark horror movies. This movie is about an island called Amity that is known for its beaches and its exotic ocean life. This island is attacked by a great white shark and the people have to stop this shark from devouring more people.I think this is the best shark movie created, its way better than Deep Blue sea, NOT CHEESY. This is a great movie because it shows the development of the people such as Brody and skipper, from being a police officer and marine biologists, to shark hunters, and how they change in dangerous situations. Not only that the story is great but the characters act perfect.The only downside of this movie is the fact that the shark looks fake and the rating; I don't know how they rated it but its PG when it should be PG13 because of language and some stuff not meant for kids.I recommend this movie if you love horror movies and (if you are a cheap buyer.) you can get it for only 3 bucks that's 1/5 the amount of the original amount which is $15.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"""Jaws"" transformed the film experience for all of us. Before ""Jaws"" there was no summer blockbusters to entice viewers into a dark movie theater during the care free days of hot, cloudless days. That changed when Steven Spielberg made it scary to go into the water. Basically combining ""Moby Dick"" with a monster movie, ""Jaws"" continues to be one of the best films Spielberg directed and one of his most suspenseful. I'm giving 5 stars to the original film. So many people downgrade these releases because of issues they have with the manufacturing or marketing and that's unfair to readers who need to know if the movie is worthwhile.The plot (if you don't need a recap skip this paragraph):--A Great White Shark patrols the waters off the coast of the summer beach town of Amity feeding on people at random. Police chief Broady (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and city council refuse to do so only allowing him to put up a beach patrol and then putting out a bounty on the shark's head. Feeding season is open and Brody along with Shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) and fisherman and shark hunter Quint (the terrific Robert Shaw)must face the creature far from land out in the open ocean in an effort to kill this rogue shark.First the bad news--this doesn't look like it's been remastered to me although the picture is a tiny bit sharper with slighly better resolution it isn't the huge difference I expected. Universal did it right the first time. The original theatrical trailers that were on the first DVD issue are missing as well. Since they were an important part of the success of the film and they were GREAT trailers, I would love to have them here as well.The Blu-ray for Jaws looks positively stunning which helps intensify the experience. Painstakingly restored from the original negative and audio multitracks, the film has never looked quite as good on home video. Heck, I doubt it looked this good in theaters at the time. Colors pop and the film has considerably more depth and detail than previously. Textures are quite good as well.The audio sounds stunning as well with an immersive lossless mix that puts you in the action. It also isn't in your face like many contemporary audio mixes for films.The special features as with the previous edition on DVD includes deleted scenes. We also get the full length documentary ""The Shark Isn't Working"" which gives us first hand stories from the late Scheider (who narrated), Richard Dreyfus, the late producers and Spielberg discussing the challenges of making the movie including the fact that it was one of the first films actually shot on the ocean and not on a backlot. The title of the documentary refers to the delicate nature of ""Bruce"" the mechnical shark--the designer didn't have time to test the shark because of the shooting schedule and due to the erosion that occurred in the salt water it would often break down. As co-producer Richard Zanack points out almost all the footage that was shot where the shark was working was used simply because they didn't have that much to work with in the first place. The documentary also includes an interview with the late Peter Benchley who discussed his expectations of his first novel including the fact that it wouldn't sell (because back then first novels rarely did), wouldn't be made into a movie (because he felt the technology didn't exist to show what he had imagined at the time)and it would quickly be forgotten. He was happy to be wrong on all accounts.We also get ""The Making of 'Jaws'"" the two hour documentary from the previous DVD set imported over as well as all the material (as far as I can tell) from the previous deluxe two DVD edition.We also get a DVD copy of the movie as well as the option to stream via Ultraviolet or watch via iTunes via download.One of Spielberg's finest films receives a nice, deluxe edition on Blu-ray and is well worth picking up. ""Jaws"" may have a slight wrinkle or two but this is probably one of the best digital facelifts that a film has received in recent memory.Highly recommended."	5.0	"Updated for Blu-ray: ""Jaws"" sharper than ever."	2005-06-26	5	3	2

Based on a best selling noval by Peter Benchley this movie was the first movie to ever surpass the 1 hundred million dollar mark at the box office heading it's way to 260 million total domestic gross. and it started what we know as the summer blockbuster event season! it was the all time box office champion until STAR WARS took the tital in 1977. It Stars Roy Scheider,Richard Dryfus, and Robert Shaw and Directed by future 2x Oscar winner Steven Spielberg. The comunity of Amity Island is terfied by a huge great white shark who finds that Amity Spells lunch! and it is up to 3 men (Scheider,Dryfus, and Shaw) to save the day in this very thrilling tale.	5.0	please take a big bit out of this dvd	2002-06-13	1	0	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2KQO3RSLSSRHA	Will Errickson	Is this Spielberg's finest film? Well, it's my favorite of his, that's for sure. It is brilliant in every way, and shows how a movie doesn't have to sacrifice plot and character for action and suspense. Spielberg should've  watched &quot;Jaws&quot; before directing his &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  travesties. Imagine how great those films could've been if the characters  were half as interesting and combustible as Brody, Hooper and Quint. Even  the minor characters, like Mayor Vaughn, and Brody's wife Ellen, as well as  Mrs. Kintner, come to vibrant life on the screen that in a way that is  often absent from current blockbusters.&quot;Jaws&quot; touches a primal  fear in humanity--that the sea is an alien planet and there are things  beneath its placid surface that want to eat us. When I was a kid it was one  of those films that was inescapable--before I saw I was worried for week,  wondering if you could die of fright (I was 7, forgive me!) It did scare  me, but it also exhilirated me, and inspired my deep and lasting love for  movies.By showing the shark in as few scenes as possible Spielberg  allows the tension to rise to unbearable heights. Having such colorful  characters allows us to escape into the film. The climax is terrific, a  blueprint for later action movies. This film is proof that escapist  entertainment need not be mindless or offensive by appealing to the lowest  common denominator of so-called film fans. This film is a classic--although  it is regrettable that people see great white sharks as monsters; any  documentary on them on tv shows that this is simply not accurate. Still, I  won't even go into a swimming pool at night!	5.0	Don't go in the water... Don't go in the water...	2000-02-21	28	21	7
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A20T0P425GAZVN	Will Hurt	"Just wanted to comment on the review of this DVD written by Paul Evans located in the ""Spotlight Reviews"" section of this page. Paul gripes about this being the second special edition of Jaws and calls for a boycott of purchasing DVDs until their last official versions are released. All of this due to Hollywood studios releasing normal versions of DVDs, and then releasing special edition versions years sometimes even just months after the DVDs initial release (Paul gives Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as an example). He goes on to say the following:""Please stop, studios. We all know you're losing money, but that's because of the overall poor quality of your product. Stop sticking it to those of us that are the biggest movie fans--those of us that are creating a DVD library. It really needs to stop.""I just wanted to point out to Paul that he needs to vent his anger over this issue at criminals, NOT the movie studios for all the recent DVD sales gimmicks. Yes, studios are hurting, but it's not because of the quality of their product, it's thanks to what I like to call ""the Napster Generation"". Studios are losing Billions thanks to piracy. You have bootleg versions of films being shot on camcorders in theaters and then sold on vhs tapes, DVD-Rs and distributed over the internet. This is taking it's toll on the studios. Just recently, a few days after the release of Star Wars Episode III, in NY one of the largest bootleg rings ever was busted. What did police find in their posession? Over 25,000 copies of Episode III ready to be sold as bootleg copies on the streets.This problem is only going to get worse too. With dual layer DVD recorders now available, people will be able to rip high quality versions of movies that were impossible using single layer recorders. And with the popularity of broadband and current compression software, we're just a few years away from people ""trading"" high quality movies over the internet.So, I don't blame the studios for doing things like this to try and make some extra bucks. But please, don't be foolish to lay the blame at the feet of the studios (who have been releasing some incredible work in recent years, despite Paul's opinion), get upset with the criminals who copy and distribute movies illegally...and their customers who knowingly break the law. It hurts all of us in the end. If this trend doesn't stop, we're going to see drastic changes in the entertainment world...and it wont be for the better."	5.0	For Paul Evans in Louisville, KY	2005-06-13	15	5	10
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AQ9SU2HXMA11W	William and Eileen Smith	I got this DVD thinking that it would be phenomenal given the underwater  sounds and all. Sorry all, but I refuse to buy something that I have to  wait until chapter 19 to hear some great sound effects that last a second.  My advice is this. If you want to get this movie on DVD because you are  done watching VHS tapes, fine. But do not buy this if you want to hear a  great sound format. Also, the DTS version is a joke. I don't know if it was  just the one DVD that I happened to buy, but it wouldn't allow you to  choose the DTS format at all. Why pay extra for DTS if you can't even use  it? My spouse and I laughed while watching it due to that there were maybe  4 times that you heard the &quot;shark coming sound effect&quot; on the  rear speakers, and even then it sounded so mono.

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2G64U6GXGDECY	William E. Fleming	Maybe I'm being overcritical.  The film is as great as it ever was; particularly with the clarity of DVD, but I was expecting more &quot;bang&quot; from the DTS version.  I realize that only so much can be done with a 25 year old film and is is not a recently made action film in which you have to have a massive floor-ratteling explosion every 5 minutes or so. My main comment is that DTS did not do much more for this film than the Dolby 5.1 surround sound.	4.0	Not quite up to the level I expected	2003-08-03	2	1	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A1LNRLXD1BSGQC	William	For those how thought that Jaws was a medicore film, i would like to be the first to say sorry about your mental health and stick to watching elmo in grouchland. Jaws is the perfect example of a classic. The notion of man  versus beast has been an age old movie idea , but under the direction of  Steven Spielberg , the boring storyline was suddenly an in your face voyage  of terror. Even after 25 years , Jaws can be ranked along The Exorcist as a  true classic , both films still have the power to conjure our deepest fears  and both can still leave our mouths parched after each viewing. After the  initiall Jaws movie , somebody should have stopped and not created such  lame sequels , but hopefully , the much anticipated Jaws will forever  change the outcome of dud sequels trying to cash in on the fear  merchandising market , but only time and hopefully , Mr Spielberg will  tell.!	5.0	There can be only one !	2000-03-07	1	0	1

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A2UUP58XPQW3GF	"Woopak ""The THRILL"""	"""You're going to need a Bigger Boat...""On February 11,2008, more than a month ago, Roy Scheider, the actor who said the famous line in this enduring classic monster film passed on to the next life. What better way to wrap up my horror ""reviewing streak"" than to pay tribute to one of the lead actors in the best monster film ever made. I will review this as a film made in 1975 and not in 2000, it would be unfair to review a classic as modern one.JAWS (1975) is the first film to reach the $ 100 million dollar mark, surpassing ""The Exorcist"" and even ""The Omen"". I've always said that the best horror films are the ones that hit close to home, with factors anyone can relate to. ""Jaws"" made a lot of people so afraid to go into the water. Masterfully directed by Steven Spielberg, based on Peter Benchley's novel which was inspired by the New Jersey Shark attacks of 1916 dubbed; ""The Summer of Fear"". The film is truly an enduring classic and such a phenomenon. It proves once again that you don't need demons, vampires, werewolves and boogeymen to induce a good scare.Amity Island is an isolated place where tourism is the townsfolk's bread and butter. Families on summer vacation go to Amity (means friendship?) to have a great time. A series of deaths that could have been committed by a huge shark threatens lives and the town's well-being alike. Chief Brody (Roy Scheider), with the aid of marine biologist; Matt Hooper ( Richard Dreyfuss) and a shark hunter named Quint (Robert Shaw) has to overcome bureaucracy, and their emotions to bring the 25 ft. monster down.Everyone knows the film's plot and premise, honestly, I've seen ""Jaws"" countless times. I first saw the film on television back in 1980 (too bad I was too young to see it in theaters); I was a child then. I can tell you that the film is so well-directed and effective that even an 8 year old could feel the chills and excitement. So what made ""Jaws"" so great? The haunting music, the feel of the unknown in the beginning, the well-rounded and interesting characters, and of course, the giant Great White Shark. The film was fated to be in the annals (yes, Chris, I said it again LOL) of excellent film-making; some of the awesome ingredients weren't done by intention. The shark wasn't seen in the first half because the mechanical model wouldn't work, who would think that this setback would prove to be the film's strongest gimmick? Thankfully, the filmmakers didn't give up and kept on with the production. Spielberg was in his twenties when he made the film, who knew that he would become one of the most renowned directors of our time? ""Jaws"" had the hand of fate working for it.The characters in ""Jaws"" are actually the ones who really carried the film. The performances by its cast headed by the trio of Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw ""clicked"" so well; viewers can easily form an attachment to them. Scheider is a cop who left the city for a small town to avoid the dangers of urban cop life; he hates the water and who figured that he'd come face to face with a 25 ft. shark? Dreyfuss is a marine biologist with a passion for sharks; he loves them and studies them relentlessly. He uses his own money to fund his research most of the time. The most interesting character for me is Quint, played by Robert Shaw; he's a shark hunter who seems loosely based on Moby Dick's Captain Ahab. Quint apparently had a traumatizing experience involving sharks during his tenure in the USS Indianapolis. All the lead characters have a link to the star of the film: ""Bruce"" the mechanical shark. Although ""Bruce"" may be a bit dated by today's standards, but trust me, this film is timeless, not because of its special effects, but the excellent script, direction and well-developed characters. Gosh, even the boat called ""Orca"" is a character in itself.Add the award-winning musical score by John Williams, the film definitely exudes intimidation. Obviously, Spielberg and Benchley had some disagreements on the script but everything worked so well that even though the film had major differences from the original book, I would easily forgive its differences from the source material. I truly thought that the film was made with care and creativity. There is no wasted moment in its proceedings, even the supporting characters carry a lot of depth.""JAWS"" was so successful that it spawned 3 sequels and a lot of knock-offs such as ""Orca The Killer Whale"", the Italian spin-off; ""Great White"" a.k.a. ""The Last Jaws"", Tentacles, Piranha and many others. The film is definitely one of the most brilliant, defining moments in film. It is a timeless masterpiece, which will undoubtedly endure forever and make future generations afraid to go back in the water.It will forever be the measuring stick for all future monster films. `nuff said.HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!

Compared to some of the supposed thrillers out today Hollywood has not outdone this movie. The current ones rely too much on graphics, cheap scaring and no plot to build up the suspense and then the surprises that give you that thrill.  In a word today's thrillers are passe.	5.0	Still a thriller!	2013-09-13	2	1	1
0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	A34097A4JTHOLP	ybarry45	In the Lawrence of Arabia special features is an interview with Spielberg. He talks about how special and honored he felt sitting next to David Lean and getting a personal running commentary from the director. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to feel we are special enough to get the same treatment. One of the greatest directors in Cinema and he has never provided any commentary on any of his films. This is a great film, done well in Blu-ray but it's missing that feeling that Spielberg got sitting next to David Lean.	4.0	A Second Bite	2013-02-16	0	0	0

0783216084	Jaws [VHS]	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"There are some films that no matter how much time passes after their debut, they still completely hold up.  ""Jaws"" is EXACTLY one of those films.For a basic plot summary, Jaws sees the coastal town of Amity suddenly becoming the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark.  Sheriff Brody (Roy Schieder) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential lose of tourist business.  When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the predator.In terms of suspense, ""Jaws"" may just take the cake for the top prize all-time in the genre.  Its theme music is now iconic, the visuals were groundbreaking for their time, and just the overall feel of the whole picture has a creepy vibe to it.  Even if you have watched the movie ""a thousand times"", you'll still find yourself sucked into the drama.  Only helping matters is the fact that the shark scenes, though filmed completely devoid of the helpful CGI tactics of today, do not look/feel cheesy in any way.  A remarkable piece of filmmaking, for sure.Of course, a movie like this needs more than just a ""villain shark"" to be a classic.  It also features a collection of iconic characters that still remain a joy to watch.  Schieder as the ""why-won't-anyone-listen-to-me!"" sheriff lets us relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show.  Of course, Shaw as Quint nearly steals the show at times with the complexity and jocularity he manages to portray in the single character.Very soon, ""Jaws"" will turn 40.  When it does (and continuing for the decades to come) it will remain just as visceral of an experience as for those sitting in the theaters in 1975.  There is a reason why director Steven Spielberg was vaulted to fame after this effort!"	5.0	Practically Defined A Genre	2013-05-30	1	0	1

The dry humor and sarcasism between Quinn and Hooper are worth the price of admission alone. The deer in the headlights look by Chief Brody when he finally sees the shark while ""chumming"" is my favorite part! Up to this point he does not realize that he is on a waterborn Deathstar. The terror gets passed to another generation.."	5.0	Jaws (1975)	2004-10-21	1	1	0
