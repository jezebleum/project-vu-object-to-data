The animation was great, the cast wonderful, and the story was pretty good. ""Finding Nemo"" revolves around a young fish and his over-protective father. The young fish (Nemo) is caught and ends up in a dentist office aquarium. His father sets off on an adventure across the ocean to find him meeting another fish (Dorie) on the way *fabulously voiced by Ellen Degeneres.* This isn't a movie just for kids.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	Sort of a two sided adventure telling the story of a young clownfish named Nemo and his father Marlin. Nemo is inadvertently captured by a diver during his first day at school and most of the story involves both his and his father's attempts to find each other.I was somewhat bored by the general story and thought that dome of the scenes might scare young children (remember the minefield with the sharks and especially that very toothy deepsea fish.).I did really like the animation, the fish didn't look real but they had a very good look to them, Pixar could sure do a real fish if they ever decide to do so. The water effects were amazing, almost enough to buy the DVD for all on their own. I liked how the water looked on the surface, so real, the underwater effect was very good too with detail including the tiny specks you always see in a real undersea shot. The shark chase through the submarine wreck could get scary for a little one but look it over well, much of it has a near photographic look to it.	4.0	Fantastic animation, story might be scary for some kids	2003-12-05	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EY1CA1C5PCNF	A Customer	Kind of hard to believe this is the highest grossing DVD ever. I had heard all of the hype about this movie and had to check it out for myself. I thought &quot;Wow, if this is the highest grossing DVD ever, then it must be something special&quot;...What I found was typical, Hollywoood, Formulatic fodder for the kiddies. Great movie for the kids...horrible for adults. You see, Shrek, Toy Story, and even Bugs Life can be enjoyed by both kids and adults..that's what makes those movies so great. This movie is just, well, boring. Sorry, I don't get it.I would have liked it better if Nemos dad's voice had been different. I can only take that guys voice for about 2 minutes! But throughout the entire movie he is yelling and screeching and whining and it really gets OLD! Also, just a question, why is it that in just about EVERY animated movie or commercial we have to listen to character that has an accent from New York or Boston or some place back east? Why? I even saw a commercial where there was a talking Tomato with an accent from New York. Well at least we aren't forced to listen to cartoon characters with a Texas accent because that would really do me in!Anyways, pick up this movie for the little ones, they will watch it over and over...and Pixar knows this....	1.0	Highest Grossing DVD Ever?	2004-01-01	75	14	61
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AO3JW5VHT2GQ	A Customer	Summary:A clown fish, Marlin (Albert Brooks), has just mated and his partner has just laid all their eggs when a barracuda (not sure if that was what it was, but it looked like one) comes along and eats the wife and all of the eggs but one.  Just prior to this happening the wife says that she wants to name one of the children 'Nemo'.  So, Marlin, in remembrance, names the surviving child Nemo and promises never to let anything happen to him.Well, Nemo (Alexander Gould) hatches and is growing up, but not very fast because Marlin won't let 'anything' happen to him, including good stuff, like going to school, etc.  Eventually Nemo prevails on his father to let him go to school, but on his first day he has to prove to some friends that he's cool and not afraid and in so doing he is caught by some scuba divers and taken away.  Marlin is beside himself with grief and now has to try to find his son.As luck would have it one of the divers loses his mask overboard and Marlin finds it.  On the mask is the address of the diver and now Marlin has something to go off of in order to find his son.  He ends up hooking up with another fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), and they embark on a series of adventures on their way to Sydney, Australia to find Nemo.Nemo, meanwhile, has ended up in a dentist's fish tank with a group of other fish, including one other that came from the ocean and not a pet store, Gill (Willem Dafoe), who is the leader of the tank.  When they overhear the dentist tell a patient that Nemo is going to be gift for his niece, Darla, they panic - Darla is a fish killer.Meanwhile, Marlin tells his story to some of the people they meet along the way and suddenly the story is passed along to everyone in the ocean, even being told to some seagulls, including one that visits the dentist's office on a regular basis.  News travels back to Nemo that his dad is looking for him and now the stage is set for the two to work through the obstacles that are keeping them apart to reunite.My Comments:The story is touching and well-done.  It continuously has a sense of urgency and moves along very quickly.  However, the two elements of this story that really make it superb are the dialogue and Ellen DeGeneres.The dialogue is very memorable and some of the insights are just downright brilliant.  What makes it so good is that they are virtually no clich&eacute;s.  Everything comes across as original, funny, and natural.  Disney and Pixar definitely spent some time working out just perfect dialogue for this movie.  It really was great.The second great element is Ellen DeGeneres's character Dory.  Dory was hands down the funniest part of the entire movie.  From her whale calls to her play on fish having a 3-second memory, Dory was unintentionally full of laughs from the beginning.  Pay close attention and you'll realize that she never actually remembers Nemo's name on the first try, calling him something new every time.  And yet, despite her forgetfulness and insatiable humor, she was also inspiring.The movie is remarkably well-thought out and each of the characters stands out as being unique, which is saying quite a bit when you're dealing with lots of fish.  Each one has a distinct attitude and voice and you get the impression that you really are in the world of the fish.I don't really have any criticisms of the movie, but I am beginning to wonder something about Disney's agenda... They continue to anthropomorphize animals (The Lion King, The Jungle Book, Tarzan, etc.).  What is their agenda?  Do they have an agenda?  Or is it just easier to tell and animate stories about animals than humans?  I'd like to know if Disney's anthropomorphizing of animals has had any long term effects on children and, say, their eating patterns: Are children that have grown up watching The Lion King, Finding Nemo, etc. more likely to be vegetarian? (Am I sociologist, it's in my nature to ask these kinds of questions.)  Anyway, it was just a thought while I was watching another anthropomorphized Disney film.Overall, the movie is very funny, superbly well-written, and family friendly.  It is definitely worth watching for anyone that enjoys Disney films or is looking for family friendly fare.	4.0	Cute, touching, and very funny.	2003-06-08	4	3	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	Seriously, though. Although many movies have been declared (most wrongfully) to be entertainment for the whole family, Finding Nemo delivers. It's funny, entertaining, warm and a heck of a lot more engaging than some of its fellow productions (Disney and otherwise). I saw this film in theaters with several friends (all of whom are over 18) and I can say that we all enjoyed it. Heck, we never agree on anything.Finding Nemo is the story of a clownfish's (Albert Brooks) epic quest to find his son. He traverses a jaw-dropping undersea world that never ceases to amaze visually. Along the way he encounters many colorful characters: a fish with short-term memory loss (Ellen Degeneres) who helps him on his quest, a trio of fish-addicted sharks (the twelve-step program was hilarious), a school of fish voiced by Cheers alum John Ratzenberger (who, ironically, is staying true to his old character as a source of information), whales, seagulls, albatross, and many more. His son, meanwhile, is the latest acquisition of an Australian dentist who bonds with the community of fishes in the aquarium (including Willem Dafoe, Brad Garrett, Eric Bana, Allison Janney).In terms of creating an impressive and convincing landscape, Pixar steps up to the plate once again and hits a home run. Also, there is a rich variety of characters in the film, most of whom are voiced by celebrity talents (most of whom are listed above). The story is standard, but the Pixar team makes it seem fresh and vital. In short, this is one of the 'kiddie' films that I have seen that I would very much like to own on DVD. The extras ought to be impressive too. Highly recommended.	5.0	Quintessential Family Film	2003-09-30	7	7	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3SJG69NUSJ2QI	Adam Raper	I thought this movie was a very fun movie to watch plus it had great animated special effects.  I just didn't think it was as good as some other movies that Pixar had done in the past like Monsters Inc. or Toy Story 2.  Mainly because there wasn't as much humor in this movie as some other animated movies that I've seen.  Some of the scenes in this movie were funny, but not many.  Also I'm not a really big fan of Albert Brooks or Ellen DeGeneres.  But if your looking for a movie that is good for the youngsters to see, this is a good one.	4.0	Good, but it could've been better	2003-08-10	1	0	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AF4WDJVU6U4AJ	"""admiralrhalbx"""	Finding Nemo is most certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Another trainwreck by Pixar studios.  Lacking an actual plot the movie focuses on the struggles of Marlin, a fish, trying to find his fishy son.  Why anyone would care about this misguided quest is beyond me. However the story ends I dont know considering the movie is about as boring as they come. The movie is full of terrible attempts at comedy leaving you wanting to throw a brick at whatever projection device is showing the rubbish. Add a few celebrity voices and there you have it, the formula for quite possibly the most annoying piece of garbage ever.  The animation isnt bad until you think about what its being used to animate. The only thing this movie did for me was to increase my support for the commercial fishing industry.  Had Nemo been mechanically seperated and put into a can of tuna the movie may have been entertaining. Everyone do yourself a favor and instead of watching this nonsense rent yourself a classic- The Barber directed by Michael Bafaro	1.0	Finding Nemo - Blight upon Mankind	2004-01-04	53	7	46

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMP7TQRWAIE84	"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D"""	December 16th, 2010This is an all-around great movie. I watched it for the first time today. I heard people gush over it so much at this website but hadn't seen it previously. I was gonna buy it but maybe I'll wait to see if it comes down in price at all.The animation is beyond top-notch. Must say that first. The water looks really realistic, certain sea creatures such as the shark look extremely intimidating and most of the fish are quite colorful. The body of water they explore can be colorful too, but usually it's quite brooding and dark.Which brings me to what I said in my title: This movie can be viewed by kids but some of the younger and impressionable ones (ages 3, 4 and maybe 5) may find it a bit scary at times.The story itself is also kinda dark at times. I enjoyed it but some may find it sad.The characters are great. Nemo is great, his father Marlin was cool but my favorite by far was the absent-minded Dory. Boy, was she a character! While I did smile a few times during the movie, she was the first character to make me laugh. Near the end I almost cried.In the end, it's a good movie but maybe you as a parent, babysitter or what-have-you, should watch it first to make sure it's alright for the kids. If they are 6 or above, I see no problem with them watching this.4 stars or an 8/10.	4.0	Heartwarming sometimes, makes you laugh but also a bit scary at times (for kids). 4 stars.	2010-12-16	0	0	0

Yet another Disney movie brainwashing kids about moral ideas such as love and trust... not that that's a bad thing... but this movie displays those morals in a corny, sappy way that will make you want to sink into your seat and will embarrass you. That's why the point was lost.But generally it was fantastic and extremely funny.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	I'm a huge fan of Pixar and their work; I think the animation they've done in the past decade or so has been truly revolutionary for the way kids movies are crafted.  There are a lot of &quot;moron&quot; movies that get splashed across the screen every year so that kids will beg their parents to take them to the movies, thus pumping large revenues into the studios.  It's the candy-bar effect: they do nothing for the kid, but they do make the kid make their parent spend money.If those movies are candy-bars, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a full meal complete with veggies.  First off; the animation--it's like a moving art gallery.  Colors are everywhere, they're vibrant, they're full of motion, they absolutely entice, and a joy to watch.  There's not a drab speck in this film, even when the water gets smokey and the scenery is sparse; it's still thrilling to watch the animated ocean, especially how the different shades effect the appearance of the two lead fish; Marlin and Dory.  I especially like the little &quot;neighborhood&quot; that Nemo and Marlin are a part of, with variated corals everywhere, multi-hued fish swimming past, sumptuous undersea fauna, etc etc etc...The comedy; first rate.  And I mean really top-notch.  One thing a lot of kids movies do is assume that their audience will only get the dumbest of jokes.  Kids are sharp and respond to subtle humor, and the writers of &quot;Nemo&quot; know this.  It helps a lot too that you have a seasoned comic actor Albert Brooks and comedienne-actress Ellen Degeneres on board as well (incidentally, I think this role for Degeneres really announces her as a comedy heavyweight, if her show a few years ago didn't.  Perhaps I'm late in catching on :-).  This isn't to say &quot;Nemo&quot; is high-brow humor, but it manages a level that I think is perfect for both kids and adults to laugh at, most of them coming from Dory who's a quirky mix of comedy relief, odd-ball character, and dramatic seat.  With her rests the majority of the comedy, but also an added element of the satisfaction that comes from her character's resolution.  It seems too that a lot of comedy movies lack a basic silliness; as if they're unable or unwilling to go there, and rely on vollying insults back and forth for two hours.  &quot;Nemo&quot; brings back the silly and it pays off.The movie might be viewed as a little skewed against Australians, as another reviewer has mentioned, but I think this is an innocent quirk of the movie and has nothing to do with trying to slant Australians.  There is a pelican in the movie who is Australian and is not in anyway stupid or bumbling like the Dentist.You'll probably also miss Willem Dafoe voicing Gill, I know I did.  Maybe I wasn't expecting it; but the tank in the Dentist's office is a neat little microcosm of the ocean in terms of learning how to survive, alliances, rights-of-passage, etc.All in all, you can watch it for these different levels, or you can sit back and laugh.  My only gripe with the movie is the beginning which is far too scary for kids (reminds me of Bambi walking around the forest calling out, &quot;Mother!  Mother!&quot;), but if you have the DVD you can skip by this part without missing a beat.	5.0	A Wholly Satisfying Family Movie	2004-02-22	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F	Ahmed	"""Finding Nemo"" is a stream of joy and hope. There wasn't a single thing I didn't admire in this mesmerizing movie. It's a faultless Father's Day film, which is just what the doctor ordered when it was released just before Father's Day. Directed by Andrew Stanton, ""Finding Nemo"" is a bright fun-filled adventure that is enchanting, touching, and amusing! There are so many morals that you can find in this deep blue sea escapade from lessons like ""If at first you don't succeed try, try again"" to things that you learn when you're only a child (look on both sides before crossing the road). The morals make you ponder and ""Finding Nemo"" is truly a thought-provoking feature. Some scenes are so gripping (especially considering that it's an animated film) that quite a few times you'll be on the edge of your seat! The varieties of the vibrant colors used in the backdrops were breathtaking from views of scenic Sydney to the underwater coral reefs! But it's not just the colorful spectrum of backgrounds but also the ingenious, one-of a kind witty script that makes this feature so enjoyable! It's different from other cartoons because it's not just about silly fun and games but also about real-life tragic events. A lot of thought was put into Finding Nemo's script from the plan of having a fish's perspective to the idea of having a father-son theme (which made me think of ""Life is beautiful""). It's even longer than other animated features running for approximately two hours.Pixar has come up with sheer cinematic magic since the late 80's. Pixar continues to outdo itself with exceptional cinematic computer animation creations. Pixar has surpassed even what is usually expected from its creators which is a big deal if you consider such masterpieces as Monsters Inc., Toy Story, and A bug's life to name a few. This Pixar production is amazing with realistic activities and multihued illustrations. Finding Nemo is like a longer version of their 80's animated short film that first brought them fame (featured the two lamps). Everything is so beautiful and you just have to awe at the pretty pink jellyfishes even though they are attacking the story's protagonist at the time. It's no surprise that at the moment this is the movie of the year beating the box-office grosses of such highly anticipated movies as The Matrix Reloaded and X-men 2. In eleven weeks it is already in the top ten box-office list of the highest grossing films gathering over $300 million in the US alone. It's probably very popular because it's an original script not based on any other story (just like The Lion King). In no time at all it will probably break The Lion King's decade old record of being the top grossing animated feature, a record it set back in 1994 (although it will be hard for Finding Nemo to break The Lion King's worldwide gross of just over $700 million).""Finding Nemo"" is a story of fishes and the big blue sea. It's features the voices of Albert Brooks (The Muse) as the cautious corny clownfish Marlin and the eminent Ellen DeGeneres (top comedian) as the absent-minded Dory. The story revolves around Nemo's father Marlin who loses his son and has no way of finding him, at least for awhile. Just when Marlin feels that like it's the end of the world, `out of the blue' the fun-loving cobalt-colored Dory enters the story and joins Marlin in an expedition to save his son Nemo. The expedition is very entertaining and spellbinding as they stumble across comical creatures like a shark that's turning in a new leaf and large amusing Australian turtles that help Marlin and Dory in their `sea voyage'.Some people believe that it's a waste to watch an animated feature film on the big screen but trust me ""Finding Nemo"" is worth it, that is mostly if you're the kind of person who enjoys and understands movies with hidden meanings and can spot analogies anywhere. When you consider it, it sounds mundane I mean a talking fish that lives in the ocean you think ""Okay, been there done that"" (probably thinking of the Little Mermaid). But ignore that little voice in your head and go watch this dazzling sea saga, truly a must-see movie this year that I definitely recommend.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" is a fantastic film! It's a collection of streams of splendor and scenic natural habitats. It's a family movie, for audiences of all ages. To cut a long story short; there's Cleopatra's grand entrance in Rome, Julie Andrews voice over the verdant hills of Austria, the adventures in the vast shivery landscapes of secluded Siberia in Dr. Zhivago and then there's Nemo."	5.0	Nemo makes a big splash!	2003-08-17	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A22UCQ7WIYIJE3	A. J. Cherrington	A great fishy tale about a traumatized father, Marlin, who is overprotective of his only son, Nemo. When Nemo lashes out to challenge his fathers overbearingness he suddenly ends up in the situation his father has been dreading all along. Caught in open water by humans and off to a dentists aquarium.Marlin then starts the long search to find him, meeting up with soom interesting charcters along the way.  The most induring and nearly scene stealing is of his forgetful companion, Dory, voiced by Allen deGeneris.  She comes accross really well.Nemo finds himself trapped but with new friends and soon plots an escape.The team at Pixar have really excelled and it is such a shame that it takes so long to make this type of animated movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A19NJ9NF9KC6L5	AJ	Finding Nemo is the epitome of all hero journies. Although the story is simple, you could compare this to movie Star Wars or Lord of the Rings because they all have one thing in common: they all have a adventure where the main character is trying to get to his goal. I love all the Pixar movies but they all seem to have the same story pattern. 1. Something gets lost 2.) The main character has to find it. This is not a bad thing. Finding Nemo was the best movie of the year. I enjoyed it a lot. Please watch it if you like a good story and a great quest.	5.0	A great journey	2003-11-06	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ATQQT2GMZMY3J	"Alan Winterrowd ""Boomcoach"""	With all the hype surrounding this film, I expected it to at least be entertaining.  While my family loved Toy Story and a Bug's Life, we were unanimous in giving this film a &quot;blah&quot;.  The animation is very well done, but the characters are uninteresting, there is no chemistry be tween them and the plot is one long wandering effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to bring in other minor characters in an attempt to bring some interest to the film.Dory's memory problem is annoying and brings nothing to the story.  The best part of the film are the characters in the aquarium, but that is damning with faint praise.If you are older than 8, find a better way to waste a couple hours of your life.	2.0	Pretty, but insipid	2003-11-24	27	5	22
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2R1R907SMOJHD	Alastair G. Stell	Nemo has its moments. Vegetarian sharks? Wonderful idea! A dentist that inflicts mahem on his patients? Ah my childhood nightmares take flight again! The world's dummest fish as a companion? Hilarious!Yes this film has its moments and the animation is quite first class.But if you want to see how a cartoon made for kids can appeal to adults, try &quot;Ice Age&quot;. For me the humor in &quot;Ice Age&quot; was far more sophisticated and endearing to adults.Nemo wins out for animation but for a compact, well told story without a minute of waste, it just doesn't compare to &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Overall I rate Nemo as a young kid's movie that parents can chuckle over. Much better than Monsters Inc which was really just a one-joke flick.	1.0	Not a bad effort	2004-05-07	44	5	39
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABO182YN0SC67	albino_squirrel	First, let me say that I really did enjoy this movie, and I found it to be funny, cute, and well-plotted.  I'd suggest it to anyone who enjoys the likes of &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;The Lion King.&quot;However, though this movie may be infinitely rewatchable for kids, I'm not sure the same can be said for adult viewers.  I mention this because being a parent, I know that if you buy this movie for your kid, you will probably have to watch it at least three dozen times or more. What makes &quot;Toy Story&quot; so great in my opinion is that the characters' expressions and body movements add to their &quot;performances,&quot; and they really afford nuances that give the movie a kick of extra charm.  &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; as funny and endearing as it may be, is a bit limited by the character design--fish--so the main bulk of humor lies in the voice acting and script, and often not much in the characters' demeanors.I'm sure that many people won't care too much about this small quibble of mine, but because I watch animation so much, these things really catch my eye and can make all the difference in the world for me, and as great as &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is, I think it's better suited to kids, not because it's not funny or entertaining, but because only kids will still find it to be funny and entertaining upon the 5th, 50th, or 500th viewing.By all means, however, buy this movie for your kid.  I haven't met a kid yet who didn't love it, and it is a better production than much of what is specifically tailored to adults, anyway.	4.0	A good kid's movie, but maybe not so much for adults.	2003-12-03	3	2	1

""Finding Nemo"" is the latest gem in the Pixar catalogue.""Finding Nemo"" presents a beautiful representation of the aquatic world, all the creatures look spectacular and well represented, the palette of colors is stunning, congratulations to Pixar, it's obvious that they did a great research job.The movie tells the story of Marlin and his little son Nemo, a couple of clown fishes; they are the only survivors of a shark attack, who ate Nemo's mom and his soon to be born brothers. In Nemo's first day of school, he goes too far, and he gets caught by the humans and ends up in a dentist personal aquarium. Meanwhile Marlin (Nemo's dad) starts the rescue of his little son, with the help of a Regal Blue Tang named Dory; she is a little goofy and suffers a lack of short memory, so she keeps forgetting Marlin's name every five minutes, but she is well intentioned. In their adventure they find all kinds of species, some friends and some enemies.""Finding Nemo"" has everything: comedy, adventure, action, drama and tender moments.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2QASAMGT1UYZ3	Alexis_Ray	"*****5 stars for the filmClown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) live in the perfect anemone suburbia - and they're about to become proud parents of more than 400 kids. But then tragedy strikes, leaving Marlin a single parent of the lone egg that survives.He names his son Nemo.Given the circumstances, it's easy to understand why Marlin becomes a devoted (if neurotic) dad who is afraid to let his son out of his sight - not to mention a super-worrier about all the dangers of ocean. But when the free spirited Nemo (Alexander Gould) is taken by divers and held hostage in a dentist's aquarium, Marlin will have to swim the ocean to save his son. He is aided by Dory (Ellen DeGeneres in a hilarious performance), a zany blue tang fish who - memorably - happens to have short-term memory loss.Along the way they meet surfer dude turtles, sharks who've taken a pledge not to eat other fish (""Fish are friends, NOT food!"") and a host of other original characters.It's true that the technical wizards at Pixar have captured every nuance of light and water - you feel as though you *are* underwater. And more to the point, you feel like you're swimming through a rainbow. Finding Nemo is among the most brilliantly colorful movies ever made.Finding Nemo doesn't have quite as many clever lines aimed to sail over kids' heads and at adults' as Monster's Inc. or Toy Story. But it does have heart, and it sticks to its story -Marlin as the overprotective parent who doesn't know how to let go; Nemo as the youngster eager to test his wings (that is, fins!) - and it hits all the right notes.The kids will love it, and even adults who've sworn off Disney will be laughing despite themselves. Just make sure the kids know that in real life, all drains don't lead to the ocean (you'll understand when you see the film).This one's a keeper.""P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2T2MYZEB81NOQ	"Alex K ""Catman"""	This is a very funny and very well made movie. In fact, it is my # 3 favorite computer animated movie of all time topped only by Shrek  and Ice Age. It is all about a clownfish named Marlin who has lost his son, Nemo, the second protagonist next to him, and is looking all over the ocean to find him, facing lots of danger and lots of different sea animals, including three sharks(who are definitely the coolest with one exception)and some sea turtles and most importantly, a reef fish named Dory who has short term memory loss (POOR GIRL! HAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!)Anyway, there are lots of funny lines and/or scenes, as well as a really cool white and black-striped fish named Gill(Nemo was cute, but Gill is my # 1 favorite in this movie and is the only one who tops the sharks. In fact, Gill has been my favorite since the start in this movie in the same way Dragon has when it comes to Shrek and Diego the Saber-Tooth has when it comes to Ice Age)Anyway, this is a very funny and very touching movie and if you like computer animation or nature, this is for you.	5.0	Saw it long ago, but it was great then and is great now!	2006-01-16	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3VPN5RKX7DQPT	Alex Thorne	firstly i will explain my age and views. i am 16 and i also feel that the world needs less of this mushy morals rubbish.now i wouldnt say that there is that much wrong with finding nemo, i just think that the almost exemplary computer generation doesnt hide the feeling of &quot;hang on, disney have done this story before&quot;. yes, the plot is extremely old hat and didnt really grip me at all.many of the jokes were also too obvious for my taste, and the only thing that had me sort of laughing was the almost chilling alfred hitchcock tribute (MINE!!), but the rest of it didnt leave much to the imagination. another problem i had was the complete and utter overkill that went into advertisement and memorabilia. i think more went into that than the actual film production, and believe me thats quite heavy. i only think that exsessive merchendise should go from films that truly deserve it, say shrek 2 or the lion king for example. my only positives from this film were the sublime vocals of william dafoe, although jack nicholson could also have done,and the animation being almost realistic. i couldnt stand the now signature 'big event happens that endangers them all, something remarkable happens too save them, then you have a supposedly sad moment in which one of the characters seems to die then live,and the goopy moral is spat straight into your face'. but then again, i suppose that its disneys trademark, and one that i begin to tire of. the only disney film that hasnt really done that since the millenium started was the emperors new groove, which i would gladly choose over this soppy ,over sentimental twallop.you can click unhelpful if you want, but that would probably show that you have no sort of sense and only see the silky graphics over story and substance. kids love it, adults give to the hype, but IM not going to be fooled.	2.0	...WAKE UP!!!...	2004-06-29	16	2	14

It has all the ingredients that make a Disney movie so special.There was a lot of humor in the interacting of the characters, and I do hope that Ellen DeGeneres will be asked to lend her voice to more Disney characters in future projects.In my opinion, this movie deserves a place on the DVD shelf of any fan of Disney Films, right next to the equally great and funny 'Lilo and Stitch'.'Finding Nemo' is a movie you can watch over and over, and never tire of.	5.0	This is a must-buy!	2003-08-27	1	1	0

Our viewing party was 4 people, ages 19-35, two women, two men and we all thought it was from pretty good to fantastic. We each found different aspects to enjoy.Too often fish are portrayed as just a generic fish. As an aquarist, I appreciated the effort Pixar put into preserving the actual behaviors, interactions, swimming motions and habitats of each individual type of fish. In this film, the characters are quite anthropomorphic, but without detracting from their basic nature. The themes of accepting and trusting others against your gut feeling and many different types of &quot;people&quot; cooperating to attain a common goal are lessons everyone can take home. The distruction humans wreck on the ocean are so lightly touched on, most may not even pick up on it. I would have liked to see it expressed more strongly considering we need to open the eyes of younger generations, but then again, this isn't a documentary.We were all blown away by the animation. They have raised the bar again. Take a good look at the movie poster. The detail in the glow of the shark's teeth, the pores of the skin around the corners of his mouth, the reflection of light through the water shown on his head and in the background and the cute freckles across the bridge of Dory's (the blue tang) nose are amazing. Then wait until you see the movie!Between the basic plot, the underlying themes, the animation, and being able to empathize with the character's situations, this is one great movie package.	5.0	Nemo is my Hero	2003-05-30	5	5	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1SIX968W2WNZM	"Amazon Customer ""dranansi"""	"I read the hype about this movie and the 5 star reviews and thought...yeah, this would be great for my DVD collection and my 5 year old [Ahem. I meant, I bought this PRIMARILY for my daughter!]  I was  half right! She loved it. Watched it over and over again. However, she wanted to know what happened to ""Coral and the little eggs"" since this was not shown. One was left to figure out that they were eaten.I fail to see what harm showing them being swallowed [no need for blood and gore] would have done. It is a fact of life! The big fish eat the little fish. The sooner the little ones understand this, the better! Funny enough, we see the heroes swallowed by a whale....hmmm...a bit of double standard here.The hero's partner is a forgetful cutesy blue fish who can read. Enough said!Having said that, the movie was for children. It should be rated ages 10 and under and not G. It was not funny, it just sort of moved along. It lacked the depth of story of the classics like the Lion King, Shrek, Toy Story I &amp; II etc. The animation was however excellent with very good sound!All in all, I would have given the picture 2 stars for effort, lack of proper research and the idiotic cutesy sharks! Really now! Nemo's dad told him that the ocean was dangerous. This would have been an ideal time to portray the shark as the dangerous stranger not to be trusted or played with! But what do we get? We find FRIENDLY, Vegetarian Sharks! Only the USA would have a sharks anonymous where the shark is giving up fish. LOL!! And what's with these hippy turtles? As the youth today say... DUH!!Why the obsession with dental procedures and pain?...what is this, an ad against Dentists? It only succeeds in making the trip to the dentist appear like a trip to torture land. Come now, surely Pixar can do better than this!I added one star to make three because my daughter watched it over and over.If you want a movie to entertain your 5 year old, then buy it.  If you want a classic to add to you DVD collection, get the Lion King platinum edition, Shrek or Toy Story I &amp;II instead."	3.0	Finding Never!	2004-01-07	10	3	7

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AUQO6TUG3AL6U	Amazon Customer	"Finding Nemo possesses all the elements of a fantastic Pixar movie- wackiness, comedy, and an exciting plot. The use of color and form makes Finding Nemo one of these rare movies where I wanted to sit in the front row to be dazzled by the animations.The story tells about the adventure of little Nemo, a clown fish born with a disabled fin. He gets captured away by scuba divers after the conflict and argument with his overprotective father, Marlin. Marlin then embarks on a journey to search and return home with his son safely.The actors voice the characters so that their own mannerisms are present in the fish characters, which are familiar to us. The director, Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job for the fish to take on the qualities of human personalities. For example, Albert Brooks plays Marlin, an overprotective worrywart and Ellen Degeneres voices Dory as a cheerful fish who has the memory span of an average two year old. The undersea world is just a shade murky, as it should be; we can't seem to see far or sharply in sea water. There is something dreamlike about the visuals of Finding Nemo that evokes the reverie of scuba-diving.The movie's great inspiration is to leave the sea by putting Nemo to a big tank in the dentist's office. In it, many other fish are held captives including the Moorish Gill. It may seem that there is no possible way a fish can escape from an aquarium ""out the window, across a highway, and into the sea,"" but there is no accounting for the genius minds of these creatures which further displays the human characteristics. Also, the fish have help from a conspirator on the outside- a pelican with the voice of Geoffrey Rush.It is interesting how the director chose the animals to act in an abnormal behavior by converting to vegetarianism. This supports the overall theme of unity between humans and animals due to the similar behaviors between the two.The first scenes of Finding Nemo are a little unsettling, as we realize the movie is going to be about fish and not people. But of course, animation has long since learned to relate other species to humankind and to care about fish quickly becomes easy as caring about mice or ducks or Bambi.Finding Nemo provides a pleasant experience to watch or all audiences from children to grownups. The movie contains many twists and jokes that only adults would understand. Finding Nemo is a truly great movie and will keep you at the edge of your seat guessing what will happen next."	5.0	Finding Nemo: The Movie For All Ages	2009-12-01	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1VBXT6UMSUKUX	Amazon Customer	"The animation in this movie certainly is gorgeous--you'd have to be blind to not appreciate it--particularly the backgrounds. As in much animation of this sort, the landscapes (or in this case seascapes) are fantastic; the way the light dapples and shifts over the objects is quite wonderful. Also common to this type of animation is the strange rubbery or plastic-like appearance to the characters; they are lacking a certain amount of surface articulation that would make them appear more realistic.Content. Oh dear. Aside from being hetero-normative (all the little fish are in male-female family units cranking-out babies) and sexist (Dory the dumb-blue, or is that dumb-blonde, female), it's just a painfully trite story. (I like Albert Brooks, but he just whines a little too much in this for me to take; the sad-sack fish business gets tiresome very quickly. Also--Great Barrier Reef...Australia...why do only some of the characters have Australian accents?)So, the other big downsides to the content, for other than the most infantile viewer, are that it is unbelieveably formulaic; this reads like dozens of other bad kiddy flicks, just set underwater. The heavy-handed morality leaves me feeling beat over the head; I haven't learned anything from watching this, and no one else will either. Again, there is no real story in this movie--it's as if the Pixar people said ""we can do this underwater thing--just tack any story onto it."" And when you get down to it, there is no character development at all.Marlin's search for Nemo, and its concommitant chase scenes (yawn), is terribly predictable, and smacks of ""future theme park ride"" plotting. Nemo's character is obviously ""future stuffed animal"" and ""future action figure"" marketing. This film couldn't be more consumerist in its development; I find it offensive to watch something that is so blatantly geared towards either ""The Sequel"" or ""Xmas Buying Season.""So what do we learn by the end of the movie? Marlin is longer depressed, but equally unbearable, he's manic! (does he suffer from BiPolar Disorder?), and he's learned to let-go a bit. Nemo, perhaps, has a new-found respect for his father; and has learned not to go swimming off into the deep dark sea.Is this the final moral of this film? Don't leave home; don't try new things; don't take risks... It's a sad society that supports such ideas for its youth; growth comes from risk, from developmental traumas, and from exploring what is new. I can't recommend this movie for anything other than the visual--in terms of content, there is definitely nothing new here."	3.0	Gorgeous Animation; Worthless Content	2003-11-11	7	2	5

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A21NGY8THKVDS6	Amazon Customer	I know that the top negative review states that the 3D is subdued in this movie, but that reviewer must have a really bad 3D TV.First, let's get a few things out of the way- your TV makes a difference (bad 3D TV = subdued 3D), your type of 3D TV makes a difference (active may give you headaches due to flickering effects and the weight of the glasses), and 3D does NOT mean that things need to fly out of your screen and into the middle of the room to qualify as 3D. In fact, the reason many people claim that 3D gives them headaches is due to too MUCH coming out towards you... so your best 3D films make use of the space IN the TV, not out of it. If you want 3D that shoots out at you, get a cheesy movie built poorly and enjoy the nausea.Why computer animation is SOOOO much better than live action is that with live action, many companies convert their films to 3D with the use of a computer, so things may look weird or out of place. Field depth may be off and you're seeing what the conversion computer thinks you should see. Avatar looked amazing in 3D because they literally built 2 cameras side by side which gave you a true-to-life 3D experience. In computer animation, they simply add another camera next to the original one and re-process the movie with the two cameras working together, just like Avatar. So in other words, it's true 3D, not converted.Finding Nemo is the best of the best when it comes to 3D. The fish may not come out of the screen at you often (though my daughter DID continually reach out toward them), they constantly look like they are swimming in true water. The floaties in every scene are constantly at different depths and flow with the water, making me feel like I was watching a giant tank. If you want to impress your friends, show them the scene where the jelly fish show up, the scene where the whale comes towards them (and in this version, coming toward YOU... creepy!!), and the seagull chase scene. I have yet to find a person who wasn't impressed (including several self-proclaimed 3D haters). It truly is astounding, and though I know the 3D splits the image for each eye, so technically you are seeing a lower resolution image in each, I swear that it looked better and I saw more detail in the 3D version than the 2D.After we watched this we immediately bought Monster's Inc in 3D... and yes, it too is just as impressive. Finding Nemo's 3D actually impressed me more than Avatar did, and those that have seen both on my TV agree with me. If you enjoy 3D at home with a really good 3D set, this is THE 3D movie you cannot pass up. If you're going to invest in some 3D movies, go with the Pixar computer animated features- you won't regret it. Don't buy just any animated feature based on the fact that they are in 3D, but when you get the best ones in 3D, it's worth the investment.(Edit: After quite a few 3D movies passing through my TV, this one still stands out as the absolute best. Again, this is the best 3D movie to date in my opinion.)	5.0	The Best 3D Movie I Own!	2013-08-11	6	6	0

I guess my expectations were too high (like seeing fish swimming in the middle of the room) so it was slightly disappointing not to have 3D effects more expressed with all possibilities this movie provides. Not sure if it's done on purpose so not to scare kids but comparing to other 3Ds this is almost like a regular movie,great and very vivid, but more 2D. I was showing 2 min previews of 3D movies from Vudu to my 5 year old before that and after watching this movie I asked if it looked like these 3ds to her. She said ""not really"". So even as this movie itself great I don't think it's the best 3D implementation of it."	3.0	Great original movie, 3D effects are quite subdued	2013-03-08	4	2	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6XDSKT6DN2ZT	"Amber E. Martin ""thepursued"""	"I love this movie and we watch it over and over again.  The characters are really and believeable (as far as talking fish can be believeable.)  The boy who does the voice for Nemo does a great job at ""not"" acting.  He even kind of stammers when talking about Sandy Plankton in the beginning of the movie which makes his character even more real.  The visuals are awesome, although, they really need to work on making the actual people look better and not so computer generated.  The plot good for little kids though a little lacking for me.  When Marlin (the dad) and Nemo finally meet up again there is little emotional rejoicing on my part.  It seems as though the moment was a little overdue.  The humor in the movie is funny and keeps me laughing even after watching it several times.On behalf of my 2 year-old son I must say that he does enjoy this movie, especially the sharks.  He is a little scared by Bruce until he starts laughing then my son starts laughing.  It's also a great way to introduce him to some underwater life.Pixar does give this film a different feel that the light-hearted predecessors, but that's not a bad thing.  If that's what you are looking for it this movie you may be disappointed in the offering.  Just like with music and musicians each release should (hopefully) offer the public something different and not the same product just repackaged. Pixar contiunes to bring high quality films with high quality stories to families and I will continue looking forward to their next release."	5.0	A Family Favorite	2004-05-05	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AO42UWCM948O4	Amy Billings	In the true spirit of Disney/Pixar classics, such as Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, and Toy Story 2. Finding Nemo is definetly one of the greatest family movies to come out on DVD this year.The graphics of this movie are bright and realistic, it is easy for both children and adults alike to become entranced with the colors and animation.  Under the sea is shown as a bright blue with rushing currents and gurgling bubbles, and other realistic features of the ocean floor.  There is also an excellent depiction of a salt water fish tank in a dentist's office, which is represented realistically as well.The characters in this movie have been brought to life with their human-like personalities and animated voices.  They are truly humorus and touching.  Nemo, the star of this fabulous flick, is a young clown fish who became caught up in an adventure of a lifetime.  His father Marlin, a clown fish as well, also becomes caught up in this fun-filled, family oriented adventure searching for his son.  There are many other characters in Finding Nemo who add to the sense of adventure and family.Finding Nemo also has a lesson to be learned, as most Disney films do.  I  will not give it away, but I will say the story surrounds family relationships and friendship.  For children this is a great movie that impresses the importance of family and friendship in a fun way.  For adults, Finding Nemo is a simple way we are reminded of what is important in life.  This film has a certain family quality that most of us can relate to.In conclusion, Finding Nemo is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.  With its bright graphics, animated characters, warm and touching story line, Finding Nemo is a definite must see for people of all ages.	4.0	Finding Nemo is Fun for the Whole Family	2003-11-18	2	2	0

I love all of their movies to date, but this one is by far the best!  I would give it 10 stars, but I'm limited to only five.  This movie contains non-stop action and comedy!

Many of the images are simply amazing!  One of my favorite scenes is when Nemo and is friends are on their way to school.  The images of the reef as they swim by are spectacular.  I also love the images of Sydney.  They look so realistic.I've waited over 8 months for this movie (that's when I saw the first trailer) and it was well worth it!

A beautiful Embossed front with Nemo (if you can see him, it would have been nice to have a film called Finding Nemo with Nemo actually on the cover and not the German Title) but it still has Bruce as the main picture, that is still a stunning beautiful design. The inside artwork is actually a scene from the movie and the rear is of the mentioned Clown fish swimming away in the distance. Very nice indeed!'Finding Nemo', is Pixar's fifth film, builds its dramatic spine from a parent's greatest fear. We've all been children faced with an overbearing parent who spoils the fun out of unnecessary paranoia; and many of us have been, or will be, the parent who would do anything to protect our children, like say spoil some fun. Marlin [Albert Brooks] is a clown fish who, after losing his wife and all but one single egg, is trying to be a good father to his young son, Nemo. Scarred by his traumatic experiences, Marlin becomes so over-protective that, in a moment of rebellion, Nemo wanders too far away from the coral reef where a human diver captures him.Unable to stop the fish-napping, Marlin embarks on a quest to rescue his son, evading sharks and exploding WWII mines and jellyfish and whales and hungry birds. Along the way, he befriends Dory [Ellen Degeneres], a loyal blue tang fish with hysterical short-term memory problems. Through this journey, Marlin must not only face impossible odds and show more courage than he ever has, but he must grow and change as a father. The only way for him to be a great father is to trust that Nemo must do some things - even really hard things on his own.I love the way PIXAR makes movies about personal passions. Toys and insects, cars, super heroes, monsters, fairy tales and of course fish. You can tell the 'Nemo' filmmakers love the ocean and all the miracles hiding within. When films are made like this, that passion is completely contagious. Or to put it another way, the passion put into PIXAR animation transforms into inspiration for all children and adults in the real world to learn and care about real things.3D Blu-ray Video Quality - The 1080p encoded 3D experience is just awesome, and the film's vast ocean wonderland is a playground of convincing depth and dimensionality. Fish slowly swim right out of the screen, reefs stretch far into the watery distance, aquarium rocks and decorations provide a sense of boxed-in space and suitably cramped scope, sharks and sea turtles float in and out of the foreground, jellyfish clump believably to form a net of deadly obstacles, and the movie looks as if it were designed from the ground-up with a 3D presentation in mind. There also isn't any further aliasing or 3D-related anomalies to report, there aren't very many on-screen visuals or elements that fall victim to crosstalk (and those that do will only do so on 3D displays that are already prone to ghosting), and I didn't encounter much of anything that will give anyone pause. Ultimately, Finding Nemo's 3D presentation is as spectacular as its 2D counterpart and will surely delight long-time fans and newcomers of all ages. My scores for both Blu-ray discs rounds up to a nice, well-deserved 10.3D Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD surrounded track is again totally awesome. Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without a single muffled line, drowned cry for help or waterlogged whisper. No small feat considering just the exceedingly enveloping and engaging nature of Nemo's meticulously mixed undersea sound field. The rear speakers never rest and never relent. Schools of fish dart by, sharks circle, predators give chase, jellyfish press in, bubbles scurry toward the surface, fins flap, tails flick, sand swishes, anemone rustle, plankton flee a pursuing whale, seagulls mount a hungry assault and distant sounds echo through the ocean. Moreover, water flows, currents surge and waves lap throughout the proceedings, and there isn't a moment underwater when the sea isn't incorporated or represented to unmistakably immersive ends. Output is terrific too, with powerful low-end pulses, truly intense chase sequences and deep, resonant booms. And if a shark or whale is about to take the soundstage, prepare yourself for a thrilling, all-encompassing surround experience. Simply put, everything from the faintest blub blub blub to the most harrowing scene to the ebb and flow of Thomas Newman's pitch-perfect music sounds utterly fantastic.Blu-ray 3D Special Features and Extras:Aquariums: A collection of short-loop ocean floor screensavers.

Thankfully, Disney's / PIXAR Blu-ray release is a lot tougher to criticise thanks to a stunning video presentation, an excellent 3D experience, a top-tier 7.1 Dolby TrueHD surround track, and a treasure trove of special features, many of which are new to this release. So all in all this is a totally awesome Limited SteelBook Edition Blu-ray 3D, which is now in pride of place with my other fantastic brilliant extensive PIXAR Blu-ray Collection. But I suspect you are wondering why I purchased this particular Limited SteelBook Edition Blu-ray 3D from France, well I am not going to pay well over inflated prices that are on offer from other Amazon outlets and it is a small price to pay for a Cover that is only partially in English.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A28ODAXRLNIIX3	Andrew Crosby	First off I must explain that I was sixteen when I saw this, and I don't have any sort of appreciation for mushy uplifting movies from Disney. However my problem with this film is that its been so wrongly labeled as like a sort of comedy. Quite frankly its a boring 1 and a half hour tirade of some stupid fish dad trying to find his little kid. Theres nothing funny whatsoever about it. It's..Boring... Then add to this films detracting features we also have the annoying and never intelligent Ellen Degeneres as the voice of some dumb founded fish. Honestly the movie sucks, it might be enjoyable for the little ones, but I dont even I could find this crap watchable at that age, especially given the low attention spans. If you want a good family flick and by family I mean everyone single person, can enjoy watch Shrek, or better yet one of Disney's classics like the Lion King, Aladdin, or Snow White. Please for the sake of your childrens taste in movies, keep the lil chitlins away from this garbage.Oh yeah, and those stupid turtles surfer dudes, dumbest most pointless attempt at humour...ever.	1.0	Touching it may be, but humorous tis not	2004-07-04	65	11	54
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I have a thing for Pixar movies (you know, unless they star a bunch of uninspired vehicles) and this film was really the start of my adoration for them.  Sure, everyone and their mother (and my three-year-old) loves `Toy Story', but it is `Finding Nemo' that really spoke to me as a moviegoer and as a human being, and it is a film that continually reaches the pit of me, now more so than ever since I became a father.Beautifully inspired and sentimentally executed, `Finding Nemo' is one of the more heartfelt offerings from Pixar.  It follows the adventure of a tragedy stricken clownfish, Marlin, as he searches the depths of the sea for his one and only son Nemo.  Marlin has already suffered enough in his life (the films outset discloses to us a savage attack that leaves Marlin a widower among other things) and so as his young son grows older he finds himself more and more protective as he is forced to loosen the reigns.  When Nemo is abducted by a scuba-diver, Marlin becomes frantic and begins a seemingly pointless search for his son.  Along the way he meets a series of odd fellows, not the least of which is Dory, one of the funniest creations in the history of animated cinema.And that pretty much sums up the bulk of this beautiful tale.  What makes `Finding Nemo' so effortless and impressionable is the fact that it truly balances out every aspect of the film with a finesse and subtle honesty that is lost in a lot of animated features.  Instead of going for a bounty of obvious laughs, `Finding Nemo' crafts something that feels more personal and pure.It goes for the heart.Pixar is known now for delivering moving experiences, upping the ante so-to-speak for animated filmmakers the world around, daring them to create something that defies the boundaries experienced within the genre.  With nearly all of their films they have done that very thing.As a father, I really connect with the sentiment presented in this film.  You can feel the unwavering love that Marlin feels for Nemo.  In knows no bounds.  He is Marlin's world.  Nemo is Marlin's only connection to a past he wishes was his present.  He lost so much and so he invests every ounce of his time to making sure that he never loses what he still has.  This has created within him a deep appreciation for his son, but it also has created an unbalanced view of his parental obligations, something that served as a hindrance and something that he needed to correct (or at least smooth out).  I know how it feels to want to smother the innocence of your child with protection.  You never want anything to harm them, whether it be physical or emotional.  That said; protection when abused can become destructive, and that is something that Marlin needed to realize.  For me, `Finding Nemo' beautifully broaches the complexities of parenthood without trying to be preachy or too literal.  It simply allows the audience to soak in the purity as it comes.Oh yeah, and the film looks beautiful too (in all it's undersea wonderment).	5.0	This movie is just precious!	2010-08-11	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	"Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.Grade: A"	5.0	"Finding Nemo is a great ""catch"" for the whole family"	2006-10-16	4	3	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A16NUQ48R46KUY	Anonymous	"This is the most profitable animated movie of all time and there's a reason for that.  The plot is excellent, the voices of people like Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Willem Defoe, and Geoffrey Rush are skillfully done, and the scenery is just amazing. . .so beautiful and realistic that you simultaneously feel like you could swim in the water and that you want a print of every scene for your wall (well, maybe not the scene when they're in the dark. . .)I took another look at this one the other day and, although Disney/Pixar went with a special features format that doesn't make it the easiest to access, the special features it does have are really quite good.  See, the special features are split up, with some on the full-screen DVD and some on the wide-screen DVD (both versions are included).  I found that the better features are on the wide-screen DVD.  That one has an amazing visual tour with such highlights as watching Ellen DeGeneres and Geoffrey Rush reading their lines (surprisingly entertaining) and snippets on the evolution of the characters and story.  There are also pictures of the models that they used for the characters and the aquarium feature on the wide-screen DVD has different scenes that you can choose.  On the full-screen disc, Msr. Cousteau's ""documentary"" is a highlight.This is a truly wonderful movie.  Everyone I know who's seen it, loves it."	5.0	Great movie	2003-12-04	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3H15HXDHH6TPB	Another happy customer	My 5 star is for the vendor, not the product.  I cannot imagine anyone purchasing Nemo had not seen it yet.  That is why I am writing about what I consider most important, my experience, not the movie.  The DVD had some type of glitch.  In the beginning few seconds, the image froze as if streaming a video from a very slow ISP.  Then when it started back up, there were voices, but they did not correlate with the picture.  I contacted the vendor and got a very pleasant response.  The vendor was apologetic and immediately started the process to refund me.  What more can you ask for?  The vendor did not make it; if I have any gripes about it, I should take it up with Disney.  I guess things could have been a lot different if I had dealt with some of the vendors from hell I have read about.  I would definitely use this vendor again.	5.0	Great movie, but I had to return it	2012-07-30	5	0	5
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A32MCD01AP5JP5	Anthony Peak	From the previews alone I could tell Finding Nemo would be below par. After watching the movie, I'm sure of it. This movie is long, dull, and overly sentimental. The voices are horribly annoying, mainly Ellen DeGeneres. She's just plain horrible as an actress and a voice actress. Albert Brooks is okay, not great but not bad. I'd say the only really good voices in the movie are Crush played by Andrew Stanton, and Bruce played by Barry Humphries. And they're just extras with only a handful of lines.The story will bore you to death and you'll feel like Nemo trying to just get away from it to have some fun with the movie. Folks marvel at the graphics, but come on... you really think this is impressive? It's nothing compared to Pixar's past. Let's see... the incredible detail of Monsters Inc, or the ocean where you're lucky to see 20 feet in front of you and a few small fish.All in all, I say skip this movie. It's much like watching an aquarium on a slow day; If you've got nothing else to do, it can be entertaining to gawk at the fish.- Rirath_com	2.0	Just okay at best	2003-06-22	44	7	37

The tale about fish (and other animal) world pitted against intruding humans in the quest for the lost orange-white clown-fish called Nemo highlights family and friendship values, and as such is a perfect family fun. Beautiful colours and animation, nice music and even occasional hints at human culture may have even more morose viewers smiling every once in a while. Don't expect anything deep, but this is cute and pure film fun, free of anything violent and controversial, yes, it's also for your little ones.	4.0	Find Nemo and Have Fun!

It's one of the best family films I have ever seen. This moive was an exciting,funny,comedy and adventure. Dory was a funny fish, but a trouble maker. Dory always put Nimo's father in trouble. Even though they took lots of time looking for Nimo,at the end of the movie they found him alive. Everyone was happy - including the viewers!	5.0	The Lovely Fish	2003-10-30	1	1	0

It's almost like reviewers don't even think about the films anymore. If it has the Pixar logo, it's a masterpiece.Well I don't subscribe to that idea. Pixar is definately the best animation house in the United States, and all their films are good, but I found Nemo struggling to live up to the legacy. Don't get me wrong, Nemo isn't bad. It's formula at it's best. Seriously the plot plays out like this: Nemo get's captured. Dad needs to find Nemo. Insert handful of random encounters along journey. Nemo found.Nemo is missing anything resembling any originality. That doesn't make it a bad film, but it does keep it from being a great film. Visually, Nemo is as impressive as anything Pixar has ever done. The voice acting and character animation is all top notch. The directing is probably the most lacking of all previous Pixar films; some scenes just don't seem to flow into each other well. You may catch yourself thinking, ""but wait, I thought..."" from one scene to the next at times like when the two main character are about to be seagull food. One is shown getting away, while the other is shown being tugged at by several seagulls. The next thing you know, both are safe with no logical transition. This happened a few times and it was a little annoying.Still, you'll leave the theatre thinking this is one of the best movies you've seen all year (as if that was saying much this year). If you like previous Pixar flicks, you'll probably like this one as well. It's just not as good as it could have been."	4.0	Pixar still has the magic but it's losing it's potency.	2003-06-06	2	1	1

I must say...hats off to the Disney and Pixar studios who put this one together because you did a fantastic job! This film is filled with lovable characters (the turtles, Dory, Marlin, Bruce, and of course Nemo) and witty dialogue that is great for all ages. The plot keeps us strumming along as we follow an uptight and very nervous father on his journey with the hilarious Dory on their search for a little clown fish named Nemo.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AOAAX92CVVC1M	Ashley Elizabeth Blair Tetzlaff	Okay, so I had heard about this movie for years and years, about how it was some wonderful, amazing drama.I was a little disappointed. There wasn't that much singing (for a Disney movie), and it was mostly just swimming... and swimming... and swimming.Story line: Boy disobeys Dad and gets in trouble. Dad rescues boy, then apologizes to son for being too strict. (Boy never apologizes for getting into trouble.)I did find the Sharks Anonymous part funny. That was probably the best part in the whole movie.I thought parts were just too scary for kids under six. But older kids would probably do just fine.Overall, interesting movie, but not as good as I had always heard.	3.0	Okay... beautiful scenery, too scary for little kids, kinda boring	2014-05-23	2	1	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AMCUKPN0K2VMR	Ashley Figley	I have always purchased such Disney animated DVDs that were the classics I grew up with such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty, etc, released as a Special Edition or Collector's Edition.  Finding Nemo I bought partly for the Disney name, but also because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  I was very surprised by how much I liked this film!  Disney films are surprisingly a little more tragic and frightening than I remembered, but also a lot more funny.  Dory (Ellen Degeneres) is definitely much-needed comedic relief for some of the rather intense &quot;getaway&quot; sequences.  Finding Nemo I don't think I would recommend for a child under 5 (the sharks and intensity of some scenes might scare some little ones).However I think this film was beautifully and imaginitively written.  Each different type of fish had its own personality and &quot;cultural&quot; differences, which merely introduces examples of tolerance and multiculturalism.  If you have NO idea what I'm talking about, go buy the DVD, it's really worth it.	4.0	Imaginitively Written Characters	2003-12-26	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1FJFDN2R367S2	A S K	This is a great kids movie well done in every way but one. I am not sure why but for some reason Disney decided to totally disrespect the Dolphin in this film. There are no Dolphin characters, and the only mention of the Dolphin, is in the context of a few sharks at a fish eating anonymous support group meeting, they are reciting how fish are not food, but fish are they're friends and then one say's &quot;except flipping Dolphins&quot;.The offending shark then goes on a diatribe about the Dolphin, &quot;oh look at me i'm a flipping dolphin hehehe look at me do a flip aren't i cute&quot; yadda yadda yadda more Dolphin dissin'. Anyway this is interesting because in all of it's politically correct glory Disney somehow manages to create a ultra cutting edge (strictly form a graphics perspective) movie, a movie that will be a vehicle for Billions of dollars in retail sales for the movies characters for years to come. I have no idea why but I am sure for a very good reason the decision was made to leave out the cause d'celebre of the sea the Dolphin, perhaps they feel there is enough public awareness regarding the plight of the Dolphin and the destruction of it's habitat as well as the trapping of Dolphins in the net's of tuna fishermen. Whatever the reason it clearly was not an oversight and the decison was deliberatley made to not have a Dolphin character in the film. Interestingly the seagulls in this film are given rather harsh treatment as well although it is in the spirit of fun, at least it's understandable to the extent that many view the seagull as a flying rat; therefore portraying them as unsavory moron's I guesss is understandable if not acceptable.	3.0	Why disrespect the dolphin?	2004-01-25	9	3	6

It hung/skipped from 1:00 until 1:07. We have returned the movie to Amazon and are having it replaced. I saw another person on a different site complaining about the same problem on the DVD disk. Very disappointed in Disney trying to save a few pennies at the customers expense. Typical America business pratice today. As far as the 3D portion, it was good to watch the movie again after such a long time but I expected more our of Disney for the 3D portion. I want items to pop out of the screen and very few times did that happen. If you do not own Nemo and want to buy it though I would recommend buying the 3D version over the reguler version.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	Pixar makes great films, and FINDING NEMO is no exception.  Nemo is a young clownfish living with his dad (voiced by Albert Brooks) who is taken by a scuba-diving dentist to live in his office tank.  When Nemo's dad takes off after the boat to get his son back, he meets Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), who tries to help him despite her horrible short-term memory.  Along the way Marlin and Dory encounter sharks, turtles, jellyfish and seagulls, while Nemo befriends his fellow aquarium dwellers, who are busy planning an escape.While I think the first segment of the film, in which Nemo's mother and all his siblings are devoured by a predator, should have been omitted, the movie is otherwise a lot of fun and very entertaining.  You might want to skip this first segment if you are watching with young kids.The disc set is loaded with great feautures, including the film in widescreen or fullscreen format, a virtual aquarium, commentary track, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a documentary on exploring the reefs with Jacques Cousteau's son, trailers, a short film, a game and many featurettes.Great movie, great deal!	5.0	great 2-disc edition of a new classic animated film	2003-11-22	4	3	1

When Nemo disobeys his father, he is caught in a net and taken away only to be placed in a fishtank with other fish.  Marlin, accompanied by his new absent-minded friend Dory, sets out to find his son.  While Nemo and his tankmates scheme on how to get out of the tank before he becomes the dentist's niece's new pet.  This film was very, very well done.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MQAQT8C6D1I7	AverageReviewer	"Of all the children's movies I own, my daughter loves Finding Nemo the best and that in turn has had me watch Finding Nemo about 327 times.  Thankfully it is a wonderful movie and the more I watched it the more I came to appreciate all the wonderful nuances of the story.Basically this is a story of two clown fish: a father and a son.  The son, Nemo, is captured by a diver who is also a dentist.  Nemo winds up in the dentist's aquarium.  Nemo's dad begins a quest to find his son making all kinds of friends along the way while Nemo and the rest of the aquarium fish plot how to escape.It's a wonderful story and no wonder it has made hundreds of millions of dollars.In addition to the great story, the visual rendering is just plain gorgeous.  Everything is so crisp and vivid - it's like being in the ocean or in an aquarium.If you have a child - do yourself a favor and get this for your kid.  It has a ton of cautionary tales built in like ""don't go with strangers"" ---- my daughter keeps asking, ""I want to see Nemo going with a stranger."" and she buries her head against my chest when Nemo gets captured.In addition, when your kid gets hooked on Nemo at least you can retain your sanity after watching it 200+ times....there are some shows out there that would just plain drive me nuts if I had to watch more than once.

By the end of the film, the kid was crying and visibly shaken, and my wife and I practically felt the same way.  I recently vetted the film for a four-year old, and decided my first impression was right: this isn't a good movie for really little kids to watch.""Finding Nemo"" is a very intense film, both thematically and visually.  The script is clever, but it works mostly on an adult level, and most little kids will probably experience the movie on a much more basic, gut level - the rapid-fire dialog will zoom over their heads, while the images and action may terrify them. And once the action starts, it hardly lets up for a second -- the film is a rollercoaster ride of anxiety and peril, ""Bambi"" to the Nth degree.Which isn't to say it's not entertaining, intelligent or well made... It is, but I would strongly caution people with very young children to think twice before showing them this movie. It's really more appropriate for an older audience, maybe eight years of age and older...Younger than that and it may just be too scary.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"I suspect all the rest of you have already seen this, but when it first came out, it was hailed as a children's film, and I don't go to children's films in the theaters. In fact, I no longer go to theaters at all. But I knew someday I'd have a DVD player, and would start buying movies.  This one was worth the wait.Marlin and Pearl, two clown fish, have a clutch of eggs (Pearl estimates about 500), and they are almost ready to hatch when the story opens. But Pearl and most of the eggs are eaten by what I think was a barracuda. One egg survived, and the grieving Marlin put all his energy into raising his only son, Nemo. Nemo has one ""bad fin,"" which he and his father refer to as his lucky fin, which is clearly a great deal smaller than the other. But he can swim OK, and his overprotective father gets on his nerves.One day, angry at his father's fears for him, he decides he's going to go out to the ""butt"" (boat) anchored nearby and touch it. However, through a bizarre series of events, he ends up captured by the diver that comes upon him unexpectedly and taken back to his salt water aquarium in his dental office.The other fish in the tank help him learn the ways of the tank, but a serious danger threatens. They hear the dentist say that he plans to give the clown fish (i.e., Nemo) to his niece. They know her to be a thoughtless and selfish fish-killer. The last one her uncle gave her was killed by her shaking the plastic bag he was in too hard.Meanwhile, back at the reef, Marlin is determined to follow the boat and find Nemo and somehow get him back. He has no idea how once he finds he cannot swim fast enough to keep up with the boat. He asks a blue fish whether she has seen a boat go by recently, and she says yes, it went that way.This blue fish is Dory, the absolutely lovable absent-minded kook played to perfection by Ellen DeGeneres. She actually reminds me of my former neighbor back in California, Lexi, who was every bit as lovable and almost as kooky.Needless to say, Dory and Marlin go off to look for Nemo, and have amazing adventures along the way. One of the best parts is a group of sea turtles that are riding the AEC (Australian Eastern Current) to Sydney, which is where Dory figured out Nemo had been taken. The diver had dropped his face mask, which had his name and address on it, and Dory can read. I'm not sure we ever find out why Dory can read, but I suppose she went to school. [very old joke, that]The interesting thing is that while the story is improbable from the start -- find one little fish in that great big ocean? -- there is always an explanation, however bizarre, for everything that happens. It goes without saying that Marlon and Nemo eventually find each other, but it would be downright cruel to spoil it by telling you how. As I say, perhaps improbable in the extreme, but if you buy the fact that fish can talk and understand human language, the rest is plausible.I loved this movie a great deal, and thank my friend Dory (different one, I think) warmly for encouraging me to get it."	5.0	So Funny, So Charming, Such Great Animation!	2012-05-14	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AJ0O0Z3QLVZWD	Becky White	My 8-year old grandson and I watched this one evening, and I was more than pleasantly surprised by the fun I had.  The characters and voices are so lively, and it's a wonderful message for people of all ages.  I haven't watched a cartooon in years, and found the humor geared to adults and children equally.  (It really is amazing what they can do with the computer cartoon drawing nowadays --  it was like watching real people!)  If you want to spend quality time with youngsters, while being entertained, then this is the perfect film.  If you are a romantic, like me, you might even find need of a tissue later in the film.  Both the humor and poignancy will wet your eyes.  Enjoy!	5.0	A wonderful cartoon for all ages.	2005-08-27	9	9	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3LRFGYJVXKPDI	Bennett Turk	"""Finding Nemo"" the latest hit from Pixar, is the biggest movie of 2003, (as of Aug. 7, 2003).  It has made more money than any other film released this year, and gotten 99% approval rating from ""Rotten Tomatoes"", the movie critics website, which is better than any 2003 movie up to this date.  It has a great story, the voices are perfectly matched to their characters they portray, it is an original script, and the techincal aspects are very well done.  The story concerns an over-protective father clownfish, Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to get his only surviving son, Nemo, who was caught by a scuba diver and taken away.  The film does start off with a violent scene involving a barracuda, the wife, and their other fish eggs.  Most of the violence does take place off camera, but, this is strong, real-life action for very young children. The action takes place between the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney Harbor, and there is one mild negative comment made about Americans.  The sea life is the type a person would find in the area.  Pixar used Professor Adam Summers, from the Univ. Of California at Irvine, in the making of the movie so it's usually accurate, but there is one scene that is impossible.  Marlin, and Dory, a blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, (who's the best character in the very talented cast), are caught in the mouth of a baleen whale, and they escape through the whale's blowhole.  This can never happen because a whale's lungs and mouth are not connected, otherwise, a whale might drown trying to eat. The water that comes out of the whale is condensation, similar to exhaling on a cold day. This one scene does spoil an otherwise perfect movie.  I think Pixar wanted the visuals of being ejected from the whale's spout, instead off being released out of the mouth.  Marlin and Dory, shallow water fish, also meet a very deep sea angler fish, but, I can overlook that mistake. The whale escape aside, the movie is great, and I plan on getting the DVD when it is released in November 2003.  This is an instant classic, and it will probably get the ""People's Choice"" award for favorite film of 2003."	5.0	99% Perfect! The escape from the whale was impossible.	2003-08-08	18	9	9

Dravis ""BETTY DRAVIS, author/reviewer"""	"My great-grandson Devon is at the age where he's entranced by cartoons, so I bought a used version of this movie in order to be able to buy him more.He lives in another city, but his mother told me he loves it so-ooo much. She said his eyes grew round as beach balls as the breathtaking underwater world of Australia's Great Barrier Reef unfolded before his eyes. His mouth flew open when Nemo was captured by a scuba-diver and got separated from his father, a nervous clownfish named Marlin. Then as the adventure progressed with Nemo meeting a scatter-brained blue fish named Dory and on through all kinds of wondrous, colorful critters--including sharks, jellyfish, sea turtles, pelicans and more--Devon fidgeted with pleasure...and anticipation...I saw this movie years ago and loved it. Since Devon and I are kindred spirits (I'm a big kid at heart), I thought he would enjoy it and am delighted that he does.Since 1,049 other people reviewed this movie before me, there's not much left to say, but it made Devon happy and kept him entertained (a big help to his mother, I'm sure)...and that's good enough for me!I'm very impressed with the awesome job Pixar does with all its movies; from animation to voice-overs to graphics, these filmmakers can't be beat! Pixar, as you might know, is the Academy Award-winning creator of ""Toy Story 1, 2 and 3,"" ""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""It's a Bug's Life,"" and more.Devon and I both recommend this movie to kids of all ages!Reviewed by Betty Dravis, September 18, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books"	5.0	Devon loves it!

Also pleasing to me was the inclusion of an audio description track for the blind. It's nice that audio description is on more and more movies that are released on DVD and Blu-ray, and not just in the theaters. So five stars for the movie, as well as the inclusion of the AD track by Pixar.Accessing the track:If you have an audio button on your DVD/Blu-ray player's remote, simply press it once the movie begins. Otherwise, you must unfortunately go into the menus to turn on the audio description.Hopefully Amazon will consider adding the AD availability to their description next to closed captioning.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1AJ3U53CI6UJI	B. Munoz	Finding Nemmo recently one an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, which I think it deserves (let's just be glad that Lord of the Rings wasn't nominated- or else they would have one Ugh) It's a beautiful movie that takes place in Australia, in the Great Barrier Reef, and in Sydney. We follow, Marlin, searching for his only son, Nemo, who ends up in a fish tank in a dentists's office, about to become the gift of a destructive little girl Marlin meets many memorable characters along the way, including turtles, Dory, and sharks recovering from eating fish. My favorite character of all the ones that he meets is Dory. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect for Dory's voice, and Dory is a laugh out loud charcter. She suffers from a bad short term memor. So she'll meet Marlin and then soon forget who the heck he is. She also has many of the most memorable lines of the movie (Just keep swimming, E-S-C-A-P-E funny it's spelled just like escape) The only thing that I don't like about the movie is it's length, it got to be pretty long at parts. But it is a movie that I think will always be remembered, not only for it;s beautiful animation, but also for it's plot.	4.0	Finding Nemo- ONe of the best animated features	2004-03-02	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A108A421PC6MH3	Bob Stout	The animation in this show is extraordinary. Disney, or more correctly Pixar, have achieved a stunning success (imagine if this level of animation were used in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;!) But there's more to an animated feature than the artistry and technical virtuosity, and that's where Nemo lets  us down a bit.The secondary characters, Led By Ellen DeGeneres as Dory are outstanding and fully worthy of the artistry. Where I must quibble is with the main characters. The animation is highly three-dimensional, the secondary characters are three-dimensional, so why can't the two main characters be a little less from the Disney-esque mold of insipid two-dimensional wimps? I found the milquetoast father figure especially annoying. However, even Nemo himself isn't much better since he fails to fully grasp the cause and effect relationship between  his actions and their consequences. This is a common theme in Disney movies where a bratty kid gets in trouble and by the final frame all is forgotten. You never get the feeling that if another similar opportunity presented itself in the future that the kid would have learned enough to avoid it.But, ah, those irrepressible kids, eh? Not a good life lesson for the little ones...Otherwise, the story's pretty much straightforward Disney.  Engaging enough, but no real depth. An interesting contrast is the animated Sinbad movie released about the same time. Very idiosyncratic and somewhat disjointed animation, but a good story and characters with some depth. It even has a back story that unfolds as the adventure proceeds. I guess the suits at Disney don't give the kids enough credit to appreciate the difference.	4.0	Five stars for the animation, 3+ stars for everything else	2003-12-03	2	1	1

The plot keeps switching betwen Nemo's and his new friends' attempts to escape from the dentist's aquarium before his monstrous daughter comes to torture them; and Nemo dad's search; the film never loses momentum, providing a lavishly animated experience for the little ones. Unlike 'Shrek', or Pixar's earlier 'Toy Story I.II', 'Finding Nemo' has little appeal to parents.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A356HBGSVZ5NRH	"B.P. ""tilley_traveler"""	"More of an overprotective parent than a relaxed comedian clownfish, Marlin is determine to rescue Nemo, his only son and bring him back home to safety after he has been kidnapped and taken above water. In the process of his desperate chase, Marlin meets up with our next main character, the optimistic but absent minded Dory who accompanies Marlin on his quest, much to his disapproval. In such a vast watery world I couldn't help but ask (out loud and to the person sitting next to me even), just what can two little fish possible expect to do to save Nemo? And how are they actually going to locate lost Nemo when he's not even in the ocean anymore? The film wasn't all that easy to second guess; in fact I found that I wasn't even trying to second-guess. I was just enjoying the wonderment of its visual and narrative arrangement that took me along a colorful and sometimes extremely dark and dangerous underwater journey through a sunken submarine, a wild and ""righteous"" ocean current, inside a whale's mouth, into Sydney's Harbor and down the sink drain. Like the rising and falling water of ocean tides, the storyline has perfect flow and it was easy for me to get caught up in the drift of the movie's momentous current. I even shed a few tears, but then that's just typical me and the way I sometimes get with Disney films, Finding Nemo was no exception.Undoubtedly as expected, this movie possesses some spectacular animation from start to finish; the settings and characters appear as completely natural as you would find them in real life. Also the film has remarkable voice talent too, with numerous Australian accents and fabulous impressions of whale speak, which I thoroughly enjoyed. There is also an interesting mix of humor and tactful character dynamics that make the movie delightfully entertaining. Such as a self-help support group formed by three sharks trying to overcome an addiction of eating fish, and the confined ""pet store"" fish plotting to dirty up the aquarium tank like something awful, to the mass havoc and confusion caused by a pelican in the dental office are just to name a few of my favorites scenes.Although the film ended with a funny, lighthearted note and the whole story lingered in the mind quite nicely afterwards. I thought the final climax just before it turned out be happily ever after was a little too bewildering and a little too much larger than life. And I didn't care for it in part because of the mixed feelings it left in me with.But regardless, the film altogether is pretty cute, charming and innocent. It's a story about finding courage, finding friends, finding trust and putting faith in others and what they can do. It's also about realizing one's capabilities despite what they have been led to believe by others or what they might appear to be lacking. It seems to be a story all in its own, fitting for all ages to enjoy, interpret differently and take to heart on multiple levels, very good and well worth seeing."	5.0	Finding More Than Just Nemo!	2003-06-18	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3P99SK4SPH3KO	Bradford LeHew	I think I've had this movie for all of 2 weeks and I have watched it 4 times!  And I am 27 years old with no kids!  It's just a great movie all around.  Fantastic animation, wonderfully funny characters and an original storyline.  There's plenty of humor in here for kids, but also enough so the adults watching it with the little ones can laugh out loud too!Ellen Degeneres is classic as Dory--the short-term-memory-loss inflicted fish.  Practically everything she does in the film will elicit a laugh.  There are several scenes that I watch over and over again.The movie is about a young clown fish named Nemo and his father, Marlin.  Nemo is captured from his reef by some divers and his father goes out into the ocean to search for him.  Along the way, Marlin encounters Dory and a host of other sea creatures that eventually lead him to Sydney, where Nemo is being held hostage as a present for young Darla.  Marlin's adventures in the &quot;big blue&quot; teach him that being overprotective isn't the best way to raise his son.  It's a great message and the enounters along the way are simply hilarious.  I don't want to give away any more of the plot...you'll have to watch and see!There are so many extras with this DVD.  I liked the deleted scenes and director's commentary.  It's really amazing what kind of work goes into making an animated film of this magnitude.  Most of the deleted scenes are not fully animated, but it's an educational process just the same.All in all, this is sure to be a classic.  You will find yourself reciting lines from this movie almost immediately.  It's great for people of all ages, it's got a great message, the animation is crisp and realistic, and the characters are funny and have depth.  It's not what most people expect out of an animated film.  I don't know anyone who has seen this movie that doesn't rave about it!  A GREAT GIFT!	5.0	A great movie for EVERYONE!!	2003-12-01	11	10	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3MQQS40FK2QAQ	"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle"""	"FINDING NEMO is another victory for the Pixar Animation Studios and the Walt Disney Company. It is the 5th success in a row for the team, and that makes it a sad thing that Disney and Pixar are splitting their relationship with each other. I knew going in that it was going to be an amazing visual achievement--all of the previous Pixar films have been. What I didn't expect is for the film to make me laugh as hard as I did.Writer/Director Andrew Stanton has crafted a story that is simple, but not dimwitted like so many other children's films. A clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) loses his wife and almost all of his children except one: Nemo. This traumatic loss makes Marlin very overprotective of Nemo, which is demonstrated when Nemo goes on a field trip with his class to ""the drop"". Marlin is horrified about this and even more horrified to witness Nemo venturing past the drop to try touching a boat fishing line on a dare. Nemo is captured by a diver and Marlin attempts to save him. He barely gets near the boat when the motor starts and the boat takes off. The diver's mask comes loose and ends up at the bottom of the ocean.Marlin is determined to find his son no matter what it takes, and he soon finds himself paired up with a blue tang fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short-term memory loss. This causes endless frustration for Marlin, but it soon turns out that he needs Dory's help. Even though she cannot remember things she is able to read writing on the mask's strap: an address in Sydney, Australia. The two of them find themselves in a situation that had me laughing uncontrollably: A Shark's Anonymous session. I liked the name of the Great White that is leading the meeting: Bruce. This session is a distraction for Marlin, but the session gets even funnier when the leader's instinct for blood takes over his better judgement and he attacks Marlin & Dory. They escape by using the place where the session is held: A drowned submarine with water-mines surrounding it.While Marlin and Dory continue their search, Nemo finds himself stuck in a fish tank at a dentist's office in Sydney. All of the other fish are interesting and even funny. The leader is voiced by Willem Dafoe, playing a good guy for a change. But there is trouble happening. The dentist's daughter will be receiving one of the fish as a birthday present. The first time we see her in a photo, with braces and head-gear, I completely came apart laughing. Fish don't survive once they're in her hands, as the photo clearly shows. Later in the film when she appears at the door, I laughed again because of the music heard in the background. (If you see the movie you will agree it is the perfect music chosen.)I'm probably giving away too much of the story. I mentioned that it is simple but not dimwitted. At the Pixar studio John Lasseter was heavily influenced by the style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, who also avoids insulting an audience intelligence. From this movie Andrew Stanton must have learned from him as well. While he sets up situations for Marlin and Dory in their quest as well as with Nemo and the captured fish that actually had me on the edge of my seat, he finds some way to show me something I've never seen before. One thrilling sequence is when Marlin and Dory find themselves riding the East Austrailian Current (known as the EAC) on the shell of a sea turtle who talks like a hippie surfer dude. The current takes them on a clearly shown patten and at a high speed.I suspect that Disney will create a ride at Disneyland sometime in the future based on that. I would prefer to see it on a giant IMAX screen.I mentioned two scenes that had me laughing uncontrollably. Another one comes late in the film. Nemo is free and searching for his dad when he finally meets Dory. She and Marlin have split up because he thinks Nemo has died. A crab knows where he went but refuses to tell where. She finds a perfect way to get him to talk by using a flock of seagulls up at the surface. It is this type of humor as well as the visual looks and intelligent storytelling that make FINDING NEMO such a wonderful family film."	5.0	A visually astonishing and hilarious family film	2003-11-06	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K	"brewster22 ""brewster22"""	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of &quot;Toy Story,&quot; the insect world of &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot;) and in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net.  As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion.  But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; delivers there as well.  The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids.  The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.Grade: A	5.0	An Underwater Treasure	2004-01-07	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3PXHENWX4ODCZ	"bridget. ""unexplained robot"""	When it comes to this insanely popular film, I've found there are two groups of people: those who are fans of Pixar, and those who are fans of Finding Nemo. Some peopleare in both groups, some just one. Either way, there seems to be a definite difference between this film and Pixar's previous creations.The story of Finding Nemo is simple. Marlin, a single father to the 'handicapped' Nemo, is overly protective as his wife and the rest of his children were eaten by a shark. Nemo doesn't appreciate his father's behaviour (though it's clear he has never been told about his mother) and rebels. The consequence of this rebellion is that he is caught by a Sydney dentist on a leisurely scuba dive. When Nemo learns he's to be a gift tothe dentist'sserial fish-killing niece, he, along with his tankmates, tries to find a way to get free. At the same time, Marlin meets up with the short-term memory-impaired Dory and faces all of his fears to get to the Sydney Harbour to try to save Nemo.This movie is a couple of things. It's the kid-rebels-then-realizes-his-mistakes movie. It's the father-is-overprotective-then-realizes-his-mistakes movie. It's the road trip movie. It's the prison movie. It's all these clich&eacute; storylines put together and done with fish, quite frankly. However, this movie is also beautifully animated and amazingly colourful. This would be why the kiddies like it so.Unfortunately, I find Finding Nemo leaves something lacking for the adults.It's not up to par with Pixar's previous creations in the story department. Personally, I have no feelings one way or the other about fish as animals. People like animal movies because of the kinds of animals - cats, dogs, bears, horses - fish, let's face it, just aren't cuddly and cute. The upside? The turtles in Finding Nemo are the best Pixar characters since the mutated toys in Toy Story.The DVD of Finding Nemo is definitely for children. There are a few behind the scenes documentaries but they lack the fun of, for example, the Monsters, Inc 'Making Of's. The second disc is packed full of games and other things for young children. Even the marine life documentary with Jacques Costeau has him speaking to the audience as if they were 4 years old.Ultimate verdict? It's great for kids, and the movie is worth seeing at least once. However,if you don't have any children, I'd recommend just renting this one.	2.0	Turtles = cool.	2004-05-21	11	5	6

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	Winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Finding Nemo continues the Disney tradition of producing high-quality, blockbuster films that entertain audiences of all ages. Featuring the wonders of the Pixar animation technology, the film is a breathtaking window into the future of animated pictures, with borderline 3-D visual effects and the introduction of original animated film techniques certain to influence future masterpieces. Boasting a slew of talented voiceovers such as Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and John Ratzenberger, Finding Nemo is certain to maintain a place in the hearts of children of all ages for generations to come...The epic story begins somewhere in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Australia. A clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) lives a wonderful life in a peaceful underwater colony of fish and other fascinating sea life with his wife. That serene setting is demolished, however, when a vicious predator attacks their home, killing his wife. Distraught, Marlin takes comfort in the egg left behind which forms into his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould).Because of his trauma, Marlin is extremely overprotective of Nemo. He follows a step behind him everywhere he goes, makes him stay in the house whenever possible, and remains quite apprehensive about his son going to school. Marlin's fears are realized when Nemo is captured on his first day of school and taken away to live in a dentist office fish tank. Intent on freeing his son, Marlin sets out on a bold and daring quest to retrace the path of the scuba diver's boat.Wandering through the ocean depths, he meets up with Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) - an absent-minded, yet friendly - fish who remains determined to help her new friend recover his lost son. Together, they encounter a pack of sharks with whom they eventually make friends as well as a countless array of diverse and fascinating underwater creatures.Meanwhile, Nemo is plunged into a dentist office fish tank overlooking Sidney Harbor where he meets a number of new and exciting friends. The other aquatic life, long confined to the tank themselves, initiate Nemo into their fraternity, revealing their numerous attempts to escape from the tank. Enlisting Nemo as their point man (or fish), they concoct a number of schemes such as clogging the tank's filter so they can make a break for it when the dentist takes them out to clean the tank. With the threat of the dentist presenting Nemo as a present to his nerdy niece, the stakes are raised for our young hero and time is of the essence.While Nemo carries out his own plans of escape, Marlin continues his search. Along the way, he meets up with some surfer-dude sea turtles who aid in his trek. Discouraged at times, Marlin finds out that he's made of much more than he thought, and he and Dory find their way to Sidney where they encounter a newly liberated Nemo...Sporting one of the best written animated screenplays of all time and an breathtaking original score by Thomas Newman, Finding Nemo is a pleasurable affair for both parents and children. The writers pull off an admirable job of combining adult and kid humor throughout the script in such a way that it doesn't detract from the experience for either age group. With a number of likeable characters, the audience will find itself rooting for Marlin, Nemo, and all their friends to accomplish the task before them. Overall, this is a must-see film for all age groups, not only because of the great story and artful performances, but if anything, simply because the animation is a wonder in and of itself...The DVD Report	5.0	One of Disney's best ever!	2005-04-19	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A151F2HKDUQEJJ	budgie	"Finding Nemo is one of those films that can completely change your outlook on film. If Toy Story was the pitch, then Finding Nemo is the home run! To say this film is the greatest of the Pixar library is an understatement. This film is one of greatest animation films of all time! Period.The story centers around Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish who has tragically lost his wife and all his children but one, Nemo. We see this in the first 10 minutes which, let's be honest is pretty tough to watch. Not just for children either. However sad and horrific the scene may be, it is essential to the story. So we understand that Marlin, naturally is overly protective of the one thing left in his life, his son.We join Marlin on Nemo on Nemo's first day at school. He is very excited to go, and naturally he would be. However his father is very nervous letting his son out of his sight for the first time. While at school Marlin finds out they are going to the same area where he wife and children were killed. So he rushes to Nemo's ""safety"". When he gets there he see's Nemo being dared to go out to see and touch a boat. Marlin shouts at Nemo being overly harsh, seeing as Nemo wasn't actually going to do it. When Marlin turns his back, Nemo rushes to the boat to spite his father. As a kid would. Tragedy strikes when Nemo is kidnapped by divers. The rest of the film follows Marlin trying desperately to find his lost son.Where the movie shines most is the characters. Marlin and Nemo are perfect. Marlin being incredibly likable and sympathetic. And Nemo is a normal, innocent kid who never gets annoying, which plagues most films with a child lead. Along Marlins journey we come across Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a lovable blue fish with short term memory loss. This could have been annoying but they manage to pull it off very well. Along Marlin and Dory's Journey we come across vegetarian sharks, hippie turtles and many other funny and memorable characters.We also get other characters in a fish tank that Nemo is put in by the kidnappers. The greatest of which is Gill(Willem Dafoe). He is a fish from the ocean who has many scars due to his failed attempt at escape. There are other characters who are very likable and very, very funny. I won't spoil the rest of it for those who haven't seen it. The score, by Thomas Newman, is beautiful. There are no catchy tunes just music that creates atmosphere and a somber feel. The film is driven along by an understated soundtrack that never over shadows the perfect script.For a film mainly aimed at children, this film is essential for adults, especially those with children. The perfect Screenplay never feels false to preachy. People may take a different message from it, which most great films should do. The film features the most stunning animation i have ever seen. Bright colors and a crystal clear picture, which makes you want to get as close to the screen as possible to emerge yourself in this beautiful ocean world. It looks even better on Blu-Ray. If there was a film to show the Blu-Ray cynics, this is it. With perfect picture quality and great sound. This is definitely a must-buy!P.S The Blu-Ray discs are region free however the DVD is restricted to Region 1."	5.0	Animation Masterpiece on Blu-Ray	2012-12-18	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	I honestly thought the trend with movie companies was that when they have tremendous success with their first and second films they eventually begin to slide in quality. At least until they hit that next big pinnacle film that makes them a massive wad of cash. Pixar have done the impossible with Finding Nemo. As their 5th feature film Finding Nemo was equally as solid and original as its predecessors, and if anything it has surpassed them.Set deep in the coral reef of Australia, a family of clown fish are one day attacked by a Barracuda leaving the Father Marlin and one egg. Flash forward a few years and that egg is a young clown fish named Nemo who's been raised by his overprotective Father. One day while at school and becoming tired of his dads suffocating ways, Nemo ignores his dads order to come away from a human boat. Nemo goes and touches the boat, but unfortunately it leads to Nemo being kidnapped by a diver, catching fish for a small aquarium. Nemo's dad Marlin must now set on a quest towards Sydney harbour to try and Find Nemo. Along the way he becomes friends with a Regal Tang fish called Dory who suffers from short term memory loss, but is still very optimistic. She joins Marlin in his quest to find Nemo, although Marlin does have to keep reminding her why she's with him. Along the way they encounter psychotic practising vegetarian sharks, deadly jellyfish and turtles riding the waves. Nemo on the other hand is trapped inside a small fish tank in a dentists surgery, he befriends the fish locked up with him and hopes for eventual help.As you can see from the plot this is simply a formula of crazy success and pure hilarity. The formula works wonders and delivers a film not just beautiful to look at, but something to wet your pants with laughter. The companion Dory and the vegetarian sharks are just insanely unique and make this movie special in itself. Dory, voiced by Ellen Degeneres is just loveable and admirable with her unmeasurable optimism and her talent to speak whale. With the adventure of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Dory on their quest the film also focuses on Nemo trying to break out of the tank before he's given to the dentists daughter as a pet. Led by the crafty Gill (Willem Defoe) and helped by the other tank fish, they hatch a plan which will allow Nemo his last chance of freedom.I did mention that it was beautiful to look at and I wasn't kidding. The scale of the ocean is second to none, and the animators seem to be looking to display the true scale of their quest. The beginning reef scene is something to be witnessed and I can't imagine how cool it would look on Blu-Ray. This is a film with a script and plot with confidence, Pixar do what they do best and they give us a quality film that teaches us a good lesson about letting go when the time is right while still having the entire family in stitches.The term family film is thrown around a lot when relating to Disney or other children's movies. I can honestly say that Finding Nemo is one of the only movies to fit that perfectly. It teaches the parents a lesson about knowing when to let their kids make their own mistakes, while showing the kids the importance of friendship and respect for our elders. It has the typical childish humour while throwing in the odd adult joke that will go straight over the kids heads.A great film all round and I sincerely can't wait for it to be on Blu-Ray.	5.0	Another Amazing Pixar Offering.	2008-08-27	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A14XW8BJGEBM91	Carlos E. Velasquez	"Many are the great animated films that the Disney-Pixar partnership has produced and remain popular to this day. However, for yours truly the one that is a sentimental favorite is, without a doubt, the very colorful and fun ""Finding Nemo,"" which was released in 2003, and deservedly won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Now, this precious movie is available in a fantastic Blu-ray plus DVD edition.The film starts with Marlin and Coral, a husband and wife pair of clown fishes at Australia's Great Barrier Reef, enjoying the imminent birth of their children, which, at the time, are just a clutch of eggs. However, tragedy strikes, and only Marlin and one, lonely egg survives. That surviving egg happens to be Nemo. We then move to the days in which Nemo is now a young, playful and happy clownfish. Unfortunately, due to a disagreement with his father, Nemo swims away and is caught by some scuba divers. He is taken away to Sidney, where they find a new ""home"" at a fish tank in a dentist's office. Marlin, of course, wants his son back and, for his luck, is able to find a clue about Nemo's whereabouts. He then embarks on a recue mission with Dory, a Regal Blue Tang, as his companion. On his way to Sidney, they will find all kinds of obstacles, including being engulfed by a whale, almost being stung by jellyfish, and of, course, as we can see in the movie's posters, surviving shark attacks. Nemo, on the other hand, makes friends with the other fishes in the tank, where they call themselves the ""Tank Gang,"" while trying to escape, too.In addition to winning an Academy Award, ""Finding Nemo"" was also, as of 2006, the best selling DVD of all time. The majestic Blu-ray version of this popular film includes the movie and some bonus materials in Disc one, additional bonus features in disc two, and the DVD edition on disc three. Some of the extras include filmmakers' discussions, outtakes and deleted scenes, theatrical shorts, aquariums, and much more! This is a perfect Christmas gift for all family.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2L4QSAB9VGA4	Carol	Here is a movie that you can enjoy with kids.  The animation is wonderful to watch (like many recent movies).Perhaps it is not filled with quite the mixture of adult/children storytelling as Shrek for instance (which I enjoyed more, and is a bit less geared solely towards children), and I would guess if there is a downside, that is it.If you want something that will entertain children, and still hold some interest for you, this is fine, but it is not a DVD you will probably play without a younger viewer around.So 5 stars for what it is intended to be....	5.0	Great For Adults and Kids	2004-12-01	4	2	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2F9XMDTWZTY2O	Cassandra	"""Finding Nemo is one of the year's best films,"" explains Joel Siegel form Good Morning America. ""Hugely entertaining and way cool,"" says Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. Finding Nemo is being compared to the Lion King and it is ranking up with the movie also. Finding Nemo is a family movie that everyone in the family can relate to.When you watch Finding Nemo you can't help but get into the movie. When I first started to watch the movie it was not what I had expected to see. With all of the hype about the movie I thought it was going to be like the Lion King and start off like that, but it does not. Instead the movie starts off with Nemo at home and showing how he lives.After watching the movie I found that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. It has all of the elements that a great movie has. I think that a great movie has all of the emotions that people feel with in a day. Excitement, scared, sad, happy, and all of the other feeling that are out there are in this movie and you do not realize that they are there but they are.I love how you can feel what Marlin (Nemo's dad) feels when Nemo gets taken from his home. With the music that plays and the looks on the faces of the characters all makes you feel so sad that Nemo is taken away from his home.  Through out the whole movie it plays with your emotions with all of the different interactions with animals that you would think would not get along help each other out.With all of that said I would most defiantly recommend this to people.  At first I was hesitant of the movie but by the end I loved it. I would most defiantly recommend this movie to people. Not only is this one of the best movies that Disney has done but also with all of the extras that come on the DVD it is worth the money to buy this movie."	5.0	Finding Nemo is one of the best Family Films ever	2003-11-20	1	1	0

I am in my twenties and I loved it the first time I saw it and watch it all the time still.  It is also great for kids as it keeps their interest.Marlin is very overprotective of  Nemo who is his only baby survivor after his wife and other eggs were eaten by a shark.  Nemo hates that his father is so protective so on his first day of school Nemo is testing the waters and his father sees that he is swimming where he is not allowed.  To spite his father Nemo keeps swimming and gets caught by a Scuba Diver.  And taken to a dentist office where he meets other fish who were also caught. It also introduces us to a mean little girl who is rough with fish and kills her's.  The dentist is giving Nemo to her (his niece) because it is her birthday.  The other fish try and free Nemo before he heads to the toilet. And Marlin meets up with Dory and they go on an adventure to find Nemo.  This movie is full of laughs and bright beautiful colors.  It is also great for adults as you will get jokes the kids don't.  I think Nemo is great because your whole family can watch it!	5.0	One great movie!	2005-02-09	0	0	0

The story follows the journey of a father and a son, both clownfish and live in the great blue sea. After losing his wife and many children by a bigger fish, Marlin, has become extremely protective over Nemo. This story is about the struggle the father has over letting his son do bigger things while the son realizes his father is more of a role model than he realized he could be. Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould do a wonderful tag team and make you feel for both characters. Disney and Pixar did an amazing job creating both characters along with the forgetful Dory.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ZUBEGJNQEARJ	Chad W. Thompson	"The trailer for the Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo showed only two Seagulls floating on the crust of the ocean. A bubble pops up from below the sea making it appear as though one of the Seagulls passed gas. One Seagull looks at the other and says ""nice."" (We don't find out until we actually watch the movie that the bubble which surfaced was created by a massive explosion caused by Marlin and Dory attempting to escape from Bruce, the shark that views fish as ""friends not food"" but is sometimes overwhelmed by temptation...)Based on the preview I had no way of knowing that I was sitting down to watch what would become known as quite possibly the best Disney animated feature of the DECADE. This film is so good that it can be watched again and again and again and never get old.The film has become so popular that there is now a ride at Disneyland which allows Nemo fans to embark on an undersea adventure with Marlin, Nemo, Dory, Crush, Bruce, and even the Seagulls that yelp ""Mine, mine mine""! [...]. There is a section on the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage in this book:The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland 2009 (Unofficial Guides)Overall I would definitely have to say this movie gets five stars and is, in my opinion, far and above every film Disney has released since. Other Disney animated features such as CARS and Wall-E are certainly close behind, but none can top Nemo.In conclusion, my original expectations for this film were that I would simply be able to find Nemo throughout the course of the film, but I actually ""found"" a lot more. I found the most thrilling Disney film since Fantasia!"	5.0	Finding Nemo FAR exceeded my expectations	2009-08-12	1	1	0

Sure, a lot of the jokes are aimed at older people like teen/adult range, but in essence, this is a KID film! I cannot say that enough! I am still young enough to appreciate it but not old enough to think it was boring...This movie has vibrant beautiful animation that looks so real that you want to go up and touch the screen. The stereotypes displayed in the fish amused me such as &quot;chronic memory loss&quot;, &quot;neat freak&quot;, and &quot;over-protective parent&quot;. It's a really cute movie that's great to watch with your younger sibs or kids or whatever.

I went to see it three times in the theater, and then got the DVD the first day.  I love the characters, the storyline, and the animation.  It is truly a remarkable film, and one that the entire family can enjoy.  It touches on basic hearttouching themes like family, friendship, and the importance of trust, loyalty, and hope.  These are great things!  And the jokes are such that there are things for the kids and things for adults.  Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres in the leading roles are superb with their voices that really bring the characters to life.The DVD has many special features, like exploring the reef (a remarkable virtual place!) and read-alongs and games, but perhaps the most fun are the virtual aquariums.  These can be left on the television for hours, a sort of screen saver for the television.  My cat loves the movement of the aquarium, and I see her frequently staring at the screen.It is always fun to see the behind the scenes, the truly wonderful technology and artistry that went into making this movie which is destined to become a classic of children's film.Also fun is the short film Knick Knack -- I saw this in the theater too, and am glad to have a copy now.Buy it today!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A142W8NH9SRXS0	"Chay Chay Walker ""DVD and book reviewer"""	"""Finding Nemo"" is probably THE best Disney-Pixar movie ever made. I don't know a single person who truly dislikes it.At the beginning of the movie, we meet two clownfish who are expecting children. A shark comes and eats the mother and most of her thousands of children...except one. The father names this child Nemo and because of his fear of losing Nemo, the father becomes a nagging parent.The father manages to allow himself to let Nemo go to school, but while at school Nemo disobeys his father and is kidnapped. The rest of the movie is about the father looking for his son with the help of a forgetful, but fun, fish named Dory.The plot and animation are superb and I was surprised at how well done this movie is. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it to people of all ages, I assure you that they will all enjoy it. Most Disney films are kids-only, and once the kids grow up they let ""Toy Story"" or ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" sit on their shelf left to collect dust. When these kids grow up they will still love ""Finding Nemo"" and will end up showing it to their children."	4.0	Simple and Great	2005-03-17	1	1	0

I truly believe that Finding Nemo deserves all five stars- And then some!!!  Plus an Extra One!!!  Finding Nemo has changed my life.  It's one of those movies that even though they make you cry, you want to watch over and over.  Dori is the greatest character (besides Nemo) to ever hit the big screen!!!  Every person should have seen this movie.  To end the war between America and Iraq, we should have George Bush and Sadaam Hussain share popcorn and watch Finding Nemo!!!

I am at a stage right now where I cannot fully appreciate &quot;children's movies&quot; anymore.  I know there was a lot of work put into this, and I did enjoy it, but it just wasn't one of my favorite movies.  I think that I am just outgrowing the &quot;children's movies&quot; because I am more interested in action-type movies.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ELM0GEXEAM79	"Christopher P. Cecena ""ssjanifan"""	This movie had to be one of the stupidest I've ever seen.  Unlike the previous Disney/Pixar efforts, this one isn't even remotely interesting.  The writers, from the looks of it, probably spent too much time working on the plot, and as a result it feels MUCH lacking, even moreso than A Bugs Life.  Not to mention that the film could have been ended a LOT earlier had they cut some of the uneeded parts out.  The jokes just aren't funny, and it's not for kids, as some parts will more than likely make them cry.  The visuals are decent, I guess, they're typical of what Pixar's been doing, no more, no less.  Overall, this is a very bad Disney film, and a disappointing Pixar film.  If you really need a Pixar movie, I suggest the Toy Story movies or even Monsters Inc, or if you just need a CGI movie, Shrek 1.	1.0	Pixar joins Disney at rock bottom.	2004-03-18	58	9	49

Dory is by far the best of the film. The fish tank bits are the bits that make this film struggle a bit. Anyways this movie is so good I enjoyed it like I enjoyed &quot;Monsters,inc&quot; for me this is beating &quot;Toy Story&quot;right now because &quot;Toy...&quot; is getting a bit old. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has amazing graphics and it looks so real. This is definitley one film you should see. The DVD is good aswell it holds lots of special features but not as much as &quot;Monsters,inc&quot; this film is superb one of the few Pixar Films which wins audiences hearts. This is a great movie I totally reccomend it, just a few things make this film lose 1 star.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADIAPP5145TAY	Chuck Woodruff	First, the product took much longer to arrive than I would have thought.  I ordered a different tape from a different source on Amazon 2 days AFTER I ordered Nemo, and that tape showed up days earlier.  I thought there must be a problem...that they had forgotten about my order or something, but was unable to track shipment or contact anyone from supplier or Amazon about late shipment.  Link supplied in order verification didn't work.  When the tape finally got here, the cassette itself was defective.  It made a grinding noise when played, then rewound grudgingly (making shrieking noises all the way) then ate the tape when ejected.  My Nemo loving kid was so upset I opened up the case and cut off the damaged part and put it back together myself.  If I rewind the tape on a different machine....just to a certain point, I can get the tape out without the tape being eaten.  I'll order another one from a different supplier.  It's too much trouble to send back on such a low cost item...even if I thought the supplier would be responsive. I would not recommend buying from this source.	1.0	poor cassette quality, late shipment	2011-07-25	30	1	29

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3SINMDNWI1N3R	C. Lasee	"So many of the animated movies have a happy mushy, love story underneath (Shrek) that little kids don't really follow.  This movie is about an independent little fish, Nemo, who gets separated from his father.  No real love story there, except between a father and his son, and that is something that a 6 year old understands much better.I agree with previous reviewers that this movie was geared more toward the younger ages, but that's not to say that older children or adults would not be entertained.  I'm not normally a big fan of Ellen Degeneres, but she was HILARIOUS as the voice of Dory.  My favorite scene was when Dory was ""speaking whale.""

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	Toy Story was not bad, never saw Part II, liked Bug's Life, hated Monsters Inc. Finally Pixar gets it right.  This film towered over such huge fare like Matrix Reloaded and X-Men 2 to become the biggest box-office grosser of 2003.Marlin, a clownfish, is a bit protective of his son, Nemo.  One day, Nemo gets captured by scuba divers and taken away to a dentist, with a rather unappealing niece(see: niece see fish, niece kill fish). So you got 2 stories: Marlin and his new forgetful friend, Dory, travelling through the ocean and coral reefs to rescue his son. Meanwhile, Nemo, in an aquarium, tries hard to break out, with his new friends.One thing that a lot of animation studios, particularly Pixar does is combine kidlike humor with more adult humor.  Adults will laugh at pop culture references and the sharks 12 step program to not eating meat while it'll just fly over kids heads.The animation is spectacular, nowhere near the ultra-realist Final Fantasy, but definately the most colorful film and vibrant: Marlin's coral home to the &quot;jellyfish forest&quot; to the australian current are so vivid and detailed you'll just sit back and wonder how long they took.Definately take a look.

People that raise their kids by themselves (single parent families) should watch this movie and take courage. I will agree that it is a little bit scary especially when Marlin and Dory go down to the abyss and they enounter this monster fish with the light on its head and also when they are with the sharks.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39LRLKACX89IP	Courtland J. Carpenter	I'm a collector and avid fan of anime, and most animation in general.  What makes finding Nemo so good, is taking a simple story, and creating an adventure from it?  Nemo is a young clownfish; his father is over-protective due to a past tragedy.  The focal point of the adventure is with Nemo's father Marlin, and his quest to find his son.  Like most good adventures, the lessons learned along the way change Marlin in many ways he doesn't even realize.This animation is so much a standout; it would be a good test for the top of the line plasma screens.  Rarely does an animation sport such vibrant colors, and get away with it, while not looking totally fake.  I sometimes have a problem with Ellen DeGeneres, (who plays the sometimes helpful fish, Dora) sounding too annoying when she acts.  In fact, Albert Brooks often comes off this way in some of his work as well.  It's funny to have him reel her in, ( no pun intended...maybe :) ) when she's getting a little bit too distracting. All in all, her performance is much better when it's a bit understated, and it is in this movie.To help aid the overall story, Pixar created a secondary story for Nemo, that story has him tested through some interesting experiences of his own. He rises to meet the challenge, and his own personal journey serves him well in the end.  Movies like this are for children of all ages, from six to sixty, and beyond.  I missed this at the theater, and I'm really sorry now I did.  On the big screen this must have been quite amazing, even on my little 24&quot; TV set it looks great.If you have the THX surround sound full treatment, the DVD includes special set-up tests for the video, and the surround sound speaker array. The menus on the DVD are some of the easiest I've seen to navigate.  You can even choose a virtual aquarium for display on your TV screen.  Sound is nice, and appropriate, although nothing earth shattering or Oscar worthy.  Despite some early tragic moments, young children should have no problem digesting this picture.	5.0	It's great plus you get both widescreen &amp; full screen discs!	2003-11-17	8	8	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"Finding Nemo is a visual feast, the sound is exciting and fresh and both serve to draw you into the undersea world of Finding Nemo.  From any other animation studio, this film would have earned an enthusiastic 5/5 stars.  Compared to other Pixar films, though, the story and emotions just don't have the same impact as the Toy Stories, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles.Son Nemo and father Marlin are the only surviving members of a clownfish family, living on the edge of a beautiful coral reef.  Marlin is especially protective of Nemo and when his first day of school goes disasterously wrong - Nemo is captured by a diver and placed in a salt-water fish tank - Marlin vows to find and rescue Nemo.  What follows is a series of adventures that Marlin and Dorie (a friend met along the way) survive on their quest.As mentioned, the visuals are fantastic, and the animation of the various sea animals is well-visioned.  It's always a tricky business to anthropomorphise non-mammalian creatures, but these fish (and turtles starfish, etc.) are both clearly the aquatic species they represent and clearly emote human feelings.  The voice acting is, as expected for a Pixar film, fantastic, with perfectly envisioned characters voiced by Albert Brooks (as Marlin), Willem Dafoe (as a fellow aquarium prisoner willing to risk Nemo's life for a chance for them all to escape), and a flock of seagulls, whose only word is ""Mine"".  My favourite scene is that depicted on the box of this 2-disc special edition - a surfer dude turtle (""Don't hurl on the shell, man, I just had it waxed!"") who shows Marlin the way to Sydney Harbour, last known location of the boat into which Nemo was abducted.For a casual viewer, there is a lot of adventure and visual surprises to entertain and delight anyone of any age.  However, for the average parent forced to watch repeated viewings of their obsessive child's movie-of-the-moment, it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings.  First, the ditzy Dorrie's forgetfulness wears thin.  Secondly, the structure of the film is a sequence of one set-piece action scene after another, and it gets repetative.  Young viewers, of course, will not notice either of these criticisms and, if my 4.5-year-old is any indication, will want to watch the film again and again.  (Curse you Pixar! If my son doesn't get enough exercise it's your fault!)This 2-disc edition has some nifty extras, although not as many as the Incredibles or Toy Story's special editions.  Perhaps the most amusing is a short mocumentary where Jean-Michel Cousteau tries to explain the ecosystem of a coral reef and Dorrie and Marlin keep interrupting (""Zis would never have happened to Papa...."")  Other highlights are the deleted/alternate versions of scenes and the director's commentary, which is more interesting and informative than the standard commentary."	3.0	Compared to other Pixars = 3/5 || Compared to other animated films = 5/5	2010-01-20	4	2	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKDXXW89ZLCJS	Cybele A. Baker	This is a cute film, the animation is superb and the character of Dory is extremely clever.However in comparison to both the Toy Story films and even Monsters Inc I found this tale slow and only funny in spurts. The turtles were cute but nothing amazing or all that clever, we've all seen the surfer dude character before. The fact that they were sea turtles was amusing at first but got old pretty fast. The sea gulls were a highlight..Mine Mine mine! LOLThe 12 step sharks were funny but a little lacking, and I wasn't offended by the American remark, I've heard pleanty of Americans make disparaging remarks about other cultures. And since this is an American film its nice to see us laughing at ourselves.Dory was fabulous, Ellen Degeneres was wonderful and the documentary  on the DVD with Jaques Cousteau's son was hysterical!I just wish Pixar could be more consistant; as it stands right now IMHO, only the Toy Story films and to some extent Monsters Inc are truly worth all the hype and praise heaped on them.Nemo, like a Bugs life had some extremely slow parts where the humor either just fell flat or the plot just didn't work. Much of the fish tank scenes left me cold.....ah well it was not horrible. But I would recomend Lilo and Stitch above this film as far as story and humor goes.	3.0	Finding Nemo some funny parts	2003-12-29	5	1	4

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1R8AO9XASQ15C	Daniel A. Marsh	While I am growing sick of computer-generated special effects in most live action movies, Pixar's brand of moviemaking continues to astonish and impress. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is another wonderful Pixar film because it has a great story. Period. The screenplay is terrific. It has detailed characters, very funny dialogue, and action sequences that flesh out and advance the story. There is a wealth of material here and dozens of characters both major and minor, but the movie never bogs down. It is fast, nimble and has a refreshingly light touch that has become the trademark of Pixar. If only the other studios would pick up on the Pixar maxim: that good stories and good characters make for good movies.And what a beautiful world has been created here. George Lucas went to insane extremes to render fantastic new interstellar worlds for the latest round of &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes, but &quot;Nemo&quot; far outshines even that level of visual excellence. The film just plain felt alive on the big screen -- deep, rich colors of a variety that closely approximates reality -- and it's just as gorgeous on DVD.The vocal performances are ingenious and touching. Albert Brooks got into movies to play Marlin the clownfish, and though some of Ellen DeGeneres' mugging grows a bit irritating (a little of her &quot;whale talk&quot; goes a long way), her Dory is a loveable character.&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; far surpassed even &quot;The Lion King&quot; at the box office, but it's a toss-up as to which is the &quot;better&quot; film. I think &quot;Lion King&quot; has a more deeply affecting story, and on a certain philosophical level is more adult. I would rank &quot;Nemo&quot; among the top five animated family films of all time (the &quot;Toy Stories&quot; are also both way up there). It's a classic.	4.0	One of the year's best	2003-11-23	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	How's that coming from sushi-lover like me?  After this movie, maybe an ex-sushi lover.  Well, actually, that's the slogan for an encounter group of predators who are trying to renounce their carnivorous ways.  But the thing about Finding Nemo is that it portrays fish as the beneficent other in nature as opposed to humans, who are portrayed as invaders of the shimmering azure sea as well as the real predators of the ocean.  Or in the case of Nemo, searchers for pets, especially for a piscicidal (fish killing) girl in braces where the shower scene music from Psycho is cued on her appearance.The story:  Marlin, an orange clownfish with white stripes, has been overly protective of Nemo, his only surviving offspring, who has an underdeveloped fin.  When Nemo is kidnapped by a scuba diver, he enlists the help of Dory, a thin blue fish who is not only more cheerful, fun-loving, fancy-free, and goofy, she has a problem with short-term memory, which can be aggravating to Marlin, but funny for kids.  The action cuts back and forth to their search for Nemo and Nemo's time in a fish tank in a dentist's office.  There, he meets other fish, including a puff-fish, a funny blue female who thinks her reflection is her sister, and a scarred black fish who's the leader of the prisoners in the tank.  They seem to find ways to distract them from their captivity, such as gathering around for a root canal and discussing the equipment used.  They also talk to Nigel, a pelican with a thick Australian accent who flies in from the window.  Now, the story:  Marlin, an orange clownfish with white stripes, has been overly protective of Nemo... didn't I just say that?Compared to Monsters Inc., which was a smash with its creative monsters and concepts, Finding Nemo doesn't quite match up to that triumph.  There is an attempt to revive the Mike-James duo in M. Inc. with Marlin and Dory.  The trouble is both are highly extraverted and their high-pitched babbling can be tiring, in contrast to the balance achieved with the more calm Jim weighed against the hyper Mike Wazowski.  Which reminds me... compared to Monsters Inc., which was a... there I go again!Yet the creativity shown in M. Inc. emerges.  A herd of ocean turtles affecting a surfer's accent, DUDE! where the director also voices the lead turtle (I wonder if Fast Times' Jeff Spicoli was a turtle in his previous life).  But the view of the blue ocean, the coral beds, and the swaying anemone that's Marlin and Nemo's home, is probably the prettiest sight of all, well-realized in Pixar's computer animation style.Disney mines through movie history for roots, such as Jaws (Bruce the Shark), a scene lifted from The Birds, the theme from Psycho, and of course Jules Verne, whose Captain Nemo was an explorer, an adventurer in the same way our clownfish hero is.  The difference is, Little Nemo learns from his experience.  And yes, this'll probably get the little tykes more attuned to marine life in the same way that Bugs did with insects.  But it also mines its own history.  Nemo looks like an orange and white variation of The Little Mermaid's Flounder, while Nigel the Pelican is the street-wise, or ocean-wise character of knowledge like the seagull in Mermaid or The Rescuers.Albert Brooks voices Marlin as an overprotective and loving father who means well, but is too haunted by the deaths of his mate and their other offspring to realize that Nemo needs adventure and experience, although nothing drastic, but Ellen DeGeneres steals the show in her vocalization as Dory, as does Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the Pelican.  Oh, and Albert Brooks does Marlin as a...okay, time to fix the short-term memory.	4.0	Fish are friends, not food	2003-10-15	4	2	2

"Perhaps Pixar's fifth animated romp ""Finding Nemo"" was  inevitable to such praise as it got (being the best reviewed movie of 2003) because it surely deserved it!  The concept is simple: Marlin, a clown fish (after a tragedy) becomes an overprotective father to his son, Nemo.  Nemo gets lost and Marlin must embark on a quest to save Nemo (in the traditional Pixar fashion I might add). Marlin then meets Dory, a very forgetful fish (the comic relief of the film) and they become friends.  Meanwhile Nemo is at a fish-tank at a dentists office in Australia, and there with the help of the other fish (a starfish stuck to the wall, a mysterious fish named Gil and other humorous personalities) try to escape to the ocean from a girl with a reputation to ""kill fish"".

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2MW0RYIXMEYGS	Dave	"The crew at Pixar has put together another winner. The combination of John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton coupled with the heart-winning plot and dazzling computer generated animation keeps cranking out box-office winners such as Toy Story (1 and 2), A Bug's Life, and Monsters Inc.Each film has broke barriers in the computer-generated world. Toy Stories were the first of their kind, an entirely CG movie. A Bug's Life broke the barrier of computer engineered plants. Monsters Inc. perfected the way a computer can portray fur and hair. And now Finding Nemo has perfected the way a computer can generate water. Pixar is truly a pioneer in the field of computer-generated movies, as well as always creating a movie that is safe for all ages, and enjoyable too.THE PLOT: An over-protective clownfish father Marlin loses his son Nemo to a diving expedition, and engages in relentless sea-wide pursuit of him. On the way, he meets up with Dory, a forgetful Regal Blue Tang fish, who, despite an tremendously bad memory, manages to help Marlin decipher his only clue: a divers' mask dropped in the ocean. Dory manages to remember the address (P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney), and journeys with Marlin. On the way, they find dangerous tunnels, hungry fish, hungrier sharks (who form a support group to keep from eating fish), and a squad of totally awesome sea turtles.Meantime, Nemo has found himself inside a fish tank in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia.  Stuck in the tank with him are Deb, Peach, Jacques, Bloat, Bubbles, and Gil. Gil teaches Nemo a little about self-reliance, initiates him into the tank fellowship, and then the group attempts to escape their situation - before the dentist's cruel niece comes to claim her present.THE BAD: With Pixar films, you can always expect a short ""BAD"" category. The only things that are bad are a few boarder-line jokes (some fish-kids think the boat is called a ""butt"", and then they say ""it looks like a big butt!"") and a few scary moments, like the attacking shark that might scare kiddoes, but only for about five seconds, or the other scary fish that try to take a bite out of Marlin and Dory. No naughty words (unless you count the expression ""Crickey!"" as bad), and only a couple of sentences about hoping the dentist will go to the bathroom so they tank group can attempt to escape. (""That's his fourth cup, it can't be long now"" and ""he just grabbed the Readers' Digest, we've got 4.6 minutes!) Otherwise, nothing else negative.THE GOOD: Pixar knows how to put together great family films, and this one is no exception. Virtually the whole thing is good, for kids, and even adults can find something to laugh about.MY THOUGHTS: Of course, most people know that Ellen Degeneres is the vocal talent for Dory. Yeah, she may be kind of unpopular, but she did an okay job at playing Dory. (However, she was reluctant to admit the gender of Dory when talking about the film on a behind-the-scenes clip on TV) You can expect something different from Pixar every time, but never any disappointments. My humble opinion: Excellent movie. Go and see it, bring the kids, bring the kids' friends, bring the kids' friends' parents!"	5.0	Pixar hits grand slams every time, for everyone!	2003-06-10	2	2	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YQ6QB2127AJ4	David Anderson	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is one of the best animated movies released in 2003.  This movie is highly enjoyable for audiences of all ages, not just kids.  It has many unique features that stand out from all other movies, especially the combination of comedy and life-long lessons.  Its plot will keep audiences laughing at many quotes.  Every movie characteristic is catchy.  Every scene keeps the audience awaiting anxiously for the next scene.  Marvin's journey to rescue his son from humans and Nemo's struggle to escape from the aquarium symbolize this.The acting is great.  Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush are a few actors who offer their voices.  Degeneres amazingly offers her own sense of humor to the movie.  All other actors also played their roles wonderfully.  Every voice effect matches their characters' profile perfectly.The catchiness stretches further than just the screenplay.  The animation is ahead of its time.  The color is amazingly shiny.  It matches the ocean's glow perfectly and keeps the ocean beautiful as it is in real life.  Every detail is perfect, even the minor ones.  If watched closely the whole time, the audience will notice that the artists did not cheat a single scene, like many others do.It wouldn't be surprising if &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature for 2003.  Compared to all other animated films released this year, this movie could likely win.  Those who watch this movie will discover why it became the highest grossing animated movie of all time.  Many will be highly entertained.***Note: Once the end credits begin, don't push &quot;stop&quot; immediately.  There's one more scene.	5.0	Fresh From the Ocean	2003-11-22	2	2	0

While Marlin and Dory follow his trail, Nemo becomes acquainted with the other fish in the dentist's office tank and learns that he is destined to become a gift for the dreaded ""fish-killer"" Darla, the dentist's niece.Though ostensibly a children's film, there is plenty here to engage adults as well.  The computer animation is magnificent; the colors and textures of the seascape and its inhabitants are gorgeous.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DAOL3NMHEPLS	David F. Nolan	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is beautifully produced, but not as engaging (in my opinion) as the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies.  Like so many Disney productions, it succumbs to cutesiness and softens its edges so as not to scare the little ones... but loses something in the process. None of the supposedly &quot;scary&quot; scenes convey the menace of the sequence with the nasty kid next door in Toy Story. And after a while the relationship between Marlin and Dory becomes more annoying than endearing.There's no doubt that the folks at Disney and Pixar know what they're doing, as shown by Nemo's huge box office success.  It's a fine film for kids 5-10 years old, and won't drive parents to distraction.  But it's just a bit too soft-centered to rate up there with the best of Disney's offerings.	4.0	Great graphics, but a bit tepid	2003-11-29	2	1	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AKOZ6Q0OEUT7H	David J. Hitchcock	"I must have watched this DVD ten times with my three-year-old daughter. It is very entertaining, with enough ""character"" development and humor to hold a parent's attention.The plot is essentially what the name implies. A scuba-diving dentist from Sydney separates a father clown fish named, Marlin, from his son, Nemo. Marlin must cross the ocean to rescue his son. On the way he encounters all sorts of adventures, picks up a charming companion, Dory (who suffers from short-term memory loss), and experiences real character growth. Meanwhile, Nemo gets transplanted into an aquarium with a host of other ""Fish-Prisoners"", who spend their time commenting on dental techniques and hatching escape plans. The dialog is delightful and the computer animations are spectacular.There are two scary moments that parents should be mindful of. The first occurs very near the beginning, before Nemo is born. A barracuda attacks Marlin and Coral (Nemo's mother). The mother does not survive, but the violence is not graphic. She is simply not scene after the attack, and her death is implied. However, this scene usually prompts my daughter to ask, ""Where Nemo's mommy at?""The other scary part evolves a shark chasing Marlin and Dory through the hulk of an old sunken submarine (that happens to be in the middle of a minefield). This part is not too bad either, and of course, our heroes escape, unharmed.--David Hitchcock, author, VIRTUAL LIFE and PATENT SEARCHING MADE EASY"	5.0	A Couple Scary Scenes, But a Wonderful Story	2004-02-21	2	0	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ	David M. Lovin	Amazing, this new computer animation.  It used to take years to make animated movies, now it can be in a matter of weeks.  Remember the Lion King's famous Wildebeest stampede scene?  That alone took two years to create.  The movie was in production forever.  Now with companies like Pixar, the animation is actually more realistic, clearer, better, and quicker.Nemo is a small clown fish who is eager to begin school.  His father (Albert Brooks) is reluctant to let him go grow up.  Nemo talks him into letting him go, and he gets in with a group of fish who are daring each other who will go closer to forbidden waters.  When Nemo starts to go out and show the others he is not afraid, his father grabs him, pulls him back, and chews him out.  Nemo gets mad at dad, and swims out toward a rowboat sitting in the water.  On the way back, he is taken by a scuba diver who drives away in the boat.Now dad has to go find him.  The film is about the hunt.  Along the way, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) will help in the search.  Turns out Nemo is in Austrailia, giving a great chance to look at the Great Barrier Reef.  Naturally it looks fantastic.One other point.  This is a great movie for families.  Not just because there is really no objectionable material (language, violence) but also that when Nemo gets mad at his father, he defies his orders and is immediately penalized.  What a great lesson.  So often, kids in movies disobey and face no penalty.  Here, Nemo's disobedience costs him a great deal.  A great parent/child discussion opportunity in addition to being a quality product.  Highly recommended!	4.0	An animated classic	2004-03-03	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"As Father's Day approaches, I write my review of this fantastically crafted animated feature from Pixar--a very lifelike and original tale that can easily make a viewer forget he or she is watching an animated feature.Our tale begins somewhere in the South Pacific where a loving couple of clownfishes named Merlin and Coral (Albert Brooks and Elizabeth Perkins) are inspecting their formidable sized roe in a pocket of the sea anemone they call home. As they anticipate their impending parenthood, the worrywart Merlin wonders, ""What if none of them like me?"" His mate assures him that among their hundreds of progeny, at least one of them will.As they discuss names for their children,their happiness is soon disrupted by the arrival of a barracuda. Coral gallantly flees to defend her unborn offspring as her mate pleads with her. Knocked unsconscious by a smack of the tail of this predatory home invader, Marlin awakes to find the enclave empty and his beloved mate no where to be found. Easily deciphering what has happened, the grieving and devastated Merlin will take consolation in finding at least one remaining, but gashed egg knocked to the ocean floor by their home. He vows to protect his only child-to-be.The offspring is named Nemo, a name his mother had liked, and we meet the lively youngster as he enthusiastically prepares for his first day of school.One of his fins--known as his ""lucky fin"" is underdeveloped because of the pre-natal barracuda attack.School will be conducted by Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), a spotted eagle stingray who will conduct Nemo and his  school mates-- including Tad a yellow longnose(Jordy Ranft), Pearl, a flapjack octopus(Erica Beck), and Sheldon, a seahorse(Erik Per Sullivan) on various adventures.Marlin will have his slightly antagonistic encounter with their parents who try to reassure this overprotective father of a physically challenged child to give him some independance.But once when little Nemo and his friends venture out too far, and Nemo is rebuked by his father, he draws further away from his Dad, resulting in his being fishnapped  by a diver named Phillip Sherman (Bill Hunter)who will keep him in his dentist's office aquarium near Sydney Harbor, resulting in Marlin beginning an odyssey of his own to retrieve his son--a journey on which he will be greatly tested.As it begins, Marlin encounters a Pacific royal blue tang with a short-term memory named Dory(drawn quite accurately to look like Ellen DeGeneres), who will play a pivotal role in this story.This animated feature will become a tale of characters finding their own strength, facing their fears and overcoming minor challenges and seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The characters they encounter along the way include three sharks trying to wean themselves from eating other fish, as is their natural instinct, including a great white named Bruce(Barry Humphries),Ancor, a hammerhead shark( Eric Bana) and Chum, a Mako shark (Bruce Spence).Marlin and his new companion manage to get past them as they battle their way across the South Pacific to find Nemo, meeting many who will either help or hinder their efforts. Among those they must surpass are a school of jellyfish. Among those lending assistance as they reach their destination--the East Australian Current  are a comically clever school of moonfish(John Ratzenberger), and the cool, surfer turtle Crush(Andrew Stanton--one of my favorite characters in the story), who encourages Marlin to give his son more independance when the reunite, an example Crush sets with his own son Squirt (Nicholas Bird).Rove McManus plays a cocky crab who finds himself compelled to assist Dory and Marlin.One angler fish featured in the story can best be described as both helpful and as a potential hindrance.Also initially sketchy is the role of a huge whale.The story of Marlin's determination spreads across the ocean, and through crawling crabs and lobsters, leaping dolphins telling the story to seagulls flying overhead, creatures of the land and sea are made aware of this effort.In the meantime the little clownfish's new tankmates, including Bloat, a pufferfish(Brad Garrett), Peach a starfish(Allison Janney), Gurgle, a royal gamma(Austin Pendleton)Bubbles, a yellow tang (Stephen Root), Deb, a 4-striped damsel fish(Vicki Lewis), Jacques, a Pacific cleaner shrimp(Joe Ranft), and the dour Gill, a Moorish idol( Willem Dafoe)-- a breed who don't do well in small aquariums--who has been scarred physically by more than one attempt to escape, discover they must protect their new arrival from the dentist's niece, the heavy-handed and overzealous young Darla(LuLu Ebeling), who has an unfortunate habit of killing the fishes her uncle gives her as birthday presents by shaking the plastic back in which they are contained too much.Geoffrey Rush's seagull, Nigel, plays an unlikely role in the effort to reunite father and son.The tale has the same clever and ingenious resolutions audiences have seen in many a Pixar flick.But watching the growth of the characters in a story told in an unconventional setting is always fascinating, and the story ends on a gentle note of loving reassurance.Marlin discovers that he need not have worried about whether or not his offspring would like him; one does and it is quite enough.I add my name to the list of those who find this wonderful story highly recommendable!"	5.0	What if None of Them Like Me?	2012-06-16	6	1	5

Oh boy were we wrong.I cannot tell you how incredibly boring this movie was. I am normally a big Albert Brooks fan but his character voice over was annoying.  I fully anticipated Ellen's voice over to be annoying (she is annoying in real life). Every time she spoke I wanted some painkillers to ease the pain of the incredible headache it gave me (especially the whale imitation scene, yikes!)The story was lacking, I didn't care about the characters. I was ready for the shark to come along and eat them all so the movie would be over.Well, just like with Lord of the Rings, I am but one of about 10 people in the world that thought this movie was horrible.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3S7WU6DIH71CC	Denny Vu Quach	Pixar has outdone themselves once again. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the dramatic, sometimes sad &amp; scary, sometimes drop-dead hilarious, tale (or should I say &quot;tail&quot;?) of a Father trying to find his lost son. In this case, the father (voice over by Albert Brooks), Marlin, is a clownfish living in a sea anemone. His son, Nemo, evokes images of Dicken's &quot;Tiny Tim&quot; character with his defective fin.In light of todays news headlines where children are forcibly kidnapped from their own homes, the opening of the film may be too intense and overwhelming for some sensitive youngsters.As with its other movies (&quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; etc.), the story is so well written, it can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.As someone who has a salt water aquarium at home with a pair of clownfish and a regal tang (the species of Dory, played by Ellen DeGeneres), I know first hand how these fish move through water and interact with other fish in the tank.It's obvious that the artists involved in animating these characters studied their biology and behavior for hours on end. A few times, the fish are literally out of the water, and as the water on their skin begins to drip off, you can see the subtle highlights in their scales. Magnificent work.Obviously, the fish are given human-like eyes... a truly necessary component to get you emotionally involved with these characters.Even Bruce, the Great White shark, is an endearing fellow with an Australian accent. Despite the human-like characteristics, the adherence to physiological details on the rest of these species is incredible.The lighting has such an effect that you feel like you are under water with the fish. The gentle swaying of the coral and anemones is surreal... just like the real Great Barrier Reef.In reality, some of these fish would never encounter each other in the wild... and we all know that Starfish do not have eyes or smiley faces... but you do not care about those minor details while watching this film.Dory is the beautiful blue &amp; yellow regal tang fish who teams up with Marlin to find his son. Her tendency to forget almost everything she hears is a part of the charm of this character. Ellen DeGeneres' voice was perfect for this fish. The facial expressions on the characters, modeled after the actors that did their voices, are also priceless.This movie is far more than eye-candy. The story and comedic timing are so good, it could be done with stick-figures and still be good.This movie is an absolute delight. When it is released on DVD, it will immediately be added to my collection - this is a film I could see time and time again.	5.0	Another fantastic family hit from Pixar,	2004-04-12	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8	Desmond Chan	Finding Nemo continues the reign of Pixar Animation in creativity and a gratifying storyline to appease both the kids and adults. It is a full-fledged underwater adventure with Marlin the clownfish (Albert Brooks) searching for his missing son Nemo (Alexander Gould) along with his forgetful blue tang friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Their journey led them to battle with the menacing Great White jaws (Barry Humphries), narrowly escape from jellyfishes, preyed by seagulls and be rescued by a goofy pelican (Geoffrey Rush). A kaleidoscope of colors mirrored most outstandingly by the detailed shadows of water and variegated marine creatures, Finding Nemo is a triumph in visual spectacle. Equally impressive is the massive crowd of characters including sea turtles and whales, created with affection by Andrew Stanton who scripted A Bug's life. Despite the sheer size, the emotional core of the story is anchored firmly by a fable that defines parental-child relations and its primal fears. Funny and emotional, Finding Nemo is an aquatic fantasia which offers a whale of a time.	4.0	A whale of a time	2003-06-05	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A241AGZXT11RE3	"D. F. Wieczorek ""Dee"""	"I'm not going to deconstruct the movie and discuss all of the human relationship topics it addresses, since other people do that much better than I can.That being said, the casting is perfect. Albert Brooks is Marlin, nebbish, overprotective and scared, right down to his scrunched-up eyes. Willam Dafoe is spot on as a battle-scarred ocean warrior who hatches elaborate plans to return to the sea from the fishtank that holds him and Nemo. Alison Janney (from ""The West Wing"") is Peach the Starfish and mocks her role on that show by keeping an eye on the dentist. Barry Humphries voices a shark dedicated to becoming a vegetarian, John Ratzenberger resumes his Pixar career in a very funny scene. And you'll never see a flock of seagulls in the same way ever again.But, Ellen DeGeneres absolutely steals the show and it's clear from the start that the role was specifically written for her. Right down to the freckles on her character's face, she's loopy, loony, funny, ingratiating and hearfelt all at the same time. Trust me; you know someone like this in your life.The animation is amazing, as you might expect. You will feel as if you're underwater with these creatures, since there's a flowing, almost-but-not-quite 3D quality to the film.One thing that did impress me was how expertly detailed the fish were, right down to Humphries' shark's three set of teeth and one scene where Marlin and Dory are being chased in the bottom of a chasm by a denizen of the deep that has a built-in lightbulb over its eyes (I can't find the correct Latin name right now).It's funny, charming and you will giggle, laugh and mist up. It's wonderful.Oh, yes...a short film from Pixar (""Knick Knacks"") precedes the first ""Toy Story"" begins the show. It's cute, features a tune by Bobby McFerrin and shows you how far Pixar has come."	5.0	It's wonderful!	2003-06-01	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EJYJC25OJVKK	"Distant Voyageur ""Nicholas Computer"""	"It completely throws my mind into several 360 degree spins on how the geniuses of Pixar manage to wow us every time they come out with a new animated film. ""Finding Nemo"" is yet again, an atomic bomb of laughs, joy, and success.  In fact, I have to say that this is the funniest, or one of the funniest flicks that Pixar has ever made. This is probably even funnier than Monsters Inc. and Toy Story and those were absolutely hilarious classics in their own right.The story begins when a clownfish named Marlin and his fish wife Cora attend the care of their 400 eggs, soon to hatch when tragedy strikes when Cora and 399 of their eggs are destroyed and eaten by a vicious barracuda but Marlin and one of the eggs survives the ordeal. Time goes by of course and the egg hatches into a young clownfish named Nemo. It's Nemo and Marlin that the story revolves around. Nemo at first doesn't get along too well with his father Marlin because of his overprotective nature and also of a disability because of his right fin being smaller than the left fin, and then when at his `underwater class' with the stingray teacher, wanders off and is `kidnapped' by a pair of human fishermen and eventually winds up in the office aquarium at a dentist's office. Now the dangerous adventure begins as Marlin is out on a quest across the vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean to find his son. The only problem is, the fish population of the world, according to the movie statistics, is over 3.7 trillion!!! And they have to find one fish gone missing! Marlin along the way, meets up with a very forgetful fish named Dory and forge up a friendship despite Marlins frustration with her short term memory problems and they both go off to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo, who's now in an aquarium at a dentists' office meets several fish and a shrimp who are held in captivity in the aquarium but are in danger from a spoiled 7 year old girl who takes the joy of shaking a water-filled bag with a fish in it and resulting in the death of that fish which took place not too long before the movies timeline. Now, Nemo tries to find a way to escape back into the ocean with the help of his accompanying fish in the aquarium before he suffers the same fate as the doomed fish before then in the hands of the spoiled girl. In it all, he has to in the process trying to escape, overcome his disability from the deformed fins of his. And so begins the adventure that is littered with numerous shenanigans and hilarious mishaps. It is around this point when the real action and fun begin.Marlin and Dory meet numerous other ocean-going animals as they try to get help to try to get to Sydney, Australia where Nemo is being held in the aquarium and as they get there, tons of awesome underwater action scenes take place and you will be laughing almost the whole time.This movie also benefits from a brilliant cast and actress Ellen Degeneres does such a wonderful job providing the voice for Dory and times the movie lines so well. Albert Brooks does a great job delivering the voice work of Marlin. To put it this way, the entire cast sounded like they had tons of fun in making this great movie.""Finding Nemo""  is an absolutely amazing and extremely funny movie that succeeds on virtually every level. It's intelligent, witty, hilarious, and absolutely charming and provides a great escape from the realities of the modern world. It almost even makes me feel happy that I don't go fishing. It also goes to show just how valuable parent/child relationships really are and how much either the parent or child will go to ensure the well-being of both. It also is a reminder of the negative effects that being overprotective can have on a child and the importance of good family relations. I don't know how Pixar manage still put incredible and highly original ideas into their movies but it is just amazing that they have managed to put out nearly flawless animated movies. This is in fact, up there with ""Monsters Inc."", ""Toy Story"", and ""Shrek"" as the best computer animated movies of all time. Maybe it's a good idea for Pixar to not be so prolific as by not being so, they are able to put lots of time into writing excellent scripts and strong plots and they deliver another home run with another animated masterpiece. Pixar are the main geniuses of movie-making. To be honest, even with this review, there's more than just what I feel I'm able to give out. Go and see it now!!!"	5.0	Absolutely hilarius.

I went with a friend's six-year old & the poor kid was shaking by the end of the film... The ""Bambi"" moment (death of parent) comes pretty early on, and the script doesn't relent from there on... it's a big, scary rollercoaster ride from start to finish, and though there are some very funny moments, the humor seems to be something that's happening well beyond the scope of the under-11 crowd.  I get why the film does what it does, but it also seems to me that studios producing all-digital animation like this, that they know every kid on the planet is gonna wanna see and that they're building from scratch, might consider making a ""G"" rated cut as well, so that the little tykes can see the Big Movie without being traumatized.  That being said, there are some great gags in here, and even though the sharks take a fade way too soon, the seagulls more than make up for it.  Stick around for the closing credits, too... they are the most lighthearted moments in the whole film!"	4.0	"Can't they make an ""clean version""?"	2003-06-16	1	1	0

When I saw this in the theater I went to the late showing, at 10:20pm.  True, it is kind of a strange time to be seeing a family film, but nobody was there and I could stretch out in my own private movie house. Then the movie began and I was instantly amazed with the astounding animation.  If Pixar keeps improving we may very well be seeing a Pixar/Live Action amalgamation.  Now, I am 32 years old and I own both Toy Story films, as well as A Bug's Life.  So, it should be no surprise when I go and purchase this future classic with the usual dialogue:  ""Are you buying this for your kids?""  ""No, I'm buying this for myself.""  There is so much adult innuendo and mature characterization, as well as witty word-play: ""First, you must pass through the fires of Mount Wanna-hawk-a-loogy!""  I loved that line, and I was sure I would see the guys in white suits come into the theater at any moment due to my incessant laughing.  Why has no one here mentioned the spectacular references to Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho?""  Those are two very special moments in store for anyone who sees this splendid film.

However this is the first animation kids film i've seen that is soo sad other than the lion king. It was kind of depressing watching the movie until the end when you feel so much better for the outcome you expect! There are so many laughs in this movie! Countless jokes that will have you giggling far into the next day! What surprised me the most in the movie is its ability to give the fish human characteristics, while still having them act as if they are truely fish. I would not recommend this movie for children under 6 for they might not understand some of the sad parts, and could get fairly depressed over the whole issue. Yet within the darkness of the movie, i feel as if their is a tunnel of light that is leading this disney movie, and that is what it did!5 stars!	5.0	Animation Under the Sea	2003-08-13	1	1	0

Their reunion is suspendous- and the friends, allies and foes they encounter kept us alternately laughing and gasping.  Good musical scores and dazzling familar voices behind the animated characters make this DVD a treat for all.Uplifting and entertaining.  You folks out there just must see this and add it to your collection.  Invite your friends over and just have fun!!!!!	5.0	UNDERWATER WORLD, FUN AND ADVENTURE	2004-01-04	3	0	3

It doesn't have a wicked dark side like many f the other Disney movies. The constant movement and bright colors attracts younger kids. And mid young kids will like the dialogue exchanged between the fish it's fun and harmless. And if your a parent you'll like the fact the movie shows a dad who will stop at nothing to find his son. This is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies.	5.0	I love all the colors	2012-12-28	1	0	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UOR8O0HTS0ZS	Douglas J. Richardson	We had been looking forward to enjoying this film for quite some time, as all the reviews and recommendations were glowing...Yet we had to turn this film off after about twenty minutes, because it had my daughter in tears. She was up half the night from nightmares.In the first five minutes of the film, Nemo's mother and all his brothers and sisters are killed. To my three year old, who doesn't understand how nature works yet (they're just somebody else's mommy and family in her mind) the scene was terrifying. After she calmed down, another violent scene would scare her to tears.Granted, the animation is sparkling...perhaps the best I've ever seen, but I couldn't believe the darkness and violence that takes place in this film.My wife and I watched the rest of the film after putting the little one to bed...we both found it rather dull and lifeless, with a few exceptions...certainly one of Disney's lesser efforts. It's amazing how much Disney films have deteriorated in quality in my lifetime.So now I'm wondering about these glowing reviews I keep hearing and reading. Am I missing something? Now I think it truly overrated. We quickly donated this film to the local library...although I was hesitant to do so.Parents, you know your children better than anybody. We strongly caution that those with kids 5 and under at least wait to show them this film...don't make the same mistake we did.	2.0	To parents of children 5 and under...BEWARE!	2003-11-07	29	9	20
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A7LETD6QFC01H	Dragonsgrrl	I did take the time to read the reviews even though I had already bought this movie, and I've now watched it 3 times.  Basically, this is one of the most spectacular achievements in CGI that I have seen yet, and I am a staunch supporter of Disney and Pixar.  This is a KID'S film!!!!  I say that because based on some of these reviews, people obviously don't understand that!  The characters don't need to be &quot;fleshed er-fished out&quot; because that would bore the kids to death!  As well as most people.  Remember how The Hulk backfired because of all that wonderful character development where it didn't belong?  Also, OF COURSE THE FISH WILL TALK!!!!  I refer back to my previous statement that this is a KID'S film!!!!! That floored me that there were actually people upset that the film wasn't &quot;realistic&quot; enough because the fish talked.  Also, my kids LOVED it, and one of them is very young, no nightmares here!!!  I honestly don't see where there is anything &quot;dark and scary&quot; in this movie.  But then, my kids aren't over sheltered either, and they can discern reality from fiction.  Anyways, we all loved this film, and will enjoy it for many years, and I will continue to shell out the money to Disney and Pixar in the hopes that they will keep making the movies that I have known and loved for all of my 30 years.	5.0	Spectacular Movie!	2003-11-10	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2VZP50FSYD6CO	drebbles	Clownfish Marlin loses his entire family, except for his son, Nemo. Because of his loss, Marlin is an overprotective father, stifling Nemo, while trying to keep him safe. One day Nemo pushes his boundaries too far and is snatched up by a diver and put in a fish tank in a dentist's office. The rest of the movie is about Marlin trying to find Nemo and Nemo trying to escape.The animation in this film was stunning. At times, especially in the shipyard scenes, I actually forgot it wasn't a live action film that I was watching.The storyline is pretty humorous. Ellen DeGeneres is perfect as Dory, a fish who suffers from short-term memory loss. The scenes in the dentist office are also funny, even if they do make you not want to have your teeth cleaned anytime soon.Just a warning, even though the film is rated G, there are some moments that can traumatize young children, starting at the point early in the movie when Marlin loses his family. There are other scary moments along the way that may not be suitable for young children.	4.0	Outstanding Animation	2004-08-21	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR.

Gorgeous animation, colorful and memorable characters and a great story!The Ocean is illustrated as a beautiful but very scary place in this wonderful animated film. Disney has got to be responsible for more children's nightmares than any other movie studio. In the first minutes 'Marlin'(Nemo's father)witnesses his wife (if you will) and 400 of his offspring eaten by a sea predator!This film does have some very tense moments that I think are a little too much for younger viewers(especially on a big theater screen, but it's a top notch movie.  The 3 disc Blu Ray carries over all important bonuses from the previous 2 disc DVD and adds a few in HD.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AYB3CG5IVMTSN	Dustin Merton	the pixar studios are just awesome and they only get better and better.  finding nemo is no exception.  this is a movie that is meant to be seen by a whole family.  it is as entertaining for adults as it is fo rchildren.  it is a movie about the relationships between parents and their children.  however i really believe that it shows how important it is that people should care about each other.  it is important to have a family so you know that there will be someone there that will look out for you and go to the ends of the earth for you.  it is just as important to have friends and friendships.  the fish dory is the perfect example because a friend can help you out of a tough situation, and also lend a helping hand because things are easier to deal with when you have someone to go through it with you.  this whole movie is about relationships.  also it shows so much about family.  it shows how parents are very protective of their children, and with good reason, but it also shows that parents need to give their children a little room also.  parents have to let their kids grow up and find things out on their own.  then on the other hand it tries to show kids that sometimes parents do know what they are talking about and that we should listen to them every once in a while, or at least think about what they are telling us.  this movie is fun, touching, and educational.  it says so much about family and the importance of relationships and i think everyone can learn or take something away from this movie.  definitely on of the years best, i cant wait to buy it.	5.0	PIXAR JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER	2003-10-27	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1R2URG8OHNEDS	"Ed Mich ""Ed"""	"The Pixar movies just keep getting better and better. The two ""Toy Story"" movies were amazing, as was ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters Inc."" Now they made a new movie in their animation studios called ""Finding Nemo"" with the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres taking on the main characters (er main fishes) voices. The joy of this movie is that it has beautiful animation, along with a script filled with humor and heart, that you just have to love it. Although the movie came out in May, when I first saw it I felt that I could not yet review it. It took me another two times to finally decide that I was ready to share with you the magic and wonder of this movie.It begins a few years before the story begins. We are introduced to Marlin and Coral. Soon they will be parents to hundreds of little tiny fish. Coral wants to name one Nemo, because she thinks that it is a great name. But disaster then strikes when a bigger fish knocks Marlin out and proceeds to eat Coral and the baby eggs. But when Marlin wakes up he finds one little egg left which he promises not to let anything happen to it. He then commences to name this fish Nemo. A few years pass and it's Nemo's first day of school. Marlin doesn't trust the ocean and is scared to let his son leave home. He does and when the teacher takes the fish to the drop-off Marlin races to go find him. Nemo is with the class but he and some friends go to the end of the ocean where it goes down into the dark abyss. They see and boat and Marlin finds them. He tells Nemo to go with him but he goes off to touch the boat and in the process of returning, is captured by a diver. The divers boat speeds away and Marlin cannot catch up to it. He bumps into and meets Dory, a blue fish with short term memory loss. We find out that Nemo is in a fishtank along with felloe sea creatures of Gill, Bloat, Peach, Gurgles, Bubbles, Jacques, and Deb who believes that her reflection in the tank's glass is her twin sister flow. Gill hatches an escape plan to escape the fishtank which is in a dentist's office in Sydney Australia. They have to escape now because Nemo is a birthday gift to the dentist's fish killing neice Darla. As they plot to escape Dory and Marlin set off to find Nemo with the encounters of the likes of Nigel the pelican, Crush the turtle, and three sharks with the names of Bruce, Anchor, and Chum who are going through AA to stop eating fish. Nemo and Marlin race across the ocean to find Marlin's son.Also before the feature there was a mini short called ""Knick Knack"" where a snowman inprisioned in the glass of a snowglobe tries to escape so he can get to his mermaid beauty toy, straight from the beautiful beaches of Miami. Sadly, seeing the movie three times, I had enough of that short after the first time. Unlike the movie, that short probally would only get about 2 or 3 stars, I would have to analyze it more if I was planning on giving it a full review.But the short was made in 1989 almost fifteen years before ""Finding Nemo"" was made. It you watch both of them together like in the theatre, you would see that there is a big difference with the animation. Even without the note at the beginning saying what year it was made, you could probally guess that it was made more then a decade ago. Even with ""Toy Story"" and this movie. There is a huge difference in the way that the animation was made. On the ""Monsters Inc"" DVD there is a feature where you see how they made the fur on one of the monsters back flow with the wind. It's such a huge advancment in technology and it just blows my mind.""Finding Nemo"" wasn't made with regular animation. It used computer generated images to make the fish. Another movie that came out this summer which I have yet to see called ""Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas"" did the opposite of this and made it with older animation. But there is something about the computer image that just makes everything look so real, mabye because it is real. Mabye there is some kind reality to everything. Look at the character of Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers."" Wasn't that a real person that they used a computer to make him look like a scary slimy creature. Animation alone in movies just makes you think hard. That is another beauty of Nemo's world.Yes. This is probally one of the greatest movies of the year if not all time. The characters are just so great. Even when you know that Nemo is not in grave danger, you want Marlin just to race across the ocean and rescue his son. You want them to be together and even though you know he's fine, you still fear for Nemo. You grow to love these characters at the instant that you are first introduced to them, and that is great filmmaking. I loved ""Finding Nemo"" and I think that you will too.ENJOY!Rated GFinding Nemo 5 stars/5Knick Knack 2 1/2 stars/5"	5.0	Finding Nemo Rules!	2003-09-27	65	45	20

These days, when even Disney movies have questionable things in them, every Pixar movie so far has been great.  ""Nemo"" is an all-around great movie, but our very favorite part of it is the portrayal of Marlin, Nemo's dad.  Dads are rarely portrayed in movies as loving, responsible, etc. if they're even present at all (there's no dad in the ""Toy Story"" movies, for example).  ""Nemo"" is a terrific portrayal of a single dad who's single for an acceptable reason (widower, not divorced or never married) who loves his child, takes responsibility for him, and is totally devoted to him.  Even if the rest of the movie weren't so good, I would recommend it solely on the basis of this aspect of the movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1U182EO6WC44A	"Elisabeth ""Gymfan15"""	I know there must be about 1,000 reviews on this movie already, but I just had to get my say in here. Finding Nemo is an absolutely tremendous movie! It is way too fantastic! My whole family is in love with it.Finding Nemo is about a young clown fish Nemo and his father Marlin. Take that Nemo is the only surviving fish from a barracuda attack that ate the rest of the eggs and his mother and damaged his fin, and add to that that Marlin is very overly protective of Nemo, and you spell TROUBLE.Things take a turn for the worst when Nemo is taken by a scuba diver when he was deliberately disobeying his father because he was tired of being over protected, and is taken to a dentist's aquarium in Sydney, Australia.Marlin is distraught at the loss of his son, and with his new friend, the Absent Minded Dory, battle the entire ocean to find Nemo. Along the way they encounter sharks, jellyfish, surfer turtles, and whales, and many more interesting creatures.Marlin eventually finds Nemo, and they live happily ever after.My family loves this movie so much. It's so funny, and the dialogue is free from dirty language, which my dad appreciates very much.My friend's mom used to be a dental assistance, and when we showed her the scenes of the dentist in Sydney, she laughed. That shows that this film was researched very well.The DVD has a ton of extras, including a documentary, commentary, and a lot of Easter eggs. One of them is an advertisement for the Aqua Scum 2003, which is very funny. I won't tell you where it is, though. You'll have to find that for yourself. &#61514;I know some people say that this movie is awful, terrible, no good, very bad, and all the rest, but I think this movie is wonderful. My advice is to watch it for yourself, then rate it. It won't do you any good to base your opinion on other peoples reviews, even my own. Watch it for yourself, then write a review and let everyone know what you think. I promise you, you won't regret it.	5.0	This movie is so wonderful, it's no wonder it won an Oscar!	2004-03-18	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12OV6Q7NHX8VI	elizabeth	A lot of people have said this movie is just for little kids, but I'm in high school and my friends (male and female) and I all loved it, along with my mom and aunt. It's an extremely cute movie with lots of subtle, sweet humor - for kids AND adults. I've seen it four or five times and see myself laughing more every time. Something about it did leave me feeling a little unsettled - just some of the dialogue/plot seemed sort of off. But at any rate, its a really adorable movie, and the DVD version is great fun.	4.0	really cute	2003-11-29	1	1	0

I highly recommend watching ""Monsters, Inc."" if you haven't done so already because it is waaay better than this Pixar follow-up.I watched this movie because I've been impressed with Pixar's work on ""Monsters,Inc."" and the ""Toy Story"" series (which you should order now before it goes out of print!) but other than the outstanding detailed computer animated graphics and cute looking characters, there is nothing to look forward to in this movie. You start to realize that maybe Nemo is telling us something: get away from this movie!There were also hidden underlying themes to this movie:-Don't buy pet fish!-Don't eat fish!-Dentists are scary.In fact, if you have pet fish and children in your home, don't be surprised if your children want to set them free once you finish the movie.I was looking for a more developed story and characters that I could empathize with, but I found nothing. It wasn't even funny! Ellen DeGeneres' character was extremely annoying and overdone (the whale language bit could've been funny if it wasn't done a million times!). The only scene I probably enjoyed was the one with Crush, Squirt and the other turtles and maybe even Bruce and his rehab group. That's probably the only reason why I give it 3 stars, in addition to its amazing animation.In fact, Crush should make his own movie. Dude."	3.0	Forget Nemo...	2003-07-24	11	2	9

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGKNH5WYJC908	entelechysail	This is the most artistically beautiful film that I have ever seen (and I am old!). The colors are vibrant;and, the underwater anemone, corals, and plant life are beautiful. The 3D effects have the fish coming off the screen into your lap, sometimes even making you duck. This collection has it all: DVD, Blue Ray, 3D, Digital, and Bonus CD. I saw this in the theater initially with my 4 y/o. My wife and teen-age daughter resisted my intention to purchase NEMO again for home in 3D since they had already seen the 2D version. Wow! was their reaction at seeing the 3D version. They couldn't believe how incredible it was, or how fun it was to watch again in the dazzling 3D latest format. A word to those who may have &#34;older&#34; 3D DVD players or TV's. I thought that I had defective 3D-DVD's as I had very obtrusive colored bands of video noise on the 3D. After a helpful person on my review noting this advised me that it might be the HDMI cable, I investigated further. It was not the HDMI cable, but my 2 year old DVD player needed a firmware update to be able to use the latest 3D encoding. Presto -- problem solved and great, great video!In summary, if you have 3D, and liked NEMO, you will absolutely love this for yourself or to give as a gift. If you have any trouble with colored bands of noise, check the firmware versions of your DVD player and TV, and update if they are not the latest. (Updating is easy, at least on some models such as Samsung: either online, download and USB, or even by DVD.	5.0	Great 3D & Great Gift	2012-12-14	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"I finally got around to see ""Finding Nemo"" over the holiday weekend when I received a copy of it for Xmas. I always had a love for aquatic life, especially marine aquatic life. Clown fish are one of the most beautiful salt-water fishes I have ever seen.  I thought it was a great idea when Disney and Pixar made a film that was based around a clown fish and his missing son. I didn't really think that it was possible for Disney to put out a film that could out do ""The Lion King"", my personal favorite Disney film of all time. Well, I was wrong. ""Finding Nemo"" was such a delight to watch, the film has now pushed ""The Lion King"" into 2nd place as my favorite Disney film. The movie isn't too scary for young children except maybe in the opening sequence when Marlin and his mate Coral encounter a hungry barracuda. I could have easily just pushed mute on my remote control and the film still would have been great. ""Finding Nemo"" is visual eye candy. The animation from Pixar studios is breathtaking to say the very least. There were moments in the film when I thought what I was seeing was real. The facial expressions of the charcaters totally made me forget that I was watching an animated film. Ellen Degeneres as the forgetful Dory was priceless. Ellen's comic timing is impeccable. She is probably the standout charcater in the film for me. Albert Brooks was perfectly cast as the overprotective, neurotic father Marlin. Albert Brooks has always been in my book a highly underrated comediac actor. His neuroticism was well played out in Marlin. One of my favorite characters is Peach the starfish (voiced by Allison Janney) and the vegetarian sharks (now there's an oxymoron for you), and the sea turtle Crush. I didn't know until I saw the credits that William DeFoe was the voice for Gil. And Bloat the porcupine fish was hilarious. Between the two stories that were going in the film, I can't really pick a favorite between the two because they are so entertaining. There was nothing about this film that I could find nothing wrong. The storywriting was excellent. The cast of actors were wonderfully witty. And the animation was nothing short of amazing, particularly the jellyfish scene and when the fish were caught in the fisherman's net. The scenes looked so realistic that I forgot that I was watching an animated film. When Oscars comes around the corner next year, ""Finding Nemo"" better be recognized for the animation work (at least). The animated short ""Knick Knack"" prior to the film was very cute to say the very least. ""Finding Nemo"" is my favorite Xmas gift I got this year. Anyone who didn't enjoy this film obviously isn't a kid at heart. ""Finding Nemo"" is truly one of the best (animated) films I have ever seen in my 20 some years of life."	5.0	Disney's finest animated film to date	2003-12-27	0	0	0

Totoro is Joy wrapped in a film. Watch &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; if your looking for the saddest Animation ever.(PG-13 for themes and R for sadness) Watch &quot;Kiki's delivery service and &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&quot; if you want to laugh. Hell even watch Pinocchino if you want a Disney Film. All these films will always be better than Finding Neom.Watch &quot;Millenium Actress&quot; if you want to see the best Animated film of 2003 (its rated PG-13 for some themes). But the Oscars will overlook this film and choose &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. What a shame. Go Totoro!!!Finding Nemo is just a rehash of elements from other Disney/Pixar films. Its like Toy Story but with animals. Its the Rescuers without the wonderful mouse companions. The Rescuers was an excelent film. But nemo falls short. It fails to make you cry when it wants you to and it fails to make you laugh at its bad brand of funny humor. Its like everyone who's not a fish was stoned and everyone who was a fish was drunk. Go see Millenium acrtess if your older than 16 and go see Totoro if your ages 2-199. Go Go KIKI... Go Go KIKI	1.0	Millenium Actress vs. Finding Nemo	2003-12-22	37	3	34
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13OOMT2EMVTH4	Eric Russo	If you're at all skeptical of the fact that this movie was not originally made with 3D in mind, please know that Disney did a phenomenal job engineering this movie for 3D Blu-ray. If anything, the new effects actually add to the narrative and help pull you into the world that Pixar has created. I would say the quality of the 3D is on par with Avatar, in that you're so wrapped up in the film and the effect is so well done that you forget you're even wearing 3D glasses at all. But if you choose to turn off the 3D effect, you'll definitely notice a difference and, personally, I can't see myself choosing the original transfer after watching this new version. Highly recommended!	5.0	Even more beautiful in 3D.	2013-06-03	4	4	0

It was sad in a way, because Nemo is the only one that survives out his brothers and sisters. He gets lost and the main point of the movie is that his dad looks for him. when he finnaly finds him after going through alot of scary adventures. In the proces he meets new people like Dori and Bruce. They are the ones that help Nemo's dad find him. I think people from all age ranks can watch this movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1QWGPBP61DPQP	"Erik J. Malvick ""Erik Malvick"""	Ok, I give this movie 5 stars because it is definitely a wonderful movie if not one of the best Disney movies ever, especially in terms of the Pixar line of movies. It is definitely a family movie, and in terms of that it does a great job of keeping the adults interested with a lot of great humor. The animation is great as are all the special features, which are fascinating as well.So, what's the But for... Well, my biggest complaint, and this is looking at it from the perspective of a parent or a little kid is what I perceive to be a little bit more violence or implied violence than what some kids might be able to handle.  Granted, it isn't something that is going to bother most kids, but the horror of seeing Nemo's mother killed (even though it isn't directly shown) seems like it could frighten a lot of kids. Frankly, I found it a little depressing, and I am 27.The shark attack scene and the subsequent mine incident also seem a bit frightening for a young child to see. In fact, there seemed to be quite a few &quot;startling&quot; scenes that could easily scare a young child.Now, I hardly think it detracts from the movie as a whole, but it is also common to sit the little ones in front of a tv to watch a movie such as this, and I think this movie is one where a little adult support could be helpful. I would hate to have my child be waking up in the night dreaming of baracudas and sharks attacking....Of course, in the end, a lot of other Disney movies have the same type of dramatic and even someone morbid aspects to their plots, and perhaps it is these aspects that make the movies great to begin with.	5.0	A Sure Classic But...	2003-11-25	4	3	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	APM06HT7JIPZ5	"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton"""	I've never been a fan of Pixar/Disney collaberations.  That's not to say I hate them, I just don't fnd them all they're cracked up to be.  Neither have any of my friends.  So needless to say, none of us thought FINDING NEMO looked very good.  But I was very surprised to get a call from my friend one day, with him screaming to me how great of a movie it was!  So I happened to catch it on an airplane trip, and I gotta tell ya, I was extremely disappointed.  When I told my friends this, they were flabbergasted!  This is the way I see it: my friend went in to the theater expecting to be bored out of his mind, and so the film rose completely beyond all his expectations, and hence he loved the film.  I, on the other hand, was expecting to see a truly great film that I would love for the rest of my life, and so the film stooped far below all my expectations, and hence I didn't like the film all that much.  Again, I'm not saying that FINDING NEMO is a bad movie, far from it!  It's great for the youngsters, and if I was seven or eight, I would be probably ranting on and on an on about this film as we speak.  I just can't believe how overrated the film is!  And since all the critics have loved the previous Pixar productions, I know that it's not for the same reason that my friends love the film.  It completely boggles me.But like countless reviewers have most likely already stated, the film has two main highlights: 1) The Animation - stunning, gorgeous, and absolutely breathtaking, it's easily Pixar's best work to date.  God bless CGI!  2) Ellen DeGeneres as the short-term-memoried-but-loving blue fish Dory.  She gloriously shines in every sense of the word, bringing a much-needed flair to this otherwise average film.  I can't wait for her up-and-coming talk show this fall!Conclusion:  Do I love the film?  No, but I certainly LIKE it.  Does everybody else but three other people in the world love it? Well, considering the fact that it now ranks as No. 10 on the list of The Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies Ever Made, I'd say yes.	3.0	The Most Overrated Film Of The Year, That's For Sure!	2003-09-12	28	5	23
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3SUS67MG5BCO7	Erin	To tell the truth, I've been meaning to see &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; since it came out, but just never got around to doing it. So last Saturday, I caved in, took a trip to Blockbuster's and watched it. I don't regret a second of it.My friend Robert was initially reluctant to go see this movie because he believed it would be a &quot;silly children's movie.&quot; Naturally, I argued with him. Several months after this, he came up to me one day and admitted that he'd just seen &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and had been totally wrong about it. He absolutely loved it. Actually, I think it would be hard not to.&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply the best animated movie I've seen in a very long time (probably since &quot;The Lion King&quot;). From the very menu screen on (just trust me), it's wonderful. It's simply hilarious and it's very, very cute. It starts out with a beginning worthy of &quot;Bambi&quot; and proceeds to tell the tale of a father and his son, two clownfish who live on the reef. It's very rare to see such an endearing father-son film as this one - &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is terrifically special in that sense.The story itself involves Marlin (Nemo's dad) trying to find his lost son and Nemo himself trying to escape from the aquarium he has been trapped in. In his journey, Marlin encounters Dory, who is personally my favorite character in the film. Dory has some problems with her short term memory. Ellen DeGeneres does a beautiful, funny job as Dory's voice. My very favorite scene is about two seconds long, but I'd watch the whole movie just for it: it involves Dory's &quot;squishy&quot; (a little jellyfish), but beyond that, you'll just have to see it for yourself. Yes, it's really that good!The story and characters are certainly memorable in themselves. Yet, the visual imagery in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is simply breathtaking. It looks *real*, truly underwater, right down to the shafts of sunlight and the rippling pattern of the light on the reef. The DVD even has an &quot;aquarium&quot; feature so you can just relax and stare at scenes from the reef. I really don't know how to describe with it, but my response was sheer amazement. I didn't know we could do stuff like that!&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; has definitely worked its way into being one of my favorite movies. I bet in ten or twenty years from now it will be as much a classic as &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; are now.	5.0	A Wonderful Movie for Everyone	2003-12-10	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADWQPR0LJD4J	"ERSInk . com ""Eric"""	"""Finding Nemo"" is a new classic for both the Mouse House and Pixar and continues to charm children of all ages. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who follows the success of Pixar, who very rarely has a miss among its hits.Little clownfish Nemo is caught by a diver and taken away from his home in the Great Barrier Reef. While he tries to find a way to escape from his life of captivity in a fish tank full of other interesting characters, his father Marlin sets out on a search for Nemo. He encounters all sorts of dangerous and eccentric aquatic personalities. Can Marlin and Nemo survive their misadventures and reunite with each other?This is another example of a Pixar film I just don't enjoy. It trudges along at a pace too slow for my tastes. My opinion doesn't matter when the film is aimed at children and parents who love it.It does have its moments. I enjoy the sequence with the sharks. I think this has more to do with the fact that filmmakers chose to name the great white shark Bruce in homage to the mechanical one Steven Spielberg used while directing ""Jaws."" It's also one of the more exciting moments in ""Finding Nemo.""The movie carries a great message about the importance of family. It's also a cautionary tale pounding home how important it is for children to obey their parents for their own safety. Strangely, it somehow delivers an edict addressing overprotective parents who won't give their children room to grow on their own.I doubt my dispassion for ""Finding Nemo"" will keep anyone from watching or purchasing this new Blu-ray edition.

Our son actually made it almost all the way to the end of the  movie, but many other parents had to leave early with their kids, and my husband had to ""talk down"" our son a few times to calm him down.  This is not a mellow movie for young children.  True, there's no major violence, swear words or sex, but it's INTENSE.  The movie starts with Nemo's mother and siblings being eaten.  Then he gets captured and his father goes looking for him, encountering lots of danger along the way.  It's very emotionally scary for a young child.  My husband said lots and lots of young children were screaming and crying in the theater.  I later saw the movie on dvd and liked it personally.  It's well done, and funny.  That being said, if you have a preschooler, it might be better to wait on this one."	3.0	Good for adults and older kids, but...	2003-12-06	22	14	8
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L8PEHENBZXI2	Eye In Sky	Just when you thought Pixar couldn't possibly produce a better movie than their predecesor, they continuously succeed in an ever increasing challenge.  Finding Nemo is certainly no exception!  In fact, Finding Nemo is my personal favorite of the bunch.  The underwater animation is nothing short of spectacular (but of course, that is to be expected).  However, what sets this movie above the rest is its emotional heartfelt core.The story toggles back and forth between a father (an over protective clown fish) and his lost son (a stubborn, but determined child trying to prove he can overcome his minor handicap).  Both parties face increasing danger as they attempt to reunite themselves before time runs out.  The result is a mixture of jaw-dropping excitement, dramatic tension, hillarious comedic moments, and a very special experience for both children and adults.What is equally amazing is the writing team of Pixar.  They seem to be able to come up with fresher and more exciting ideas in their animated pictures than most other live-action studios to date.  Finding Nemo also uses Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption/The Green Mile/Scent of a Woman) for the soundtrack which gives Finding Nemo a darker and more mature feel in contrast to the giddy happy music of Randy Newman (Toy Story).I cannot wait to see what else Pixar has up their sleeve!	5.0	Pixar keeps upping the ante... over and over again!	2004-08-29	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A204JBQ3CUB06Q	Fantastik	"I didn't think Pixar could possibly mess up two movies in a row, but ""Nemo"" is a truly disastrous film. An almost-all-star cast is roped in along with a fabulous animation team, but they can't save the movie from sinking farther than the Titanic.First of all, the story is nothing special. Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish, and his family are attacked by a baracuda who kills his wife and all but one of his children. For reasons undisclosed, Marlin becomes extremely over protective of Nemo, the remaining child, prompting him to disobey his father. Of course, Nemo is captured by fishermen and thrown into a fish tank in a dentist's office. The tank is home to several one-dimensional characters and only two have the slightest hint of a personality. Willem Dafoe voices Gill, a sage-like fish who teaches Nemo virtues, and Gurgle (Austin Pendleton) provides the best joke in the film. Meanwhile, Marlin befriends Dory (lesbian Ellen DeGeneres), and the two set off to find Nemo, meeting several unnecessary characters along the way. The 'surfer-dude' turtle, Crush (which means 'to have sex' by the way), is a pointless and potentially offensive stereotype, while several sharks who don't eat fish sport the least creative slogan I've ever heard: ""Fish are friends, not food"".While, yes, the animators have obvious talent, they hardly ever show you anything incredible. Most of the time, Marlin and Dory will be talking to each other with nothing but blue, empty sea in the background. After they leave the reef, you'll almost never see another fish swimming around, or the slightest bit of scenery. Above ground, the seagulls and pelicans are a good idea but they're never fully exploited, while the fish tank grows and shrinks as required for the scene, a cheap way for the animators to have less work.There is very little humor. Every character is dependent on rehashing a joke at least five times and milking it for all it's worth. You'll here Marlin stutter over the same bad joke and explain that just because he's a clownfish, it doesn't mean that he's funny. Dory suffers from short-term memory loss and forgets who Marlin is over and over, making a mockery of what is actually a very serious condition.I highly recommend that you skip this one. Hopefully next time Pixar will get the picture and stop trying to bank on garbage."	1.0	What A Mistake	2003-08-13	144	5	139

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1X4P6CN08U57A	FicktionPhotography	Pixar has always continually put out a fantastic array of movies for children over the years, but this one stands out amongst the throngs.  Finding Nemo, unlike it's Pixar predecessors, is set almost entirely in a watery environment and it certainly feels that way.  Down to the last speck.  Even the characters, heavily anthropomorphized, move like the creatures they represent.  Their personalities reflect their shape from the slightly crazed, bubbles infatuated tank dwellers to the hippie inspired sea turtles with their 'chill-out' grace of movement.  A wonderful assortment of personalities, memorable characters, and phenomenal layouts that represent everything from coral reefs, to dirty docks, to fish tanks is represented and delivered with utter excellence.The story unfolds when an overprotective but dedicated father, Marlin, loses his son, Nemo, to human divers looking to populate their fish tank naturally.  Marlin, consequently, goes on a quest to find his son where he meets up with Dory, a fish with short-term memory loss.  To reach his son he will have to battle the dangers of the ocean to find his courage and to learn that love has a limit when it become stifling.  It's a delightful story that is suitable for all ages.  High adventure, drama, comedy, and action come together as seamlessly as the oceanic environment we are introduced to.The musical score is, also, in of itself, brilliant.  It compliments the subtle quality of the film that makes it so grand.  After so many years of Pixar being in our lives it's difficult to be wowed by their talents anymore.  However, this is certainly wow worthy!  The musical score coupled with the subtlety of genius and talent are what we take away from this movie.  We feel as if we have really spent the last hour and a half in the ocean, getting to know the characters, their personalities, and the lessons they must learn.A crowning achievement with a heaping amount of 'feel good' on the side.	5.0	Finding Perfection	2012-01-06	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39849I0AQTTVR	Gary Jaffe	Finding Nemo is the fifth installment for Pixar Studios, the most reliable studio in Hollywood today, and it is my personal favorite.  The first obviously outstanding aspect of the movie is the animation.  From the breathtaking wonder of the Great Barrier Reef, to the cold, sterile fish tank, the animation is top notch and truly state of the art.  The water, which has always been the bane of animation, is picture perfect, and the animators have captured the rolling but constant ocean and the light refractions perfectly.  But animation itself doesn't make a film. Finding Nemo's strongest aspect is it's warm, witty, heartfelt, and funny story of a father's quest to reclaim his son.  The kids will love the vibrant characters and funny situations, and so will the parents.  However, the parents will be able to enjoy the film on a level far more than the kids will.  The story is about losing a child, and the desperate quest to be reunited, which will hit the parent right in the gut. This is the story's dark side, which has, thankfully, not been sugar coated by the creators.  Overall, lets just say Halleluja, Pixar, you've done it again!	5.0	Pixar's getting in a habit of constantly outdoing themselves	2003-06-07	187	170	17
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AN81JUYW2SL24	Gearhead Mania	This movie is one of my favorites, and I'm usually into movies like The Matrix, Blackhawk Down, etc... but Finding Nemo found its way into my library of good DVDs.However, don't let its cute appearance fool you. It's not REALLY for young kids. Some of the jokes go over their heads while some of the animations could cause the kids to have nightmares. There's a scene where Dory and Marlin first meet Bruce the shark. His looming presence made me jump a little in my seat.Then there's the deep sea fish w/ the bioluminiscent light...For parents or older siblings, I highly recommend you watch this movie FIRST before showing it to younger children - simply cover their eyes when the &quot;scary&quot; scenes occur.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALZ5Y1CE0DWQ1	G. Guberlal	I have loved what animators can do ever since I was a young child watching reruns of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, &amp; a plethora of movies ranging from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Cool World, and of course, Ice Age, The Lion King, et al.By far, Finding Nemo is one of the hardworking CGI (computer animation as opposed to hand-drawn) movies since Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (a fully realized world based loosely on the video game series, albeit with no controller and a story that was so-so) that really impressed me, both visually and storywise.The movie opened around Memorial Day 2003 and at the time, I was interested in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded.&quot; Finding Nemo was an afterthought, however in this world I have found that a persons first thought is not always the best. But maybe we need them to appreciate the &quot;sleeper&quot; things, such as this adorable movie for people of any age.I love Widescreen movies best, however, for this movie, the Fullscreen version provides more of a complete enjoyment. Set mostly underwater, you're transported to a fantasy world without prophecies of computers wiping us out in a computer program, no evil-eyed Terminator's, no bad boys blowing up things for shock value, and most importantly -not a second of wasted time.The DVD is hitting the market at just the right time, and in the right edition. What I mean by that is, Thanksgiving and the Christmas season is upon us and it's time for family. Finding Nemo is assured to please any age and whether you silently want to despise the movie, you'll give in to rejoicing with it. At least I did, thus, it was an afterthought to see the movie at all. Why I waited having loved animated movies, I don't know. All I can come up with is that I bought into the hype of the summer sequels, which left me flummoxed at best.The DVD extra's are done just right, not overwelming, not intrusive or boring, but filled with educational value and a great behind-the-scenes look at how this movie came about, and also, how it was animated.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3O86HL8QOJR6	"Ginger ""vipbooks"""	Here is one movie that everyone I have talked with LOVED.  The list includes little children, Gramma and Grampa, college kids, teenagers, pre-teens, AND their parents.  What was the last movie that achieved that?There is going to be something for everyone in this movie. It's funny, sad, happy, and surprisingly, has aspects that parents and kids will relate to.Overall, the visual effects of this movie are nothing short of remarkable.  Just look at the way they created the reef, and the jelly fish, for example.  That's all I'm going to say - you must see this for yourself.I disagree with a previous reviewer who suggested waiting for the DVD.  To see this on the huge screen of a movie theater is the first choice.  I'll be on Amazon.com when it's out on DVD, but in the meantime, I may be back at the theater to see this one again.	5.0	Instant Classic	2003-07-11	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2OBNO2SEPX05	"glynenergy ""glynenergy"""	The people who reviewed this and gave it 1 star are clearly deluded. It is a good film by any standards. However it is not a classic, even though Pixar spent so much loving care in the creation.The visuals are stunning. There is no argument with that, anyone not blown away really has not followed cinema for long enough! The graphic realisation, colour and depth are truly of the next level.My problem is really in the fact that Pixar have set such a high standard for themselves before. Whilst I enjoyed it,and there is much that is brilliant here, I found that I didnt enjoy it in the same way as Toy Story 1 and 2, Shrek (I know not Pixar!) or Monsters Inc. Heres why;The story is very linear in a classic Disney way. The gags are there, but enter and exit rather than are part of the story. Other Pixars and films like this had some surreal left field plot lines which elevated the movie to another level.There was no real bad guy/girl which meant that there was little counterbalance to the overall story.Dory - DeGeneris. God, what an annoying character. The monotone voice, and the whale noise skit was embarassing. No one over 5 laughed at that in the cinema. The makers clearly thought that as DeGeneris was in it they would overtwrite her part. Terrible.On the other hand the fish tank scenes were totally underwritten with very very few gags. It also felt like the main story of the search for Nemo was really struggling to come up with things to carry it along.The sharks, who were genuinely funny, are criminally underused, whereas the annoying Dory is badly overused.The father/son dynamic doesnt work any empathy up really, apart from the first 10 minutes when his mother is killed and father/son are left.Ok so it is a good film, there is no denying, but it isnt up there in the top ten animated. I hope Pixars next one remembers that they are fans of the Simpsons and not Bambi!!!!!!!	3.0	Good, but no cigar	2004-02-12	9	2	7

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1ZS82R4RC0I2N	gonn1000	One of the most overhyped animated movies of the last years, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a visual delight, presenting a competent (if somehow predictable) all-ages story that manages to entertain and offer a few surprises along the way. It`s a worthwile and funny film with some hilarious moments (the sharks are great and way clever idea, as is Dory`s character, which prove that Pixar`s creators still have a couple of witty and innovative concepts). However, it`s far from being the masterpiece that so many claim it to be. It doesn`t bring nothing new aside from some visual delights, given that the storyline follows the classic Disney pattern (thankfully, it avoids the dull songs and the over-the-top cheesy moments). As a whole, though, it works rather well, combining its elements to provide an engaging and convincing cinematic experience.Worth finding.	3.0	Something for Everyone	2004-03-05	4	1	3
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GQXLVWTJLARH	Gordo the Gatling Gun	I need to make one thing clear before I begin this review: I am not a Pixar fan. In fact, after The Incredibles, my tolerance for the studio started heading downhill, especially in regards to films like Wall-E or Up. Granted, Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 picked up the pace a little bit, but upon seeing Cars 2, I was utterly appalled that the studio actually managed to make a film much, much worse than Wall-E of all films, and I almost gave up on them. Yes, I liked Brave...but I also saw the teaser trailer to Monsters University and it looks to me that the studio is back to making more crap for us in the near future.But believe it or not, the signs of their eventual downfall from grace wasn't marked by either Cars nor Wall-E; if anything, Finding Nemo pretty much confirmed for me that the studio was heading into a really bad direction. The only reason why that went over my head at the time was because the movie they made immediately after this--The Incredibles--was an awesome movie, and as it was essentially the studio's first big failure in my eyes, I was willing to pass it off as a mere bad egg. In retrospect though, I should have known better.This film essentially marked the very beginning of the studio's corruption into a corrosive mixture of sentimentality, a comedic meanstreak, sheer cynicism and heavy-handed propaganda all rolled into one. The best thing I can say about this film is the absence of the latter in this picture. Yeah, it's pretty too, but prettiness in a film can just as easily turn against itself as a negative instead. All pretty visuals in a film this nasty and this hateful can do is ultimately invite others to sit back and embrace the film for all it has to offer: Carefully calculated sentimentality, trite jokes, and unlikable characters. The visuals do not enhance the quality of the film; it only contributes to the manipulations and the brainwashing.And frankly, Nemo got what was coming to him. He deliberately disobeyed his father and swam out into the open ocean to touch the boat! I don't care if he was a kid; he got what was coming to him. And there's no possible way I can side with his father, Marlon either because the guy is portrayed as being so anal retentive that he became both annoying and unbearable. Yes, I know; he lost his mate during the film's prologue. But that doesn't excuse the way the film portrays him; as an obsessive-controlling shrew who was clearly in the wrong from the very beginning. And I really hated the jokes surrounding Dory and Darla (the antagonist); those jokes were not funny; they were nasty and mean-spirited. Dory's got short term memory loss, which is a serious medical disorder; Darla is a loud, ugly, stupid little girl who can't take a hint after the first time she shook her fish in a bag. Both cases played entirely for laughs.The only remotely likable character in that film is Gill (the leader of the fish tank) because his plight is totally understandable as well as the reasons why he needed Nemo to sabotage the tank as part of their escape plan (granted, there should be some serious ecological repurcussions for them for doing so, but in a better movie, I'd let it slide). Everyone else in this film's either extrutiatingly annoying or just plain pointless; before anybody mentions Bruce the Shark and his Fish annoynmous group, Friz Freleng did it better with the short film, Birds Anonymous, and it was in better taste as well.And the rest of the story is every bit as predictable as it is melodramatic and weepily sentimental. Nemo directly and deliberately disobeys his father and gets kidnapped as a result; Marlon overcomes many a ''hardship'' along the way and ''grows'' into a ''better'' father figure upon his reunion with his son; but first, we needed two fake outs in which the film expects us to believe that Nemo's either dead or dying, the second one followng an arbitrary climax. That's the entire film; a formulaic story that substitutes real suspense or character depth in favor of corrosive sentimentality.Frankly, I am appalled with this film. I am appalled with Pixar. I am appalled with Andrew Stanton. I am appalled of the knowledge that we're going to get a sequel to this. If you still bow down and worship this film as a great work of art, then nothing I say from this point forward is going to matter. This film is without any redeeming virtues. Not a single, solitary one (sorry, but Gill's character is completely irrelevant compared to everything else that is wrong with this movie).Seriously, compared to the bottom 4 Pixar films, this is easily number 3; not as bad as Cars 2 or Wall-E, but even worse than Up. Up has the benefit of being a potentially decent--albeit sentimental 30 minute short fillm bloated to almost 2 hours in length. Finding Nemo sucked the moment Nemo rebelled and never recovered.PS: As for why Wall-E and Cars 2 are worse? Because at least Finding Nemo had the common courtesy of not being a propaganda flick like Wall-E (yeah, it toned down on the comedy, but it instead became a joyless ideological flick bent on brainwashing young children, both traits I think makes it worse). Cars 2, on the other hand, just has so much intellectually and morally wrong with it...and it stars Larry the Cable Guy!	1.0	For the greater good, I will have to go against the grain on this one	2013-02-16	33	5	28

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	"""Finding Nemo"" is not only one of Pixar's biggest movie hits, it's also one of their best films. To quote Leonard Maltin describing ""Peter Pan,"" ""it's a film in which everything clicks."" Visually, it is almost overwhelming -- on the big screen, recently in 3D, on DVD and now on Blu-ray, where every details sparkles.Much is said about the pros and cons of using ""name"" celebrities for voices. ""Finding Nemo"" stands as a great arguement for using them, if they are well cast. Few animated films of any kind boast such an on-target cast, from the stars to the always great character actors and voice actors who fill out the company.It's also one of those films that, once you get started watching it, you simply have to keep watching, no matter how many times you've seen it. The story is 99% fat free, every sequence moving logically from one to another. This is Pixar at its best, and also the master influence of Walt Disney and Hayao Miyazaki at work.So if you want to behold its majesty in Blu-ray, this new release is highly recommended. Even though there is a DVD in some sets, which you can use in the car or the computer, if you love bonus features and want to keep them equally accessible, than hang on to your 2-Disc Collectors Edition. The Blu-ray seems to have a few new features, but most of it was imported from the last edition and does not reappear on the new DVD.There was also a 168-minute ""visual commentary"" on the earlier edition that has been reconfigured on the Blu-ray into a ""Cine-Explore"" that now runs the 100-minute length of the film. I cannot itemize every element to assure that the edited material was placed elsewhere on the Blu-ray, so again I'm keeping my earlier edition.New option on Blu-ray and DVD:English Descriptive Audio Service2012 Blu-ray Bonus Features* Cine-explore (shortened visual commentary)* Reinventing the Submarine Voyage* Deleted Scene: Alt Opening* A Lesson in Flashbacks* Knick Knack Theatrical Short* Aquarium* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable* Selection of Virtual Aquariums* Art Review* Documentary: Making Nemo* Exploring the Reef* Studio Tour* Old School* Outtakes* Deleted Scenes* Publicity Pieces* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia2012 DVD Bonus Features* Knick Knack Theatrical Short* Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable* Aquarium2003 2-Disc DVD Collectors Edition* Widescreen movie* Documentary: Making Nemo* Visual Commentary (with Deleted Scenes, 168 minutes)* Design Galleries (Art Review; Characters; Environments, Color Script)* Selection of Virtual Aquariums* Introduction with filmmakers* Full Frame movie* Aquarium* Exploring the Reef* Knick Knack Theatrical Short* Mr Ray's Encyclopedia* Fishharades Game* Storytime* Behind the Scenes (Character Interviews, Studio Tour, Publicity)"	5.0	"It's easy to ""Find Nemo"" on this new Blu-ray"	2012-12-14	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10F39N6YQDM99	Gregg	Some 3D movies simply don't gain much thru the inclusion of 3D.  Furthermore, most movies that weren't originally created in 3D, don't really benefit that much after they've been transformed.  Well perhaps technology is changing this, or we need to give a lot of credit to the artists that re-did Nemo.  Because I was stunned at how much BETTER an already great 2D movie was in 3D.If you thought the ocean was deep and things looked great as they were, buy this 3D movie and prepare to be blown away.

It's truly superb film, with a great story line, and the primary colors grab you from the beginning of the film.The voices were matched equally well, with Albert Brooks voice to &quot;Marlin&quot; the clown fish, and Ellen Degeneres as &quot;Dora.&quot;  I'll have to admit that Dora wasn't my favorite character, but she made me laugh, and I have to admit that watching the adventure of this Marlin go after his son, Nemo, was a pleasant surprise.The scene at the end with the dentist had to be on of the most hilarious scenes put to animation.  What with Nemo's friends in the fishtank trying to save him and get him away to be reunited with his Dad, well...you gotta see it.  It's worth the entire film.

I waited to see it on this DVD and I am sad that I didn't see it in the theatre with nephews and nieces.Surprisingly, Disney doesn't go overboard on their political correctness (just a few references trying to make fishing look bad but they fail, fortunately) and the rest is pure fun.Plus the kid (er, the fish, Nemo) loves his dad and for a Disney movie of late, that is rare and refreshing. usually, Disney makes fathers idiots. Here they show a loving father and his son who loves him back. Just a sweet and innocentg movie.And the animation is, as expected, marvellous. the humor is great for kids and some higher-level humor for adults (but no adult-only themes, thankfully, another rare Disney movie of late).	5.0	Yes, simply Fantastic	2004-02-28	0	0	0

After he ventures into the open sea, despite his father's constant warnings about many of the ocean's dangers. Nemo is abducted by a boat and netted up and sent to a dentist's office in Sydney. So, while Marlin ventures off to try to retrieve Nemo, Marlin meets a fish named Dory, a blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss. The companions travel a great distance, encountering various dangerous sea creatures such as sharks, anglerfish and jellyfish, in order to rescue Nemo from the dentist's office, which is situated by Sydney Harbor. While the two are doing this, Nemo and the other sea animals in the dentist's fish tank plot a way to return to Sydney Harbor to live their lives free again. It is a wonderful and heartwarming movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NSDLHSG4YBHV	Gwen A Orel	"I rented this DVD to amuse my 7 year old nephew and 3 year old niece, but ended up not watching it until after they had left.And maybe missing them helped me really appreciate how incredbily Pixar captured the nuances of children's facial expressions, ways of speaking and interacting, even their gestures-- and when you consider that those gestures are having to be made with fins and not feet, that's amazing!My niece had a stuffed Nemo doll and now I see why she loves him-- when little Nemo swam off to touch the ""butt"" because his father embarassed him, his expression was JUST like her ""pre-tantrum mad"" face.  The way the baby turtles cuddled up to Dory when she got Marlin to tell the story of his journy was JUST like her ""paying attention, settling in"" stance.  And Nemo also reminded me of my nephew too, especially when he was being brave and resourceful... and when he was figuring out how things worked, ahead of the adults.Lots of people have raved about the animation, and it is unbelievable-- and after watching one of the ""extras""-- a 25-minute documentary about how this was made-- I realize just HOW much work it was.  Is it any wonder Nemo was better than most live-action films, when you consider how carefully, and over how much time, it was constructed?  Yes, it's a work of genius.But what I loved about it the most was its storytelling which was funny and always touching.  Even the little prologue in which Marlin and Coral his wife discuss their new home-- the way she discussed the neighborhood and her glee at their ensuing parenthood was in every respect a new mother having moved way out into the 'burbs (she discusses the schools, the neighborhood)... and so her death was very sad (in my opinion, this is the part that would be the hardest to take for little ones, but it goes by very quickly and is not so brutal as Bambi).You don't have to have kids to love this DVD-- but if you've been around any lately, you'll appreciate it even more.  (and it may come in handy to distract the kids you know from Spongebob, who also lives under the sea....)

How can they possible produce another film better than F.Nemo? It's absolutely adorable and a true treasure. I find it ironic that &quot;real&quot; actors rarely connect with the audience like these fish do. Maybe Hollywood actors should learn from these fish!

The story is about a fish, Nemo, who was taken from his father, Marlin, by a fisherman and put in a fishtank in a dentist's office where he is awaiting delivery to the dentist's niece, who is quite frankly, very evil and quite homely.  EEK!!Anyway, Marlin goes in search of Nemo and befriends Dory, a fish with some problems remembering things.  Hilarity ensues and the plot is quite predictable but it is cute and Ellen Degeneres, who was the voice for ""Dory"" is soooooo funny.  She was the ""only"" person who could have done justice to this part.  She was perfect. perfect. perfect!  The animation by Pixar was outstanding.  Overall, a very good movie for the family.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3TKP294Z0E2FF	Heath Williams	Back in 1995, I was obsessed with Toy Story. I had all of the toys, the bedsheets, etc. and made my Mom go buy me the video the day it came out. I never imagined that Pixar could make a better, funnier, more imaginative movie that Toy Story. That all changed this year when I saw Finding Nemo.The beginning of the movie is a tad on the depressing side, but that's not a bad thing because the rest of the movie has more than enough humor to make up for it. The characters in this movie are tremendously voiced. Ellen DeGeneres does a phenomenal job voicing Dory, the fish with short term memory loss. Her antics had me grabbing my stomach in pain from laughing so hard.The animation is spectacular. I never thought there were so many colors in the world. The faces of the fish are also well done, as they seem to express the emotions that you think the fish would be feeling.I really can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie and I cannot wait for the DVD.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29QYILLQ8YE2L	Holden E. Lewis	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; sensitively explores the inner lives of families who survive the sudden, unexpected deaths of loved ones. It is perhaps the finest cinematic portrayal of a family in grief since Bergman's &quot;Fanny and Alexander,&quot; upon which &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is based, and a model for &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;'s handling of John Ritter's untimely demiseAs the story begins, a grammar school-age clownfish named Nemo and his father, Marlin, gaze into the maw of unyielding death as Nemo's beloved mother is cruelly snatched via the jaws of a predator. What follows is a dreamlike dirge of grief, as Nemo invites his own ceaseless demise by frolicking with sharks and swimming recklessly among jellyfish that resemble pink mushroom clouds -- the shape of modern anxiety.Nemo is guided in his journey to the brink of the abyss and back by  a blue tang named Dory. Playing the voice of Dory, Ellen DeGeneres almost seems to channel  Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand, who played a similar role as Jons the Squire in Bergman's &quot;The Seventh Seal.&quot; It was an inspired coup to cast DeGeneres, who is better known for her light-hearted roles but has previously demonstrated her range in the exquisitely depressed character of Sgt. Rita Pompano in &quot;Goodbye Lover.&quot;&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; delves deep into the chasm of the human heart confronted with death, as deep as the Mariana Trench, then resurfaces, sparkling with little cold droplets of hope.	4.0	Joy redeems grief	2003-11-18	0	0	0

This movie has a sophisticated plot.  Lot's of laughs yet poignant. The animation is so good you forget you're watching animation and not living creatures! I also appreciated that both the widescreen and fullscreen versions are included in the one package. The behind the scenes extras show how enthusiastic and professional the creative staff are.This is another DVD that makes your player, TV, etc look their best!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TU84F1NWQSN5	"H. Semones ""soanim8ed"""	"If you can get past the first 10 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films.  Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation.  Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up.  All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie?  You bet!  Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film.  They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.If only they had done something with that beginning.  The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor.  Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it?  At least give them something to chuckle about.  It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film.  That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well.  This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo.  Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away.  Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory.  Dory is basically an idiot savant.  She has a severe short-term memory loss problem.  Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial.  She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her.  Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching.  Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through.  That's what makes the scene work so well.  Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office.  One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him.  He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end.  Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable.  Their motto:  ""Fish are our friends and not food!""Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar.  A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside."	4.0	How I Found Finding Nemo	2003-05-26	25	16	9

One of Disney's highest ever grossing films.The movie is likeable for kids as well as adults.  The animation is great. Movie is better than SharkTale which was DreamWorks answer to Finding Nemo hoever they failed compared to Finding Nemo.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1OE27U7XOY0ZN	James Kerr	I'll start with the visuals which obviously led people to so overrate this middling effort. The visuals were indeed technically impressive and beautiful at times. But to me these  synthetic, digital images are hard on the eyes after a few minutes, and just plain grating. Take us back to real drawings.But I suppose the delightful scenes of the reef are what led people to so overrate this movie. The basic story line of finding the lost son is so simple it is hard to call clever. The purported tension of the movie -- repeated life threatening encounters -- became tediously predictable. The humor was usually strained, and supposedly funny riffs (memory loss, whale talk)were repeated to the point of tedium.	2.0	so overrated.....grating synthetic visuals	2006-04-29	8	3	5

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38E2IE4BOUL7U	Jamie Diamond	"Pixar animation studios may be one of the most well known movie companies around. And for good reason. Pixar has produced some of the best childrens movies ever seen; such as Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. These movies have also happened to be some of the first in a three dimentianal format. But ""Finding Nemo"" was certainly not ""just"" a children's flick. This movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen; animated or not. The movie's core revolves around Marlin, an over protective father clownfish (Albert Brooks) who is constantly afraid of the big sea. His son on the other hand, Nemo (Alexander Gould), is enthusiastic and wanting to learn all about the world around him. The already small family is split apart when divers trap Nemo in a net for transport to a fish tank. The rest of the movie chronicles Marlin's journey to resque his young son. Along the way, Marlin meats Dori, a funny and constantly forgetful fish (Ellen Degenoris). Togeather, they search the ocean blue for signs of where the divers went. The movie combines great casting, wounderful scripting, witty jokes (some of which will go over the kid's heads), wounerous enviorments, and a whole lot of heart. When people ask me if Finding Nemo is a cute movie, I tell them it's more than cute, it's astounding. Jamie Diamond - Kidmedia International"	5.0	The Best Family Movie This Century!	2003-09-07	2	2	0

It's hilarious! Ellen DeGenres cracked me up so much, I was crying!! Literally!!At first I didn't want to see this movie, because it had fish in it and I'm really scared of the deep dark ocean. But as more detailed trailers came out, I thought it looked really funny and I wasted no time in seeing it. I wasn't disappointed! But I do think it should've been rated PG, because there are some scary/tense moments for little kids (e.g. really big sharks who are freaky lookin' but are vegetarians).Dory's expressions are just hilarious. She makes me laugh so hard, even when she's not talking! And the way she speaks whale, don't even get me started on how FUNNY that was! Every time someone starts talking about whales, someone else begins imitating Dory! IT'S FUNNY!!I read one review on here that I thought was sort of mean. They said that Nemo's gimpy fin shouldn't have symbolized strength, and that there should've been jokes about it. How would you feel if you had one arm shorter than the other, and everyone poked fun at it? Besides, its not like the fin was cheesy. It was a result of almost being eaten by a baraccuda. And it makes Nemo even more like Gill.I just have to say once more that this is definitely Pixar's BEST BEST BEST movie ever! Funny! Uproarious! I can't get enough! And everyone has to watch &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot; with Jean-Michele because it is SOOOO funny! Dory, Nemo, and Marlin are in it, and Dory is just as funny as ever!! (every time Jean-Michele says his name, this music plays triumphantly in the background, and the animated fish keep looking around to see where it comes from.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Disney/Pixar hater; I just caught a little Toy Story on Disney and I could still enjoy it even though I had watched it many many times. The only jokes that made me giggle were the times the blue fish called Nemo Fabio and 1 more that most people won't get.	1.0	Very Dissapointed.	2003-12-01	47	6	41
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L8NDPFC0Q20B	Jarrett Johnson	"""I'm gonna get ya!""  You hear from Dory the Blue Tang as she sees a floating light in the depths of the ocean.  Even Dory's levelheaded companion Marlin is mesmerized by the view.  Perhaps the best animated movie for all ages, Finding Nemo, is action-packed and full of laughter.  Though the movie was geared towards children, I was suprised how enjoyable it was to older generations as well.As a single parent, Marlin the clownfish was very protective of his son, Nemo.  On Nemo's first day of school, while wondering out into open water, he was taken by some divers onto their boat.  Marlin then began his journey to recover his terrified son.  While still in shock and dismantled he has a head-on collision with a fish with short term memory loss (Dory).  As Dory and Marlin set out on their adventure, Nemo is thrown in a fish tank inside a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia.  While dodging sharks, deep-sea anglers, jellyfish, and much more, Dory and Marlin become famous to the marine life.  Throughout this time, Nemo and his new tank friends try to develop plans in order to escape the tank before its too late.One of the last things Marlin said to his wife, Coral, was the statement, ""OK, we can name one Nemo, but I would like most of them to be called Marlin, Jr.""  Shortly after, a shark causes Coral's untimely death, along with all their children except one, who Marlin names Nemo in his wife's memory.  The tragedy of the whole story is a good contrast for the funny aspect.  However bad you felt when Coral dies, you feel ten times worse when you see Marlin lose all he had left.Despite the sad aspect, comedy plays a very large roll in the movie.  If you enjoy silly jokes, or seeing familiar personalities in a cartoon setting, you will laugh your socks off.  From young fish getting the words ""butt"" and ""boat"" confused, to Dory constantly forgetting what is happening there is no funnier Pixar film yet.  I believe the reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because of the comedy.  It is mature enough for adults, yet simple enough for children.In this memorable tale, you feel many emotions.  Happiness, sadness, you name it.  The strong story line keeps your interest throughout the full hour and forty-minute film.  It is amazing how talented the people at Pixar are, and I must give them snaps for their courageous ideas.  I absolutely loved this DVD, with its fun extras and especially the short film called ""Knick Knack"".  I would recommend it to people of any age, it's a great family film."	5.0	Nemo's swimming out to sea	2003-11-30	8	8	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2WSCMGYIMGVEY	"Jason Nieuwoudt ""Jason"""	Just a quick review to highlight the good and bad. Number one the animation.Wow!!! I was drawn into a magical world under the sea! Truly spectacular animation!!! In some ways the water and physics of water behave more &quot;lifelike&quot; than real water!!! Astounding, although anyone who is an avid PC gamer would have seen the extent of water effects in 3-D animation by now. Second, the voice acting. Some great performances, some instantly recognisable such as Albert Brooks or Geoffrey Rush. And the jokes are generally  not crass or rude, in some instances however only adults will &quot;get it&quot;!!! but it's always safe for the kids.The audio is great with a deep full bass and dynamic audio utilization through all ranges. The video quality is also great with sharp and distinct colours and contrasts. &quot;Reds&quot; look paritculary good. The one complaint I have is with the &quot;blues&quot; of Dory, Ellen DeGeneres. It seems that they are so bright that they are not defined as a result.She seems to be blending into whatever ocean environment she finds  herself.The characters that Marlin meets are for the most part interesting. My favourites are however the three sharks led by Bruce, a Great White with a wonderful Aussie accent, who is the leader of a self-help group promoting goodwill between fish and sharks. &quot;Remember, fish are friends, not food!&quot; the groups motto is recited at every meeting!!! I suppose i would have prefered it if they has spent more time with Bruce and his companions or possibly spent more time at the &quot;paaaahty&quot;.All in all, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a fun adventure, (2nd on my list after Monsters Inc), and should delight all children. A friend of mine's son has seen it at least 30 times in the last month, so I suppose he would be the best critic and his opinion the most prudent.	4.0	Bruce is the Best!	2004-04-05	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NX9C7A3IH6AH	Jason Rodriguez	"Simply put, this movie is fantastic. How people may come and say a movie like Bruce Almighty or X2 tops this, I won't understand. It's like comparing apples and oranges of course, but if you're feeling neutral and wanted to choose one movie, this is it.Finding Nemo has it going on just about everywhere. Let's clear out the obvious right from the start: Finding Nemo is just fantastic to look at. From the characters to the surroundings, everything here is animated brilliantly. Even subtle effects such as lighting and contrast are on full effect here. Watch as the difference in lighting switch between the serene reef habitats where the movie begins, to the way it changes in the clouds of jellyfish, right up to the color distortions between the fish and the world outside a fish tank. The characters themselves are animated with such touch, emphasizing just the right characteristics to give these animals a human touch. Just note the distinction between the older and younger clownfish. The younger does actually look like a child, just one in fish form.Yet there's so much more. Every voice done for these aquatic creatures seems absolutely perfect for their roles. From the somewhat sinister and yet clownish sharks, to the surfs up voice of the turtles, down to the sing song voicing of the sea ray. All seem up to par with the performances demanded of them, and come up great. Not to mention this movie is so sharp and the dialogue so well written, from the opening moments right down to the end everyone interacts perfects, in part no doubt to well done writing and well cast voice talent. It moves from gag to gag, jumping between the obvious humor of pitfalls and physical mishaps over to more subtle, script heavy jokes that most certainly an older audience in with their children will appreciate. Just remembering the ""Find a Happy Place"" line of the starfish brings a smile to my face. Yet for its humor it never seems to be stopped by the obvious ties it brings in between father and child, and their independent adventures that develope their own characters. This moments of character development cannot go on far too long, obviously, for fear of losing the younger crowd. Yet it's brought to life with just the right touch, stopping for one truly breaking moment towards the end, and then carrying right through to the finale with a great combination of drama and humor.If there's any place where Finding Nemo does fall, however, and what definitely robs it of the perfect rating, is it falls back far too often on the rehashing of a particular type of joke or drama inducer. You'll notice that some of the physical jokes are reused two or three times, while one type of particular cliche cliffhanger is reused three times as well. While no great faults independent on their own, they might detract or pause an older, more observant audience.In the final analysis though, despite trudging through some minor faults, Finding Nemo is the perfect movie to see. If you can't find the humor, your overlooking the obvious, and if you think some of the humor is obvious, you're forgetting its target audience. Sit back, relax and enjoy.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A27LD4WGYMFUSS	"""javmaro"""	"The story is simple BUT very meaningful. A clownfish name Merlin lost his whole family except for one, Nemo. With that traumatic experience in his life, he became a very overprotected father to Nemo. Nemo got kidnapped by a dentist, and Merlin went to Sydney - with a help from the hilarious Dorry - to save Nemo.I'm surprise that many people said that the story is so flat and that the characters aren't being developed. I think Merlin has been developed very well in the film. Come on, he changed from a very overprotected & unfunny clownfish to become a more relaxed dad and funnier in telling jokes (hehehehe).Pixar did amazing works and FN is probably my favorite at the moment. Don't get me wrong, I adore Toy Story and Monster Inc, but I found FN to be more real that the others cause I can relate more to FN instead of Toy Story & Monster Inc.I never really believe that there's a monster in my bedroom. I never really had any toys either, been playing with Super Nintendo, playstation & PS 2 for all my life, and they're not really the kind of things that I hope to be turned to live at night. I'm not a very imaginable kid back then I guess, so coming from a family with a very,very overprotected father, I can feel nemo's uneasiness with that situation.However, the film itself has elaborated me to understand Merlin's point of view as well as my dad's point of view. this film actually explained why overprotected fathers are really hard in letting go their children. It's their treasure! No matter how bad their children are, they're still willing to do anything to save their children. The most touching scene on the film is when Dorry said, ""and when I'm with you..I'm home,"" I realized that no matter how annoying our parents are and with all the stupid, annoying, and embarrassing things and moments that our parents gave us, but they are HOME to us.It's a fantastic film. Maybe some of you who expect complicated story and psychological explorer wouldn't really like it, but an ordinary man like me found it amusing and simply amazing. The DVD is a must!It has beat the DVD sales for Spiderman rite now & I hope it'll win an oscar for best animated film. Oh btw, I'm 23, drive a landrover & use a nemo keyholder on my car key -!"	5.0	Fantastic	2003-11-26	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2PUA6GJJJQKTD	Jay Chen	The screenplay for Finding Nemo is very, very clever and its one of those films you can watch multiple times and pick up something new each time.  The basic story &lt;no spoilers> is about the coming of age of a clown fish named Nemo.  And, as the name implies, Nemo's dad spends a lot of time looking for him.Love her, hate her, but any way you cut it Ellen DeGeneres turns in a brilliant performance as Dory, the memory challenged companion of Nemo.  Likewise Willem Defoe is a standout as Gill, the escape artist.  Add to these Bruce, the rehab shark, and Crush the very mellow surfer turtle and you've got a tour de force.The screenplay is so clever that you really have to listen closely to get the full effect.  And even when you're watching it again, the humor still works.  The only downside that you have to deal with is the rather Disney-ish tendency to portray children as the wise ones and adults as the louts.  This isn't done in such a heavy handed way though that it ruins the storyline.Should you buy it?  If you've got young kids and you've never seen it before, I'd definitely say yes.  It's virtually guaranteed that you'll watch it several times.  Pixar generally turns out great films and this is certainly one of the better ones.  It's geared for kids but adults will enjoy it as well.	4.0	I've watched it many, many times	2012-04-06	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1M0I3S8NOZFS9	JayCoolbreeze2	Everything good you've heard about this movie is true it is a fantastic animated film. Now on to the DVD.Oh all the fun you will have with this dvd! There are many extra features here on this two disc DVD including several easter eggs. The main menu features the voice of Albert Brooks. The deleted scenes are fun to see. There is a documnetary and an exploring the sea featurete. The sound is excellent and the picture is fantastic. You can even use the underwater backgrounds has a screen saver. One disc is in widescreen the other is in full screen. Both discs hold special features and easter eggs. The deleted scenes are always my favorite thing to see on dvd and I'm glad they have included several here. The delted scenes are all rough animation and not completed so it looks much like story boards that move and have some voices and sound added. The first scene is my favorite and is a touching bed time story given to Nemo of how the sea took away his mother. It may have been nice to have seen this kept in the film. Another favorite of mine is a scene titled Gill Lies. In that scene one fish in the background states revelations always happen on Friday and what follows is Gill telling a story to Nemo ala Kevin Spacey in Usual Suspects. It was a great scene that would have been a little too much extra in movie. The picture is very clear, however I did notice a glow around the clown fish from time to time. I enjoyed all the many features on this two disc set and would recomend it to anyone looking to see Findind Nemo.	5.0	DVD Of The Year	2003-10-30	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6WSJVJO4G6T6	J. Blair	I must admit, I really am not a big fan of Pixar movies.  I find the movies, in general, overrated.  However, I was extremely pleased when I saw Finding Nemo.  I thought the animation was spectacular and the voicing was very well done.  In any case, it's the best movie I think I saw all summer.  Some may say that this isn't saying much considering this summer's releases weren't all that great.  However, I would definately put this film ten notches higher than the other movies.  What I think I liked most about this film is it was a constant adventure.  From the very beginning the viewer is literally immersed in an underwater epic.  Not a moment goes by that the viewer is treated to something new and different.  Overall, I thought the directors and animators did a wonderful job with their imagination and modeling the character's personalities with personalities of the real sea animal.  I commend the directors for coming up with such a complicated plot, while weaving in so many characters and sea creatures.  To go along with this, I am impressed by the attention to detail of this film.  I thought all the characters were well developed and well voiced.  In conclusion, I was immensely satisfied with this flick.  It had the perfect balance of thrills, emotion, and humor.  For someone who doesn't really like Pixar flicks, this movie went above and beyond my expectations.	4.0	A fun, warm-hearted adventure	2003-09-18	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NF1RY31JF0HE	"J. Buettner ""Jaws Fan"""	Pixar has a flawless track record in terms of putting out quality stories for any age. Their stories contain a perfect blend of tragedy and comedy, adventure and drama. Every character in Finding Nemo has a want, a need, and a past. There isn't a character in the movie that seems like a puppet for a plot. My favorite character of the film is Dory voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Where in so many other films the sidekick is used just for an occasional laugh, Dory has perhaps the most emotional and heartbreaking scene of the film.The animation is amazing. With each film Pixar sets the bar higher.Is this movie perfect? No, in fact it's not even my favorite Pixar movie (which is Monster's Inc.). In selected scenes it gets a little too overdramatic, but this is just nitpicking. Finding Nemo is definately one of the three best movies of the year.	4.0	Pixar is now 5 for 5	2004-01-31	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XH4KDR90ZMIV	J. C. Stine	At first I was very skeptical of this film.  Disney has been putting out nothing but garbage lately, HOWEVAH, this is a Pixar film.  Why they collaborate with Disney when they are heads and shoulders above I do not know, anyway....I had seen Monsters Inc, which was extremely saccharine to say the least, so my skepticism was peaking.A friend of mine said, you need to see this just for the visuals.  She was right.  The visuals are stunning.  But this is not what won me over.  It was the blue fish Dory, with voiceover by Ellen DeGeneres.  The comedy was perfect.  Not too much, not forced.  I would buy this movie just to watch her character alone!  Just about all the voices in this are great.  At no point does the film drag.  The part with the seaturtles was maybe a little overdone, but overall no big complaints.If you are a doubter of animation or especially computer animation give this one 5 minutes and you will probably end up watching the whole thing. This is also not specifically a 'kid's' movie, another plus.	4.0	Very enchanting, DeGeneres steals the show	2003-12-22	0	0	0

We watched it EVERY day while both parents were working.  I enjoyed it as much as she did.  I found myself watching it every day (sometimes several times a day) with her.  I made the mistake of letting her take it home, never to be seen again.  I now have another grandaughter, aged 6 months, so I have an excuse to buy another copy.  I confess that I would skip the whole first scenes showing the bad fish with Nemo's mom, and you know what happens if you have watched this.  My grandaughter never even knew that was in the movie until she was older (she probably wouldn't have understood, but I personally thought it was sad, even though death is a part of life).  As I first said, I know this movie word for word, and recently watched it on TV with my 60+ husband and we still laughed (not a kid in the room as an excuse).

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	Adults and Children alike will be sure to enjoy this newest family film from Pixar Entertainment.  Following in the tradition of other great animated movies such as &quot;Ice Age&quot;, &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; combines excellent animation and a fun storyline which will surely captivate any audience.The film starts out with Nemo (Alexander Gould) being taken to his first day of school by his father Marlin (Albert Brooks).  Having never been out in the wide open areas of the ocean before, Nemo was coaxed out by his young friends.  However, Nemo is soon scooped up by a diver and placed aboard a boat.  Marlin, having discovered that Nemo is missing, begins a frantic search for his son.  Along the way, Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a blue Tang fish, and an instant bond develops between them.  Dory agrees to help Marlin find Nemo.Their adventure leads them to the far reaches of the ocean, and many interesting encounters occur, including meeting a group of sharks who have vowed to stop eating fish, a group of jellyfish, being trapped inside a blue whale, and meeting a group of sea turtles.Meanwhile, Nemo has been placed inside the aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  Nemo is befriended by Gill (Willem Dafoe), who hatches a plan for Nemo's escape.  Will the plan work?  Will Marlin reach Nemo before its too late?My children and I have grown to love the Pixar animated films, and &quot;Nemo&quot; keeps up the fine tradition of earlier movies from this company.  The animation is terrific and the voices of Brooks, DeGeneres, Gould, and Dafoe bring the characters to life.  This movie also teaches the important idea of family bonding and going to any lengths possible to save a loved one.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is sure to become a classic.	5.0	A Family Classic	2003-12-29	1	0	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AJGUO2HUEX40S	"""jeffreywu"""	"This movie is Pixar Studios (PIXR) at its very best.  The plot of the movie takes the user (both adults and children) on a tour of emotions that is so believable that you end up totally empathizing with the animated characters.  The best entertainment always has a point, and ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception.  The film allows us to watch and feel the development of a relationship between a parent and a child that ultimately ends up as one of compassion, mutual respect, and trust.  The heavy emotionally-laden storyline is saturated with good humor and action as both Nemo and his father Marlin (Albert Brooks) navigate their underwater worlds.  If you see a movie, and buy a DVD this year, then see ""Finding Nemo"" and buy it on DVD when it is released this holiday season.  This is a film that we will all cherish for many years to come.  Cheers to the animation geniuses at Pixar Studios, the imaginative minds at Disney, and the brilliant finance people on Wall Street for allowing this film to be made."	5.0	Pixar and Disney - a Dynamic Duo	2003-07-09	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AWA0CA9AYL5YQ	Jennifer Litchfield	Finding Nemo is, quite simply, brilliant.  Computer animation has come on in leaps and bounds since the days of Toy Story (1995) and Finding Nemo stunningly attests to this.  From the vibrantly coloured and gently undulating coral on the reef, to the murky depths of Sydney harbour, to the clever use of reflection and refraction off the fish tank, this is a film in which the constantly changing scenery is a large part of its attraction.  The original and well-judged score enhances the viewer's sense of wonder and their empathy with the characters.But computer wizardry alone cannot create a great film.  Finding Nemo is also blessed with an action-packed story and lots of laughs (largely courtesy of Dory - a well-meaning blue tang fish with short-term memory loss).  Nemo is a young clown fish, eager to test his boundaries, who is caught by a diver and taken to an aquarium in Sydney.  Whilst there, he makes friends with a motley collection of aquatic creatures who help him plot his escape.  Meanwhile, his over-protective father, Marlin, begins a frantic quest to find his son.  Along the way he is helped and hindered by three new-age sharks, some bodacious-dude turtles, a whale, and a monstrous angler fish (amongst others).And yes, the ending may be a little mushy, but after such an epic adventure, the viewer will find the sentimentality relatively easy to stomach.  Indeed, the character development is surprisingly deep for a children's movie, and it's a nice change to have not every character being entirely good or bad.  Parents in the audience will certainly identify with Marlin's dilemma of wanting to protect his child, and yet coming to realise that the time comes when one has to let go a little.	5.0	&quot;You're ridin' it dude.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A239R2X6U7UK48	jennifer thompson	I've never seen a more heart-filled, will-powered, animated production such as Finding Nemo. Slithering slowly upright to the edge of my seat, I felt the amount of fear Nemo father's heart embedded when Nemo disappeared. It was as if Nemo's father and I were both on this never ending search to bring Nemo back home.Nemo's father displayed the strength of his will to find his son as any loving father would. Nemo's father never gave up and once he felt like there as no hope left, his cries were answered. Although finding Nemo is a cartoon, it relates to everyday situations. It lets people know that no matter how hard or impossible a situation might seem, ther is always an answer and a way out.When Nemo's father found Nemo, it brought tears of joy to my eyes. To know that Nemo's father never gave up hope,inspired me to have a strong will through all of my triumphs. I know it will touch the hearts of many parents as well as bring entertainment to children.This movie also teaches children about disobedience. Nemo didn't listen to his father and got lost. Luckily he was found, but no telling what could have happened to him if he wasn't found. Parents are only here to help and love their child. I believe that the message was very well stated throughout the movie.Finding Neomo is a movie that everyone can learn something from.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"Finding Nemo is a great movie! It starts out a little scary perhaps for the really little ones, but once it gets going, the personalities of each character each take over. The story of how fearful Nemo's father is of letting anything happen to him prevents Anything happening to Nemo, so he rebels, and get's separated from his father. The lesson of letting go is loud and clear. My kids absolutely love's this movie and its one of there top favorite.In this film, the characters are quite anthropomorphic, but without detracting from their basic nature. The themes of accepting and trusting others against your gut feeling and many different types of ""people"" cooperating to attain a common goal are lessons everyone can take home. The destructions humans wreck on the ocean are so lightly touched on; most may not even pick up on it. I would have liked to see it expressed more strongly considering we need to open the eyes of younger generations, but then again, this isn't a documentary.Between the basic plot, the underlying themes, the animation, and being able to empathize with the character's situations, this is one great movie package."	4.0	Lesson to be learn	2005-12-03	4	3	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3F1IGAS4XLD81	Jerry L. McGahagin	Finding Nemo is a wonderful underwater fairytale - unique in that it is one of those few movies that fully lives up to the hype it has received. The animation is incredible - you feel like you are right there under the sea with them! The voice acting is superb and you get the sense that the actors really put themselves into the mindset of the characters they are playing. The story captures both the attention of young and old, mixing humor and drama equally as a desperate father teams up with a quirky, crazy new friend in a search for his lost son.If you are a fan of classics like &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; then you will love &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The primary difference (that in my opinion makes the story better) is that there really is no &quot;bad guy&quot; trying to foil the main character - he just has to overcome the overwhelming odds against him in his search. It's a truly delightful story for both young and old.	5.0	Wonderful underwater fairytale!	2003-12-04	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A158W0UWU6RECS	"""jessicaguerra03"""	Finding Nemo is such a sweet movie.  I admit I cried at a couple points in the movie.  The first point was out of sadness, when Marlin woke up to find that his wife and eggs had been eaten by a shark.  The second time was... well... at first happy, then sad, then happy again.  But since that's toward the end of the movie, I won't discribe that part since I know some people haven't seen it yet.It's probably the most touching Disney/Pixar movie since Toy Story.  And the animation's really good.  I love how Disney always has a way of making animals so human-like.It's a really good movie for both adults and kids.

Its about a mother having a lot of fishes and only one survives and they decide to call it nemo. The mother with the rest of the baby eggs get eaten. The father is left with that one fish and as he grows up the father still doesnt want to let go of him. So one day he gets caught by human beings and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist office. So basically he gets taken away from his dad and they start trying to look for nemo. In between this nemo had a friend named dori. But this movie was halroius esepcially the part were they find these sharks that say ' FISH ARE FRIENDS NOT FOOD' and then Nemo's friend (dori) starts bleeding and they start getting chased.	5.0	H A L A R I O U S	2005-09-13	0	0	0

This is certainly a sad story, a lonely story about loss which I don't find appropiate for kids. I don't remember anyone dying in any of the previous PIXAR movies and they were still great movies, so why putting the idea of death and loss in the children's mind? Children should laugh and enjoy and we adults should try to let them enjoy thier chilhood and protect them from sadness. There'll be plenty of time for that when they grow up. Visually the movie is great and some of the special features are worth watching too but the storyline is far from being funny. Grab yourself any of the TOY STORIES instead.	2.0	Pixar's Worst!

Though I'm not a huge fan of Pixar, I thought ""Toy Story 2"" was amazing in every way. I saw the preview of ""Finding Nemo"" in the theater. I was amazed, and was anticipating what seemed like was going to be a very good film, the best Disney/Pixar movie to be released. It seemed like it was going to be a huge contribution to the world of animation. To my dismay, it was very disappointing when I watched it. Pixar has the ability to achieve the best visuals in the movie industry. The technical achievements put into ""Finding Nemo"" surpass anything they've done previously. However, the visuals cannot hide the same old Disney aftertaste that's provided in the movie's material.I'm tired of people calling ""Finding Nemo"" a great movie, because it is not. It gets way more hype and rave than it really deserves. It was very predictable and overly reliable on cutesiness and stereotypes, and it was yet another Disney/Pixar movie whose plotline was a rescue mission wrapped in sentimentality. It's a sad thing when technology has reached its apex, but overdone formulas remain. Disney has been churning out tedious, pedestrian, pixie-stick drab for a while now. Their movies tend to always play it safe and comfortable; they never seem to reach out for something different. ""Finding Nemo"" continues that tradition. Why can't Disney, a world-known cultural icon, push their own boundaries further?A big aspect for creating movies for children is humor. Unfortunately, the humor in ""Finding Nemo"" felt contrived and slapstick. Compared to Pixar's previous works, this one was disappointingly flat. Can Pixar do better than have a side companion plagued with memory loss? Can Pixar do better than to give characters social stereotypes? (ie: the surf turtles, scary girl with braces) ""Finding Nemo"" lacks the situational humor, the smart cultural references, and the smart quirky antics that other animated films have, even some older Disney movies such as ""The Emperor's New Groove"". Some people have graduated from the cutesy humor approach long ago. Remember: there is a big difference in bringing out the child in someone as opposed to just presenting someone childish stuff.It's depressing to see a mundane film like ""Finding Nemo"" receive all the rave and attention while other amazing animated movies, such as Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" aka ""Spirited Away"", are left to be overshadowed by the public. Now that movie is an example of how a children's movie should be. A great children's movie should be able to trigger a child's senses, emotions, and imagination. It should not just rely on old tricks: being cute and visually enticing so it could sell."	3.0	Gorgeous, but hideously overrated	2004-07-02	8	3	5

They are the true masterminds that creates works of art like 'Finding Nemo' , and Disney gets the majority of the credit. This movie is beautiful to watch. Ellen Degeneres has found her true calling in entertainment. Now, if they could only make the fish a lesbian in the sequel, then she would have it all. The droll delivery of Albert Brooks humor is a perfect match for the character he portrays. Brooks reminds me a bit of Woody Allen on PAXIL. Obnoxious and miserable but O.K. with it. I have enjoyed this with my wife and 5 year old son over and over and can truly say that i've never been happier with a PIXAR film. Just be careful with the openning sequence. It's a death sequence which may have a few sensitive children a bit upset at first.	5.0	Finding brilliance....	2004-02-25	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	A film by Andrew Stanton and Lee  UnkrichI finally got a chance to see Finding Nemo.  After all of the hype, and all of the box office success, I know what the big deal was all about.  Simply put: Pixar makes great movies.  Finding Nemo is a lot of fun to watch, and has some of the most beautiful animation I have ever seen.The story is rather simple.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a Clown Fish.  Marlin is the single parent of a little clown fish, Nemo (Alexander Gould).  Marlin is a very over-protective parent and while Nemo is away at school (clever, no?) he is taken by a scuba-diver.  This is the branching point of the story.  The movie switches back between Marlin and Nemo.  We see Nemo taken away and what his life is like in a fish tank.  We also see Marlin's quest to find Nemo and bring him back home.  Marlin has a huge adventure as he tries to rescue Nemo.  He meets up with another fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), and together they track down Nemo.  Dory is an interesting fish, as she has a limited short term memory and keeps forgetting things.  Together they deal with sharks, jelly fish, pelicans, and sea turtles and everything feels extraordinary and fun.Fun is the bottom line with this movie.  It is simply a lot of fun to watch (for children of all ages) and the animation is simply stunning.  Finding Nemo also features the voice talent of Willem Dafoe, Alison Janney, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Geoffrey Rush.  I would like to highlight the work of Ellen DeGeneres.  Her voice work was part of what made the character of Dory for me.  It was a funny character, a sweet character, and perhaps the most sympathetic character.  Dory was a lot of fun (like so much in this movie) and is probably my favorite character.  I would recommend Finding Nemo to anyone (and everyone).	5.0	the best animation i've seen	2003-12-16	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29PCQFO8JCYL3	Joe Vanderbilt	I didn't see this movie in the theaters but made a mental note that I should buy the DVD later.  I figured I would like this one as much as Pixar's earlier efforts (Toy Story, Bug's Life, Monsters Inc).Sadly, that was not to be the case.  Pixar's other films had a broad appeal to both children and adults, and the characters were believable.  Finding Nemo seems to be geared mainly towards children and is filled with characters with practically no personality, both in the animation and the voices.  The whole thing is far too cutesy-poo for my tastes, as well as being basically not funny.  Pixar thinks a fish whose memory and common sense come and go is funny, so this becomes the running joke throughout the whole movie.There were some amusing parts, though, like the dentist's office scene, but I won't give them away here.  The animation was, of course, the best part of the whole movie.  Without a decent story or plot, so what?  Pixar is starting to crank them out so fast they're sacrificing quality for quantity.The DVD itself is overcompressed, too.  They shoved alot of extras onto the main DVD instead of putting all of them on the 2nd DVD, so they sacrificed picture quality.  Thanks!	2.0	Lacks the broad appeal of Pixar's earlier efforts	2003-11-05	33	5	28

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2 and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are some of my favorite family films; &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In &quot;Toy Story&quot; they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; they showed us the monster world. In my review on &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie &quot;Platoon&quot; might have something to do with that.This is taken from my &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; review: &quot;Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.With &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they seperate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.	5.0	One of the best of the year. As always, Pixar delights...	2003-11-10	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGH5RJDNL7TAZ	"John Stodder ""a.k.a. Juan La Princi"""	Going to the movies has been such a disappointing experience during the past 15 years that many adults have basically stopped.  The problem is the scripts, especially for comedies. What's supposed to be funny, generally isn't.The great exception in the past decade have been the series of Pixar/Disney films: Toy Story, Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., and now Finding Nemo.  This one may not be the best (I think Toy Story 2 is one of the greatest films ever made with its combination of humor, poignancy and Borges-like overlapping realities), but Finding Nemo is surely the funniest.The comic actors recruited for the main roles, especially Ellen DeGeneres, not only do a brilliant job, but the animators capture them perfectly in manipulating their fish counterparts. The animation of the fish themselves turns out to have been a great idea--their quick darting movements heighten the comedy. The shark sequence is a masterful parody of self-help/12-step, and all the scenes in the dentists' office where Nemo is held captive in a fish tank come close to the brilliance of the toy collector scenes in Toy Story 2.My 13-year-old son laughed throughout the movie, but so did I.  There is no Billy Wilder on today's scene, no Preston Sturges, no Ernst Lubitsch; and Woody Allen ain't what he used to be.  But the mob of writers and animators at Pixar are the closest we've got to filling their shoes.	5.0	Pixar magic isn't limited to the computer animation	2003-06-26	2	2	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"""Finding Nemo"", the fifth in the Pixar line and its first Oscar winner for Best Animated Film, is easily their best-looking movie. The underwater milieu and detail, both for the dozens of fish characters and settings (the anemones look very inviting and comfortable), is beautifully done- you really feel that the ocean's come to life. Kudos to Andrew Stanton, the primary director/writer (and a native of salty Cape Ann, MA), who must have some salt water in his blood.This is one of the few animated or family movies where the main character's a dad. He's Marlin (voiced, in a pleasantly neurotic way, by the oft-brilliant Albert Brooks), an orange clown fish who's ready to follow Nemo- his little son, born without a mother (who was eaten by sharks)- to the ends of the ocean after he swims away from his school and gets netted up by a diver who turns out to be...an Australian dentist! Soon, Marlin is joined by Dory (voiced, brilliantly, by the very likable Ellen DeGeneres- and even sporting bright, Ellen-esque eyes), a pretty blue tang fish who loves to talk but has memory problems. Together, they follow the reef, with adventures involving rowdy Aussie-accented sharks, surfing sea turtles, and even a whale. Eventually, they reach the familiar, breathtaking skyline of Sydney Harbour (remember the 2000 Olympics?), where Nemo's in the dentist's fish tank. Whether you're 5 or 95, you'll love swimming along with them.Pixar will always have my respect for never repeating itself, and ""Finding Nemo"" has its own look and feel. Supporting characters, many of whom have Australian accents and are voiced by dinkum Aussie stars (Barry Humphries as Bruce the shark, Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the swooping pelican), are not only distinctive but realistic. The dialogue between Marlin (Brooks) and Dory (Ellen D.) could pass for a legit romantic comedy; it's the best interplay by any two Pixar characters. Add a moody,""underwater"" score by Thomas (Randy's cousin) Newman and it even sounds aquatic.As with all Pixar packages, the 2-DVD set has some notable features, including both widescreen (always my preference) and fullscreen views. More than, say, ""The Incredibles"", the extras seem geared to kids; young Alexander Gould (Nemo's voice) visits the Pixar studio departments on a scooter and Mr. Ray (leader of Nemo's school) narrates a sea-creature encyclopedia. My favorite extra is a Jean-Michel Cousteau look at real reef life; he's constantly interrupted by Marlin and Dory, ""swimming"" into the underwater shots. It has, to me, a fun outtake feel; kids will just want to see the characters. (Cousteau's treated with more respect by Steve Hillenberg on the ""SpongeBob Movie"" DVD.)""Finding Nemo"" isn't my favorite Pixar movie, but they don't know how to make a bad one. It's so pretty and relaxing to watch, you might not even notice that it's funny too- for kids of all ages. Take the plunge!"	5.0	NOTHING FISHY ABOUT IT!	2005-07-28	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DX5ELWUXHLIZ	Jorge Carreon, Jr.	The imagination of Pixar reaches new heights with the release of FINDING NEMO, the year's most consistent entertainment.  Armed with a gallery of gorgeous visuals, a stellar voice cast and a gripping narrative, the film is a sublime mix of all things wonderful.  The core of its success is a terrific script that plays beyond small-fry.  This fish tale is also a great adult parable that has surprising depth and feeling.Albert Brooks is Marlin, a widowed clownfish who smothers his son, Nemo. Fearful of the open sea, Nemo feels penned in, eventually breaking free in a moment of reckless spirit.  Of course, there is a consequence and Nemo is captured and placed in an exotic fish tank.  Marlin must then face his fears and head out into the open sea to find his son and return home.Pretty standard fable stuff, right? Wrong. While purists may think the film plays it safe in the shallows, the film's greatest strength is that it makes complex life issues (death, love, handicaps, child rearing) simple to digest and understand.  Also, the film has a charming and sophisticated wit, an experienced bolstered by the expert delivery from the entire cast, especially Brooks and Ellen De Generes as Dory.Hype driven spectacle has dominated the summer, which is nothing new.  Here is a film that plays on every level to every age group without numbing them into submission. It is without wonder that FINDING NEMO continues to dominate the box office.  Refreshing, original and thoroughly entertaining, it is the movie of the season.	5.0	Sea It!  Now!	2003-06-23	3	3	0

I think that the character Coral is the most beautiful creation in the film and it's really bad that that beautiful creation was killed at the very beginning of the film. Not only does Nemo's mom, Coral die, but his brothers and sisters, Marlin Junior and Coral Junior die too. The only member of Nemo's family that survives is Marlin, his father. This movie has too much animal violence in it. Even more than you say, Melissa Smith. Coral was perhaps the only female creation I like in this movie, any of the others did not look so pretty, like Dory. She is not a cutesie, Coral is, but no other female in this film looks as cute as she. So sad. Disney and Pixar did do better than this, notably Toy Story and A Bug's Life. That crazy old fish ate up Coral and the kids who were going to be Nemo's brothers and sisters and I don't like it.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	As a father how can I not love a film where the father will stop at nothing to rescue his son?Marlin is a husband and father.  He does his best to provide for his family.  He has provided a home with an ocean view.  The whole ocean.  But tragedy strikes and his wife and four hundred eggs are wiped out leaving him with only one egg.Marlin is now overly cautious and highly protective of his only child, Nemo.  But when the first day of school arrives Nemo is caught by divers and taken away.With no thought of danger to himself, Marlin leaves the reef and enters the ocean in pursuit of his son.  His unwavering quest makes friends and creates an ocean-sized legend.  Sharks, whales, jellyfish, sea turtles, deep sea anglers, and other dangers are all braved.During the movie we meet an interesting collection of characters voiced by some very prominent actors.  But the action never stops.This is a very intense movie and my daughter was upset by it (I skipped the opening barracuda scene) as she hates seeing family members separated.  But other kids I know younger than her (4 ) enjoy the move and are not scared at all.  I recommend parents watch this one first before deciding if it is appropriate for their children.	4.0	One For the Dads But Not All Children	2004-03-19	4	3	1

This is far and away the most visually stunning thing Pixar has ever done.  They are closing in on the point - maybe they're here - where it just doesn't seem like computer animation anymore - it's so smooth and seamless. That's a good thing, and the fact that no-one tells a story as well as these guys is important - Pixar isn't about the technology anymore, it's about going to the movies and having a great time.  I'm going to see the digital projection version later today, which by all accounts is even more stunning.  I still rate Monsters Inc over Shrek, and here's why:  In Shrek, you never forgot it was really Eddie Murphy and it was kinda cute that they made a donkey sound like him.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2NBOL825B93OM	J R Zullo	"When you discover Pixar is releasing a new animation movie, run to the theaters at first opportunity. Everyhting is good, from the little lamp icon to the short animation before the movie starts, including the plot of the movie, the characters, the scenes and the unbelievable way Pixar technicians are able to transform dreams into reality. They have done it before with both ""Toy story"" movies, with the funny-as-hell ""Monsters Inc."" and they've done it again in ""Finding Nemo"". Well, almost. I think the story of ""Finding Nemo"" could be more gripping and enterteining. Still, perfection is hard to be obtained.This time there are no talking toys, no monsters that hide in children's closets. This time it's about the sea. The plot is very simple. Marlin is a clown-fish, living happy in his new home with his companion and 400 eggs waiting to be born. He has plans for his future family, but these plans all get shattered when something real bad happens and all he has left is one little egg, the future Nemo. Nemo's life is full of safety measures. He can't swim in open sea, he has no friends, and he's going to school really late. Unfortunately, Nemo is caught by a human diver, and, unless his father will find a way to go to Sydney, Australia, Nemo will spend the rest of his life as a pet of a saddistic child. (Yes, the story is weaker than the Toy Story series, and weaker than Monsters inc., but this is supposedly a kids' movie, so I really didn't expected nothing like a Fellini movie based on a book by Umberto Eco.)This seemingly simple story is greatly complemented by the characters in the movie. In fact there are so many memorable characters that Nemo and his father Marlin get a little overshadowed. Ellen DeGeneres is the voice of Dory (most of the characters have facial resemblance to their voice interpreters), a blue fish that will help Marlin in his way to Sydney; that is, she will help him when she remembers to do it, because, like Guy Pierce in Memento, ""she has this condition"". Dory is, no doubt, the funniest character in the story (the scene where she tries to speak the many ""whale dialects"" made the whole theater laugh hard). Crush is a 150-year-old turtle who speaks in surfers' slang. Bruce is a shark that creates a group that helps other sharks to understand fish are friends, not food. There are many others, all good characters. All of them are stereotypes, but they are so intelligently stereotyped that it makes the difference.The animation is so fantasticaly real that I think small children are not able to fully undertand what they're seeing on screen. You have to be more of a grown up to notice the perfect details provided by Pixar technicians. Attention to detail is so high praised that the research and study behind this single movie must amount to lots of hours. (In fact, I got scared when Bruce the shark goes berzerk, because of the kind of detail portrayed in this scene.) That is just to say, people of all ages should watch ""Finding Nemo""; each one will find a particular reason to enjoy it in their own way.I give ""Finding Nemo"" 4 stars, instead of 5, because I have to compare it with other, better Pixar movies, like the ones I mentioned before in this review.Grade 8.4/10"	4.0	Ave Pixar!	2003-07-07	7	6	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A89XYGOH96V97	"J. S. Kaczmarek ""jskazzy"""	This movie is brilliant - a wonder ride for children of all ages, from 4 to 84!  The voices of the colorful characters are very well cast (Ellen Degeneres as Dory, and Willem Defoe as Scar are so convincing you almost want to believe that they *are* talking fish), and the adventures are breathtaking, exhilerating, and frightening all at the same time.  Plus, the movie has so many hysterical moments -- pelicans crashing into windows, the famous &quot;bird bubbles&quot; scene (which is definitely in one of the trailers), and of course the evil seagulls croaking &quot;mine&quot;.  No one could resisted being amused, amazed, and satisfied with this movie.  You'll want to ride the East Australian Current again and again!	5.0	Pixar's best, hands down	2003-11-20	5	5	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1IGXLHDZ2KY10	"Judy Asman ""Judy Asman"""	"""Finding Nemo"" is an exceptional story about surrender and faith.While the film's deeper messages might be perceived as too advanced for children, it's presented in a way that will no doubt leave a strong impression on your child.The story follows Nemo's father Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Marlin's new-found friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) through oceans of turbulence and unpredictability as Marlin searches for Nemo (Alexander Gould), who was taken by deep sea divers and added to a salt water aquarium full of charming and entertaining characters.For big people, we learn that ""letting go"" reigns supreme while on a difficult journey. Dory's blissful and forgiving innocence somehow manages to quell Marlin's tightly wound fears. And the results always find them exactly where they need to be--that much closer to Nemo.A clown fish who was born with his right fin smaller than the left, Nemo teaches us of the unconditional love we can have for ourselves--even with all of our physical imperfections.This film is way above average.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A28GCEHD00JFZG	Julian Kennedy	"Finding Nemo: 6 out of 10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party.The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kid films to be more accommodating to adults.Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the ""mine, mine, mine,"" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess.

It didn't teach any good lesson other than ""run for your life"" basically because the whole time, Nemo was in distress either trying to save himself, or another.  It became repetitive and gave me a negative feeling about the movie.The sharks were scary for my 3 year old.  Atleast in ""shark tale,""  fear was not all you saw.  Shark Tale is funny.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2IF5C0I5BH11F	Kala	I have a healthy respect for Pixar.  They've done four major films, every one of them was graphically stunning, yes.. but they also realized what makes a great movie isn't just the graphics - but a good STORY.  Finding Nemo is probably my favorite of the four they've done.  Not only is the story heart-warming and touching, but its also funny!The basic plot is that Marlin is an overprotective father who lost his wife and most of his children in a barracuda attack.  His only surviving child is a little clownfish named Nemo, who happens to also have a bad fin.  On the first day of school Nemo's class goes to the dropoff (where the reef stops and the ocean gets deep), where Nemo and his new friends see a boatand  decide to have a competition to see who can swim closer.  Marlin shows up, becomes overprotective and Nemo rebells.  He gets caught by a diver and put in a fishtank.  The remainder of the story is how scaredy cat (er, fish) Marlin goes on a fantastic journey to find his son.I saw some reviewers complaining that the story isn't realistic - but is it supposed to be?  It's supposed to be entertaining and fun, which is it.  The characters are all funny, likeably and interesting.  Dory, who Marlin befriends on his journey, is hilarious throughout the whole movie (&quot;Yes, I'm a natural blue!&quot;).The graphics are amazing as well - Pixar keeps raising the bar with each movie they make.  The bottom line is, this movie is visually stunning, the story is wonderful, the characters are great.. its one of the best movies of the year - no question in my mind!  The DVD is also a great buy - it has tons of features including some behind the scenes stuff that is really interesting.  I especially liked the special which basically went through the entire process of making the movie (albeit condensed - the movie took like 3 years to make!).  Another especially neat feature was how they watched real fish and tried to make all the computerized fish as realistic as possible.It's a great buy - I highly recommend it.  You won't be disappointed!	5.0	Not just for kids!	2003-12-02	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1HO9J4DCQDGP9	"Kali ""bengaligirl"""	"What a delightful movie!Okay so seeing Nemo's mom and siblings gobbled up by a hungry underwater predator in the first few minutes of the show made me have nightmares for a month but other than that I loved every single minute of this animated fantasy.The plot is simple and fun.  Nemo is a little clown fish with a weak and undersized flipper who wants to prove to his Dad, the over protective Marlin that he is grown-up enough to start school.  Unfortunately things go wrong on the first day of school and Nemo is captured by a scuba diving dentist who takes him away in a boat and it is up to Marlin to rescue him and he sets out on an adventure of a lifetime.Marlin meets up with the attention deficit blue tang fish Dory, voiced over by the wonderful comedienne Ellen DeGeneres and we are treated to a roller coaster ride of fun, laughter and tears as Marlin sets forth into the world beyond the safety of his coral reef home.Other wonderful characters include Bruce the Vegetarian shark, the hippy like Sea Turtle who gives Marlin good advice, the friendly pelican, and Gill the scarred Warrior Angel Fish (William Defoe) who is forced to live in a fish tank and constantly dreams of escape.Little Nemo's fate is to end up in a tank with a group of disparate fish and crustaceans who long to flee the confines of their glass prison.  Led by Gill, Nemo finally realises his own potential as he strives to escape the clutches of Darla, the Dentist's psychotic young niece who thinks that the world and its fish are hers to scare to death.There are many hysterically funny moments, such as Dory trying to speak whale, the seagulls who screech ""Mike, Mike"" all the time and try to make a meal of Marlin and Dory, along with heart stopping moments such as the ride through a wall of jelly fish and a trip in a whale's stomach.This is a great film for the whole family, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	This is the endearing story of a father fish named Marlin who raises his baby son Nemo only to lose him to a scuba diver.  Nemo is deposited in an aquarium in a dentist's office where he shares a tank with some friendly fish who are just as eager to return to the ocean as he is.  They encourage Nemo to help save them by risking his own life despite the fact that he has an undersized fin which makes swimming difficult for him.  Meanwhile his father has become friends with a blue fish named Dorrie who is absent-minded, and direction-challenged but totally loveable.  The two of them brave a variety of dangers in the ocean in order to rescue Nemo.  The production of the film is expertly done with beautiful colors and fascinating fish in the undersea world which the producers have created.  There's enough adventure to keep adults interested as they watch this film with their children, and it adds up to a delightful viewing experience.	5.0	Delightful family fare	2003-12-26	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1OBJ2263JCK5	Kenneth M. Gelwasser	Any parent of a young child knows, that inevitably their child will latch on to some film or TV program and insist on seeing it oh say... three hundred times a week (O.K., I might be exaggerating a bit...but just a little, bit)! In my case I have been very lucky, because my two year old toddler has become enamored beyond belief with the Pixar animated film, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. I say &quot;lucky&quot; because if I'm going to sit down and view one disc hundreds of times on the old DVD player, then it might as well be something that's beautifully artistic, well written, imaginatively directed and featuring some of the best comedians and charactor actors in Hollywood as well as the international acting community. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if your age 2 or 102 your going to enjoy this movie. For anyone who's been hiding in an enime since the film's 2003 theatrical release it is an underwater story of a timid, over protective, widowed, clown fish named Marlin (neurotically played by Albert Brooks), who goes on an adventurous/comedic journey with a absent-minded, blue tang (hilariously played by Ellen DeGeneres) in search of his only son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been stolen from the coral reef, apon which they live. Meanwhile, Nemo is trapped in an Australian, Dentist's office fish tank. He and the other aquatic inhabitants of the tank (including the voices of William DeFoe, Brad Garrett and Allison Janney) are attempting various plots to escape (a'la Steve McQueen's &quot;The Great Escape&quot;) and get back to the ocean (&quot;All drains lead to the Ocean&quot;).Along the way, the film imparts the ideal that although we still have to be protective &amp; vigilante of our children, we also have to let go, just a little bit, to let them experience, what life has to offer. Where do you start with what makes this film great? Do we start with the brilliant, computer animation? This is just a visually beautiful film to watch. It is like a painting in motion.You could turn the sound off and just serenely watch the changes in light and shadows throughout the film. It really seems like you are watching something under the sea. How about the great script? As, mentioned before, I have watched this movie many times and have yet to tire of the plot, well rounded characters or fast and funny dialogue.It's fun to try and pick up the pop cultural references made in the script (a shark named Bruce for all the &quot;Jaws&quot; fans out there). It seems like every time I watch this film, I discover something new in the script that gives me a chuckle. Also the casting in this film is just perfect! It's unbelievable how much comedic chemistry, actors, Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenres have together. You could close your eyes and listen to these two banter back and forth and it would still be thouroughly entertaining. Kudos also for all the actors, who do the voices for the fish in the tank. I love the gravity in actor, William DeFoe's line readings as Gil, the angel fish, who acts as ring leader for the bunch. Brad Garrett (of &quot;Everyone Loves Raymond&quot; fame)is equally good as a comically, deep voiced, blow fish. Finally, I want to mention Composer, Thomas Newman's wonderful musical score, that adds so much to the story and it's emotional impact.It leaves a lump in my throat everytime I hear it! I truely believe this film will historically go on to become an animated movie classic in the same way that &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinnochio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; have. This is great film that belongs in any DVD collection. Highly recommended for viewers young and old alike!	5.0	&quot;He's Looking For His Son... Harpo,  Fabio, Bingo, Elmo Etc&quot;	2004-02-10	2	2	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JKXPPLXJK5IW	"Kent Miller ""shortstop-ok"""	The visuals of the movie were wonderful - many times you could almost think the fish were real.  The voice talent in this movie I would say was medium - Ellen DeGeneres was great and Willem Dafoe was good too as one of the fish in the dentist's tank, as well as the voice of the sea turtle by Andrew Stanton.  None of other performances stood out to me.The plot was OK - early in the movie Nemo loses his mother and is cared for by his overprotective father Marlin.  Through the movie both Nemo and his father get a big adventure and learn something about themselves.  What really saves this movie from being just mediocre is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, a fish with short term memory loss.  Dory is responsible for the majority of the laugh out loud moments in the movie - one moment in particular when she is trying to talk whale speak provides the film's best laugh.In summary, this is probably the 3rd best Pixar movie (after the Toy Story movies but better than Monsters Inc and Bug's Life) but not an enduring classic.  3 stars - wait for the DVD.	3.0	stunning visuals - average story - wait for the DVD	2003-06-12	188	28	160

There was a time when all my kids ever wanted to watch was NEMO! The animation is riveting, the characters are unforgettable, the story is beautiful and the humor is marvelous for kids and adults and never crosses the line. What I loved about this was it fell into line with what you would expect from fish and all the other creatures that you come across and never crossed a line into absurd or in tongue, sarcastic humor like some other fish movies I've seen. A fathers love is so strong for his son drives this film and in what has to be the funniest supporting fish, um..actress in an animated film I've ever seen.

There's the mother's death, the ""I hate you Dad,"" and the defiance of a very bad bad fish.  Then again, without these we would have no movie.If I were Marlin, I would have slapped the crap out of Nemo once I found him.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is an enjoyable film to watch.  With characters like &quot;Bruce&quot; and &quot;Dory,&quot; this story is sure to hold the attention of any young child.  My two and one-half year old loves it, and not a day goes by when she wants to watch the &quot;fish&quot; show.Like other Pixar movies, this story features great animation, although I noticed a couple of frames in the DVD looked rather &quot;digitized&quot; compared to others.  The story isn't too violent, is geared towards younger audiences and has a few laughs for the adults.I didn't enjoy this movie as much as &quot;Toy Story&quot; or &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; but it is worth a look for the older crowd.  I did laugh at a lot of the silly humor in this flick, but overall this movie seems to be geared toward the 2-8 year range more than any other Pixar movie.I did enjoy the DVD extra &quot;Knick Knack.&quot;  Other features included virtual aquariums and games for the younger lot.In closing, get this movie for the young ones.  Its great for them, but it's only okay for the older kids.	4.0	This tale isn't all wet	2003-11-10	35	17	18

Adults will pick up on a couple more of the subitle jokes, while kids seem to like the silly parts and the movie still teaches a lesson, and while you knew that the lesson was there it wasn't plastered everywhere.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	"Its obvious why PIXAR hired Simpsons veteran to helm THE INCREDIBLES, the studio was dangerously close to becoming formulaic. While FINDING NEMO scored big with audiences and critics, it does wear telltale signs of over-plotting and forced jokes. Albert Brooks is great, teamed up with Ellen DeGeneres, making a comedic odd couple buddy team, and the 3D animation sparkles even more than Monsters Inc, but there are some badly-written fish tank scenes where some characters are ciphers and others aren't even introduced. The story shows Marlin, an over-protective dad who searches the ocean looking for his son Nemo, who is kidnapped by divers off the Australian coast. Along the way Marlin faces angler fish, sharks, seagulls and jellyfish in a desperate attempt to rescue his estranged son. Meanwhile Nemo gets stuck in a dentists' fishtank where Willem Dafoe's fish try to get the little clownfish back to his father. A somewhat original concept, but not exactly revolutionary. The buddy comedy movie sub genre is having its last nail pounded in as we speak, and while Nemo works on a comedic line, its core remains a cold as Tony Blair's nose. But then you could say ""Hey, it's for kids so who cares?"" And you'd be wrong. If John Lasseter and the boys at Pixar remember, they were the ones who made Toy Story, the first movie where adults could laugh along with the kids. Nemo gets filed above Monsters Inc and Bug's Life, but doesn't quite reach the comedic heights of Toy Story or The Incredibles."	4.0	Good fun for the kids but lacks sparkle	2005-07-09	2	1	1

It had some cute and funny parts. It reallywas geared towards children in all means! A lot of people say it is better than Toy Story. I'm sorry, but I disagree! Yes, the computer animation was great and storyline, as well; However, it would have to be a more funny and entertaining to beat my rating on Toy Story or Toy Story 2. And the Toy Story's had some adult humor in them, which Finding Nemo lacks.My 7 year old son enjoyed the film, but he agreed that Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were better. My 3 year old daughter couldn't sit still, it didn't keep her attention (which Jungle Book 2, both Toy Storys, Cinderella, all kept her glued to the screen).They both want the DVD for Christmas, which I've already bought and it has some good special features. And maybe you'll agree with a lot of the other viewers, by giving it 5-stars and saying it was the best Disney feature. But, I am sticking with the Toy Storys' to be considered the best films!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2X3M0LWJX96VL	Laura Bellamy	How is it possible that every movie Pixar makes manages to top the ones before it?  They just get better and better!&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is one of the best movies to ever come out of animated cinema.  Everything about it fairy reeks of perfection.  From start to finish, this movie is brilliant.For starters, the animation is top-notch, it is simply breathtaking.  Every detail, every little artistic touch is wonderful.  One of the most beautifully animated scences I have ever seen is the jellyfish scene.  Wow!  Talk about spectacular!  I wanted to get up and clap when that scene was over.The voice actors were absolutely perfect, in particular Ellen Degeneres as Dory -- she cracked me up!  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen is the whale scene (and for those of you who have seen this movie, you KNOW what I'm talking about!)  Dory completely stole the show.The other, more minor supporting cast, were wonderful as well.  Bruce the Shark, and Crush the Sea Turtle were fabulous...the fish in the tank were great...even the gulls!  I will never be able to see a seagull again without thinking &quot;Mine!&quot;The story was unique -- funny and touching and heartwarming all at the same time.  It kept you interested from the moment it started, and never stopped for a minute.  It was rounded out nicely, and fleshed out to perfection.  I laughed and I cried, and when a movie does that, I'm hooked.As is typical for Pixar movies, it started out with a great little animated short.  I laughed so hard just in that few minutes!  These are fantasically brilliant animators, folks.  This short is called &quot;Knick Knack,&quot; and it's so funny!The only thing that disappointed me at all was that there were NO outtakes.  That is something we've all come to expect from Pixar, and frankly, I was rather looking forward to some great Dory outtakes!  That would have been HILARIOUS!But oh, well, the movie was worth it anyway, outtakes or not.Bravo for Pixar! I can't wait to see the next one!	5.0	How do they do it?!	2003-12-15	0	0	0

Just sitting back and watching the great visual stimulation while enjoying a clean humor filled laugh!  I actually saw the movie twice and still laughed!  If you are hardcore adult action film watcher, this might not be up your alley, but if you enjoy watching something different with a cute plot and lots of humor this is your movie!  The kids and adults alike will really enjoy the different characters and the voice actors to go along with them.  The casting was wonderfully done!  I was surprised that Dory's voice was Ellen.

There are so many great lines and most are enhanced by hilarious facial expressions - I just can't choose!""It is true - countless scenes contain awesome adult and kid humor.  Each time I watch ""Finding Nemo,"" I find new comedy and laugh a little harder.  This movie is great for all ages - from 3 to 93.At a recent family party, both children and adults enjoyed this wonderfully crafted Disney-Pixar film.  Many adults laughed as they quoted Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), ""Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills,"" or ""I can speak whale!  Whaaaatt'sss goiiiinng onnnn herrrrre?""  Although the kids did tend to wander in and out of the room (as kids do), they demanded that it be played.  Whenever they have a chance to watch a movie, they choose ""Finding Nemo.""The voices fit the roles perfectly.  Ellen DeGeneres does a wonderful job with Dory - her voice completes the off-the-wall character.  Albert Brooks perfectly personifies Marlin as an overly concerned parent.  The Australian accents are fun to listen to and attempt to mimic.  Crush also certainly adds to the ocean atmosphere with an obvious surfboarder's tone.My favorite characters are the seagulls.  I roll with laughter because of their general character - they are shown in large, annoying groups and often squawk, ""Mine!"" whenever food is nearby.  You have to see the movie to fully appreciate the comedy and high-quality animation of this film.However, I did enjoy ""Monsters Inc."" and both ""Toy Story"" movies better, but this film is a must addition for any Disney film collector."	5.0	Cute Flick!	2003-11-18	7	7	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1U6B2LDK3BUVU	"LF ""Keep your feedback to yourself, these are..."	"Why do so many children's movies have to be about essentially scary subjects?  I reject that.  I think that movies for children can and should be about things that aren't terrifying.This movie is from the point of view of a fish, and therefore when the ""mother"" is eaten by a shark (along with every single brother and sister) it becomes a story about the murder of your own mother, brothers and sisters.All I can say is ... WHAT THE HELL !!!!!!I don't understand why other people think this is a good children's movie.  What are you thinking?  This is depressing and terrifying.It's not that the script is creative.  It's not.  The only thing going for it is the beautiful undersea drawing.  Aside from that, it is nothing.  Take the rose colored glasses off.  This film is a lot of scary nothing, and I think there is something wrong with the people who praise it.What annoys me the most is that it is so formulaic, so non-creative, but then again, I expected that.  After all, it is made by Disney, and they consistently put out sub-par work these days.  We are no longer in the golden age of Disney.  We are in the commercial and non-creative age of Disney, when all they do is scare kids and give them the same trash over and over.Who really likes this stuff?  Are you kidding yourself or do you really enjoy this depressing uncreative movie?  Except for the artists, of course.  They are great.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3J9TPLVO0T3YH	lindsay fraser	The recently released DVD, Finding Nemo, has rapidly and easily become my new favorite Disney production. I would even go on to say that it is one of this years best films. It contains amazing animation and extras which make the picture flawless. This tale will truly have you on the floor laughing while at the same time warming your heart.The story begins with Marlin and Coral, two clown fish who recently moved to a new neighborhood near a coral reef. Here they hoped to safely raise their children, who at this point are still eggs. Tragedy strikes though, Coral and all but one of her eggs are murdered by a baracuda. Now Marlin is left alone to raise his one child, Nemo.As Nemo grows older his father grows more protective. Marlin is even reluctant to allow Nemo to start school. Against his best judgement Marlin allows Nemo to begin school. While in class Nemo goes beyond the reef and out into the open sea, where he is then captured by a SCUBA diver who lives in Sydney, Australia.Marlin, mortified by his only sons disappearance, embarks on a long journey in hopes to rescue his son. Along the way Marlin meets Doris, a spunky fish with a short term memory problem who helps him on his voyage. They encounter many obstacles like, sharks, a deep sea creature, stinging jelly fish, and crazy seagulls. There were also nice creatures along the way who help Marlin and Doris and spread the tragic story about the sea. My favorite friend to Marlin was Crush, a one hundred and Fifty year old sea turtle with a surfer bum attitude. He was Hilarious and very helpfull at the same time.The rest of Marlin's journey and Nemo's where abouts can remain a surprise. One can be assured though that the ending is exciting and leaves you feeling good. I insist that everyone see this movie at least once, and trust me you will be satisfied!	5.0	Hilarious yet Heart Warming	2003-11-13	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26K25KKMYY9TG	Lindsey	I've loved Finding Nemo since the first time I saw it in theatre - it's possibly my favorite Disney-Pixar film EVER.  You tear up, you laugh, you're fascinated with the gorgeous underwater world, you'll never forget those quirky characters or look at a Clownfish (or a shark for that matter) the same way again.  It's no wonder it won an Academy Award!I was thrilled when I found out it was finally out on Blu-Ray - everything looks better Blu-Ray, and this is no exception!  It's crisp and clear and vivid, a delight to watch.  And the special features are great, there are deleted scenes and even an alternate movie opening.Special Features:Knick Knack Theatrical ShortAquariumCineExploreReInventing The Submarine VoyageDeleted Scene: Alternate OpeningA Lesson in FlashbacksFinding Nemo: A Filmmakers' DiscussionOuttakes & Deleted ScenesArt ReviewIf you're looking to upgrade your Disney DVDs to Blu-Ray I recommend this edition highly!Note: I was provided with this movie for review purposes.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3EKFI1NLY1OUO	Liora	This movie is not your standard summer movie.... instead, it is a fully entertaining movie masterpiece. Finding Nemo is perhaps the best Disney movie for kids since Toy Story 2, and it delivers for the entire 2 hour length of the film. The basic premise is that an overprotective clownfish loses his son Nemo when he wants to escape the rules and regulations of his father. The result is a fun, comical journey featuring true dedication of a father for his son and the eventual trust that a parent must place in their child as they let them make decisions on their own. A cast of colorful (literally) characters and many funny moments make this surprisingly good movie even better. Several of the fish act like they are on a permanent sugar high, but they are funny and not unbearably annoying. If you thought that Hollywood was going down the tubes with hackneyed slasher fics, action-driven sequels with no plot (The Matrix Reloaded *ahem*), and other vapid movies, think again! I am not yet an adult with children, but I enjoyed Nemo thoroughly. Parents with small children will not mind this movie at all, though some moments are frightening or sad to children under 7. This movie is quite simply a triumph. It is interesting, simple, funny, and beautifully animated. Best of all, it's original and doesn't need a sequel, but knowing Disney.... watch out for Finding Nemo 2: Nemo's Kids.... ugh.	5.0	Pure entertainment!	2003-09-01	7	7	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2W00XKTTF1G0Z	"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa..."	I am going to talk to you on two different levels regard this film. One, Entertainment Value and two, its Meaning. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich the film is utterly Magical.Entertainment is what this movie is all about. Fun, adventure and the most amazing representation of the undersea world as represented by computer animation in it full realism. The images and colors jump at you one by one as the sea life REALLY comes to life in front of you. ON the big screen it was overpowering...on DVD it's is as amazing as anything I have ever seen.The film is a the story of a Father and Son and the process of father knowing when to let go and a son dilemma over proving he is capable of being on his own. So real in it portrayal it reminded me of conversations I had as a kid with my father. All the bad and all the good that comes with growing up are in this movie. It is very touching - especially at the beginning and even MORE so at the end.Albert Brooks (Defending Your Life, Broadcast News, Mother) stars as Marlin the father Clown Fish and Alexander Gould (Wheelmen, They) the son Nemo. They get separated on his first day of school and the adventure begins. On his way to retrieve his son who was abducted by Humans for a Fish Tank in Australia, he bumps into the fish Dory - dumbfoundingly and hysterically played by Ellen Degeneres (Ed TV, The series Ellen and her own daytime talk show now).Ellen is amazing and Albert is the perfect straight man. You won't believe the clever, witty and charming adult humor there is in this film. Kids will love their antics and fears and adventures while adults will hang on to every word Dory says.Thanks to the help of Schools of fish (Played by John Ratzenberger of Cheers and in EVERY Pixar movie), two very wise Sea Turtles (Played by the director himself!) and a Seagull played by Geoffrey Rush (Shakespeare In Love, Shine, Quills) Dory and Marlin track across the oceans to get to Australia to find his son. The funniest scene is Dory speaking WHALE. I'll say no more! Watch it.Nemo is then greeted and accepted into his new home, which is that of a fish tank installed in a Dentists office deep &quot;Down Under&quot;. With the support and help of Gil played by the sympathetic Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man, Victory) and Brad Garrett (Everybody Love Raymond) as a Blowfish named Bloat - Nemo manages to get out.The story ends - now this is the &quot;Meaning&quot; part I was telling you - with revelation of the importance of friendship, loyalty, family and fatherhood. Their wasn't a dry eye in the theatre when I saw its premiere at the El Capitan in Hollywood and when I just showed it to a few friends for the first time yesterday. Everyone was laughing and crying and went out to buy it!The DVD extras are fantastic. Fish Charades, Games, Story telling and some historical and scientific information about the seas and the eco system of the oceans and coral reefs. The segments are humorously written and performed with the original cast and the Chemistry of Dory and Marlin (Albert and Ellen) is hysterical.Well...the highest grossing animated feature and top selling DVD (8 million copies its first day) this is one to own. If you ever thought of buying one animated featured - just to have - this is the one. My favorite animated feature of modern times. It still makes me laugh and cry!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38BSJHR3ZSYBZ	Lori Flanders	The beginning part when Marlin's wife Coral and all their eggs (except Nemo) were devoured was sad.  But have you noticed that Disney movies for children seem to always bump off one of the parents?  Try to name more than one (101 Dalmations is one) where they don't kill a parent.  They are for some reason against the family unit as a whole.This movie is great otherwise!  It has us in tears laughing.

Meanwhile, Nemo ends up in the dentist's fish tank in Sydney, Australia, along with other underwater captives, including Gill (Willem Dafoe), the group's scarred Moorish idol leader. As Nemo works with his new friends on a plan to escape their tank, Marlin and Dory swim closer, but they'll need more than just fins to get into the dentist's office. We also meet the improbable Bruce (Barry Humphries), a great white shark on a no-fish diet.When Nemo and his new friends realize that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece Darla. ready to give Nemo to Darla. Nemo acts dead and is flushed down the drain and eventually into the sea, but this also causes Marlin to believe him to be dead. Dory swims off but encounters Nemo and helps Nemo back to his father. The two, along with Dory, happily celebrate, but their joy is quickly cut short when Dory is caught, along with a school of grouper, in a fishing net.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALYOQ8324079Y	"Maddi Hausmann Sojourner ""madhaus"""	If you missed this film in theatres this summer, don't despair; it's out on DVD and it looks great.Finding Nemo uses the same formula Disney has recycled since Bambi: take a young animal, put him in danger, and kill off one of his parents (usually mommy).  Nemo's mom is eaten by a barricuda before the opening credits and he hasn't even hatched yet.  Alas, all his siblings' eggs are eaten, too, and his big-thinking father (Albert Brooks) turns into a neurotic worrywort once the opening credits have finished.  Marlin is determined that nothing will happen to his son, and hovers overprotectively, leading Nemo to take a dare he wouldn't have had dad stayed in the schoolyard with the other parents.  Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken to Sydney to live in a dental office fish tank.  Dad Marlin, having already lost his wife and other children, will stop at nothing to get Nemo back, be it sharks, explosives, angler fish, whales, or pelicans.The film is an interesting mix of sitcom (Nemo's tankmates seem straight out of Cheers), action/adventure (near-escapes from various sea predators), farce (vegetarian sharks on 12-step programs, anyone?  Surfer dude sea turtles?), nature documentary (seagulls who chant &quot;mine! mine!&quot;), camp (tank escape plots straight out of Hogan's Heroes or Chicken Run) and pathos (Marlin lost his son by always meddling).  The parallel stories of Marlin seeking his son, with the &quot;help&quot; of a forgetful Dory (Ellen deGeneres), and Nemo learning he can handle the real world, under the tutelege of tank leader Gill (William Dafoe) reinforce the film's basic message to trust in each other and love will conquer all.Did I mention that the animation is absolutely spectacular?  If you haven't seen any of Pixar's films in the last few years, you must take a look at this one.  A delightful film for kids and adults.	5.0	Finding A Great DVD	2003-11-10	0	0	0

There was no added in adult humour to attract an older audience, because that simply wasn't necessary. In this day and age a really children-themed movie is very rare, and this one carries the day with its memorable well developed characters and original plot. This isn't just, as most new disney movies are, a rehashing of an old plot, or a sequel to play off of the popularity of a previous hit, but it was a refreshingly new idea with amazing digital animation.	5.0	Beautiful!	2003-12-04	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"The digital animation is remarkable.  Jaw dropping in spots.  Just look at all the specks of plankton hovering in the water and you can guess where a good chunk of the ...budget was spent.  The characters are gorgeous looking, too, for the most part.  The great white shark drips with detail--from its endless rows of razor sharp teeth to blotches of torn flesh on its nose.  The cute characters--there have to be cute characters--are perfect, like the little pink squid that inks itself.  But cutting edge animation and beautifully realized fish do not a movie make.What's missing here is heart.  And a clear theme.  And a story that grabs you.  It's like the most exhorbitantly wrapped Christmas present that turns out to be a box of styrofoam peanuts.  Well, that's not totally fair.  There is something in the box, but it just doesn't live up to the wrapping.  Not even close.The movie starts out well enough.  There is enough death and mayhem in the first ten minutes to suggest that we might have a classic on our hands.  And, I must admit, all the terror-struck children in the audience (""Why did the mommy leave?"") were enough to shake up even the most jaded viewer.  Yes, this was a movie that wasn't going to take it easy on the little ones.  Life is tough.  Grow up!And, in fact, the movie has a number of scenes that weren't throttled down in fright value just to keep kids from having nightmares.  When the great white gets high on a whiff of blood and goes on a rampage, we had kids in the audience shrieking with terror.  And there are some genuinely funny moments, including the now staple entertainment of breaking wind, to balance the mortal fear.  I liked the seagulls in particular.  But they simply aren't good enough.  Nothing close to Toy Story, A Bug's Life, or even Monsters, Inc.And the story, such as it is, doesn't hold a candle to Pixar's earlier films.  I suppose the main message is that life is good, bad, and dangerous, but that being overly protective is just as likely to get your kids in trouble as letting them loose to swim fancy-free.  That message is there, winding its way inconsistently, through the muddled messages this movie provides.  They other is that human beings--fishermen, reef collectors, dentists, dentists' children--range from awful, to violent, to mean, to stupid.  There isn't a single redeeming human in the whole film.  In fact, one message of this movie is that the whole planet would be better off without us.  Which may be true, but this is fantasy.  Indulge us a little bit, Pixar.The voice characterizations are good, if not memorable.  Ellen DeGeneres does the best job of the lot, though her character and it's short term memory loss--a joke that gets run into the ground--isn't enough to carry the film.This is movie for little kids.  Not much there for adults, which makes me wish for kids movies like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Pixar's many treats.  Pixar well knows that you can entertain kids and adults at the same time, but they seem to have misplaced the formula."	3.0	So this is a good movie?	2003-06-09	21	4	17

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ASN36IA89EBD6	Marco	As a person who was born, raised and lived in Sydney all their life, I have to say this movie is perfect. Pixar got the look and feel for Sydney 100% right, even down to the sounds of Rainbow Lorikeets (brightly coloured parrots seen in gardens and backyards in the early morning) outside the dentist's window the morning the tank is clean. The view from the dentist's window actually exists, at the Zoo exit. Also, I have snorkeled on the Barrier Reef several times, and the Reef sequences are beautiful and look pretty much like the actual reef.Real Aussie slang is used by the sharks and pelicans, not the pseudo-Aussie slang that Americans seem to think we use all the time. This was great to hear, and shows Pixar's commitment to authenticity on this project. The use of Aussie actors and not Americans doing bad Aussie accents was also a treat for us.As for story, this movie is a winner. The dual storylines cutting back and forth moves the story at a breakneck speed with not a single boring moment. The devoted-father-and-lost-son theme is well told and never gushy/cutesy. All this using jaw-dropping animation. And how could anyone not fall in love with Dory?As far as I could see, there was only 1 technical fault. The pelicans depicted in this movie are actually North American pelicans. (mainly brown). The Australian Pelican is all white with black wings.But I'll forgive Pixar this single boo-boo.Thank you Pixar for choosing our beautiful city for this movie, and an even bigger thanks for showing Sydney so magnificently and realistically.	5.0	Sydney and the Great Barrier Reef never looked so good!	2004-03-05	2	2	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	Nemo is the only surviving child of Marlin, a clown fish without a sense of humor.  Marlin is so afraid of loosing Nemo that he is extremely over protective.  On Nemo's first day of school, he is kidnapped and taken to an aquarium in a dentist's office.  Marlin sets of to find and rescue his son, teaming with Dory.  Dory has her own issues; she has short-term memory loss.  Along the way, they meet up with some sharks trying to kick the meat habit (&quot;Fish are friends, not food.&quot;), a school of fish that does impressions, and some surfer dude sea turtles.  Nemo, meanwhile, must work with the others to escape from the tank into the ocean before Darla comes to take him away.Pixar has most certainly done it again.  I have loved all of their movies, and this one is no exception.  The story is sharp with endearing characters and plenty of one-liners that catch you when you aren't looking.  Computer animation has never looked better.  The ocean shots are simply jaw dropping stunning.  They've certainly come along way since their first shorts.As you'd expect from a Pixar movie, this DVD set is wonderful as well.  Both full frame and widescreen versions are present, this time on different discs.  With a direct digital-to-digital transfer, it looks simply wonderful.  Sound is great as well in full surround.  The widescreen disc features plenty of behind the scenes information, including a commentary that incorporates deleted scenes and other information.  These added parts can also be viewed separately.  Disc two, the full frame disc, features things for kids to explore, like an encyclopedia on the ocean.  It also features a tour of Pixar's studios, fun character interviews, and the publicity for the movie.You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, and this is no exception.  If you happened to have missed it so far, find it today and enjoy.	5.0	Sure to Entertain Everyone Who Finds It	2004-03-08	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A34IM7RFKVKH1S	Mark Shirley	"Finding Nemo is a great movie, not just for kids, but for adults as well.The movie is mainly about two clown fish, Marlin, and his son, Nemo. The whole movie is centered on Marlin trying to find Nemo, hence the title ""Finding"" Nemo. Marlin searches the whole ocean with his new friend, Dori. They encounter a lot of dangerous and cool obstacles, like sharks, turtles, and even whales. Meanwhile, Nemo is in a fish tank and makes lots of new friends from all different pet stores, and even one from the ocean. The aquarium fish are even friends with a pelican, who has an important role later in the movie.One of the reasons that the movie is so great is the plot. It is a father going out to find his son, but at the same time it keeps people laughing. You can sometimes guess what will be coming up next, but there are also a few surprises that you wouldn't expect. Another reason this movie is good, is that voicing is about as perfect as it could get. They couldn't have picked better voices for these characters. Each one matches the bodies perfectly. Ellen DeGeneres especially does a great job playing the role of Dori and Albert Brooks does a fantastic job with the voice of Marlin. The way each actor portrays their characters makes the film even funnier than it truly is.One last reason is that the movie has a wonderful message. It really shows the love that parents can have for their children. Even though they might get into fights or arguments, parents are still willing to risk everything just for their child. It also shows the message of true friendship. Dori ended up being a true friend to Marlin, and Nemo made true friends with the others in the tank. The message is one of the overall best I have seen.Overall I would give this movie 5 stars out of five. I have seen it many times, and it never gets old. I even enjoy quoting some specific of the parts in the movie. It is so great, that whenever I see a clown fish, I always think it is Nemo! You could be the same way if you watch this movie."	5.0	You'd be Ridiculous Not to Watchi This	2011-09-25	1	0	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	"Disney and Pixar have come together over the past few years to bring about a revolution in animated motion pictures. While many studios have faltered in their attempts or fallen back on trying to adapt anime as a way to make movies inexpensively, these two studios have taken a different route and joined the art of animation with cartoon storytelling.The movie tells the story of Nemo, the only offspring of two clown fish raised along by his single father Marlin (Albert Brooks). Having lost his wife and hundreds of unhatched eggs to the sea, Marlin has been overprotective of little Nemo. And when Nemo rebels and is captured his first time out to the big ocean, it seems as though all of Marlin's fears were right.Fearful of the ocean himself, Marlin must make a journey to find his son and save him. He heads out to sea not so much boldly and without fear as much as he does out of concern and love for his son.Along the way, Marlin makes many new friends, among them another fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short term memory but ends up being a help anyway and Crush, a cool dude sea turtle voiced by the films writer/director Andrew Stanton.Nemo himself finds new friends as well. It appears that he was captured by a snorkeling dentist who intends to present him as a gift to his destructive niece. The other fish in the tank try and help Nemo to escape.Word of Marlin's adventures as he searches for Nemo go so far as to reach Nemo's ""ears"". Marveling at the tales of his father's love, Nemo and the tank fish do all they can to escape.  It's not until nearly the end of the picture that you find out if the father and son are reunited or if Nemo becomes just another fish tossed down the toilet bowl.The humor in this film is so on the mark it's fantastic. Not only are there jokes that the kids can laugh at, but there are a few in jokes for parents to get as well. This path seemed to work well for animators in the heyday of cartooning in the 40s and plays well here too.The animation is nothing short of phenomenal. The waves on the surface, the vibrant colors of the fish, all mingle together to form a feast for the eyes.But beneath it all is something much more important. The rest is mere icing on the cake. Because at the heart of this movie is the story of two people, parent and child, who may not see eye to eye on all things. But the deep rooted love of that father for son is enough to make him forge ahead and do all within his power to protest and save the one most important thing in his life. His son.Reports are coming in that this film was the highest box office successes  of the summer it was released and it's easy to see why. It's because it works on all levels and appeals to every viewer out there. It is a movie that is one to watch again and again."	5.0	FINDING FAMILY	2008-03-13	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	"Ever since they made their feature-film debut with ""Toy Story,"" the Pixar studio has proven itself as the master of computer animation. Disney and Pixar have definitely outdone themselves once again with FINDING NEMO, a breathtaking and beautiful film that is both funny and touching.The film follows the comedic and eventful journeys of two fish - Marlin and his son Nemo - who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is unexpectedly taken and thrust into a fish tank in a dentist's office overlooking the Sydney harbor. Buoyed by the companionship of a friendly-but-forgetful fish named Dory (the FANTASTIC voice talent of Ellen DeGeneres), the overly cautious father embarks on a dangerous trek and finds himself the unlikely hero of an epic journey to rescue his son - who hatches a few daring plans of his own to return safely home.What's remarkable is how Pixar, under the leadership of John Lasseter (who directed the first three Pixar features and executive-produced ""Finding Nemo""), has maintained such a consistent artistic vision and standard of writing. The movies may be made up of pixels, but the filmmaking springs from the minds and hearts of gifted storytellers. No computer could create such indelible characters as Buzz Lightyear and Woody; Mike and Sully; and now, Marlin, Nemo and especially Dory.Each feature exists in its own beautifully realized, fully populated world. ""Finding Nemo,"" directed by ""A Bug's Life"" co-director Andrew Stanton (who has received a writing credit on each Pixar feature), mostly takes place in the ocean between the Great Barrier Reef and the coast of Sydney, and the scenery is as colorful and breathtaking as you're likely to see on any scuba-diving trip.The artists have risen to the challenge of filling the screen with evocative, highly detailed seascapes that rival the brightly hued wonders of real life, where the organic coexists with such manmade relics as military mines and downed submarines.Everything comes together in a way that's funny and emotionally potent. ""Finding Nemo"" and its Pixar predecessors tap into the shared gene among the kids and adults that delights in imagination-engaging, eye-tickling and wit-filled storytelling. You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. It definitely may be a bit too intense for children, but this is classic Disney and Pixar. The result: a true masterpiece."	5.0	Eye Popping and Amazing!	2003-06-07	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1HFIKNWLABJIN	"mark ""weeping_guitar"""	"I wonder if it's in the water, because there's something fishy going on at Pixar. (puns intended) It seems they can do no wrong as each film outing seems to be hailed by critics, audiences, and pretty much everyone as cinematic gems. Their latest Finding Nemo is certainly no exception and can stand right alongside Toy Story, Monsters Inc and the rest as movie magic. When I watch these films I almost forget they're actually some pretty impressive computer work because they stories and characters are so appealing and well done. Pixar is the ultimate ""family film"" creators not because they create great films that kids can watch, but they makes films that everyone can not only watch, but enjoy things on their own level. In that way they're not only the new Disney, but the new Muppets as well.The visuals of Finding Nemo are that much more adventurous and successful than it's predecessors. The work that went into not only creating a assortment of under-sea creatures but their environments (and the actual water) is awe evoking. It's amazing how much hard work we instantly take for granted in these films because the visual work is so, well, perfect that we don't have thoughts to find any flaws in it (I'm pretty sure there aren't any anyways). The recreation of Sydney Harbor is pitch perfect and it's just a treat to sti back and take it all in.Our story revolves around a overprotective clownfish, Marlin (Albert Brooks), who lost his wife and all but one egg to a shark attack and all he is left with is Nemo (Alexander Gould), his young adventurous son. Nemo is his life and he won't chance losing him too so he goes overboard in sheltering him. You can see where the story is going with a son that wants to break free and a parent  who needs to learn to let go and two people that need to meet in the middle of it all. Nemo finally does break free and does so too boldly and becomes a capture of a Sydney, Australia dentist who makes Nemo a resident of his office fish tank. Marlin can't let his life slip away so easily and sets out to rescue his son any way he can.Marlin is joined by a  blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who becomes his son  away from Nemo in many ways, but only this time he allows his companion to have the freedom they deserve. DeGeneres is achingly funny as the memory challenged fish and Brooks is ideal to play a neurotic worrywart like Marlin. Along their trip they meet a group of fish-free sharks (""fish are friends, not food"" is their mantra), navigate a visually breathtaking jelly-fish field, and catch some waves with some surfer dude style turtles. Nemo's tale involves his initiation into the fish tank crew and their plans to help him get back to the ocean, which is plotted out by a fellow ocean native Gill (Willem Dafoe), an Idol fish. The tank crew provided many of my favorite parts of the film, especially their knowledge of dentistry they've picked up in their extended stay in the tank. They've also got a contact on the outside, a pelican (Geoffrey Rush) called Nigel, who ends up playing the middle man and ends up helping the two groups find each other.I think as of right now Finding Nemo is the funniest in the Pixar cannon and I consistently found myself laughing. The casting is perfection, as is the norm for these films, and I can't express enough times how great the likes of DeGeneres, Dafoe, and Rush were in this film. I've almost forgotten to mention the fantastic sound design that helps complete the experience, as well as the nifty score by Thomas Newman, who gives Pixar a change from the usual Randy Newman score. The film has morals throughout, but the best part of them is that they're given time to work themselves out in a natural way and are rarely forced out.

Have they even played a video game or watched their local news?  If they're referring to Nemo's mother getting killed, well, (1) you don't see anything graphic and (2) death is a part of life.  Anyways, Nemo is a great film, you should know that by now.  This dvd really is fantastic as well.  I highly recommend all of Pixar's movies (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc.); they're just fabulous.  One last thought . . has anyone wondered what is UP with Disney nowadays?!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2R6RA8FRBS608	Matthew G. Sherwin	"Finding Nemo is practically an instant classic; it's a charming tale for the whole family about a nervous father who must go after his son after the son strays and gets taken hostage in a dentist's office. The twist (as you may already know): it's underwater! The father and son are clown fishes; the father (voiced by Albert Brooks) gets help from a blue tang fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Although Dory suffers from short term memory loss, she proves to be helpful--mostly--to Marlin, the father, as he swims to Sydney Australia to find his son Nemo. Along the way there's plenty of action as Marlin and Dory encounter sharks that have gone on a vegetarian diet in a 12 step mode, surfing sea turtles and dangerous jellyfish! Of course, this is Disney and Pixar, so Marlin finds Nemo safely in the end and they all go back to the coral reef together. However, so as not to spoil too much of the plot, I won't tell you how Marlin and Nemo become reunited.The color, animation, and sound are all excellent. I did have to turn up the volume on my remote, however. On one DVD disc there is the full frame version of the movie; on the other DVD disc there is the widescreen version. The discs played well without any problems in my player; and the set is nicely packaged.The two DVD set is loaded-and I mean loaded--with extras, making this truly a collector's edition! There are commentaries along with deleted scenes, a documentary called Making Nemo about the production and preparation for the final film, virtual aquariums for your TV set, a game called ""Fisharades,"" a very well done semi-documentary called Exploring the Reef with Jean-Michel Cousteau and a short film (both with commentary and without) by Pixar called Knick Knack made in 1989, six years before Toy Story! There is more as well; it's truly awesome and guaranteed to keep all ages entertained.I would recommend this highly if you are looking for a family type of movie entertainment. It richly deserves more than the maximum five stars Amazon allows me to give! The movie and especially some of the extras about the making of the film are great for fans of computer animation. Seek this movie out and enjoy for years to come! GRIN"	5.0	All ages--climb aboard for this awesome film ride!	2004-10-24	4	2	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"""Finding Nemo"" is another delightful animated movie from Pixar Studios [released through Disney]. Other Pixar creations include ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story"" and its sequel, and ""Monsters Inc."" Pixar is famous for its awesome digital animation, and ""Finding Nemo"" is its best work so far. If there is a flaw, it is simply that this tale is a bit less interesting to adults than Pixar's other movies. It seems specifically aimed at kids aged four to ten. Those who are not fans of Albert Brooks and/or Ellen DeGeneres will be less amused than those who are because it is their voices that carry the bulk of the film.Marlin [voiced by Brooks] is a clown fish who lives in the sea near the coast of Australia. When his wife produces something like two hundred eggs, Marlin is delighted. Catastrophe strikes, and Marlin loses his wife and all but one of the eggs. When the remaining clown fish is born, Marlin names him Nemo. Times passes, and Nemo becomes old enough to go to school. Disaster strikes again when the adventuresome Nemo gets too close to a boat and is caught in a diver's net. The little fish winds up in a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's office. Marlin, aided by an addled fish named Dory [voice of DeGeneres], goes on a quest to find Nemo. Meanwhile, Nemo is befriended by a motley assortment of fish in the tank who have their own escape plans.Adults may find the movie only mildly amusing. Kids will find it uproariously funny. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with making a great movie for children."	4.0	Latest Pixar wonder aimed more at kids than adults	2003-11-09	1	0	1

First, the movie looks like it was made for blu-ray.  I saw so much more detail than I ever did before.  Also, once again they put in a whole second disc just for special features (which I always love).  There's a very interesting chat between the creators as they met up again after ten years.  It's things like this that really lets me appreciate a film even more.  I highly recomend this movie in some form, and if you can this combo is the best.	5.0	Nemo on the big Blu (ray)	2013-03-05	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3OPLLHN1C14R6	Megan Cabral	n my opinion, Pixar can do no wrong when it comes to storytelling. Even with state-of-the-art CGI, they never forget that the story is what people care about and i Finding Nemo /i is the best story Pixar has ever told, and the best story the animated world has yet to see. The voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, Willem Dafoe Brad Garrett are some of the all-star talent assembled and are never wasted. Degeneres nearly steals the show as the forgetful Dory, and the Sharks in the AA-type meeting are classic. The turtles are downright hysterical and Pixar has set it s standard a notch higher. Chances are, most of you have seen this movie already and if you haven't - grab this DVD, you will not be disappointed.	5.0	The Best Animated Film EVER !!	2013-12-01	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AC8JTBIOS10YO	"Megan ""Megan"""	Okay, don't laugh, but I thought this was one of the scariest movies that I've ever seen.  I spent the whole time clutching my boyfriend's arm.  Meanwhile, the 7 year old on the other side of me was laughing his head off and having a great time.  So maybe it is just me.The movie is a Pixar film, so obviously it's brilliant.  Great animation (the reef at the begining), great writing, great story, great characters.  The beauty of the animation must be seen to be believed.  Hopefully it will also teach kids a lesson about taking care of their pets.If your child (or you) does get scared easily, you might want to procede with caution.  It's obvious that it's going to have a happy ending... but it's a bumpy ride getting there!	4.0	Maybe it's me	2004-07-02	1	0	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2OIG88PG8K4M3	"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado"""	"You have to love a movie where a main character exclaims gleefully ""I speak whale!"" If you are not as blessed as this exceptional fish, worry not. It doesn't matter, because the makers of ""Finding Nemo"" have brought the ocean to the audience. This is one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen.The story is nothing particularly remarkable. It is the standard adventure tale: one person (or fish, in this delightfully anthropomorphic tale) loses someone very dear to his heart, and sets off to get him back, encountering various obstacles and helpful creatures along the way.The brilliance of ""Finding Nemo"" is not in its plot (though it's a charming one) but in the delivery. It's a film that young children can enjoy, but that adults will not find asinine. There are of course the requisite kid-oriented jokes present, but there are also touches of subtle humour everywhere: the H2O-intolerant seahorse; a support group for sharks (""Fish are friends, not food!""); the starfish from ebay; a fish with a short-term-memory but a big heart; a group of surfer-dude turtles; and a paranoid but utterly loveable dad. Every time one watches this film something new jumps out at one. I found myself laughing harder than I've laughed in a film for years.And the visuals. Oh, the visuals. Pixar has once again outdone itself in creating an underwater world that is totally believable and at the same time slightly fantastic. The edges and far background of the screen are slightly hazy and seem to fade right into the sides of the theatre, giving an idea of the vast expanse of the ocean. The water, too, is often murky, which proves very handy for having sea creatures loom unexpectedly. I was transfixed for the whole film.The father-son relationship of Marlin and Nemo is extraordinary: unlike so many films of today, dad Marlin is respectable and likeable even though he's paranoid (for good reasons - it's dangerous out there!), and Nemo is a reasonably well-behaved son who just wants to have fun. Dory, the loveable but rather forgetful Blue Tang, is a riot (""No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family. Well, I mean, at least I think it does"").The rest of the very colourful cast of characters are just as enjoyable: Bruce the Shark and his mates in the ""Fish are Friends, not Food"" support-group had me laughing till my sides ached; they're funny enough for children to enjoy, but the irony of a fish-eschewing shark is something adults will appreciate. Crush the Surfer Sea-Turtle is hilarious (just the idea of a 150-year-old turtle talking like a kid in his twenties is funny) and Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the Seagull was an inspired choice of casting.This is a wonderful, feel-good film, combining the elements of fantasy, fun, a hint of danger, a heartwarming story and hilarious dialogue in a lovely mix of satire and a plain good time."	5.0	Do you speak whale?	2003-08-01	7	7	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1LZIQJ7O5ZBF8	M.E.	I just thought I would add my own two cents to this movie review section.  This is such a wonderful film for the entire family!  My children saw this movie when it first came out and they loved it, but we never bought the movie.  Well after a discussion with my 16 year old daughter one evening I decided to change that and bought the movie via instant video.Now all three of my kids, ages 16, 12 and 9 all watch this movie over and over and they laugh as they repeat the lines of the characters.Honestly, I'm not one to like many movies, and animated movies even less.  I'd much rather read a book than watch a movie.  But I have to admit this is a favorite of mine.  Ellen DeGeneres totally makes the whole movie with her ditsy character.  Somehow I can even envision her in the sound booth speaking into a mic with her facial expression as she speaks Dory's lines.I love this film and I'm really glad I bought it for my kids to enjoy over and over.I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine has.	5.0	wonderful movie for any child ages 0 to 109	2013-02-13	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	Walt Disney Studios created what is probably one of their best animated films ever with the 2003 &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.  With an all-star cast providing the voices, the film was written and directed by Andrew Stanton and co-directed by Lee Unkrich.  Andrew Stanton has written many popular animated films in the past few years including the 2001 &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, the 1999 &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, the 1998 &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; and the 1995 &quot;Toy Story&quot;.&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is about a clownfish named Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould), who live in a sea anemone along the Great Barrier Reef.  Following the unfortunate demise of Marlin's wife Coral (voice of Elizabeth Perkins), Marlin becomes very protective of Nemo and doesn't want him to venture from their home.  Marlin relents, but Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken back to Sydney where he is put into a fish tank.  Determined to rescue his son, Marlin ventures out into open water and comes across an absent-minded blue tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) who joins Marlin in his search.  Nemo gets to meet some interesting characters in the fish tank including an angelfish named Gill (voice done by Willem Dafoe), a puffer fish named Bloat (voice of Brad Garrett), the confused fish Deb (voice of Vicki Lewis), a cleaner shrimp named Jacques (voice of Joe Ranft), a bubble-obsessed fish named Bubbles (voice of Stephen Root), a starfish named Peach (voice of Allison Janney) and Gurgles (voice of Austin Pendleton).  Other interesting characters include the pelican named Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), the shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries), the hammer-headed shark named Anchor (voice of Eric Bana), a sea turtle named Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton), the stingray schoolteacher named Mr. Ray (voice of Bob Peterson), the dentist (voice of Bill Hunter) and his frightening daughter Darla (voice of Jordan Ranft).Of the various endearing characters in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, my personal favorite is the absent-minded Dory.  Ellen DeGeneres did a superb acting job with her voice.  Willem Dafoe was also wonderful, as was Albert Brooks.  The quality of the animation in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is among the best that I have ever seen.  In a documentary contained on the second disk, Andrew Stanton comments on how he had to tell his animators not to make the underwater scenes look too real.  I have no doubt that the film will be nominated for Best Animation during next year's Academy Awards.  I would also not be surprised if it received nominations in other categories.  Some of the most memorable animation in the film includes the sea anemone moving with the ocean currents, the divers, the jellyfish and the deep-sea anglerfish.Overall, I rate &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It is sure to please both children and adults alike for years to come.  The nice thing about the 2-disk DVD set is that it contains both wide-screen and full-screen versions of the film.  The documentary material and other extra material on the two disks is very good, including the encyclopedia of the various underwater species used in the film.	5.0	&quot;I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember!&quot;	2003-12-17	5	3	2

This movie is visually awesome, with superior animation, and a fine cast of wonderful characters.  Hats off to Ellen DeGeneres (whom I have never really liked) for her brilliant characterization of Dorrie.  Also to Alexander Gould's innocence as Nemo and Albert Brooks wonderful voicing of Marlin.  There are so many great vignettes in this movie, they are hard to single out; I loved the turtles; the shark and his &quot;fish are not food&quot; program, and the wonderfully funny members of the fish tank.  Who thought Willem Dafoe could ever be so charming?  And Geoffrey Rush is a hoot as Nigel.  The &quot;mine&quot; sea gulls are also brilliant.There's nothing wrong with this film.

Ellen DeGeneris steals the show and offers levity to what could have been a seriously sad animated movie.  Albert Brooks is the perfect overly protective father.  I was hooked from the start.Michael Duranko [...]  presant? Watch to find out.g team you are! Of course I woul d have loved to have seen the actors in action doing their voice overs but this would have to be the ONLY set-back. We only see about 3 people in the bonus bits. To all the 15 million owners of this DVD already we don't need to encourage the 'rest' of the western population to buy it... the sales figures says it all.**** out of ****** from me... his fears of open water to swim through the whole coast of Australia to find Nemo, aided by Dory the nutty blue tang who tracked the path of the dentist's boat.The movie is not as funny as most of the other Pixars, though it has its moments: the Fisheaters Anonymous meetings for sharks, some of Ellen DeGeneres' scene-stealers as Dory the forgetful blue tang, the goofy fish Nemo meets in the dentist's tank who provide color commentary for dental procedures.The movie is also more poignant than the other Pixars. And you're guaranteed never to look at fish in fishtanks the same way again.As a DVD, the extras are not very good.  There are &quot;deleted scenes&quot; but they were deleted at the storyboarding stage of production, so they did not get the full Pixar compu-graphic workup and are instead crude drawings with proto-type voiceovers [Pixar does an initial voice-over of the script with in-house production crew members providing the voices, then brings in the high-priced talent like DeGeneres, Albert Brooks [Marlin], Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, etc.; sometimes Pixar folks' work remains in the movie such as Crush the surfer-dude turtle in this flik, and Heimlich the fat caterpillar from A Bug's Life].  There are also some educational bits that are interesting.But the character interviews with Dory, Marlin and Nemo are not particularly humorous or well-written, they just magnify the characters' more noted traits. Worst of all, there is NO BLOOPER SET -- the best feature of the other Pixar films (they're so popular that Monsters, Inc. had TWO Blooper sets).  That is a true loss.	5.0	Pucka	2004-01-06	2	0	2

The graphics are really amazing, and the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenares are a perfect match for the characters they play.  The producers did a really incredible job in putting together a story that is engaging, fun and moving.The other characters are great, including my personal favorite the sea turtle (a dead ringer for Spicoli in Fast Times), the other fish in the tank with Nemo, and the sea gulls with their &quot;mine, mine, mine, mine&quot; calls.  Too funny.A great film for the whole family, although little ones may find some of the scenes a bit too intense.  My two year old was scared in a couple of scenes.

What sets their previous efforts apart from other computer animated films has been their equal emphasis between aesthetic quality and a quality story. And again they succeed on both counts.It's a multilayered set of themes that make this story so effective. There is the basic umbrella of a parent frantically trying to regain his son, while working against his own fears. Meanwhile the son strives to master his own potential and an independence thrust on him by his own rash action. Throw in a sidekick with severe short term memory loss, a group of sharks trying to maintain themselves on a twelve step ""no fish consumption"" program, surfer dude sea turtles and precision formation fish schools and you have enough enough comic elements to satisfy both kids and adults.Marlin the Clownfish is the surviving parent Nemo, determined to avoid loss and protect his inquisitive son. Like so many other children, Nemo reacts to Marlin's protective smothering with an impetuousness that leads to his capture from the waters of the Great Barrier Reef and transfer to an aquarium in a dental office. Dad resolves to find his son, while son struggles to regain his bravado and freedom with the help of the other prisoners of the aquarium.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	Finding Nemo is one hour and forty minutes and made its movie debut on May 30, 2003. The story plot is about tiny Clown Fish named Nemo who is capture and his dad goes to rescue him. That is the story in a nutshell. The long version goes like this. Marlin and Coral are looking over there eggs and are deciding what to name them and swim back into there home and start to swim around and have fun. Coral swims out of her home and Marlin gives chase and when he turns around Marlin spots a barracuda. Marlin tries to fight off the barracuda, but is knocked out cold. When he awakens, he sadly discovers that the barracuda has eaten his wife and children. Marlin finds one egg that is a little damage and names him Nemo and take cares of the egg. Nemo grows to be a guppy with a misshapen fin. Nemo and Marlin head off to school where the teacher and the students are going a field trip. Marlin finds out that the class is going to the edge and gives chase. Embarrassed by his father, Nemo swims to the open water and is capture. Nemo is taken to a fish tank with other sea fishes. Nemo is a birthday gift for the dentist's niece. Marlin gives chase to the boat but is unable to swim fast enough to follow. Marlin meets Dory (who has short term memory loss) and the adventure begins. The two finally arrived in Sydney, Australia and are befriended by pelican named Nigel. Nigel tries to help rescue Nemo but his attempt is failed. Nemo finally is flushed down the drain of the dentist's sink. Nemo emerges from the sewer pipe and tries to locate his dad. Nemo runs into Dory and the two look for Marlin. The three of the finally hook up and live happy ever after. The only thing I did not like is the packaging with contain both the Widescreen and Full Screen version of the movie. The consumer should decide what to buy.

Finding Nemo is everything we've come to expect in a Disney/Pixar featuer, and then some. There is comedy, drama, and truly heartfelt emotion as Marlin the clownfish searches for his lost son Nemo. The story is superb, the writing is sharp, the vocalwork is fantastic. And then there are the visuals. To say the least, Pixar has outdone itself when it comes to the detail, richness, and realness of the animation in Nemo. Simply put, you FEEL like you're in a vast underwater world. Light bends and shimmers around the water, you see particles float, shadows look realstic, refraction looks like it should, overall, it looks incredibly REAL. Pixar definately deserves awards for the quality of the animation here.As for the DVD, it too is a winner. Packed with two versions of the film (wide and fullscreen), and hours of wonderful bonus featuers for both kids and digital animation enthusiasts alike. The transfer is superb (not hard seeing the film's digital roots, like Star Wars: Attack of the Clones), and the sound quality is excellent.The bottom line? Nemo is a DVD that everyone should have in their collection, without a doubt.	5.0	Pixar's Best Yet, Not to be Missed	2003-11-23	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1PEO8T68DM9YU	Michael Sutcliffe	Let me start out by saying that I haven't even seen this, and I already know it is a piece of corporate trash. I actually got a mini preview of it by hearing a cassette dramatization, one of Disney's usual props to sell it's videos. It's humor is too grown-up, sophisticated, and ultimately, gross, for children. It is what you would find in a movie like American Pie, or some other less sexual teenage flick, only slightly dumbed down for children. I can't see the animation, so I have no comments to make on that. I actually like Albert Brooks' character, but he was about all that saved this from being utterly stupid and unbearable. The story line is unbelievably formulaeic, even more so than some of Disney's other efforts. I'm not even going to explain it, since the abundance of reviews here make the main plot elements clear. The characterization is cardboard, no, make that paper-flat and uninteresting, except for the sympathetic Marlin. The humor is disgustingly subpar, as I've said, it's toilet humor for children. Really, people. Do we actually want to teach our kids these kinds of things are funny? I'd never thought I'd see the day when Disney had to resort to almost swearing in it's movies to hold children's interests. That is absolutely unforgivable. And referring to a volcano as an invitation to produce phlegm? My, how pathetic! Personally, I don't find it ammusing in the least.	1.0	too adult for children, too childish for adults	2004-02-08	35	2	33
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YSG0FI8GIHOU	michael wehner	I must admit, I am a huge fan of Disney films, and the work of Disney and Pixar is always pleasing. But I am more a fan of cel animation, and computer animation can only last so long before you get tired of it.Pixar films like Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. are the only two Pixar films I actually would rate high. Toy Story's sequal was really unneeded, and A Bugs Life just wasn't up to game. But when you ask me about Finding Nemo, I'd say this much....Finding Nemo was made out in advertizments to be a very funny, and haert warming film. At veiwing I saw none of these qualities.Yes it's true you get a few laughs out of it, but thats all. It lacks a real point, and a journy across the sea would be much more exciting then some jelly fish, vegetarian sharks, and surfer dude turtles.  Ellen Degeneress, although a very good and funny actress, couldn't save this movie.My expectaions must have been to high, but this proves that Pixar is slouching.  I didn't even feel bad when Marlin's wife Coral died. It was just a failed attempt to make the movie emotional.If you want a movie, I suggest you buy The Lion King, or Lilo and Stitch. Both of which are actually worth your money. If it's Pixar you want, you can't go wrong with Monsters Inc. or Toy Story.P.S. The animation was perfect, but thats not enough to help this film slide.	1.0	Not as good as they made you think	2004-02-16	65	11	54

Now that I've said that, I should tell you that this is NOT solely a childrens' movie, but will be enjoyed as much (if not more) by adults. The cleverness of Pixar will never cease to amaze me. Only they could take a concept like a full-length movie about fish and make it totally believable. This film succeeds n being very, very funny. Heck, I'm 16 and saw it in the theater with only my mother. The two of us were laughing hysterically throughout the entire thing!There's alot of sadness and emotion in this movie and some absolutely terrific voice acting--the voice cast is top-notch. There are some touching moments and subtle messages to be heard by all, not just kids. I look forward with anticipation to the DVD release of this wonderful movie. The suspense never lets up; encounters with jellyfish, a whale, and a deep-sea lanturn fish make every moment exciting.As we know, every Disney/Pixar film is associated with its own special ""short."" Well, this one is the best yet, and the short film sets you up for the great feelings you'll have while seeing ""Finding Nemo."" I won't give away the storyline, but it involves a cute snowman, a water globe, and some tropical souvenirs that completely ready one for the overwhelming tropical-ness of the feature film.One thing I can't get over is how true-to-life these characters are. The attention to finding a unique species for each fish is incredible and adds a whole new, educational, dimension to the movie. There are some memorable characters in ""Finding Nemo."" First and foremost is Marlin, the lovable clownfish who is an overprotective father to his adventurous son, Nemo. Then there's Dory, the regal blue tang with the memory problem. She provides much of the comic relief but is also an immensely ""real"" character. Bruce is a mako shark who wants to get rid of the typical image of sharks as mindless eating machines. Crush is a 150-year-old sea turtle with a cool-surfer-dude attitude. Nigel is a helpful pelican. The whole thing takes place in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia.And then there are the aquarium fish, who invite Nemo into their 'club' when he gets scooped from the sea. He goes through the initiation ceremony at Mt. Wannahockaloogee, complete with tiki statues and all. The animation is awesome. Their group includes Peach, the lookout starfish; Deb, a delusional fish who thinks her reflection is her sister; a French shrimp, a puffer fish, a yellow tang, and a royal gramma. They are led by Gill, a moorish idol who longs to return to the ocean.This film is excellent; it deserves a sequel...Overall this is one film that nobody should miss--parents, kids, or otherwise.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	You can always count on a Pixar film to create loads of family fun as parents and children alike take some time off their busy schedules to enjoy another one of their features. They sure have a great record for it. They began with the surprise hit Toy Story, which started the long-standing trend of computer animated films. They followed with A Bug's Life in 1998, Toy Story 2 in 1999 and Monsters Inc. in 2001. Pixar outperforms each of their previous efforts which is very rare in the modern Hollywood scene. Now, after taking a year off, they take audiences to the ocean in Finding Nemo. But how well will the film do? This is the first time a Pixar film has been placed during the summer time (all previous efforts had been released in November) but this allows for more success with children finishing school. Another problem for the film is lack of voice talent. Monsters Inc. had the advantage of John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the leading roles but the voices for this film are less known. This doesn't matter to children but it can be for some adults.  The question is whether Finding Nemo can continue Pixar's trend of success or will be the film be sunk by the competition?The story goes that Marlin, an orange and white striped clownfish, lives with his son Nemo, who has a &quot;lucky&quot; fin that is smaller then his other fin, in the ocean near Australia. Marlin is very cautious after the death of his wife and fears for the safety of his son. He fears so much that follows his son on a field-trip on his first day of school. Nemo, who seems embarrassed by his father's over-protective behavior, swims to a boat as dare to prove that he is not like his father. But this courage gets him in trouble as he is captured by a scuba-diver and taken away to a dentist's office in Australia. Marlin goes on a rapid search for his only son and along the way he meets a variety of colorful characters. Among those are Dory, a blue fish with short-term memory loss, Bruce, a shark who forms a club for vegetarian sharks, and Crush, a surfer talking turtle. Marlin will go to any length to find his son and bring him home even if it means facing his own fears head on. Like all previous films, Finding Nemo's story is far superior to most animated films though, it can be said, it is not totally perfect. Much like A Bug's Life, which was also directed by Andrew Stanton, the story tends to drag a bit in parts making it less consistent then Toy Story or Monsters Inc.As previously stated, the voice cast for Finding Nemo is less well-known then most Pixar films, which gives it another similarity toward A Bug's Life. Albert Brooks gives a perfect timid voice to the character Marlin. Brooks, who is also appearing in the In-Laws currently, deserves more attention for his role in this film then he is currently getting. He presents sarcastic humor at the right time with this characters as well as emotion which makes you feel for him as he struggles to find his son. Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely delightful as the forgetful Dory. The funniest moments in the film come from her characters especially the hilarious scene where she tries to speak whale. Some of the most thought provoking moments come from her character as well, which is ironic coming from a fish with short-term memory loss. Barry Humphries is perfectly cast as the voice of Bruce the shark. He gives a chilling voice-over that makes the character mysterious yet somewhat sympathetic. William Dafoe is wonderfully cast as Gill, who tries to help Nemo escape from the dentist's office fish-tank. Geoffrey Rush, who stars in Pirates of the Caribbean later this summer, is humorous as the pelican but most of his most funny scenes had been seen in the trailers. The director himself, Andrew Stanton, provides the voice of Crush the sea-turtle who speaks with a surfer accent. And Pixar regular, John Ratzenburg, is great as the school of fish that poke fun at Marlin and teach him to lighten up.Overall, Finding Nemo is another great film from the folks at Pixar but not their best work. The visuals are the best that have ever been seen in an animated film, that is for sure, but the story is not as hilarious as Monsters Inc. was or even Toy Story 2. The story also tends to drag a bit in parts which makes it quite inconsistent. Finding Nemo also seemed to have a lot more intense scenes then most films aimed toward children, which is better for the older crowd but is sure to frighten some children. Speaking of those frightening moments, it was quite disappointing that there weren't that scenes involving the sharks who become vegetarians. The scenes that were shown with them were mostly seen in the trailers and they do not reappear until the end of the film, which was somewhat confusing as to why they would appear at the end. But the spectacular visuals, the delightful characters and those Pixar tributes to famous films (including The Shining and Psycho) make this a must-see anyway. The messages expressed in Finding Nemo may feel a little tacky and too heart-warming but they work. Pixar films are the few films out there that actually have people on the verge of crying and teach them something about life. The best family film to date and looks to be for quite some time with lack-luster fare like Rugrats Go Wild and Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas cluttering the movie theater in the next month or so.	4.0	The Moose Hole - 'Finding' Pixar	2003-12-29	1	0	1

I prefer to consider it average, measured by Pixar's standards. The image quality and DVD transfer, however, are awesome: As far as I know, this was transferred directly from the digital masters (not via film like most movies at that time), and Pixar was kind enough to make a ""full-widescreen"" framing for this DVD. That is, they chose to fill a 16:9 screen with the image, instead of leaving black bars to preserve the cinemascope aspect ratio (which is the case with all later Pixar releases). The image quality and detail, too, are so good that this is one of the best DVDs to put in your player if you really want to see the benefits of S-Video and Component Video connections over a Composite connection. Highly recommended if you own a Widescreen TV or projector and wish to take full advantage of all its expensive pixels."	4.0	Average movie, awesome transfer to DVD	2007-10-05	1	1	0

Bluray takes the movie to the next level as far as detailed images and sound goes. It makes you appreciate the quality of the CG animation that DVD tends to hide. As for the 3D, its effective yet natural. It's not over driven, no pop outs, just depth and shape. Some scenes there's no effect at all. I'm a fan of 3D so I like it but some might just prefer the Bluray by itself. If you haven't seen this movie, take the time, it's one of their best.	5.0	Great movie better in Bluray	2013-01-10	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AZGEBQE5B7BOP	Mike L	I could barely stay awake for Finding Nemo. I doubt kids will get anything out of this for a lesson other than perseverence pays off, and maybe don't wander off without your parent's permission. Other than that the plot was flat and geared toward parents more than kids, the characters tried to be funny but weren't, and some of the sequences were too intense for my 3.5 year old. This is one of the first movies he did not say AGAIN! immediately after viewing it... and I don't blame him.Other movies he loved: Spirit, Lion King, Bugs Life, Piglets Big Movie, and any of the Veggie Tales short features.Yes, the animation is superb from Pixar, as always, but that's all I'll give it. Some friends who loved the movie immediately ran out and bought the DVD and lent it to us, so at least I saw it for free. I was dreading the question, how did you like it?. I simply said I liked Bugs Life and the Toy Stories better. Bugs Life and Toy Story are still, in my opinion the two movies by which all recent Pixar films should be measured against.Monsters Inc... ehh. Finding Nemo... blah.My advice, rent before you buy this movie. Some people really liked it... I'm not sure why.	1.0	barely held my attention, too intense for little guy	2003-12-18	58	9	49

The story stinks worse than a fish market - a father loses his wife and kids, all except one, which he then smothers. The kid goes out on an adventure, is caught, and dad fights to reunite them. The cookie-cutter plot is made worse by the dullest of the pixar characters so far, and there's so many of them that no time is given to any of them so they're not fished ... er ... fleshed out. What is Dora's background? Why does Bruce the shark not want to eat fish anymore? Do we see Marlon's response to losing his wife? Maybe a need for revenge? And what about all the fish in the fishtank? They're just tossed in for one-liners, with no depth at all. None of these fishy characters hooked me in. Where's the chutzpah and self-reference that made all the other pixar movies so spectacular? The sense of humor has become homogenized and this reeks of a bad Disney production. There is nothing cutting edge. Nothing pushing the envelope. It's corporate fodder. And where are the outtakes? If the thinking was, ""we've done it to death,"" you haven't! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The this clearly a case of more Hollywood people becoming so powerful they don't have to try anymore (even if these guys do live in Emeryville.) They should be ashamed at this lackluster effort, but while people buy it at the record-breaking rate they've bought this DVD, they'll continue to make flaccid movies like this. Mediocrity wins again. (Note that a few days after its release, there are 75 used copies on sale at half price! It ain't a coincidence!)Monsters, Inc. rules!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Finding Nemo"" is a film from Disney's master of computer animation, Pixar Animation Studio. Like all Pixar films, it was born of pixels, not animation cells, and so has a visual style distinct from conventional animation. The images have much more texture and subtle activity than films made from individually drawn cells. ""Finding Nemo"" takes us into the ocean, to an  imaginary world of marine life in Australia's reef. We meet Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks), a neurotic overprotective clownfish whose only child, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) has been abducted by human divers and taken away on a boat. Impelled by his great love for his son and aided by a hyperactive blue tang fish with a terrible memory named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), Marlin sets out to find Nemo and bring him home. Marlin and Dory encounter perilous creatures and make many new friends in their tireless journey to Sydney harbor. Meanwhile, Nemo is residing in a dentist's aquarium where he and his fellows captives are plotting an escape of their own.""Finding Nemo""'s animation is beautiful. Writer/director Andrew Stanton and the folks at Pixar made it hard on themselves by setting this film underwater. The ocean and the reef are is constantly in motion, so every bit of the image must be moving. This makes for some gorgeous scenery and gives the eye a lot to take in. The movement of the water provides some of the film's most striking animation. And, as we've come to expect from Pixar, there is a lot of clever but good-natured humor that's fun for kids and adults. At times, I was struck by the tremendous creative talent exhibited on the screen. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this film is the constant chatter. The sea critters talk all the time. Literally. At times I felt that the film should have slowed down and shut up long enough for us to take in its stunning artwork. Marlin and Dory really could give you a headache. The humor in ""Finding Nemo"" isn't as sophisticated as that of ""Monsters, Inc."". The writing is more Disney-influenced. But ""Finding Nemo"" is entertaining and its strength is its beauty. Kids and adults will both enjoy this gorgeous film."	4.0	Stunning Underwater Animation. Another Winner from Pixar.	2003-11-20	1	1	0

Where most studios go on a hit and miss mentality and are at their best are above-average in putting out great movies, the whizzes at Pixar are seemingly on a sacred mission to please movie-goers with classic but innovative storytelling and eye-popping computer animation.  That tradition is carried on proudly by ""Finding Nemo,"" Pixars' fifth outing in the movie biz.  And the question begs, ""How much better can they get?""  The plot revolves around a over-protective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould).  Marlin is terrified of losing Nemo like he lost his wife and other children to a hungry sea predator. So when Nemo is kidnapped by a dentist diver from Australia, Marlin goes on a mad search for him.  Along the way, befriends Dory (Ellen Degeneres) whose short-term memory problem is a pain for Marlin, but hilarious scatterbrained humor for the audience.To support Dory and Marlin, is the movies' lush and and vibrant computer animation.  An ocean environment in tough to capture in animation because everything is in constant motion with changing currents.  However, directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich make it all look easy.  They serve up some eye-catching chase and cliffhangar scenes but their real strength is making you feel the ocean and all its many diverse plants and animals with genuine authticity.  The star of ""Finding Nemo"" may not be the touching Albert Brooks or  the uncanny Ellen Degeneres, but the water environment that surrounds them.But the stars of the movie are the many characters and the wildly imaginative screenwriters.  Each separate characters are deftly developed that you find yourself caring for them so much.  Albert Brooks is poigiant and so touching as Marlin, who goes through major changes in his search for his son.  Ellen Degeneres is laugh-out-loud hilarious as Dory, but is equally as touching as Marlin is a scene in the an Australian bay that makes you want to cry softly to yourself.  Also Wllem Dafoe and Brad Garret (Everybody Loves Raymond) turn up as inhabitants of the dentist diver's office aquarium and turn in colorful performances.In a sequel-filled summer that has performed below expectations, isn't it ironic that the summers' most commercially and critically successful movie involves  talking fish?  Not really, because ""Finding Nemo""s storytelling is so unforced and nuanced, its vocal actors so natural in their roles, the characters so memorable and the animation so fluid, that is becomes clear why ""Finding Nemo"" is this summer's biggest hit."	5.0	The Movie Industry Needs Pixar	2003-07-28	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2JXRZGZF9OI4Z	"""mmcandre"""	I absolutely adored Finding Nemo by Pixar!  I recently traveled to the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney, Australia, so this movie was reminescent of the trip.  The animation is absolutely wonderful and really looks like the structures: Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Opera House, Great Barrier Reef, etc.  This heartfelt movie makes you feel multiple emotions in less than two hours time.  As the story line begins, you automatically feel sorry for Nemo and his father, Marlin, when his wife is killed.  Marlin then vows to never let anything bad happen to Nemo.  Over the course of the movie, the viewer laughs until it hurts, especially at the greedy seagulls.  MINE!  Overall, I believe that this movie is full of laughter and kindness; it teaches the young and old alike about the love between a boy and his father, while the viewer meets several interesting characters along the way.I'm definitely buying the DVD.  My friends and I, a group of teenagers, loved the movie so much that we saw it in the movie theater on several occasions.  One time, we had such an urge to see and have a few laughs that we saw like an 11:00 viewing on a Tuesday night.  This movie is spectacular, and adults and children can really appreciate its lessons, as well as the laughs.	4.0	Find Nemo when you  buy this DVD!	2003-10-12	15	2	13

It still doesn't sit well with my almost three yr old & my almost 5 yr old. They see it as Nemos mommy & brother & sisters. It's hard to explain to them why a bad fish ate Nemos mommy. Good grief...they could have gone with a less severe story line.Other than that...it is a wonderful movie in which I think DORY voiced by Ellen Degeneres steals the show.It will be a classic & enjoyed for many years to come!	5.0	Pixar creates a classic	2007-01-23	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AO4J90YPX5RU6	Moviebuffer101	&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the DVD to get this month. As most of you know DVD's are released every Tuesday. If you buy only one DVD all month, make it this one. I don't care if you live alone or have three kids.. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a crowd pleaser regardless. People young, old or middle aged will find that &quot;Nemo&quot; has alot to offer. It's among the best that Disney/Pixar has released. The animation is liquid smooth and flaw free. It has a wonderful story, and the voice talents are splendid. I loved the humor that Ellen DeGeneres brought to her superbly written character. Also Albert Brooks (shame on that person who had negative words about Mr. Brooks) who voiced Nemo's father, he brought the frightened father who coundn't let go to life with skill and brilliance. &quot;Nemo&quot; is a heartwarming film that will be a treasure forever. Buy it now before it sales out and you aren't able to get it for 20 years, (you know how cruel Disney can be).	5.0	The greatest underwater adventure ever	2003-11-06	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	Finding Nemo was one of last summer's big box office smashes and, given the success of past Pixar movies, and the cool image portrayed by this movie, it's easy to see why.  The story has Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his only son Nemo after he is scooped up by a scuba diver and forced to live in a dentist's aquarium.  Along the way Marlin meets with mild-mannered Dory (Ellen Degeneres), who can't remember things for more than a few minutes, but has a heart of gold.And there we have it, a simple journey plot through the ocean, meeting weird and wonderful creations courtesy of the wonderful special effects at Pixar.  They really are incredible - the water effects especially are brilliant.  Remember when Monster's Inc came out and the big development was the minute details of Sulley's fur.  Well, this is even better technically.  However, there's a certain breed of familiarity here that makes you think that the people at Pixar are capitalising on their previous films' success, because Finding Nemo is probably the least distinguishable of the lot.  Of course, the Toy Story movies have already deservedly achieved classic status, but the key different between the previous Pixar movies and Finding Nemo is that they focus a lot less on the adult audience and more on the children.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because as a kid's film Nemo is fantastic, and much more endearing than something like Shrek which, although good, was never really as layered as Toy Story.  For instance, all of the characters are endlessly endearing; from the cute little Nemo, to the lost Dory to Squirt, the baby turtle.  This isn't to say Nemo doesn't have its flairs.  There are a few more adult jokes along the way, not least a group of sharks professing that fish are friends and not food, desperately trying to rid themselves of their stereotypes.  The turtles using 'surfer' talk are also very well observed.  Add to the mix a great turn by Willem Defoe as Gill, a hard-bitten aquarium fish who helps Nemo escape, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, manic seagulls screeching 'Mine, Mine!' and you've got an effective engaging movie.  Still, it's a shame that every Pixar film will live with the shadow of its predecessor hanging over it, especially when this is a brilliant family movie, but the nagging resonance of the brilliant Toy Story is always in your head.	4.0	Pleasing, funny family film	2004-03-09	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ASEBCEN9ZWTZ	"Mr. JKW ""jkw"""	"In recent years Disney and Pixar have teamed together for some of THE best family movies of all-time including Toy Story, A Bug's Life and Monster's Inc.  The magic returns with their latest offering ""Finding Nemo.""THE STORY:""Finding Nemo"" is a heart-warming story about a father and son and the lengths that the special bond of love will take them.  Marlin, a widowed clownfish, searches across the seven seas for his son Nemo who was captured by a fishing boat.  He braves all the dangers of the ocean including sharks, seagulls, jellyfish and assorted other predators, to find his son.  Along his journey he befriends the forgetful fish Dory and some sea turtles.  All in all, it's yet another heart-warming and fun tale from our friends at Disney and Pixar.THOUGHTS:For myself, this was easily Pixar's best effort yet in terms of animation as well as storytelling.  The world of the sea comes shockingly into life with the various types of sea creatures beautifully rendered.  Among the environments we sea are the deep ocean, the reef as well as the fish tank.  Animation freaks will once again marvel as Pixar's work.The storyline itself is much more grand in nature than what we saw in Toy Story and Monster's Inc.  Marlin's epic journey across the ocean is definitely as inspiring as it is grand.The true stars of the film however maybe not Nemo nor Marlin, but rather the characters of Dory (the forgetful fish) and the sea turtles Crush and Squirt (dude!!!).  The character of Dory was easily the highlight of the film as the comic relief.  Her antics and classic lines easily steal the film.BEST SCENES:1. Marlin, Dory and the Whale2. Riding the EAC with Crush and Squirt3. Nemo's transformation into ""Sharkbate""4. Sharks AnonymousTHE VERDICT:This is easily the best family-film and animated film of the year.  It's the perfect treat for the family (and Father's Day) and will make a great addition to your video library once it comes out on home video.Enjoy!!!Highest Recommendation"	5.0	They&#65533;ve Done It Again	2003-06-28	5	5	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALSDJP35S1DB4	"Mr. King ""Lit/Comp 9A"""	by Brittany Herndon.Finding Nemo is a comedy,action,and suspense movie that I think is a great kids movie.I think that some funny parts in the movie are Nemo's first day of school. He is really excited! Another funny part is when Marlin, Nemo's dad, meets Dory, and they go and look for Nemo.Some of my favorite action scenes are when Bruce, the shark, is chasing Marlin and Dory around, trying to eat them. Another scene is when Marlin and Dory go through the jellyfish so they can get to the jet stream to get to Nemo. Then there is the part where they meet the sea turtle and he helps them get to where Nemo is.The parts that I think build you up with suspense is when Bruce, the shark, comes up to them and asks them to go to a party, because you don't know if he is going to kill them. Another thing is you that you wonder if Marlin will ever find Nemo.I think that if you have small kids they would really enjoy this movie.	5.0	Finding Nemo	2005-10-23	0	0	0

Disney has got to be responsible for more children's nightmares than any other movie studio.

I personally believe this film will meet your expectations and exceed them.  Pixar has done an amazing job with this digital ocean and its characters; it all looks amazing!  The plot's been summarized already so I won't go into it, but it's a very complete story that doesn't leave you wondering what or why something happened.  This movie is endearing and hilarious, and Ellen DeGeneres's Dory steals the show.  The movie is longer than the animated features we're all used to (it's longer than a number of ""regular"" movies out right now), but I didn't find the pacing to be slow.If you enjoyed the other Pixar films in some way, you'll enjoy this one too!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1S5B32WYMEE44	"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words"""	Finding Nemo is enjoyable.  Finding Nemo is a great family movie.  But, in the comparative scale of all things animated (computer-mated maybe a better term with Pixar's fare) Pixar's Nemo falls short in comparison with the likes of Lion King, Toy Story, and A Bug's Life.  It is great, yes, but not that great to be in a league above.Pixar as a production studio is simply amazing with the streak of creativity they have maintained.  While Disney churns out retold classic after retold classic, Pixar comes up with truly original story-lines that puts the joy of creativity square back in animated tales.  The voices are dead-on matched up with the characters.  Ellen Degeneres as Dory the Blue and Yellow Tang Fish is apropos.  Albert Brooks as Marlin the Clownfish is equally engaging.  But perhaps the best performances are turned out by Barry Humphries as Bruce the Shark fighting his very nature by leading a non-fish eating club.  The most subtle turned performance though is William Defoe as Gill the salty old-timer and leader of the aquarium.  At first, you envision a Scar from the Lion King but then realize there is depths to the character as a sly wizened dark gravelly voice gives way to layer upon layer of tough love leadership.  It is truly an engaging performance.The movie has many laughs and much drama but in the end fails to enchant as much as the other previously mentioned animations.  Look for the most entertaining moment in the movie though when a underwater mine is set-off.  The screen shows the explosion and then flashes to two sea-gulls bobbing innocently above on the sea's surface.  The inevitable bubbles rise.  One seagull looks accusingly to the other.  It is subtle, if you blink, you'll miss it.  The scene cuts away quickly, but you will find yourself howling in delayed laughter when the joke hits you.  True moment of artistic humorous genius, I'd say.I'm not steering you clear of Finding Nemo, but comparatively you may find it falls short of the animated greats, in my humble opinion.	4.0	Pixar's Pixilating Just Short of Perfection	2003-12-21	4	1	3

Pixar makes movies, with the intent for children, but ends up being fun for the whole family.  I am twenty years old, and have just watched this pretty recently.  I saw it the first time when I took my ten year old brother.  The second when I took my fifteen year old sister, and my thirteen year old cousin.  And for the third time with both my brother and sister, and now my forty five year old mother, and my forty seven year old father.  All three times were great experiences for me.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AA3AE1SNHREL3	Muse From Afar	Once again, Pixar and Disney have joined forces to release a fun animated movie with a warm-hearted ending. The computer animated graphics and the story are just as touching as any other Pixar/Disney film. Finding Nemo is the story of two clownfish: Marlin(Albert Brooks)and his son Nemo. After his wife and all of his other children are devoured, Marlin becomes a nervous, overprotective father who fears the ocean and prefers to hide out in his sea anemone. On the first day of school, the day that Marlin finally lets go of his son (temporarily), Nemo is captured by an Australian scuba-diver/dentist. Marlin desperately searches for his son and is soon accompanied by a blue tang fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who suffers from short-term memory. They face many dangers to find Nemo who meanwhile, is in danger himself. The dentist is going to present his frightening niece, Darla, with Nemo. Big trouble. Boosted by the witty humor of Ellen DeGeneres, the awe-inspiring visual effects, and the moving storyline, this is a movie the whole family will love.	5.0	Outstanding Family Film	2004-03-12	14	11	3

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2FAYH6JQY8I03	"Naive Pegasus ""bobawedge"""	After &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, its becoming more and more doubtful that Pixar knows how to make a bad film.  Following &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, and &quot;Monster's Inc&quot;, and &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;(which, though good, was outshined by the similar animated film that year, &quot;Antz&quot;), Pixar seems unable to do wrong.  Finding Nemo follows a father's search to find his son who was snatched by a scuba diving dentist.  During his seemingly impossible search, he runs into a fish with short term memory loss, Dori(who is played astoundingly well by Ellen DeGeneres).  What follows is a surprisingly sweet, gentle, and funny film with spectacular animation.  This is a movie that you cannot aford to miss.	5.0	truely moving animated epic	2004-04-19	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3A90CELVLOUP6	"Nanciejeanne ""Enjay"""	"My 4-year old twins were very excited to see this movie after having seen plenty of hype on tv regarding its release.  There is a very good Pixar short at the beginning of the film, I think my kids liked this as much as the movie!  Don't show up late or get stuck in the popcorn line or you will miss it!Now on with the show..The movie starts with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his wife (sounds like the wife from Emperor's New Groove) expecting 400 children (well, they are fish).  Then (scary music here) a big old meanie fish shows up.  My son didn't like this..he hid his face.  But they don't show the wife and kids getting eaten up(except one--Nemo.)The rest of the story is about Nemo's Dad being overprotective and Nemo asserting his freedom..then learning about each other after losing each other, and of course (..and I don't think this is a spoiler, after all it is Disney...) finding each other at the end.Ellen Degeneres is Marlin's sidekick (Dory) during his search for Nemo. She is really good...great timing on the lines.  Albert Brook's is typical Brooks-but even if you don't like him..he is neurotic-good in this part.  They meet other characters along the way...the turtles are great. (Some are spot-the-celebrity-voice scenes.) Some of the scenes are a little scary for some of the kids (especially the dark scene at the really deep part of the ocean...I was even a little scared of that fish!)Meanwhile, Nemo finds himself as a pet in a Dentist's office waiting to be adopted by a fish-shaking-niece soon. He doesn't want to be ""belly-up""  with her so he and his tank-mates try to come up with escape plans.  The tank scenes are terrific.  Don't miss Mount Wanahockalugie!Really cute movie overall.  There seemed to be alot of little jokes throughout..some I am sure I didn't catch on one viewing.  Funny stuff aimed at the parents in the audience.  It's nice when the parents can get a little chuckle in here and there in a kid's movie--nothing really off-color or anything.  The stingray (the children-fish's teacher) was singing here and there and what I could catch was great!  I would like to view this over and over on DVD to catch all the quick stuff.  I don't think it was too scary for my kids...they talked about it favorably later...and upon subsequent viewings the scary things don't come out of nowhere and hopefully won't scare them anymore.Definately better than the last few Disney releases (Treasure Planet, Lilo and Stitch and even better that Monster's Inc.  which was a little scary, too come to think about it.)  I will definately be on the pre-order DVD list for this one!"	5.0	Good, a little scary for younger kids...still 5 stars	2003-05-31	2	2	0

You've probably already read about the baracuda eating Nemo's mom and all his siblings in the first 15 minutes of the movie.  I can't say that was as disturbing to the kids as it was to me - they were all confused as to what was going on and didn't get it.  However, there is one shock after another in this film.  From the sharks to the dentist performing root canal work, to the sadistic little girl that Nemo is to be given to, none of the kids in my group liked the film.I think Disney tried to hard to make an action-packed film and forgot that there can be action without the fear factor (think Toy Story 2)The two stars I gave it are for the graphics -- superior as usual, and Ellen DeGeneres' portrayl of Dorrie, the forgetful fish who helps Nemo's dad find him.	2.0	Disappointing	2003-05-30	25	8	17

In addition, the character voices are outstanding.  Albert Brooks is great as the overbearing, neurotic father clown fish, Marlin.  Ellen Degeneres is wonderful as Dory a friend who helps him find his lost son Nemo.  The beginning of the film concerns me a little (for children) with the tragic scene of Marlin's &quot;wife&quot; Coral and their offspring eggs being devoured by a predator.  Nemo was the only egg left behind.  This causes Marlin to be overly protective of his only son.  However, like all kids Nemo wants to spread his wings or in his case fins.  He dares to go out into the open sea in which he gets caught by a scuba diving dentist who takes him back to Sydney with him.  Along the journey to finding Nemo, friendships are formed, trust is developed, and courage becomes everyone's middle name.	5.0	Nemo Found	2003-11-13	2	2	0

When a clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) becomes seperated from his young son Nemo, he travels across the vast ocean to find him.  On his journey he meets a blue tangfish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who suffers from short term memory loss, while having plenty of encounters with sharks on what resemble to be they're version of a twelve step program (&quot;just one bite, just one bite!&quot;), jelly fish, sea turtles, seaguls, and pelicans.  The animation is superb, Pixar has come such a long way since Toy Story all those years ago; and children will find immense enjoyment in the colorful, friendly fish life to be found in Finding Nemo.  The rest of the cast of voices features Allison Janney, Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, and Eric Bana.  The DVD itself is a modern marvel of DVD technology, and is absolutely a must own for parents and they're children.

Definitely enhances the movie.#3:  The underwater scenes are indeed a feast for your eyes.This is the best major studio release so far this Summer, and I seldom make such qualiatative statements.  It's a cinch to be Disney's first win of a Best Animated Film Oscar, and depending on the quality of Oscar worthy movies, should be a contender for Best Picture.	5.0	The #1 Summer Hit	2003-07-08	3	2	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2FG29CGPQV29N	Neilisa	Pixar has done it again with another great movie.  Finding Nemo is a heartwarming story about Marlin, a clown fish, who loses his mate and almost all of his children to a shark.  His one remaining child, Nemo, is a boisterous, fun-loving little fish.  But after the trauma of losing almost all of his family, Marlin begins living his life with fear:  Fear of the ocean and of losing Nemo.  His overprotectiveness eventually becomes a problem when Nemo goes out on his first day of school; A day that includes a field trip to the outer edges of the reef.When Marlin finds out, he panics and rushes out to pull Nemo from the trip.  All in all, this results in a rift between Nemo and his father and Nemo's eventual capture by a dentist, who whisks him away to his aquarium to keep him there until he can present him as a gift to his young niece, a &quot;fish-killer&quot;.  Marlin, realizing what his fear has cost him, begins his trek to Sydney to rescue Nemo.  And this is where the adventure begins.I love this movie.  Marlin's adventure allows him to cross paths with many different species of fish and birds, some friendly, some not so friendly and some who are down right dangerous.  In the process, Marlin learns the importance of letting go and trusting Nemo and also learns to let go of his fear and just live.I have no complaints.  This graphics were outstanding and very colorful.  Pixar did an outstanding job.	5.0	Funny and heartwarming	2004-01-20	1	0	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A37NEHKEWK9ZS8	Neil Leslie	Astonishing animation, standout performances, and a story with plenty of heart make this movie a winner in the best Disney tradition.Traumatized by the loss of his wife and all but one of his children, an overanxious clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) hovers obsessively over his son Nemo, stifling the boy's natural sense of adventure and curiosity and making his son miserable in the name of keeping him safe. When Nemo defies Marlin's wishes and is snatched by divers from before Marlin's eyes, the father sets out on an epic quest to find his son. Along the way, Marlin learns that sometimes the most loving thing a father can do is let go and let children take risks and have the adventures they long for. Nemo, for his part, learns that whatever his father's personal shortcomings, almost everything Marlin does is motivated by a fierce, devoted love for his son. This is the kind of movie that helps parents understand their kids and kids understand their parents--a family movie in the truest and best sense of the word.Ellen DeGenneres is absolutely hilarious and winning as Dory, the ditzy but loveable blue tang fish (&quot;Yes, I'm a natural blue&quot;) who aids Marlin in his search despite being addled by short-term memory problems (&quot;It runs in my family . . . Where are they?&quot;). Brad Garrett (&quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;) and Willem Dafoe (&quot;Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;) turn in nice supporting performances as two members of a tankful of fish in which Nemo finds himself.The computer-generated animation in this film is mesmerizing, but thankfully, unlike so many other movies these days, the visual effects never overwhelm the story or the characters. Instead, the animation supports the story, making Nemo and his friends more real and drawing us deeper into this incredible underwater world.	5.0	For a Clownfish, he really IS that funny!	2004-07-05	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2IRWF3MNCUQWO	Neverwinter Knight	"I honestly expected more from this film. I had spent many minutes watching teasers for this film, because I had to sit through previews at movies. I thought it looked imaginative. Although this was the case in terms of visual effects, the story was sub-par. At best.I love Pixar, and in my opinion they make the best films for Disney. My favorite of which was probably A Bug's Life. My review was most likely swayed by the masses of little kids and rock head parents.In the beginning, Marlin, Nemo's father, is having a conversation with Nemo's mother. Nearly instantaneously, a barracuda comes out of no where. In a dash to save her eggs, the mother lunges for a cave. Marlin tries to stop her, but is attacked by the large fish. The scene fades out, and fades in on Marlin. Plug your ears for this. On top of the fact that there are no funny scenes for the next fifteen minutes, let alone the rest of the movie, you will be swamped by nearly twice that time by kids asking their parents 'Where are the eggs? Where is the mother?' I felt like turning around and yelling in their faces ' She's dead! Can't you read between the lines? Jeezus, you would think the your parents wouldn't take an infant here!"" And the scary part is, I like kids.On top of this, there is no 'bad guy'. This movie floats along for two hours on a course for no where, like a piece of driftwood with holes, plot-holes, that is. Later on in the movie, Willem Dafoe's character, some forgettable fish whose name I have already forgotten, tells Nemo that 'All drains lead to the ocean.' WHat the hell is that? Drains lead to water processing factories where all waste, i.e. Nemo, will be burned in an incinerator.All in all, the reason this is even entertaining is the attention to detail. I give serious kudos to the animators."	3.0	A fishy tale.	2003-06-09	16	3	13

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	Finding Nemo is probably one of the best movies ever produced by Pixar and Walt Disney.  It was a hit at the theaters, and also a hit on the DVD release.  This two-disc set features the same movie as the original theatrical release, plus lots of extra features.  There are extra scenes and deleted scenes, but these are mainly sketches and hence are not included as part of the regular movie.  The movie itself is worth buying this set; its bright and flashy with cool visuals and special effects that make it attractive for kids.  The soundtrack is considerably different from the traditional classical fair found in Disney's motion length pictures.  This movie's soundtrack is laid back and different, but paces well with the action.  The voice-overs are great, and the comedy is unique and hilarious.  Vegetarian sharks!  Fish without memory!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AP5NXS66INNOB	newyork2dallas	Finding Nemo is a good movie with super production and great Disney themes: family, paternal instincts, friendship, loyalty, and the parent-child conflict dynamic of protecting the child versus the ability to let go and let the progeny do things on his/her own.  For those who don't know: Marlin and Coral are clownfish who produced a school's worth of eggs but Coral and all but one of the eggs are eaten by a barracuda in the first minutes of the film (scary for little ones).  Nemo is the sole survivor and grows up with his overprotective dad Marlin.  On his first day of educational school, Nemo is captured by a diver for his dental office's saltwater fish collection and Marlin overcomes his fears of open water to swim through the whole coast of Australia to find Nemo, aided by Dory the nutty blue tang who tracked the path of the dentist's boat.The movie is not as funny as most of the other Pixars, though it has its moments: the Fisheaters Anonymous meetings for sharks, some of Ellen DeGeneres' scene-stealers as Dory the forgetful blue tang, the goofy fish Nemo meets in the dentist's tank who provide color commentary for dental procedures.The movie is also more poignant than the other Pixars.  And you're guaranteed never to look at fish in fishtanks the same way again.As a DVD, the extras are not very good.  There are &quot;deleted scenes&quot; but they were deleted at the storyboarding stage of production, so they did not get the full Pixar compu-graphic workup and are instead crude drawings with proto-type voiceovers [Pixar does an initial voice-over of the script with in-house production crew members providing the voices, then brings in the high-priced talent like DeGeneres, Albert Brooks [Marlin], Geoffrey Rush, Willem Dafoe, etc.; sometimes Pixar folks' work remains in the movie such as Crush the surfer-dude turtle in this flik, and Heimlich the fat caterpillar from A Bug's Life].  There are also some educational bits that are interesting.But the character interviews with Dory, Marlin and Nemo are not particularly humorous or well-written, they just magnify the characters' more noted traits.  Worst of all, there is NO BLOOPER SET -- the best feature of the other Pixar films (they're so popular that Monsters, Inc. had TWO Blooper sets).  That is a true loss.	4.0	Good movie, so-so DVD	2003-11-07	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ	Nicholas Stix	"Recently, I saw Albert Brooks on Late Night with David Letterman, talking about Finding Nemo. Brooks, who stars as the voice of Marlon, the daddy fish, had taken his son (who, I believe was about five years old, the equivalent human age of Nemo), to the premiere. After about five minutes, Brooks said his son leaned over to him, and quietly said, the way a grownup might, ""I cannot watch this movie,"" and walked out. Late in the movie, the son returned, having obviously been crying. Leaning over, Brooks assured his son, ""You are not Nemo.""Such is the power of this fish story about father and son clownfish who become separated, and must struggle to find their way back to each other. Marlon is a loving but neurotic and overprotective father; Nemo is a frustrated young fish who wants to be independent and see the world, and resents his father for preventing him from doing so. We see an ocean (read: the world) that is a terrible, heartless, and yet joyous place that we frail fish must confront, as best we can, because there's no alternative.The animation was done by the wonderful folks from Pixar, who are the closest thing to the reincarnation of Walt Disney. There is simply no comparison between the animation of the typical, visually flat, politically correct, contemporary animated movie (many of which are produced by Walt Disney Pictures!) and Nemo. In Nemo, the ocean floor looks like the ocean. And the characters are all ... characters. They are all physically distinctive, wonderfully written, and performed by gifted actors who - if you'll pardon the clich&eacute; - will alternately make you laugh and cry. Of particular note are Barry Humphries as Bruce the Shark, Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the Pelican, Willem Dafoe as Gill, Allison Janney as Peach, and of course, young Alexander Gould as Nemo. Ellen Degeneres, in particular, steals every scene she's in, as Dory, a gregarious fish whose memory leaks like a sieve. But this is Albert Brooks' movie. The Academy should give this man a special Oscar for the most moving voice work my wife and I have ever heard.Thomas Newman, of the musical Newman clan (Alfred, Lionel, Randy) has produced a score that is subtle and unobtrusive much of the time, but at dramatic moments takes over, and is more impressive, with repeated viewings. He deserves his fifth Oscar nomination for Nemo.Andrew Stanton's (Toy Story, Monsters, Inc.) screenplay, written with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds, brims with intelligence and wit (e.g., in an AA-style group of recovering - and frequently lapsing - sharks, the members intone, ""I am a nice shark, not an eating machine.... Fish are friends, not food""), and Stanton's direction does not waste a scene. Every moment in Nemo will either charm you or move you. In fact, as my wife remarked, for all of its many comic scenes, this is one of the most moving movies you'll ever see. We've already seen it several times with our three-and-a-half-year-old son, who loves it, and yet with each new viewing, we notice things we'd previously missed.Though I wish Nemo would win all of the big Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Screenplay), I doubt Academy voters will choose it over its live-action competition. And yet, I will be very surprised, if a better picture -- live action or animated -- is released this year.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A31WTLZ9HR5BZ7	Nick Weston	This movie is fantastic.  I would only hope that disney created a fantastic dvd for this wonderful movie.  The people at pixar are wonderful film makers.  The best part about this movie as well as other pixar pictures, is the films ability to maintain a balance of adult humor as well a something that the children in the audience can laugh at.  This is a touching story about a clown fish named marlin (brooks) who is journeying to find his now captive son nemo.  Along the way, marlin runs into some very interesting and diverse characters including a forgetful but sweet blue fish named dori, who is played by elen degenerous. Like all of the voice talents in this movie, (Degenerous) is absolutly hilarious  and plays this part with heart, humor, and is irisitable.  I would highly recommend this film to any one of any age.  I think this is a classic movie with many memorable moments as well as characters..........PLEASE SEE IT!!!	4.0	Finding Nemo is a contemporary disney/pixar classic	2003-11-03	6	3	3
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1U4UZW7TJXYI7	Nicky	I might have sort of enjoyed this movie if everybody hadn't been telling me how amazing it was all the time before I saw it. Maybe that made me expect a lot more. Or maybe if it hadn't been from disney/pixar. Or maybe if I simply hadn't seen Monsters INC/Shrek.Unfortunately, all of these things DID happen and this movie quite frankly did not live up to all of that.People told me over and over again how hilarious this movie was. WHERE WAS THE HUMOR?!?! What? Ellen Degenerous (i forget the name of the fish she played) has a memory problem? That is funny? I'm sorry, but I happen to enjoy more intelligent humor than just &quot;wait...what did you say 2 mins ago?!&quot;Not only was it not funny, but the memory problem got to be annoying and repetative after a while. If the &quot;humor&quot; in a movie is annoying and the joke is repetative...that should be a sign that it's NOT FUNNY anymore.Okay, I mean I guess there were a few things that were mildly funny, but I don't think I actually laughed outloud once during the entire movie....Aside from the humor, the storyline was pretty predictable and...straightforward(I'm not sure if this is the right word to use here). There is just one objective throughout the whole story and you know it's all going to work out in the end. Personally, I like a semi-complex storyline and a movie is much more interesting if you are in suspense or doubt whether things are going to work out...ALl in all, I came away from this movie feeling thoroughly dissatisfied and dissapointed. If you're looking for a great children's movie, Monsters INC is a very cute recent one :)	2.0	Too hyped	2004-03-09	21	7	14

My 3 year old daughter hated this movie and cried most of the time!  It went from one violent scary moment to another!  My husband and I were stunned...we kept thinking it HAD to get better but it didn't!  How did this get a ""G"" rating?!?  While other children's movies have some violence, like Lion King, Brother Bear, etc., those movies quickly defuse the fearful moments with an extended comic relief moment or song.  With this movie, soon as a child is starting to calm down after seeing something like the take off of the Stephen King movie ""The Shining"" 'Here's Johnny!' scene, there quickly comes a scene with a horrifying creature with  a long fangs chasing Nemo's father and Dorie, or Nemo almost getting ground up by the filtration system in the fish tank or one of the many other horrifying scenes.  This kind of stuff went on throughout the whole length of the movie.  This is NOT a movie for young children!  The animation is well done...making things look very real, thus more scary.  We have taken our daughter to see Brother Bear five times at the theater and watched it countless times on DVD!  Our whole family still loves Brother Bear!!!!!!! Our daughter loves Brother Bear and knows all the songs!  For the money that people have to pay for movies these days, the better value is Brother Bear...Gorgeous animation, a sound track that rivals Lion King, and a message for people of all ages.  Like Lion King and Finding Nemo, the topic of death plays a role in Brother Bear, but in the end, it is shown that those loved ones who were lost are still forever watching over the ones they left behind.  Brother Bear has a wonderful story of forgiveness, tolerance of those different than you and the importance of taking responsibility for those you have hurt and working to heal.  Brother Bear is what a Disney movie should be, NOT the mindless violence of Finding Nemo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	1.0	Lots of violence; little message!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	2004-04-22	68	12	56

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A10X0JN8KTK89H	ninjasuperstar	The issues revolving around a dead mother, a single father, and a handicapped son are treated with careful grace in this film.  The adversity the characters triumph is more personal than the creatures of the deep.  Learning to love as well as let a child live life despite the danger is powerfully difficult for many parents.  I also enjoyed how DeGeneres' fish wasn't exclusively comic relief.  The movie would have set a conflicting tone if the forgetful fish didn't find a way as well (I'm staying vague so as not to spoil the film).The dangers of the deep are so well personified.  I love when the movie is able to stop and let us get to know the sharks and the sea turtles yet still keep the feeling that the story is moving.  The subtleties of plot are as beautiful as the scenery.It's difficult to write happy stories.  This is one of the best ones I've ever encountered.	5.0	How Nemo does it	2003-11-16	3	3	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A341BG8RMH8QW	NotATameLion	Few movies in recent years have done as impressive a job as Finding Nemo in giving us uplifting, truly fun entertainment with a wonderful message. Nemo is a nonstop journey from fear to joy, from struggle to triumph, from grasping and clutching to courageous self-abandonment. I will not say an ill word about this movie. I cannot give it less than a full five stars.Pixar has put out some great movies--but none of them hold a candle to Nemo.Visually this movie is unlike any of its pixar predecessors. The Toys, Bugs and Monsters of the past have all been skillfully executed. They have also all been very anthropomorphic. They not only acted like humans, they took very human forms. Not so with Nemo. This movie is set in a very believable, but wonderfully alien seascape (and aquariumscape).Yet what Nemo and his Father go through is the most human of stories. The over-protected child must come of age. As is often the case, the protector (Nemo's Dad), finds that he must do likewise.Nemo's Father only wants the best for his child. Yet, like too many fathers, he unintentionally fails to heed the teaching of Colossians 3:21-- &quot;Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.&quot;Nemo becomes lost in his rebellion against his father's discouraging nagging. However, it is in the darkness of the proverbial &quot;far country&quot; that Nemo comes to see his life more clearly. In time he finds things inside (and outside) of himself that he never suspected were there.This story of the unexpected Rite of Passage has an almost mythic power to it. Along the way we as viewers cannot help but find ourselves laughing, being moved, and--always--entertained.Albert Brooks has always been on my shortlist of the best voice actors alive (listen to his guest-voice work on The Simpsons). He does not disappoint as Nemo's Dad. He and Ellen Degeneres absolutely carry this movie with their brilliant acting. Wilhelm DeFoe is wonderful as well in the role of Gill.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I'm still waiting on The Return of the King, but Finding Nemo may well win my personal movie of the year award.Watch it Today!	5.0	RITE OF PASSAGE	2003-11-26	16	15	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3J32CP7XVRNS8	not telling	Definitely one of the best Disney films I have seen in years. Personally I felt Disney had been going downhill after The Lion King, give or take a few, but Finding Nemo is an EXCELLENT movie! I got it for my daughter, who loves it,but my husband and I were both equally entertained. Nemo is a handicap fish (one fin is smaller than the other) who gets taken by a fisherman as an addition to his fish collection and his over-protective, worry-wort father, Marlin, swims all the way across the ocean with help of a new friend Dory (Ellen Degenerous) to get his son back. It a beautiful story about father and son, the lengths that any parent will go to in order to protect their children, lessons in differences, and lessons in learning how to let go. Kids will love it for the goofiness and undersea visuals, adults will love it for the heart warming story and underlying jokes.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	Inevitably, computer animated films will be compared against each other. I don't normally like doing that, but here a small bunch of films vie for the same market with the same qualities (technical excellence, anthropomorphic comedy and adult/kid crossover appeal) so it is a very easy thing to do.On that basis, Nemo ranks well down the tables; behind Shrek, Monsters Inc and either instalment of Toy Story.No quibbles technically. Extraordinary. But then again, the films in this bracket are all extraordinary, so it's not such a big deal. In any case technical virtuosity by itself does not great cinema make.As a child placator, it can't match any of its Pixar predecessors or the brilliant Shrek. In fact, Nemo isn't really a kid's film at all. Our Monsters Inc-mad 3 year old, whose tastes are admittedly somewhat eclectic (also a big fan of Blade Runner, for some reason), was simply terrified and now refuses point blank to watch the DVD. I can see his point: Nemo is quite violent in places - it may be cartoon violence, but given the technical achievement, these cartoons are now so realistic that the very idea of cartoon violence begins to lose its meaning.As a parent placator, Nemo isn't a great deal better. One of the truly shining qualities of the earlier Pixar releases is their rewatchability factor - since you are forced to endure them over and over at your children's behest, this is an inestimably vital quality. Every pass at Monsters Inc. reveals a fertile crop of partially buried cinematic references, visual gags and cheeky quips from background characters. Nemo is stonier ground. Nor is the script as funny - there are some nice touches, to be sure (Barry Humphries' Bruce the Shark is a cracker, but gets precious little screen time) and while Ellen DeGeneres' Dory is funny enough, in her I think the production doesn't have quite the same calibre of comic timing offered by a Billy Crystal, Tim Allen or Eddie Murphy.The overall vibe of the picture - a cloyingly redemptive weepy, basically - is so Disney it hurts. In case you were wondering, I mean that in a bad way. The earlier Pixar movies largely avoided this, and were all the better for it. Nemo charts a course straight back into Bambi territory.Apparently Pixar has nixed its relationship with Disney (I wonder if this sort of editorial influence in part brought that about), and it would do very well to go back to the anarchic post-modern comedy and lay off the maudlin moralising next time.Lastly a couple of points on the DVD: as seems to be Disney's wont, the pre-menu stage is jammed with advertisements for other Disney pictures you have to actively avoid (though at least now you *can* actively avoid them - in Toy Story you have to cue through the blighters) and the making-of documentary reveals a horribly self satisfied bunch who were openly of the opinion that they were making one of the best movies of all time - which is a sure recipe for a stinker.As it happens Nemo isn't a stinker, but it isn't a great film either. We're still in full-frontal Disney hype at the moment, of course, but I suspect time will come to judge Nemo rather more harshly than has the box office.Watch those sale bins.Olly Buxton	3.0	Falls short of its illustrious predecessors	2004-03-08	4	2	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AHF97M45JFCB	ONENEO	"Back in 2003, when Finding Nemo hit the big screen, Pixar had a track record of only four prior feature films! Having covered such topics as living toys, the day in the life of a bug, and blue-collar trials and tribulations of the average working monster, Finding Nemo represented a departure from land-based set computer wizardry to oceanic exploits of the grandest scale.Finding Nemo takes its viewers along on the offbeat voyage of an overprotective clownfish father, Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he attempts to locate his lost (abducted) son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). See it turns out that while defying his father, young Nemo wanders too close to a human scuba diving expedition and ends up becoming a salt-water aquarium specimen.In an instant, the once free clown fish finds himself captive (with several other inhabitants) in the waiting room of an Australian dentist's office.  The film basically divides its time flashing between the two environments: Marlin's trek across the ocean to reach Sidney Harbor (with the aid of a forgetful regal tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and a hippie aquatic turtle named Crush (voiced by director Andrew Stanton)) & Nemo's time in captivity, planning a great escape.At a runtime of 100-minutes (1 hour, 40 minutes), Finding Nemo is one of the lengthier entries into the CG feature genera; a condition further exemplified by the plot pacing, which though certainly passable, seems to harken back to an era before the Pixar gang turned the craft into a well-oiled machine.On the surface the Finding Nemo formula is pretty simplistic, almost too linear for my own tastes but a little deeper examination reveals a pretty solid grasp of the complex relationship between a father and son; one in which all that remains of a once-thriving family (with 399 siblings) is one another.I have actually followed along on studies that set out to prove that in each other's absence, each of the title clown fish discover the missing element of their relationship: Marlin finds himself befriending a creature (Dory) who proves that survival is possible in the rough and tumble ocean without short term memory or even much common sense while the captive Nemo finds himself under the tutelage of a father figure (Gill) who finds no fault in continually putting Nemo in harm's way.  Without revealing too much of the film's conclusion, the arc of the story is in fact a lesson in perfecting the relationship between parent & child.The lighting effects and underwater setting of the film are still quite spectacular even to this day.  Scripting is, as is expected of the Disney/ Pixar machine, quite polished.  The humor is actually a little weak, especially when compared to the more risqu&eacute; overtones made famous by prime competition DreamWorks.  The Thomas Newman composition/ scoring is subliminally brilliant throughout.It should also be noted that the influence Finding Nemo has had on the collective industry in general is undeniable.  DreamWorks answered with their own underwater adventure a couple years later in Shark Tale, Weinstein Company's The Reef would follow suit two years after that and even 20th Century Fox wanted in on the action with 2010's The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer.  Of course it could be argued that none were near as successful at delivering such a simple prose laced with such complex emotions.In all Finding Nemo has certainly earned its place in the hallowed halls of CG feature fame despite the fact that it's difficult for me to consider its delivery revolutionary.  It does nothing worthy of complaint, make no mistake, but in my opinion nor does it excel in the arena of humor, plotting or sheer Pixar-esque cleverness.By the way, the making-of featurette contains a segment that demonstrates Pixar's study of real aquatic environments as so thorough that early graphic tests were ""too realistic"". The appearance of the environments had to actually be cartooned for the actual production.  The comparison shots here are truly so amazing as to be worth the price of admission alone.  In all a very worthy addition to any collection."	4.0	A Solid Piece of CG Feature Film Even Today	2011-01-24	1	0	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ARMVAHWQQ9S8A	"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand"""	"Another Pixar film that all ages will enjoy, ""Finding Nemo"" delivers a simple story with some pretty heavy themes.  It's one of those rare gems that will entertain you when you're young, but get all the more relevant and meaningful when you see it again later down the road.  Contrary to some of the negative reviews, it is never too violent or too sad for the kids to see, giving only the fun scares that movies like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King had throughout.  It's about as universally enjoyable as a movie can get.Aside from WALL-E, it's the most visually stunning Pixar movie I've ever had the pleasure of feasting my eyes upon.  The world of the ocean opens up in a beautiful array of colors with scenery as complex and detailed as the real thing.  So much work was put into making it look real, and the producers knew when to make certain creatures look just like their real life counter part (the jellyfish) and they knew when to stylize others (the seagulls).  From the true to life things to the more cartoony things, everything here is so exceptionally done, from the overall story arc, to the themes of dealing with loss and learning to let your kids experience life, to the characters, to the voice acting, to the exceptionally crafted DVD itself.I wouldn't call ""Finding Nemo"" a masterpiece or a classic, but it aims high and comes very, very close.  What it is, though, is an astoundingly well done film that tells a story from the heart that will entertain, stun, and put smiles on the faces of the audience.9/10"	5.0	Another Pixar Film for All Ages	2009-01-04	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1W21SB4GOOOFW	Pedro Tejada	That's it,I have made up my mind.Pixar is undoubtedly the best production company these days.They've made such groundbreaking animated classics as Toy Story,Toy Story 2,Monsters,Inc.,and now,maybe the best 3-D movie they've ever made,Finding Nemo.I think most of you agree with me since it was the biggest movie of 2003,and quite certain deserved to be.Pros:1.The Animation Is Truly Breathtaking.Most of the films greatness comes from it's eye-popping animation.From the amazing backgrounds to the greatly-drawn chacracters,this film ahead of it's time,visually speaking.2.Hilarious For All Ages.This isn't just an ooh and aah experience for children;the movie itself is side-splitting and quick witted,a good example being the hilarious antics of the Tank Gang(i.e.,Deb and her &quot;twin who is really her reflection Flo).This film really deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar.3.Dory!Dory(voiced over by Ellen DeGeneres is pretty much the backbone of the film and is the best and funniest character in the whole film,in my opinion.She is a pro just for being that funny.4.It's Heartwarming,But Not Too Heartwarming.You just can't help but go &quot;aww&quot; at Marlin and his son,Nemo.Any dad who searches for his kid like that deserves a few &quot;awws&quot;.Anyway,the story is very cute,but not so cute that you're reaching for a barf bag,it is just the right level of heartwarming.Cons:ABSOLUTELY NONE!The Verdict:This is a captivating film that is really one of the greatest family films of all time,also.Recommended:Yes	5.0	One Of The Greatest Animated Films Of All Time.	2004-05-15	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A39L6FG6O2IZ75	person	"The movie was a little boring and looked really fake. You could tell it wasn't real and was just a bunch of silly puppets. I hope the kids that watch it don't really think fish can talk. Most of the movie is scientifically inaccurate. At one point there are a lot of ""baby"" fish. These fish appear, no, not as fry or something else that makes sense, but as slightly smaller versions of the adult. After this, these ""baby"" fish climb onto the back of a stingray (a predatory animal that should be eating them) who is their ""teacher"" he swims around and sings songs while the ""baby"" fish ride on his back. Other associations appear in this movie that I doubt have ever been observed in the wild. At one point, a clown fish is talking to a seahorse and an octopus, two of which only associate with their own kind, and one of which will kill anything to get within several feet of it! Does this happen in the movie? NO!However, what I find most disturbing is not the numerous scientific inaccuracies, but the fact that most people that view this movie regard it as a documentary on ocean life. I have seen kids at the aquarium pointing at fish and referring to them as a ""Nemo"" or a ""Dori"".Anyway, the stingray teacher manages to lose the baby clown fish (big surprise, what do you expect with a stingray for a teacher, you're lucky he didn't eat the kid!). And the clown fish gets captured and put into an aquarium in a dentists office with, yes more talking fish, but just wait! In this tank, there are also talking shrimp, and even a talking Starfish.OK, now talking fish is one thing. They may not have lungs or vocal chords to produce speech, and not even close to sufficient cognitive function, but at least they're vertebrates! But having an animal without even a brain talking!? That's just ridiculous! And speaking the same language as the fish!Now, yes, there have been strange things in Disney movies before. In Alice in wonderland there are talking flowers, and even a talking slug that smokes opium. However, Alice in Wonderland is the delusion of a madman, and does not take place in the natural world. Hence the name ""Wonderland"". However, does Finding Nemo take place in ""Wonderland""? NO! It takes place in the Great Barrier reed, just outside Australia! Did the maker think ""Well, nobody that watches this movie has been to Australia, so they won't know that the fish don't talk there""? I don't know what he was thinking, but I wasn't fooled! I personally have been to Australia, and the fish do NOT talk there! this movie makes no sense and is in no way entertaining.After that, the fish attempt to make their tank dirty by clogging the filter, in which they succeed. However, the maker of this film has obviously never kept saltwater fish before. If he had, he would realise that after living without a filter for more than an hour, every fish in the tank would be dead. Does this happen? NO! The tank just gets really dirty and the fish remain just as alive as ever! I couldn't take it any more. I walked out of the theater after that.Do not regard this movie as factual! Do not take your children to see this movie! This is one of the WORST places to get information about fish. Do not be fooled by this movie or the numerous other positive reviews!"	1.0	DO NOT BE CORRUPTED BY THIS MOVIE!!!	2007-06-04	90	18	72

She makes this picture even funnier than the computer graphics are good.  (and the graphics are VERY good)If possible see this movie at the drive-in as I did as the bigger screen really makes this picture rock.There was a great little pixar pre-feature concerning a snowman and a blonde. I don't know if it was only at the drive in or not but it was great.As always Pixar computer animators prove that the old Nerd chat ""That's alright that's ok you'll all work for us someday.""  is more than just words.  As their quality is so steady that it almost doesn't need comment it really becomes the job of the voice over actors to make the film.  They do."	4.0	Mine, Mine?	2003-06-02	2	1	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13UFZZWOMZA6B	Peter Swift	"It seems as though rated ""G"" movies are often under-advertised and never really make money or are even worth watching. Generally they're made specifically for children and any humor in the movie is lost on those over the age of seven. Pixar, in the past, has defied these common sentiments with movies like Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, and Monster's Inc. Pixar continues to defy standard Hollywood practices with the release of Finding Nemo.This movie is, by at least a little bit, the best rated G movie I've ever seen. Monster's Inc comes in a little behind in second place. The animation in this movie is incredible, the water, the fish, the particles of dirt floating in the water...there were many points when I would watch the movie and could definitely not be sure whether I was looking at a real or animated sea-scape.The story...the story wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking other than the setting...father loses his son, will do anything to find him. In this case, anything includes taking on sharks, jellyfish, pelicans and other random sea monsters. The father, Marlin, is a clownfish that defies his name by being particularly unfunny...luckily he picks up a sidekick early on with a short term memory problem - a little memento-esque.Nemo, the son, is captured by divers and put in an aquarium in Australia, where he meets several psychotic fish including ""Gills,"" another fish from the open sea - whose voice belongs to William Dafoe (in a non-bad guy role!).Of course, being a comedy, the movie does have a happy ending, but the ending isn't nearly as much fun as the trip taken to get there. The movie is great, I went along with indie rock dave and Mike, and they both laughed as much as I did. If a kid's movie can make three college students laugh as hard as we did...it is definitely worthwhile seeing. The movie is genuinely funny and worth watching with the entire family. The movie is safe for small children, though there are a couple of potentially scary scenes that might frighten *really* young children.I have very little to say against the movie, except that the first ten minutes or so drag on a little and the drama seemed a little out of place in the film.  Other than that, the plot, animation, characters, voices and jokes make this movie hilarious and fun to watch."	5.0	Was Nemo Worth the Hype?	2003-06-04	1	1	0

This movie, however, was surprising fresh. It had a lot of appropriate but timeless humor. The plot is watchable for adults who are forced to watch it over and over due to kids. This one never gets old.I am also a purist for animation. I usually do not care for Computer generated animation, but this one is well done.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	"""Finding Nemo"" is a reprieve from the rubbish that's thrown out to us from Hollywood lately.  This movie is not merely brilliant visually but it has an enduring storyline that would stand the test of time.  As I watched the movie, I was mesmerised by the ripples in the water, the cornucopia of sea reefs & corals, the movements of the fish, & many times I pinched myself to remind me that this is a computer graphics movie.  It was so lifelike & I never questioned about its authenticity.  What differentiates Pixar movies from other cartoon or even computer graphics movies would be its storyline, that is forever accessible to people of all ages.  To have me, a 31 years old sitting next to primary school children and old couples in the fifties is the greatest testimony of all.  Notably, Ellen de Generes was at her best being hillarious, hyperkinetic, over-the-top & having an excessively short memory at the same time.  Mel Brooks is also at his best being neurotic & yet, brave for his son's sake when it needs be.  Whichever you see it, this movie is a joyride or perhaps, a journey where the father finally learns to let go of his grown child.  A truly memorable movie & a movie that definitely sets a high pinnacle for the movies of this calibre. Highly recommended.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12GY3QS6F4RHQ	"""pngwnzrule"""	"I missed this movie in the theaters, and was very anxious to see it.  I LOVE IT!  Good story, diverse assortment of sea life, and very realistic scenery.I can't really see where there are any parts scary enough to induce nightmares!  A little scary, but nothing out of the ordinary. (Think Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King, etc) My 2 year old niece watches this movie at my house at least twice a week.  Totally captivates her, and it doesn't frighten her at all.I thought that writer/director Andrew Stanton was perfect as Crush!  The surfer dude turtles were great anyway, and it was neat to find out that he did the main turtle dude's voice.Who could blame poor Marlin for being so overprotective of Nemo?  It was his decision to move to the drop off, which led to the death of Coral and all of his future children, except Nemo.  And then, when Nemo was born with a ""lucky fin"", it probably gave him even more reason to be neurotic.  It shows a lot of love and devotion for Marlin to brave sharks, jellies, whales, etc, when he would much rather be safe and secure in his anemone.  And the look on Nemo's face when Nigel is explaining to Nemo that his dad is looking for him.  He only knows his dad as smothering, and taking some of the fun out of being a kid.  To know that his dad was confronting all of these creatures, and renews Nemo's spirit, and gives him the urge to keep fighting and to not give up!All children are shocked to learn exactly what their parents will do to keep them safe, and Nemo is no different.Dory is fabulous, and her whale talk is hysterical.  And one of my husband's life questions was answered... ""mine, mine, mine""Over all a great movie, and the DVD extras are great too."	5.0	Destined to be a classic!	2003-11-10	0	0	0

However, after a couple of months it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.I would recommend this for young children. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent but is violence in nature. very entertaining for the whole family.	5.0	GREAT MOVIE!!!	2007-03-12	2	2	0

Each time, I'm wrong.  Finding Nemo was incredibly fun, it was warm, and--amazingly--not patronizing.  Usually kids movies talk down to kids and adults alike, trying to hamhandedly teach a lesson.  Not so with Pixar movies.  You should get this DVD.  I know I will.	5.0	Fabulous!	2003-10-17	7	4	3
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A31ZO2G7KA11AR	Poppies_rule	First, this is one of my favorite movies, it is a 5/5 as far as entertainment value/story.  But, that said, I wanted to review strictly the 3D in this movie since it was obviously done retroactively.  It's ok.  Compared to say the Lion King were 3D really was not impressive at all (I would literally give the 3D of Lion King 1/5), Pixar did a much better job than probably could be done on Lion King since it wasn't CGI.  However, I watched Tangled in 3D immediately before Nemo and Tangled is a definite 5/5 in 3D, and Nemo really does not compare.  There just isn't the depth to literally everything on the screen like in Tangled.  Every blade of grass has a 3D effect in Tangled where in Nemo often just the characters are in 3D and the background is flat (you can tell because you can still see it clearly if you peek under your 3D glasses).  And scenes like the shark chase just don't explode with 3D effect.  It's there, don't get me wrong, but at no point in Nemo did I feel like I could almost reach out and grab something like I did with the Chinese Lanterns in Tangled.  Even the more impressive scenes like the beginning when Marlin and Nemo are headed to the first day of school, have a very layered effect rather than a continuous effect.  You see an item in the foreground the characters in the middle ground and more items in the background where in Tangled you could see the bridge into town stretching away like you were really standing on it.	3.0	Review of 3D only	2014-05-09	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1M6WS6IUHN12V	"powwowhappy ""powwowhappy"""	I would give this movie 5 stars because the animation was awesome, but I have learned to expect nothing but the best from Pixar.  Instead, I gave it 4 stars because the storyline, although interesting, was just missing something.  I didn't like this nearly as much as Monsters, Inc.  Ellen Degeneres as Dori the fish, was perfect.  There is also a jelly fish scene, where I learned something about them I never knew before.Admittedly, I probably would have liked this more too if it hadn't had the typical Disney opening trauma of having something/someone die, and then building a story/moral around that.	4.0	Fish With Feelings	2004-01-17	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1TUDEC66M9FO3	Preston C. Enright	Excellent film.  I appreciated how there were moments that illustrated the threats to sea life that industrial fishing poses.  Fishing giants like Tyson utilize massive nets that can hold 14 jumbo jets.  The trawlers also drag metal contraptions along the ocean floor, and destroy everything in its path, like coral.  Then there is the issue of the coral reefs dying due to slight increases in water temperature.  It's really a sin what's being done to the world's oceans.  Hopefully, Finding Nemo will spark some interest in youth to become ocean biologists or environmental activists like those with Greenpeace.	5.0	Great film with good enviro message	2006-06-26	8	4	4

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3BBZXUGB3W2U8	"P. Smith ""PedroMiguel"""	Finding Nemo was a very enjoyable animated film, but I just can't gush about it the way that most reviewers have.The visuals, naturally, are incredible.  The commentary and extra chapters included in the 'visual commentary' do an excellent job in showing how much work went into making believable computer generated water even if though it seems almost impossible to get an indepth look without a degree in computer animation.The character of Dory made the movie for me.  A couple of the side characters fell a little flat though.  The surfer schtick of the sea turtle is something that will amuse small children but not adults.As for people going on about how scary this movie is, don't underestimate your kids.  Nothing makes me want to vomit more than sugar-sweetened childrens entertainment.  Walt Disney removed quite a few dark elements from his fairy tale adaptations, but at least he left a few dark elements.  The bottom line is that I was scared by the Wicked Witch of the West, the Wicked Queen, etc etc but it didn't scar me for life.Speaking of which I love how the plot ties into current events.  Senseless acts of violence happen (columbine, 9/11) but you need to learn to not live dominated by your fear.  I think that this is the main reason why the movie has become such a success.  For the same reason that the Lord of the Rings movies present ordinary people in heroic situations.	4.0	Not quite overrated, but almost there	2003-11-14	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1CX86CO1MH5II	P. Solinger	Finding Nemo is another classic from the creaters of Toy Story and A Bug's Life.Albert Brooks voices Marlin, a clownfish who's entire family, except for one lone fish, are killed in an attack by a barricuda.  He is left as a single father raising his son, Nemo, voiced by Alexander Gould.  Naturally, Marlin is now afraid of the creatures in the water, and he tried to protect Nemo at all costs.  This includes keeping him out of school and away from his friends as long as possible.  When Nemo finally gets to go to school, Marlin still can't seem to let him go as he tracks him down on a field trip.  Fed up with his father's overprotectiveness, Nemo swims into open sea only to be captured by a diver's fishing net.  This leads Marlin on a race across the sea to find his son.  Along the way he meets Dora, a fish with a memory problem, voiced hilariously by Ellen DiGeneres, three sharks trying to get over their desire to eat fish, and a family of turtles who help show them the way.In typical Disney/Pixar fashion, the characters grow and mature in a realistic, natural way.  In the end we forget they are even fish, or cartoons.  They are incredibly real.  This is a funny, hearwarming tale that is available on an incredibly fully loaded DVD.  The extras are phenomonal.  It would take about six hours to watch them all.I highly recommend this film to everyone.  This is a family film that can be enjoyed by people without kids (like me), and to any fan of animation the extras are a must-see.	5.0	Another Pixar Classic	2003-12-20	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A319YRDK8Y39N	"""qmlhcb"""	"Pixar just doesn't seem to get tired of making good films. They are the most reliable makers of animated films today, and ""Finding Nemo"" is certainly no exception.My favorite Pixar film has been ""Toy Story 2"" ever since I first saw it. Somehow it improved on the wonderful original film,, adding additional layers to existing characters and pushing them into even greater events. I think I may have a new favorite now.I should say I'm a sucker for good ""road trip"" movies, stories in which the characters are on a quest and must get from point A to point B to do what needs to be done. The plot device allows us to meet many wonderful characters along the way, see many foreign places. It's a great way to constantly keep the viewer fully engaged with the film. As long as it's done right, that is. ""Finding Nemo"" does it right in spades.The story follows Marlin, (Albert Brooks) a single parent/clownfish raising his only son, Nemo. When Nemo, tired of his dad?s over-protective nature, disobeys his father, he lands himself in big trouble ? the fish tank of an Australian Dentist. So Marlin, and his newfound friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) go on the search for Nemo.Just like Pixar's other films, it seems the makers cram in every great idea, every funny event or joke, explore every angle in the movie they come up with. There are enough ideas and jokes here for this picture and a sequel. But they don't hold back, they use 'em all in just the one flick.Also, just as important, are the characters. Where as in most animated films, the characters are drawn a certain way, perhaps given a quirky voice, and that's it for characterization and development. Not so for Pixar and ""Finding Nemo."" Every character, no matter how minor, is given a motivation, given a living personality. Character's here aren't content to just exist. They want to live. This is what makes a great children's film simultaneously be a great adult film.And how could I leave out the breathtaking animation. Perhaps ""Finding Nemo"" is just on par with my former favorite ""Toy Story 2"" in every other category. But the animation here of the beautiful ocean and tropical landscape is such a joy to watch. Never have I been more smitten with the sheer look of an animated film. The Jellyfish look like they're right out of a National Geographic, the choral reefs so lifelike, everything is just beautiful. It?s the images that we imagine whenever we want to get away to paradise, and since it's all controlled in a computer, we get to see it all and then some.""Finding Nemo"" is certainly proving the good track record rule of Pixar. Can they make a bad film? Let's hope they never give us an answer."	5.0	One of Pixar's best	2003-06-13	5	5	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A6L1VS9ODEV30	Q the Immoral	This movie is typical Disney fare.  It's funny, heart-warming, thought-provoking and the ending (where Marlin finds Nemo) is pretty much guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye.It really is a *good* movie, and I'd recommend it if you just want to watch a funny movie and enjoy it.However, if you want an accurate movie, then this isn't the one for you.  Oh, it's accurate in the way the fish movie and such.  But this movie is set on the Great Barrier Reef off of the east coast of Australia.So, why are all the characters bar two voiced by Americans?And why are the ones who are voiced by Australians (Bill Hunter as the Dentist and Barry Humphries as Bruce the Great White Shark) the comic relief?To me, this stinks of the American policy of knocking my country and making us out to be nothing more than a lot of yahoos and idiots.  If I was going to write and film a movie about a Texas rancher, I certainly wouldn't have Australian actors playing the major parts.But, I suppose, Disney being the wealthy and powerful company it is, they have no need for accuracy of that kind in their movies.  After all, who cares as long as it makes money?	4.0	Finding Nemo - find the Australian!	2004-02-18	9	2	7

Doubtless I had to explain some points to her (why Nemo's mother is missing etc) but she was able to follow the story most the time. The silliness of Dory was lost on her, but then she may be a bit too young to understand fully the memory lost / forgetfulness of adults.She wasn't scared of the shark nor of the whale. The pictures were very clear (and seemed real to her), we could even see the fish scales.Other than that, all in all, the story has a happy ending (of course :-), and if she could give points, I think she'll give this 5 stars.

It's the whole 'I'm-growing-up-leave-me-alone' kind of relationship. But Nemo's father who can't help it because he's a little insecure, and because of a tragic event (it happens at the very beginning of the movie, but I still don't want to spoil it) in his life, he's afraid of Nemo's safety. When Nemo is caught by scuba divers and is stuck in an aquarium of a dentist's office in Australia, his father immediately tries to find him. He finds a new friend Dorry, a fish with a terrible memory, and also meets some other friends (and fiends) along the way.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2HVMOQEBTB53E	"Ray Chung ""darth_corleone"""	This is solely in reference to the actual DVD release, and more specifically, to a certain technical issue.  I won't go into the actual movie, as I generally agree with all the great things said about this wonderful piece of entertainment.  My bone to pick is with something that has come up on numerous DVD's...On some DVD players, you may notice some instances when particular parts of the image, mainly the bright red Marlin character, looks a bit jagged or 'blippy'.  We're talking about a blink of an eye here or there (one frame - 1/30th of a second, actually, but in several places in the film).  Most noticeably, the scene with the sea turtles when the young turtles pile up on Marlin.  If you go frame-by-frame, you'll notice some pixelization here and there.  I tried three different Nemo DVD's on my new Pioneer DV-563AS player, in both progressive-scan and standard, through both component and s-video output, and the anomalies were still there.  Strangely, I did not see this on an older Sony unit that I have.  Additionally, there seems to be a surprising amount of grain in the picture for a digital-to-digital transfer.  I can only determine this to be less than optimal DVD encoding as performed by the factory.I think a good benchmark for DVD picture quality (especially with a progressive-scan to HDTV set-up like mine) is Pixar's Toy Story 2, especially the opening sequence.  This is an overall pristine DVD with the utmost clarity and picture integrity.  I've also heard of some problems with Monsters Inc., but watched that DVD again very closely and noticed no such issues as with Nemo.So.... there's a good chance that many viewers (especially those with standard TV set-ups) will not notice this.  And perhaps the Pioneer player is the only one that will show this (as the Sony did not, although my Sony player is 5 years old).  But since the other DVD's mentioned play cleanly, and since I haven't noticed any such thing's with any other of my many DVD's, I'm behooved to lay blame on the DVD encoding.  I kinda' hope it's just my player, as I'd like to believe that DVD encoding quality is on the way up.  But in reading through many DVD-rating sites, this kind of DVD encoding problem is more common than it should be.....especially on such a movie that should take advantage of newer home entertainment technology.	3.0	Great movie, but beware (DVD technical issues).....	2003-11-10	8	4	4

It's an incredibly amusing film. Some critics say that it is not as witty and enjoyable for adults as toy story since it contains no adult humor. This film has humor for anyone at any age. The whole audience enjoyed the film with adults and children alike laughing at the same thing. What I'm trying to say is: GO AND SEE THIS FILM!

Sure, the animation is breathtaking, the voice talent is unsurpassed, the characters are quite engaging, and the movie's length is &quot;family friendly&quot;.However, as appealing as it is, it lacks the witty humor that one has come to expect from Disney/Pixar collaborations.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3W13VVBRY5GL7	"Review Lover ""ReviewLover"""	Why 'Finding Nemo' got some bad press at the time of its cinematic release will forever more puzzle me. It's a wonderful, glorious romp through the Garden of Disney, and has more going for it than most of Disney's recent releases.Nemo is a young clown fish, who, after his mother and siblings were killed by a predatory fish, is left to the care of his overprotective father Marlin. When Nemo is captured by human divers, Marlin must brave the entire ocean and his own boundaries to rescue his only son, helped along the way by the forgetful Dory and a whole host of memorable characters.Disney's computer animation just keeps on getting better and better; parts of this movie look so real that it's impossible not to sit up and take notice. I will always be a bigger fan of hand-drawn cartoons, but kudos to the designers and animators, they have given us a world of believable depth and mind-blowing detail.The voiceovers are of the ususal excellent standard, with Ellen DeGeneres (Dory) and John Ratzenberger in a cameo (Fish School) being among some of the best, most endearing voiceover parts I have ever heard. Albert Brooks does a decent job with the character of Marlin, ditto Alexander Gould as Nemo, and the impression left on the viewer by their talent is one of character depth and attachment.The storyline may be standard Disney fare, but it's excellent, intelligent little touches like the Seagulls in Sydney (Mate! Mate! Mate!) and the Fish-Not-Food Sharks that make 'Finding Nemo' stand head and shoulders above such other standard Disney fare as 'Brother Bear' and 'Mulan'. Coupled with such magnificent visuals and excellent, credible voice acting, 'Nemo' is a highly polished package both for adults and kids alike.'Finding Nemo', really, is something you shouldn't be without.

The storyline is one which will hold a child's attention. It has a little bit of everything... humor (the sharks), adventure (the journey), excitment (Nemo's escape) and friendly encounters (the turtles).

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1F1FOR46702YF	R. J Rey	"Pixar continues to dominate computer animation with the crowd-pleasing family blockbuster ""Finding Nemo"". An overprotective clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) must face the many perils of the open ocean to rescue his ""fish-napped"" son Nemo.  His only ally in this amazing adventure is a forgetful blue tang named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres). ""Finding Nemo"" is an astounding and funny animated experience that sets new standards for computer animation. The fifth animated feature from Pixar Animation Studios was a runaway hit with critics and American audiences and became the top-grossing animated film of all time. ""Finding Nemo"" features a funny and enchanting storyline and memorable characters. Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are an amusing pair with superb comic energy. The top-notch voice cast also includes Geoffrey Rush, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, Vicki Lewis and Willem Dafoe. The computer animation is definitely groundbreaking with great detail on the underwater scenes and colorful characters.If you're only going to purchase five DVDs this year, then ""Finding Nemo"" 2-Disc Collector's Edition should be included. The film is presented in both 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (Disc 1) and full screen (Disc 2) formats. The picture quality is flawless with amazing clarity and rich use of colors. The Dolby Digital 5.1-EX sound is impressive and quite dynamic. This 2-Disc edition contains great supplemental extras including a filmmakers' visual commentary, an enjoyable virtual aquarium option, ""Making Nemo"" documentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes and some clever animated menus.

Nemo is the only surviving hatchling of one Clownfish couple's clutch of eggs. With the unsuccessful heroism of his mother, he and his father are all that's left of their little family. But Nemo is taken captive by a diver, and his father Marlin is forced to embark on a perilous ocean adventure, in search of him. There is so much rich and colorful detail in the surrounding ocean scenes, you'd swear it was the real thing. And I'm still not convinced that it isn't! Marlin soon encounters the extremely daffy Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), at her funniest. And I've never really considered her all that humorous.From migrating sea turtles, to wacky aquarium inhabitants, nothing goes wrong here for laughs. And those crazy seagulls nearly steal the entire show. Mine!...Mine!...Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!Oh, and Nemo? Of course the ending is all good.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	"Thoroughly enjoyable in almost every possible way!  A delightful (if mildly predictable) story told with great verve and BEAUTIFUL graphics.  Pixar's movies are all gorgeous to look at and all get 5 stars in my book.  However, I give TOY STORY 1 & 2 A++, MONSTER'S INC an A+, NEMO an A and A BUG'S LIFE an A- / B+.There's nothing really WRONG with NEMO in comparison to the TOY STORY movies, for example, but on an emotional level, it didn't quite deliver the same whammy.  No true ""tears in your eye"" moment for me. (Unlike the transporting moment at the very end of MONSTER'S INC when Sully goes back to see the little girl and is greeted by ""Kitty.""  The look of joy on his face has never been matched by a real-life actor.)I will say the opening scene was wrenching.  We see Marlin (the male clown fish, voiced so well by Albert Brooks) and his spouse Coral, frolicking in their new home, a lovely anemone with a view.  Their hundreds of eggs lay just below, waiting to hatch.  In the middle of their carrying-on, a fearsome looking barracuda appears.  The eggs are clearly threatened and Coral naturally runs to save them.  Marlin knows this could be  mistake, tries to intervene and is knocked unconscious.  When he awakens, he's ALONE. Man, it's a chilling moment...I imagine it could be upsetting for some kids.  Naturally, he discovers one surviving egg, which turns out to be Nemo.  We skip ahead a few years and Nemo is ready for school, but his father is unbearably overprotective of the little tyke with the one short fin.  And Nemo gets into trouble and is captured by fishermen.The movie goes back and forth from Marlin's journey to find Nemo and Nemo's life in the fish tank in a Dentist's office, where he makes some new friends.Marlin is befriended by a blue fish with short-term memory loss (Ellen DeGeneres) and their interactions are hilarious.  The memory device is a real treat...congrats to the person who thought that one up!!!!  The run into some amusing sharks, some terrible jellyfish and some really cool sea turtles, among others.  Their adventures are great to look at, but feel just a tiny bit predictable.  But still very enjoyable, don't get me wrong.Nemo's new world, on the other hand, is one delight after another.  His tank-mates are all wonderfully realised characters, and they ways in which they interact with the dentist's office are quite ingenious.  They hatch a risky escape plan that adds lots of edge of your seat drama.Another great touch:  seagulls are depicted as the ""rats"" of the sky, and they are dangerous yet absolutely hysterical.  One of the movie's other really successful imaginative leaps.I HIGHLY recommend the movie for all ages.And there is also a brief, early Pixar short film before hand that is a hoot as well...a wordless wonder..."	5.0	The folks at Pixar do it again!!!	2003-06-08	5	5	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Finding Nemo (Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, 2003)You're a studio who just had two megahits come down the pike. You want another megahit. So what do you do? If you're Pixar, you take half the directing team from each, put them together, and presto! you have Finding Nemo. Stanton (A Bug's Life) and Unkrich (Monsters, Inc.) team up for the latest Pixar release, hopefully the last under the Disney banner. (That Pixar has gone so long under Disney's control without being tainted by the idiotic revisionism that mars most Disney films is remarkable in itself.)The odd thing about Nemo is that while it bears the same marks as Pixar's other releases to date (excellent script, engaging characters, tremendous animation, etc.), and while it had almost as much emotional impact as did Monsters, Inc., it didn't have the same lasting effect as that one did. I'm not sure why. Maybe we're so used to incredible movies from Pixar that Nemo suffers embarrassment-of-riches syndrome. Or maybe it's just not on the same level as Monsters, Inc. in come ineffable way. It's still a very, very good movie, it's just not as high on the ladder as was Monsters, Inc.The story is pretty simple (think of it as a more lighthearted The Searchers): Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish, and his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) have just moved into a new anemone when it gets attacked by predators. Coral is killed, and the only surviving egg from their litter ends up being Nemo. Marlin becomes a neurotic shut-in, and Nemo, outgoing and expressive, feels stifled by his father's fear. As soon as Nemo ventures out, though, he is caught by humans, and Marlin must overcome his fear and go looking for his son, having numerous adventures along the way.And I just realized what that erstwhile ineffable quality is: the film suffers from the Curse of Albert Brooks, a man who can take any script and lower its quality by his very presence. Why that is, I have no idea. but there you go. Also, it's probably to be expected that a kid's movie is going to have such a strong undertone of ""if you disobey your parents bad things will happen to you,"" but it still grates.Enough of the bad. This does end up, after all the moralizing, being a fun movie. The other fish in the tank where Nemo is kept are a very fun bunch (including Willem Dafoe and Allison Janney), and Marlin hooks up with some great characters while on his rescue mission, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who's basically Guy Pearce's character in Memento in female form. And the usual attention to humorous detail abounds (no one who sees the movie will forget the seagulls for a very long time).All in all, good, but could have been somewhat better. *** "	4.0	Not their best, but can't quite say why.	2003-06-20	3	2	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1YSI93GVIVPPT	Robert Fernandez	I enjoyed all of the previous PIXAR movies, and when I heard they were making another film soonafter Monsters Inc., I was pretty excited; that is, 'till I started to see the first previews for it. I know that its not right to judge a movie by it's trailer, but for some reason I felt uninterested in this one, even if it was being made by PIXAR(which is one of my favorite animation studios, next to Studio Ghibli, Aardman Animation, and Gainax). I kept thinking to myself that no matter how beautiful Finding Nemo's computer-generated imagery was, beneath all of the 3-D FX the story probably would sink. I mean, the movie's about FISH. Now PIXAR's other movies dealt with toys, monsters, and even bugs, and yet still those ideas seemed pretty neat even before those movies came out. Now FISH don't have hands or anything like that; they just have fins. The most I thought they'd be able to do in the movie was swim.But even with my expectations that low, I didn't think the movie could get past 'em. Boy was I wrong.The movie wasn't at all; sure, I didn't think it was as good as the other PIXAR movies, but it still was WAY better than most of the animated tripe that came out last year and this year. One thing about Finding Nemo was that it felt different from the other PIXAR films; for once, one of the characters DIES. Plus, there's a scene where a forgetful blue fish named Dorrie(voiced by the hillarious Ellen DeGenerous(sp?)) gets hit hard by an object, causing a substantial amount of blood to seep out of her mouth. Nothing major, but it could creep out those who hate the sight of blood.The thing I didn't like about Finding Nemo was that the plot was predictable; The movie's title says it all. There should've been some sort of twist like in Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc.But either way, the film's humor is something that saves it from drowning; that is, if you're not a very cynical person, you'll get at least a good laugh or two. The kids in the audience were in a riot when Dorrie began to speak to a whale in it's specific language. Something else was kinda funny, the mindless seagulls reminded me of that penguin from Wallace and Gromit. Anyway, another thing I didn't enjoy about the movie was Nemo's father, Marlin, who's VERY overprotective of his son. Supposedly its because of his overprotective-ness that causes Nemo to get taken away. Finding Nemo had another un-PIXAR-like quality; most of the film's music consisted of piano solos(which I liked), and there's no Randy Newman songs(like in PIXAR's last two movies). Anyway, the main draw of the movie is it's computer animation, which is astounding. This must be PIXAR's most detailed film to date. For instance, in one little 5 second scene when Nemo goes to 'school', you get to see a whole swarm of different kinds of fish doing many different things and swimming everywhere. And the level of detail they put on creatures such as the shark, Bruce, and the whale, was amazing. Some scenes actually looked life-like, especially when you get to see Australia. Props to the animators at PIXAR, they must've had alot of work to do to complete this film. Finding Nemo was a pretty great movie, compared to most of the other animated stuff america has produced. I'd just wished Bruce the shark had a bigger part; that guy's cool and kinda scary-looking. He's got 3-rows of teeth! :)	4.0	Better than I expected...	2003-06-14	2	2	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A26JGAM6GZMM4V	Robert Morris	"As grandparents, my wife and I appreciate films such as this which really do offer ""something for everyone,"" especially when our grandchildren urge us to see it with them again and again and again and again....The same is true of Antz, A Bug's Life, Shrek, Toy Story and Toy Story 2, and Monsters. All of these animated films offer an interesting story line and memorable characters, to be sure, but they also offer wholesome humor on several different levels of sophistication, humor which thus delights viewers of all ages.Featuring the voices of Albert Brooks (Marlin), Ellen DeGeneres (Dory), and Alexander Gould (Nemo), it focuses on a father and son who are separated by circumstances best revealed in the film. Marlin (the father) sets out to find his son and is joined by Dory. Along the way, Marlin and Dory share life-threatening experiences in the vast ocean. Meanwhile, Nemo finds himself in a dentist's fish tank. Eventually -- after numerous adventures --  father and son are finally reunited.This theme of separation also invests earlier animated classics with authentic tension, as in Dumbo and Pinocchio, to name but two. For me, Finding Nemo dramatizes a number of important lessons which even younger children seem to recognize. For example, be alert to the possible dangers around you. Respect your parents' concerns about protecting you from such dangers. Be a loyal friend. Help others in need. Keep the faith. Be persistent when you encounter difficulties. By no means is this a ""preachy"" film, however, even as it skillfully affirms certain values such as these.Indeed, although appropriately serious at times, Finding Nemo is mostly a humorous film, in large measure because of the verbal skills of Brooks and DeGeneres. Other easily recognizable voices include those of Willem Dafoe (Gill), Allison Janney (Peach), John Ratzenberger (Fish School), and Geoffrey Rusch (Nigel). Andrew Stanton co-directed this film with Lee Unkich and co-authored the screenplay. He deserves special credit for matching a proper human voice with each fish character. In my opinion, also, the quality of animation is unsurpassed. For these and other reasons, Finding Nemo is among our family's favorites.Although many of the DVD's special features will probably not be of much interest to younger children, older viewers will enjoy &quot;Making Nemo&quot; (a documentary), &quot;The Art of Nemo&quot; (narrated by the artists), &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot; (a new short with Jean-Michel Cousteau), Knick Knack (a Pixar short with commentary), a brief preview of the next Pixar film, The Incredibles, followed by a tour of the Pixar Studios."	5.0	An Animation Classic	2004-01-31	0	0	0

"Ironically, I saw this movie with my 9 year old son, and I must have to say that despite the maker's comedic intent, I was moved to tears a number of times during the movie.Finding Nemo is a wonderfully funny and emotional tale of one father's quest to find his lost son. In the process, the father learns a few things about being overprotective, being more of a father than a ""nervous-nellie"" to his son, and he comes to appreciate the special togetherness that only a son can bring.A wonderful story for the entire family."	5.0	A touching tale of father and son love.	2003-11-29	3	2	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than ""Finding Nemo""?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, ""Aladdin,"" ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story 2,"" it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged ""kiddie"" fare in recent years.  This is a film one can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).Like many tales designed for the junior set (""Dumbo,"" ""Bambi"" etc.), ""Finding Nemo"" taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, ""Finding Nemo"" takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is."	4.0	amazing visuals	2003-11-28	6	4	2

The undersea world is beyond imaginative; it has a character all its own.  Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres deserve Oscars for their character work; their evolving friendship is one of the most memorable relationships in a movie filled with them.  Each new vista, new character and new situation provides new thrills, new adventure and new suspense.

My favourite character is the blue tang fish called Dory because she can be narrow minded like me because I sometimes lose my mind too.My other favourite characters are Nemo because he is funny and so sweet and he makes me laugh.I also like one of the pelicans and I can't remember the name.All the animals are so wonderful and Albert Brooks puts in the must funny words in their mouths. Albert has a way of expressing how the characters are feeling and emotions are going through their minds. The funny part is where Dory apparantly loses her mind and can never remember what they are doing in the ocean and why they are there. It's a beguiling film and it takes you somewhere exotic and you feel like you're in the film yourself .	5.0	Finding Nemo	2004-03-02	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RHBT46LS6DA3	"Ryk E. Spoor ""Author, Gamer, Geek God"""	"... making me wonder just how horrid they'll have to get when they finally crash. I mean, no one can keep making quality products forever, can they?Monsters, Inc., wasn't quite as good (to me) as some of the prior offerings, but with Finding Nemo Pixar jumps right back into its top form. One of the things that Pixar seems to understand far better than their patron Disney is how to strike a balance between ""kid friendly"" and ""stupidly pandering"". In Finding Nemo, we once more have a twin-plotline movie (just as we did in Toy Story 2), following the adventures both of little Nemo and of his terribly worried father. The characters are nice people without being insipid, and the opposition is mostly the world rather than other people.One of the nicer things about the Pixar movies is that in general they don't always make adults out to be either totally stupid or totally the enemy. Nemo's father is overprotective, but dedicated, courageous, and capable of learning. Nemo, at the same time, is given a chance to grow out of what his overprotective father taught him, and the two are both better for the experience. Much of the current crop of movies and TV shows tend to be exceedingly divisive -- in kid's shows adults are either absent, idiots, or impediments, in adult's shows kids are either absent, plot tokens, or annoyances, and in shows targeted for the ""young adult/teen"" bracket, both younger kids and adults are impediments/ The Enemy (to the eternal refrain of ""they just don't UNDERSTAND!"").Pixar avoids playing that particular game; characters get to be who they are without assigned roles. You can have good and wise adults as well as stupid and hostile ones. Both sides can, and do, make mistakes. And by doing so, Pixar makes shows that are much more fun AND capable of much longer endurance. I wish other filmmakers would take a look and see what Pixar does right here. We could use more Pixars."	5.0	Pixar's Winning Streak Continues...	2003-10-24	4	2	2
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3L9FTW01LMYSE	Ryne	Expecting your average Pixar film, I walked into the theater without knowing how wonderful this film really is.  Even with the technological backgrounds and modern storytelling, this film reminded of older Disney classics.  It will never be forgotten.  The highlight is the absent minded fish, Dorie who could've ONLY been brought to life by the brilliant Ellen Degeneres.  Even if you feel you are too old to see this movie see it anyway because I think that it will appeal to adults even more than the kiddie crowd.  The DVD is wonderful, especially the transfer.

The coral reef scenes are spectacualr to view, especially on HD televisions, and the sound is great too.  The cast headed by Albert Brooks, and the scene stealing Ellen Degeneres, was awesome (Ellen being the best)  The film is probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and the film doesn't just target children.

It represents a refreshing and much-needed return to form (read: Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y) for Disney Pictures.  Chances are you've already heard about this film or know someone who has seen it.  Now that I've seen the DVD, it's easy to see what all the buzz was about.  The plot provides the film title:  Marlin, a father clown fish on the Australian Great Barrier Reef, has been separated from his son Nemo, who has been netted and suddenly transplanted to a Sydney dentist's aquarium.  Thus follows Marlin's epic journey to find and reunite with the youngster.  Along the way we are treated to a virtual feast of visual sensory overload of colorful scenes, exciting adventures and a host of hilariously unique sea creatures that permanently endear themselves to you whether you like it or not.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3CH1KT8XQE8SA	"S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange"""	FINDING NEMO was a big hit with myself and my young niece and nephew. Diving beneath the deep sea of the Great Barrier Reef near the coast of Australia, Disney portrays the delightful world of the lives of fish and other creatures that inhabit this often-unknown region of Earth's geography. In addition this film is a wonderful way to teach youngsters about these amazing animals. Nemo is a young clown fish who becomes separated from his father after he is captured by a diver and taken back to Sydney to accompany other fish in his aquarium. What follows is a cute and creative tale of Nemo and his father attempting to find each other while they face numerous obstacles. Under normal circumstances I tend not to watch animated movies but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that both adults and children can enjoy FINDING NEMO.	4.0	CUTE AND CREATIVE	2003-06-03	3	2	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	APMJ4GIPWUR3O	"Scarlett O'Hara ""Vivian"""	"Finding Nemo quickly engrosses audiences with its impending adventure filled with seemingly impossible tasks. Nemo recruits a few friends to help him along the quest to return home to his father.Finding Nemo presents a perfect opportunity to begin a serious discussion with children regarding safety, talking to strangers, and carrying contact information with them in case of an emergency. Parents may be able to develop safety and emergency plans along with their children.On another note, Finding Nemo revolves around having an unorthodox family structure (which is increasingly common nowadays)and being anatomically different than others. Often rephrasing a ""shortcoming"" and describing it as a ""challenge that can be overcome"" may improve how the child perceives an event or physical difference. Using positive language can be a valuable resource for parents and caretakers.Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)"	5.0	Great Parenting Resource	2011-04-11	1	1	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2221QUVAM43QX	SC Lady	This is an adorable movie.  It is also unnescessarily scary.  I don't understand why they didn't just start the movie with just Nemo and his dad, instead of having that beginning scene.  It was too scary and intense for my 4 year old, and in my opinion, added nothing to the story to know that part of their background.  Especially for younger kids, who would have just accepted that he and his dad were on their own.That same scary sequence of various characters being chased by something growling and horrid looking, with sharp teeth, is repeated more than once.  In fact it seemed as if a good chunk of the movie was a character trying to outrun something scary trying to eat them.  I guess I am at a loss as to why we need all of these scenes that have the potential to be horrifying for some kids.  If you crank up the age range to account for the scary parts, you have kids who might be too old to be all that interested in this type of character's story.I probably won't let my daughter see it again until she is older.  I thought some of the characters were pretty adorable, but then again, I'm a heck of a lot older than my daughter.	3.0	Not sure what age this is for	2013-02-04	2	0	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIBRTGBN07D6A	Scott	"Since there are countless reviews about this film, I won't say how great it is, but provide my review solely for the DVD.The DVD is loaded with special features, including the wide screen and full screen versions, so you don't have to worry about which disc to buy.  It also includes an ""Aquarium Vision"" feature that is just a virtual aquarium for those lacking a real one.  I found it really relaxing to sleep to.  The making of featurette and commentary is one of the best I have seen for any movie. You don't realize how difficult it is to do something seemingly simple, like animate water or create shadows underwater until you listen to the director.  The DVD also includes a look at the culture of Pixar Studios and the hundreds of people that worked on the film, which I found pretty interesting. Disc one is really more geared to adults than children.The sound quality and picture is amazing.  Whenever a film is transferred from widescreen to full screen format, it is accomplished by cutting off the sides of the picture so that it fills up the entire screen.  Pixar actually added new animation to the film for the full screen format, so not only do you not have to worry about the picture being cut, but you are actually getting new footage.if you purchase the DVD, not only are you getting a great movie, but the bonus features will keep you entertained for hours after Nemo and Marlin have swum away."	5.0	Disney's Best Yet	2004-01-21	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	Disney's PIXAR studios have re-defined the world of animation time and again with their many film efforts.  Such movies as &quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;Toy Story 2,&quot; &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; and &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; have introduced audiences around the world to the potential of computer animations as a medium for creating the &quot;next generation&quot; cartoon.But nothing yet compares to the unparalleled quality of animation, storytelling and pure magic that was produced in their most recent effort &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.The story centers around a clown fish whose son is taken by divers somewhere off the coast of Sydney, Australia.  Marlin, father to Nemo, is an overly protective dad who will do anything to keep his son from danger.  You see, his mate and all their other offspring were lost when they were attacked by another fish.  So in a desperate act to save his one remaining child, Marlin sets out across the ocean to rescue his son.The movie brings the ocean to life with rich, vibrant colors that are serene and immensely beautiful.  The close attention to detail in this film gives the settings, characters, indeed the entire film, a level of depth and quality not commonly seen in a &quot;cartoon&quot;.  The animation is so completely convincing that viewers often lose sight of the fact that they are watching a cartoon and instead they become immersed in the beautifully detailed world created by this team of animators from Pixar.The movie has many wonderful characters created by a cast of all star talent.  Marlin is played by Albert Brooks, whose voice has so much inflection in it that he gives a vitality to the character that equals or surpasses the animation of his character.  Ellen Degeneres plays &quot;Dory&quot;, an absent-minded lady fish who serves as Marlin's companion on his adventure and serves much of the comic relief of the film.  Other celebrites making an appearance in this film include: William Defoe as Gill,  and Geoffery Rush as Nigel, an empathetic pelican who helps save the day.The movie mixes humor with human emotion, giving &quot;Nemo&quot; a vitality most animated films lack in this current medium.  The film is at once touching and compassionate, clever, witty and funy, combining tongue-in-cheek humor with a tender honesty that will make all audiences young and old a fan of this film.The DVD set contains enough extras to keep families entertained for hours, even after the film itself has ended.  Provided in this collection are both wide screen and full screen editions of the film, along with several shorts from Pixar studios, and a particularly memorable and entertaining short documentary &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot;, which stars Jean-Michael Costeau (son of famed undersater explorer Jacque Costeau), as well as some of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; favorites.So, for those of you who have reservations about watching a &quot;kids&quot; movie, set them aside and give this one a chance.  It is really a film for all ages, with enough humor, action, adventure and entertainment to provide entire families with an experience not soon to be forgotten.Scott Kolecki	5.0	I Found A GREAT Film in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;!	2003-11-18	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A12WTXKP9IPL2M	Scott Lefaive	"pixar's latest, finding nemo, begins by meeting disney's quota for the death or absence of at least one parent with the seemingly kid-unfriendly scene of marlin losing his wife and all but one of his children to an eel. due to the circumstances surrounding the birth of his only son (nemo), marlin attempts to protect him, sometimes suffocatingly, from everything outside the four tentacular walls of their anemone home. further complicating the matter is nemo's small (""lucky"" if you ask his dad) fin, which makes it difficult for him to swim long distances. despite, or because of, those hurdles, nemo longs to venture outside his father's grasp and is unwavering in his desire to begin school with its concomitant autonomy.of course, as soon as nemo breaks free into the open ocean, he is scooped up by a diver and placed in a dentist's office aquarium, where he is to be presented to an unruly girl who resembles sid from toy story. in the tank, he joins a bevy of luckless sea creatures, including a pink starfish suctioned to the glass, a scarred angel fish who desperately wants to escape, and a french shrimp who meticulously cleans the artificial habitat. marlin begins the journey through the great barrier reef accompanied by dory, a blue tang fish voiced by ellen degeneres. along the way they are helped and hindered by sharks who have (mostly) sworn off eating fish, pothead sea turtles, the bright bait of an angler fish, self-serving gulls, a forest of jellyfish, the belly of a whale, and dory's own short-term memory deficits.the movie has many opportunities to address bigger issues, but it's satisfied with patrolling the shallows. nemo's disability isn't treated as a detriment, necessarily, but it's exoticized somewhat. the travails of captivity are mentioned, but only in a superficial manner. after the credits rolled, children, rather than organizing boycotts against pet stores, were heard screaming, ""mommy, i want a clown fish. can we take one from the great barrier reef?"" the replies: ""well, it is a protected area, but anything for you, my dear."" three sharks bring their terrified fish buddies to a meeting where they announce that fish are friends, not food, before being tempted toward a more carnivorous diet when they sense blood in the water. it's a way of decreasing the impact of their ecological footprint, perhaps, and it works as a joke, but the filmmakers are reluctant to either focus on the details implicit in such a decision or expand their sights to encompass other areas worthy of criticism. i did, however, like the references to marlin's perceived comic ability solely based on his reputation as a clown fish. the idea that others would assume he was funny was understated and portrayed deftly enough that it made a statement about the problems of stereotyping.i realize i shouldn't be harping on the lack of social imperative in a (children's) movie, so i will concentrate on the humor. many of the jokes were repeated throughout. dory's forgetfulness was made evident at every turn, making me wish that i had received some sort of blunt trauma to the head so that i wouldn't be burdened by memory, or at least that she could have been relegated to the role of an ancillary character. the sea turtles' speech, which relied upon a surfer's lexicon, grated from the beginning and steadily got worse. sure, i've been known to occasionally pepper conversations with ""dude"" or ""man,"" but this was ridiculous. it should be said, the majority of the audience didn't seem to be as negatively affected by the repetition as i was: the man across the aisle from me joyfully said, ""wow, it's still funny,"" when a frightened young octopus inked itself for the nth time.the film does succeed sometimes, mostly when it concentrates on nuance. the scene involving the sharks and the one involving the angler fish are imaginative, but they continue past their expiration date, as does almost every scene. the best sequence occurs when the fish escape from the tank, only to bob on the surface of the water inside their plastic bags, unable to achieve true freedom from their confines. the monosyllabic sea gulls are consistently funny, especially in the scene where a crab is offered to them until he divulges the secret he is concealing. interestingly, these gulls appear to be a homage to aardman entertainment (and wallaby way is the street on which wallace and gromit live), and there are a few other visual references to pixar films, past and future. in my opinion, the viewer would be better served renting chicken run and actually paying attention to it this time."	2.0	catch and release	2003-06-10	106	16	90

For whatever reason, I grew up with an...uneasiness...around people with handicaps. By the end of the film I was completely oblivious to the fact two of the main characters were physically or mentally challenged. Dora, in fact, was one of the most charming characters I've seen in film recently - animated or not.I also (as a divorced father) greatly appreciated a single FATHER being portrayed as loving and capable. Too much of media shows men, if not actually villains, as bumbling or careless - if they're present at all.BRAVO!

Foster	I normally don't purchase Region 1 DVDs, however I couldn't wait for FN to come out on DVD in Britain so I snapped it up immediately.  This Pixar animation comes closest I've ever seen to turning cartoon vision into 3 dimensional reality with characters and visuals which are simply stunning.  This tale of unfunny clown-fish Marlin, (Brooks) and the irrepressibly charming and cute but forgetful blue tang Dory, (Degeneres) is a heart-warming tale of paternal love, self-discovery and friendship underlying a dialogue which is nothing short of hilarious.The underwater visualisation is enchanting, and characterisation of sea-creatures and their prey nothing short of original and side-splittingly funny  - vegetarian sharks following a 12-step ''fish are friends'' program, Surfer-dude Turtles, flatulant seagulls and shape-throwing Tuna-  you get the impression that Pixar have not only been cognisant of their duty to stun visually but have spent an incredible amount of time in investing in enchanting and 3-D characters which you just walk away from loving.Degeneres steals the show with her natural comedic intonations and side-splitting interpretation of whale-talk, I was in raptures throughout.  A definite contender for Disney's greatest classic (along with Lion King and Beauty and the Beast)&lt; this is one movie I'll cherish.  I haven't met one person disappointed in this movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1L8HRCM60W0W7	Shashank Tripathi	As with other Pixar releases, very wholesomely enjoyable experience. Lots of layers for all ages, visually wicked and enticingly real.  Pixar has made many breakthroughs with each movie, with each having a quantum leap in something. The realistic water in Nemo is almost as noticable as the jaw-dropping realism of fur wisps in Monsters Inc.You'll enjoy some wry wit in the inside jokes and homages. I kept expecting a &quot;Great Escape&quot; homage with Gill, perhaps having his gimpy fin look like a ball glove or such, but I suppose some would have pointed out that Chicken Run already did it. I did think that Gill's scar looked a lot like the facial scar in Platoon (problem being it was Tom Berenger's character that had the scar not Defoe's), but then again I might have been looking for way too inside jokes (how about a West Wing hint with the Star fish). I just about wet myself when she started trying to speak Whaaaallllle. I would have killed to have seen Ellen's face for real as she recorded those bits.Not the least of reasons to watch this excellent family flick is the almost palpable emotion -- as a not so funny clownfish goes on an impossible trek through the ocean depths to rescue his only son.An engaging, heartfelt animation.	5.0	CHARMING MOVIE THAT'LL TAKE YOU FOR A SWIM	2003-12-14	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ALMNEDSLJ0L2S	Shawn Skvarna	When I first saw Finding Nemo in the theaters I thought of it as good but not as engrossing as other Pixar movies before it. Since then, I met my fiance who loves the movie and wanted a copy of it, which I bought for her in the week leading up to the birth of our daughter in 2012. Now our daughter is 19 months old and points at the TV, looking to us says &#34;Fishies?!&#34; She absolutely loves this movie and after seeing it many, many times over the year it's definitely grown on me as much, much better than I first thought of it. In the last few months we upgraded Nemo to Blu-ray and couldn't be happier for making the switch. My fiance, someone who thought for quite a while that the whole Blu-ray phenomenon was just a cash grab to make people rebuy movies they already owned on DVD, is convinced there's a huge difference and improvement watching not only Nemo but every computer animated movie in high definition. I already agreed a while back, but it helps that we both are on the same page now.	5.0	Huge Improvement from DVD	2013-10-24	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2WMEDQT6EL5FM	"Shaz ""oi-you!"""	"I do believe that ""Finding Nemo"" is by far my new favorite Disney DVD. The film is great, but the extras go above and beyond. Marlin (Albert Brooks) has lost his son Nemo to a diver who lives in Sydney, Australia. Marlin braves jellyfish, sharks, and whales to get his boy back. Along the way he meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a sweet hearted blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Still, she can read and knows the address that is in the mask the diver left behind. Each character in this movie is wonderful, and there are plenty of laughs throughout. Be aware, though, that there are some emotionally difficult scenes that may be slightly disturbing for younger viewers. The extras included on this DVD are great:CHOICE OF WIDESCREEN OR STANDARD PICTURETURN YOUR T.V. INTO A VIRTUAL AQUARIUM: love fish tanks but hate the work? Pop you FN DVD in and have your own virtual aquarium playing in the background!STORYTIME FUN FOR THE YOUNG: Children can read themselves, or have a narrator read to them the story ""Nemo Goes to School""MR. RAY'S ENCYCLOPEDIA: Learn about every sea creature featured in the movie.PLAY ""FISHARADES"": The school of fish form pictures bit by bit, and you have to guess what it is before they're done.PIXAR ANIMATION CLASSIC SHORT ""KNICK KNACK"": The animation short shown in theaters before FN, this 3:50 minute short tells the tale of a snowman in a snowglobe that wants to get out. My son remembered it and asked to watch that first before I'd even popped the DVD in.EXTRAS FOR ADULTS: Usually, kids aren't interested in the ""making of"" extras, or ""filmaker's visual commentary"", so these are pretty much here for grown ups. Oh yeah- there's,also deleted scenes.EXPLORING THE REEF WITH JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU (son of Jacques Cousteau, in case you were wondering): By far the best feature is this tour of the coral reef. As Cousteau narrates, Dory, Marlin and Nemo interrupt him, frustrate him, and upstage him. I laughed all the way through.Above and beyond that, you get a fabulous movie with amazing animation. Be prepared, though, for a more PG theme than i advertised. The peril these fish go through, along with the ""death"" of Marlin's wife can be very traumatic for a child who's not expecting it. Be ready to reassure them."	5.0	Great DVD	2003-11-05	23	18	5

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	"Pixar has outdone themselves once again. ""Finding Nemo"" is the dramatic, sometimes sad & scary, sometimes drop-dead hilarious, tale (or should I say ""tail""?) of a Father trying to find his lost son. In this case, the father (voice over by Albert Brooks), Marlin, is a clownfish living in a sea anemone. His son, Nemo, evokes images of Dicken's ""Tiny Tim"" character with his defective fin.In light of todays news headlines where children are forcibly kidnapped from their own homes, the opening of the film may be too intense and overwhelming for some sensitive youngsters.As with its other movies (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters, Inc.,"" etc.), the story is so well written, it can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.As someone who has a salt water aquarium at home with a pair of clownfish and a regal tang (the species of Dory, played by Ellen DeGeneres), I know first hand how these fish move through water and interact with other fish in the tank.It's obvious that the artists involved in animating these characters studied their biology and behavior for hours on end. A few times, the fish are literally out of the water, and as the water on their skin begins to drip off, you can see the subtle highlights in their scales. Magnificent work.Obviously, the fish are given human-like eyes... a truly necessary component to get you emotionally involved with these characters.Even Bruce, the Great White shark, is an endearing fellow with an Australian accent. Despite the human-like characteristics, the adherence to physiological details on the rest of these species is incredible.The lighting has such an effect that you feel like you are under water with the fish. The gentle swaying of the coral and anemones is surreal... just like the real Great Barrier Reef.In reality, some of these fish would never encounter each other in the wild... and we all know that Starfish do not have eyes or smiley faces... but you do not care about those minor details while watching this film.Dory is the beautiful blue & yellow regal tang fish who teams up with Marlin to find his son. Her tendency to forget almost everything she hears is a part of the charm of this character. Ellen DeGeneres' voice was perfect for this fish. The facial expressions on the characters, modeled after the actors that did their voices, are also priceless.This movie is far more than eye-candy. The story and comedic timing are so good, it could be done with stick-figures and still be good.This movie is an absolute delight. When it is released on DVD, it will immediately be added to my collection - this is a film I could see time and time again."	5.0	Endearing characters, great movie!	2003-06-12	36	24	12

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ADLN37B0153N	Silmarwen	When Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks) loses his wife and most of his children to a hungry barracuda, he swears to protect the remaining child, Nemo, so that nothing ever happens to him.  When Nemo is finally old enough for school, Marlin has a hard time letting go and embarrasses Nemo in front of his friends, spurring Nemo to go and touch a boat close to the reef.  Before Marlin can chew Nemo out for disobeying him, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken away.  Marlin tries to follow the boat, but quickly loses it and is forced to rely on a fish named Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, to show him where it went.  Meanwhile, Nemo is learning all about dentistry in his new home in an aquarium in a fish tank in Sydney.  As Nemo tries to help the other fish escape back to the ocean, Marlin must overcome his fears and fight his way past hungry sharks, fearsome fish in deep trenches, stinging jellyfish, whales, pelicans and stupid seagulls.  Along the way, Marlin will come to learn the value of friendship and that, if you protect your children from everything, they will never get to experience anything - good or bad....I would have to say that this is my favorite Pixar film yet.  I laughed my way through the whole movie and still laugh everytime I see it.  Dory was by far my favorite character, (her short-term memory loss makes her absolutely hilarious!) but Pixar took the time to study and make all of the characters memorable.  I am always impressed by their attention to detail and simple, yet meaningful plots.  This is one of those rare films that both adults and children of all ages can truly enjoy.  However, I would like to say that children of the ages of 3 and under sometimes get really scared while they are watching this film, as there are some dark scenes and sudden movements by the monster fish.  Still, I would say that this one is definitely a buy for anyone - I am 27 and it is one of my favorites!	5.0	Fabulous Family Fun!	2004-01-30	3	2	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A15MLF38WROSWU	"S. M. Anderson ""sma331"""	"I don't have any children of my own, so I usually feel strange watching a movie like this without a child in the room, but after my 6 year old niece pretty much informed me that I was missing out on a great movie I decided to watch it.  This movie was so much fun for me to watch, and it was a very sweet movie.  It's one that I could actually relate to.Marlin is a clownfish who is about to become a father for the first time.  He is happy, he is in love with his wife, and he can't wait for all the fish eggs to hatch.  Marlin looses his entire family, except for Nemo, and Marlin becomes very protective because Nemo is all he has. He does not want anything to happen to his son.  Nemo wants to be able to explore, and find his own way, while his father wants him to stay as close to home as possible.  Nemo is really tired of his dad always trying to protect him.  He feels like such a baby, and even though he has an undeveloped fin, Nemo feels like he can do anything anyone else can.  It's the first day of school, Nemo is excited, and Marlin is nervous.  When Nemo is caught by a diver, Marlin starts a frantic search for his only child and will not give up until he finds Nemo.  This is when the real fun, and action begins.I loved the forgetful Dorry (voiced by Ellen Degeneres).  She was so funny and energetic.  The Sharks that had a self help group promoting goodwill between fish and sharks was a total riot.  ""Remember, fish are friends, not food!!""  When Bruce (the head Shark) gets a whiff of blood after one of the fish is injured he totally forgets that fish are friends, and he wants to nibble.  I liked how Marlin would stop at nothing to find his only child.  That really touched my heart.Along the way during his search for Nemo Marlin runs into sharks, whales, jellyfish, sea turtles, crab, and sea gulls.Nemo finds himself stuck in a fish tank in a dentist office, and finds out he will be a present to a girl who killed her last fish.  Needless to say Nemo wants to find a way to escape so he can make his way back to his father, before the girl with the braces comes to claim him.The animation for the movie was simply beautiful.  I felt like I was in the beautiful sea along with the fish.  The title is not just about Marlin finding his son, but Nemo also finding himself.  If you think about it, we have all gone through something similar.  We want to live up to the expectations of our parents, but we want to learn the good and bad in life on our own.  I felt the film also dealt with having to pay for the consequences of your actions.  Nemo tried to defy his father, and he paid a hefty price, but on the same token, Marlin did not love his son any less.  I thought this was such an adorable movie, with plenty of parts to make me laugh, and other parts that I felt was kind of scary for very young children.This is an enjoyable film the whole family can enjoy together."	4.0	A very sweet enjoyable film for the whole family to enjoy.	2004-10-26	3	2	1

Through tragedy comes acceptance.  This was a beautifully crafted, well made movie that will become a classic in years to come.Note: The first 5 minutes of this film could be very traumatic for children under 6 as I experienced with my three little cousins who were crying hysterically in the movie theatre at the sudden loss of a loved one.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2U6BT86L5GFIV	"Sokste ""KtS"""	Of course I loved the movie etc.. I've never been much in to animation and would probably have continued to successfully avoided it except for a certain birth some years ago. So I've watched a lot of animation, and the animation that I don't ever hate is Pixar. In fact, I quite like it. Nemo is a delicious new beginning for them - dealing with parenting and family. Love the humor as always and the pace and the visuality - everything. More female characters wouldn't be terrible of course yadda yadda...Anyway, given that it came out in May 2003, and the main character is named Marlin, how obvious was it that Florida would win the 2003 World Series!?!??

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AK3R3RNUWLFJR	solar-bear	I saw this movie last night.  I have to say that the movie totally sucked.  First of all, as ridiculous as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, in which human could fly, it's absurd that fish (and turtles and birds) talk in this movie.  Have you ever heard fish talk in the pet store?  That's my point.  My second objection relates to the fact that the characters are not developed enough.  I didn't feel that I even cared if Marlin found his son in the end or not.  I was not really able to relate to those fish at all.  I went to the theater having heard all the rave reviews and came out feeling ripped off.  But if you want to laugh your belly button off, forget about the world around you, and be immersed in the surreal world of underwater pain and happiness (a little like the Spongebob experience) this is an adorable movie.	5.0	Not enough character development.	2003-11-09	12	0	12

The DVD quality originally released was great, but the colors always seem muted on the format.  Now, the colors truly seem to pop on the large screen televisions.If you're a fan of the movie, it's honestly worth it to buy this release on Blu-ray.

This movie really moved me. It's more of a father/son relationship that shows the parent really care about their child. Love is the key to happiness and you have to open up and let your felling's soar is what this show is saying.Anyways clown fish...ya. Ok this movie starts off like any other with the parents taking care of their to-be children and then out of no where a baracuda comes along. The father of course get rendered unconsious and the mom is no where to bee seen by him when he wakes up! *GASP* No more eggs. but wait there is one left. I meant the whole start made me cry but in a good way. The rest of the movie brings a fish with long term memory loss who travels with marlin go on a quest to look for his son.	5.0	This is so cute...you have to see it!	2003-11-27	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AIL4HD8BRUHV9	Soozie4Him	I think the last movie I reviewed here was Monsters Inc.  It was probably the last movie I saw too!  That tells you how much of a movie fan that I'm NOT!  But this one is just TOO GOOD TO BE MISSED!  Our family watched it together - our kids are grown or nearly grown.  We all laughed hysterically and loved it.  Two of my kids had seen it already, and had dissolved into laughter after repeating the line from the movie &quot;Just keep swimming, just keep swimming&quot; and &quot;I speak whale!&quot;, so we had to see what this was all about!I did feel the opening part about Marlin's wife Coral and all their eggs (except Nemo) being devoured was sad and might be a little intense for young viewers, but other than that, the movie was a real winner.  Another reviewer said that if you have young children, you could skip that part and I agree.There are so many lessons here - and the sense of adventure - and the importance of love and family and friends is very clear here.  There is nothing not to like about &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;!  I didn't view the extra DVD material, but it sounds great from what I've read.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2LICSQ2IFE3C5	"SPM ""scott_maykrantz"""	The *idea* of Pixar making a movie about fish is better than the movie itself. After Monsters Inc and two Toy Story movies, you could expect something special. But what you get is something mediocre --- bright and amusing but without any sophistication.The scenes under the sea are far better than the scenes in the aquarium. The jelly fish and the sharks, in particular, are amazing. Once humans beings appear, the quality of the movie declines. The humans have the same inflated limbs and faces as the people in Chicken Run. That's good for Chicken Run, but not for this film. The aquarium fish and their home are dull. I liked the blowfish (and his voice) but the others didn't stand out.It seems as if the animators' creativity was tapped out by the time they started to design the dentist, the aquarium, and the aquarium fish. Or, to make another quick comparison, look at the seagulls and the pelicans. The seagulls are like boneheaded Stormtroopers --- they're funny and intimidating. The pelicans, however, are as you would expect them to be. They aren't special.I enjoyed most of the voices. Willem Dafoe and Ellen Degeneres stand out. Albert Brooks is also good. The boy who does the voice of Nemo is perfect. Overall, this movie is entertaining but a little boring. It feels like the plot was simplified and the fish were colored a little too bright so it would appeal to kids (and be easier to merchandise).	3.0	Three stars for adults, five stars for kids	2004-01-11	6	3	3
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	S. Quinto	It's outstanding, how the Pixar people have come to make such a realistic animated movie, so I'm not going to praise them more, because it's obvious this is a well done technical movie, instead I'm gonna tell you that the plot of this movie, is simply innovative, and creative, touches delicate topics, like the death of a parents, without getting to much into detail.  The story of an scared father searching for his son thru all the pacific, is simply delgihtful, and the heartouching ending is better, specially this movie teaches everyone, that friends like Doris, even if she is like out of place and without focus could give you a needed hand, so remember this is a great movie, well done, and with a great message.	5.0	ALL TIME CLASSIC!	2004-02-23	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A29BQ6B90Y1R5F	S. Rhodes	Finding Nemo is dubbed the best and most successful Disney movie (in my opinion Beauty and the Beast will always be the best).  While it is the biggest success Disney has ever made it isn't quite the &quot;Best childrens movie ever&quot;.To those who gave it one star because of the excuse &quot;It's a kids movie&quot; my only questions would be, if you knew it was a kids movie why did you go see it?  Well, we all know Disney makes family oriented films and Finding Nemo is one of the better ones.The movie begins where we see Nemo's mother and father.  Soon they're attacked by a shark and Nemo's brother and sisters and his mother are all eaten.  Not a nice start but the movie got better. I wasn't disgusted with it but it seems that Disney has parental death in ALL their hit classics!  We all remember &quot;Bambi&quot; right? And then of course there's the other one that stands out: &quot;The Lion King&quot;.  Even if we don't see it, the parental death is there (Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin had parental deaths but they weren't mentioned nor shown).Aside from that the movie gets better.  Nemo's father, Mervin, after witnessing the death of his wife becomes scared of the ocean. Nemo, who is the only surviving child with a severed fin, wants to embrace the ocean.  But when Nemo is taken by a group of divers near Sydney, Austrailia, it's up to Mervin to find him.The movie is pretty entertaining at times and funny at other times.  It is pretty heartwarming too.  Of course as the movie progresses we see a change in Mervin's character. He goes from being scared to being pretty brave.There are other characters as well. Dory is obviously there to provide comic relief. She has a short-term memory problem but again, we see a change as the movie progresses. Actually, to be picky for a minute, when we first meet her, her short term memory is OVERDONE! Then they loosen up a bit as the movie goes on. Still enjoyable.The voice talents are great! While Finding Nemo doesn't rise above Toy Story the movie certainly shows a lot of entertainment for younger audiences and family alike.  I loved every minute of this movie. Now when will Disney make a great, spectacular movie without parental death and BOTH parents make it thorugh the movie?	5.0	A Good nice, Disney Film.	2003-12-29	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2ISHMIA2U1PX8	Stacey	The film begins with the murder of the mother fish and 399 of the 400 unhatched babies. Only dad and one egg (Nemo) survies. So already, children feel the fear of abandomnemt and the horror of the realization that mom and/or dad can die and leave them without a parent.  This theme continues throughout the film, with Nemo being kidnapped by humans becuase he didn't listen to his dad, and both Nemo and dad facing deadly circumstances and several incidents when the audience is supposed to believe that one or the other is dead or greviously injured.  The animation is beautiful and the voices well-acted, but the mildly humorous aspects within the film are greatly overshadowed with sadness and grief and abandonment issues.  (Not to mention reinforcing the sterotypical fear of dentists.) I would NOT recommend this film for young children.	2.0	Sad and Scary for little ones	2003-06-01	28	13	15

My husband and I bought this for our daughter and she was riveted. The characters are great, and the plot is much better than most of the &#34;classic&#34; kids movies my daughter has recently seen. I've watched this movie many times and it never gets old. Albert Brooks, Marlin,  plays a great neurotic dad, and Ellen DeGeneres makes her character, Dory, lovable and hilarious. The storyline is easy to follow, and makes finding Nemo a true adventure. There are a lot of interesting fish Marlin and Dory meet as they look for Nemo. They come upon sea turtles, sharks, jellyfish, and more, on their travels. This movie is visibly entertaining for kids, and has a nice amount of humor to keep the adult's attention as well. It offers a great message to help prepare parents for the day they have to start letting their kids do (or at least try) things on their own.

I watch this over and over again. All of the major critics say its great, i say its great. What more do you want?I espically liked when before the movie started, disney had previews of &quot;brother bear&quot; and the moose was commenting that the people that were &quot;leaving&quot; were &quot;going to find that nemo&quot; Hey, what can i say? it was pretty funny timing considering that &quot;brother bear&quot; was a piece of crap. And I also love the short film, kcick knack. I also enjoy when the DVD comes out, Pixar leaves you in suspence by showing you a preview of their next movie. In this case its &quot;the incredibles&quot; which looks very funny. I also have been hearing some rumors of the the NEXT movie after that. &quot;Cars&quot; i think it was.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich's ""Finding Nemo"" is a worthy addition to the Pixar cannon.  Undoubtedly it will endure as a family favorite for years to come.An overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) embarks on a search for his son Nemo (Alexander Gould) after losing him to a scuba diver collecting aquarium samples.  Nemo eventually winds up in a fish tank in a dentist's office surrounded by a motley crew of other captives who similarly have escape on their minds.  With a hippo tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) in tow, Marlin braves hazard after hazard and traverses vast distances in a determined quest to return his son home.The Pixar animators distinguish themselves with ""Finding Nemo"" as every frame of the film is infused with dazzling detail and colors.  However, all the pretty images in the world would amount to nothing without a quality script to complement them.  Fortunately, screenwriters Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds deliver a winner of a screenplay that is full of heart and charm.  The father-son relationship between Marlin and Nemo is beautifully realized and captures the feelings of sadness, fear, and pride that all fathers experience when their child seeks to strike out on his own.  As with all Pixar efforts, the voice cast is top-notch with Brooks, Gould, DeGeneres, Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Austin Pendleton, and Geoffrey Rush all providing memorable moments.  Chalk up ""Finding Nemo"" as another well-deserved feather in Pixar's cap."	3.0	"""You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny."""	2009-08-15	3	1	2

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AH2XM0D5UDTWY	"""strong_bob"""	I missed this movie whilst it was in theaters, so i was bummed... my brother, grandma, aunts, uncles, etc. all saw it and said it was great...So when this came out on DVD I was excited to see it, i grabbed it as soom as we got home, went up to my room, put it im my Pc and was ready for the &quot;magic&quot;20 minutes later, i was sleeping...for about a week I bragged that it &quot;put me to sleep&quot; since I was the only one I knew who had fallen asleep, but to be fair, i watched it again... it was horrible...There is nothing funny about this movie at all, it is neither &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;Heartwarming&quot;, or anything else the reviews and my family said...Also, there was alot of stuff they could have done that they didn't, like Nemo's fin, all they really used his broken fin for is symbolysm to never give up, while they could have had some jokes about it or somethingDon't get me wrong, I'm not a disney hater who hates everything they churn out, though i don't really like disney, i do have some favorites, Aladin, POTC, and others ring a bell...I also loved the other DIsney/Pixar collaborations, Toy Story is STILL funny after 10 years, A Bug's Life still makes me laugh, Toy Story 2 is pretty cool, and Monsters Inc. is ok.But, here is one of the problems, Pixar needed advertising when it came out because nobody knew who they were, who would see anything by a company nobody has every heard of?Disney ended up loving the idea for Toy Story and decided to distribute it, this would make big bucks for Disney who hadn't actually made a good movie since Aladin (in my oppinion) since then, and needed a good one, and Pixar would get money in return because, hey, its a Disney movie.Pixar became a household name and as of now is actually considering going on their own, and they can... because they are popular and good enough. But, Disney is holding on to them for everything because thats all they have, their animated movies are pulling in little to none.but, back to Nemo, the fish are all one-dimentional and every joke in this movie is just another Clishe, unlike other Pixar movies which had new ideas, who had, up intil now, heard of talking toys, Bugs, or monsters that scare for a &quot;living&quot;?But, now we are back to talking animals something that Disney has (sarcasm) NEVER DONE BEFORE! (end sarcasm)I have a feeling that Pixar, in light of the whole &quot;wanting to break away from Disney&quot; thing, decided to make a sucky movie so Disney wouldnt want them anymore, but sadly it backfired, and has become Disney's most succesful movie ever...You can see that Pixar is trying to be funny, but disneys restrictions prevent that....Now, you don't have to be discusting to be funny, but you can tell Disney really wanted the G ratingNow, something good that came out of this is that now, Pixar can't possible make anything worse than this, so the next one will probably be good...	1.0	This has to be the worst....	2003-12-11	43	4	39

The animation was terrific, of course, but the simple characterizations, simple story and contrived 'hollywood' humor left me bored and fast-forwarding to the credits.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP	Takis Tz.	Usually i stay a safe distance away from anything to do with Disney and the main reason i decided to give 2 hours to Nemo was for being curious about how far Pixar technology has gotten (the last i had watched coming from them was Toy Story).I was expecting to drown in cheesiness and cleancutness to be frank, and yes to a certain degree that did happen but not to a level where i had to resort to fast-forward techniques.Technically speaking &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a masterpiece. The animation is truly spectacular and this technology is probably the closest we've come to 3-D-ness in that respect. I don't know how further it can be taken but this is really convincing stuff.Now, this aside, the sad thing is that this technology is in the hands of Disney and that in turn means scripts with the cheese oozing like nuclear waste through the orifices of your TV set. If you're not cheese-proof that can be quite a test to go through unless you like watching your films with a puke-bag handy. But i imagine most people don't allthough i imagine lots of things that sadly don't apply to this world.Whatever the case, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; does have moments of brilliant humor, in fact more such moments than you'd expect it to. Plausibility in the story isn't an issue (fish talk, and have human psychological issues, so i guess plausibility goes out the window all the way) so he only thing that remains is whether you can laugh your way through this.The verdict is you'll laugh quite a lot of the way, but the sudden cheese attacks will function like surprise cold showers.Still though, when it hits its target, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is great and thus reccomendable even if it needs to be taken with a (sizey) pinch of salt.Made to fit somewhere in that grey area where it can be accepted by both adults and kids it struggles to keep that balance at points but does well in the long run.	3.0	Pixarious and cheesarious...	2004-04-04	4	1	3

There were hours and hours of information about the making of the movie as well as educational aspects of the types of fish and other animals that were represented in the movie.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2RB67N8XJ52QB	"Theatre Kidd ""princessofmirkwood"""	Finding Nemo is probably the best kids' movie that I've seen in a while, especially great for those 'in-between' kids at the ages of eight or ten.It's about a sweet little clown fish that gets taken away from his father and world and put in a dentist's office aquarium. His father has to go on this huge journey to save him, and meets all these little sea creatures on the way...But enough about that! What makes Nemo the greatest isn't necessarily the father, Marlin, or the son, Nemo, but all the little supporting characters that know exactly what to say and how to say it.Dory- the blue fish with a memory problem- is hilarious, and so is Bubbles, the yellow tank fish that has a fixation with- you guessed it- bubbles.The graphics are beautiful, as well, and they actually make you seem like you're underwater. Extremely colorful fish and scenery in the beginning, and when you get to the more 'out-there, away-from-fish-civilization' places like the trench, it actually gives you the feeling of danger.I didn't think that it was that physically scary like, say, Spirited Away, or that emotionally scary, like Lilo and Stitch had been, and I think that kids of all ages would love it.	5.0	Finding Nemo	2004-05-14	1	1	0

This picture deals with some difficult themes in an entertaining and heart-warming way. The ocean scenes were so breath-taking that at times it was hard to believe we were watching computer animation.  We loved this movie so much that we will be going to see it again this week.  Looking around the theater I saw many young adults and couples without children.  I hope the 70 million dollar opening weekend sends a message to Hollywood:  America is tired of the violence.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AI3Z25FWNK4QS	"""the_donster"""	I, Robby Genepri, have languished long and hard while critiquing this film through and through for any revolting gratuitous cartoon violence.  After finding little to boot, I must admit that I am still taken aback by the sheer audacity of Disney to release a cartoon film that encourages fish to fend for themselves.  I feel it incumbent upon the cartoon industry to underscore the increasing importance of interdependence, or collectivism, if you will.  Nemo, in his despicable American individualism, sours the taste in my Marxist socialist palate.	2.0	Too American	2003-09-02	65	4	61
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2I29YY8T7PVLZ	the_frog	What should be the new lesson #1 in film school: Boundless technical wizardry cannot cover poor storytelling. Ultimately, every movie must tell a good story to be interesting. Pixar, who commands unparalleled technical resources, devotes more energy into producing quality stories than any other studio. (George Lucas, are you listening?)That said, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's lesser acheivements. Which is not to say that it is not very good (it is), but next to their other efforts (Toy Story 2, in particular), one can feel a slight lacking. The humor is a bit more juvenile than most of their movies (Mount WannaHockALugee leaping to mind), and the plot is slightly less sublime. If Toy Story 2 was aimed at 8-12 year olds, Finding Nemo is pointed more at ages 6-10.With that said, it is still a very entertaining, well-written movie. Most of the laughs come from Ellen DeGeneres's exasperatingly absent-minded Dory, though the surfer dude/sea turtle Crush steals a few memorable minutes. The animation is, of course, beautiful and it is marvellously captured on DVD (HDTV owners will want this DVD to show off with). The set includes the theatrical widescreen, and an unsual fullscreen version, where, rather than pan-and-scan, Pixar re-rendered the movie in a larger window, so you actually see MORE in the fullscreen than widescreen.The special features are typically rich, as they are in most Pixar movies. People who bought any other Pixar release will recognize the template.All-in-all, a quality release just shy of perfection. Given the target audience, it should have tremendous replay value.	4.0	Another lesson in Cinema from Pixar	2004-01-03	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A23RQOODUIBCNY	themarsman	Finding Nemo has got to be one of the better animated films in a long time.  A clown fish named Marlin travels the waters off the east coast of Australia after losing his son Nemo to a human.  Marlin's journey to save his son is filled with memorable characters (including a fish with a bad memory and sharks that have forsworn eating fish) and lots of action.  Meanwhile, Nemo's imprisonment in a dentist's aquarium also has its share of memorable characters and humorously &quot;tense&quot; moments.  The climax coming when the dentist's precocious (to put it nicely) niece shows up for her surprise gift of a pet fish -- Nemo.  The movie's animation is wonderful...with the possible exception of the few human characters...I thought they could have been animated a bit better.  This minor point aside, Finding Nemo should be seen by all...young and young-at-heart alike.	5.0	Great Animated Film	2004-05-09	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AENS008HCBVC5	Theodore Illenberg	This a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. Finding Nemo promotes good family values in that a parent will sacrifice anything for their child. This is a great movie of the love between a father and son.Nemo and his father Marlin are clown fish. Nemo is captured by a diver who is also a dentist in Sidney Australia. Nemo and his father live in the coral reefs off of the coast of Australia. Marlin sets out to rescue Nemo with the help of an absent minded blue fish named Dory. The dentist places Nemo in his office aquarium. He plans to give Nemo to his niece Darla. who is not gentle with her pets. When she is seen they play the theme to Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot;. The fish try to help Nemo escape. He eventually does and is re-united with his father. While most computer enhanced movied try to hit you over the head with this new technology, Pixar instead uses it as a means to tell a story. This movie plays on all levels for adults as well as children.The DVD set consists of two discs. Disc one contains the wide screen version. In addition there are several items that go into the production of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The producers wanted the entire staff to by SCUBA certified. They took actual movie footage of the ocean and the coral reef. These movies were the basis for the animated film. The producers wanted the film to be reqalistic and to reflect life in the ocean.The second disc consists of the full screen version. There is also a menu of fun /educational items. The first is a live film about the coral reef produced by Jean-Michel Cousteau, son of Jacques Cousteau. There is no real narration, just live footage accompanied by orchestral music. The film keeps on getting interupted by Nemo and his friens.The next item is Mr. Ray's, Nemo's teacher, encyclopedia. This item consists of a live video clip of the actual living counter parts of the creatures in the movie &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;  Each video clip is accompanied by a narrative description about the creature by Mr. Ray.Another item is a story about Nemo that the user can read or have read to them. All three items are good learning tools about the coral reef and the ocean. I teacher can use this as a learning tool about the ocean environment and the coral reef in particular.The second disc also contains an early animated movie done by Pixar called &quot;Knick Knack&quot; as well as clips from future Disney DVD releases. There is also a preview of the next Pixar movie &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. There is also picture sharade game called fisharades that the user can play.In general. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is another winner from Pixar that the entire family can enjoy.	5.0	Finding Nemo	2003-11-30	2	2	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2FKVFY0VXIL56	"""theparagonspirit"""	There are those reviews before this which tell parents of young children to avoid this film because of some 'violent' aspects to the movie that may me too much to handle. However Bambi, a legendary Disney movie, shows a mother deer being killed by a hunter, an aspect that, for me, is far more violent than a fish being eaten. I believe Finding Nemo belongs in the ranks of Bambi and Lion King as one of Disney's masterpieces. The best Disney movies are those involving 90-100% animal casts with little human intervention. From start to finish this film is brilliant. The animation is unrivaled in any film to date, and the storyline stands on its own. Far from being flimsy, this is a story of loss, strife, finding one self, independence, responsibility, and family. The story is beautiful and can move you and then humor you at the drop of a dime. The story is swift, but moves at a comfortable pace for its audience. This is a captivating film in every aspect; continuing the success of Pixar/Disneyp partnership, but also proving that Disney is able to craft a film which explores the depths of human emotion and places it in a context in which young and old can allow their imaginations to be freed and can embrace a film that will be treasured by generations to come for its awesome animation and the touching and humorous tale it weaves from beginning to end.

Another rather annoying yet hilarious fishie is Dory (a regal tang fish), a forgetful yet wonderful companion of Marlin when he was searching for his son.Nemo and Merlin, through the difficult quests to find each other, experienced different hardships and met many other sea creatures. As the story goes, the audience can see the development of each characters and how their journies influenced them as a fish.Another great facet of this film is that the Pixel movie crew did a faaantastic job with the animations.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A22QPZWME85Z8T	"Timothy Hammond ""Movie Geek"""	"I saw this movie late in the game, after it had already grossed a gazillion dollars, after I had heard everyone rave about how good it was, and after I realized that it was the only true, bonafide blockbuster of the summer.  So naturally I figured Pixar had created another movie which was on par with ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life"", both of which I very grudgingly admit that I liked.  What I saw was a very average movie with a few chuckles and a few neat visual effects.  Was I watching the same movie?  Are the masses THAT easily entertained? or does Pixar have some kind of mind contral over 90% of the population?In the past, no matter how corny or phony feel-good a Pixar movie was, you could count on a decent amount of clever and witty jokes to make the whole thing entertaining.  It is precisely that cleverness that is almost entirely missing from ""Finding Nemo"", making it a mediocre movie at best.  Instead, viewers are given the goofball antics of the Ellen DeGeneres voiced Dory, and the Abbott and Costello type bickering between Dory and Albert Brooks' Marlin.  This type of humor is clearly aimed more towards children, and in turn ""Finding Nemo"" lacks that crossover appeal between adults and children that all of its predecessors had.In addition, the all too familiar Disney/Pixar themes are expounded on once again ad naseum and are beginning to wear thin. Personally I have become tired of having a multi-billion dollar corporate conglomerate tell me how one little person/fish/bug/toy/whatever can overcome even the most terrible adversity as long as they believe in themselves.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had time to explore such cynical thoughts had the story, humor or jokes held my attention, but the fact is they didn't.  It may may be time for Pixar to stop recycling the same story disguised in different forms and try something truly different and original in their next movie."	2.0	Very average	2003-08-18	17	5	12
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2GJ98824GGXGP	Timothy Kearney	"When I noticed that there are already so many reviews of FINDING NEMO, I decided there is no need to write another. But then I thought, why not add my voice in praise of a truly enjoyable film?FINDING NEMO is simply an enjoyable film, nothing more, nothing less. Like so many Disney animated features, the film tells a story of tragedy and triumph, in a way that children can understand and adults can enjoy. FINDING NEMO is no exception.The film tells the story of a small clownfish named Nemo who gets caught by a scuba diver and ends up in a dentist's aquarium. The plot tells of the ways in which Nemo plans to return to his father and the methods that Nemo's father Marlin uses in his attempt to find his son. Along the way the father encounters great dangers, but he meets a range of characters along the way including a new found friend named Dory and a group of sea turtles with personalities that resemble ""surfer dudes."" Eventually the two are reunited, but this is only after much intrigue and some interesting plot twists.Like other Pixar features produced by Disney (TOY STORY immediately comes to mind), there is more to FINDING NEMO than meets the eye. The depiction of the underwater world is amazing and oceanographically correct as far as environment and natural enemies are concerned. The story deals with pain and loss when Merlin loses his wife and most of his children, and the bond he has with Nemo is realistic. Nemo has a slight disability (a shortened fin) but yearns to be like the other fish, again a realistic touch. Dory is a loyal friend and the friendship between Marlin and Dory is touching to say the least. Marlin needs Dory's enthusiasm and Dory needs Marlin due to her won disabilities (short term memory loss chief among them). The dentist and his diabolical niece Darla add an amusing touch.I have found that children who see the movie love it for its special effects, but adults find the film moving. When the movie was playing in theatres, some parents did have to take small children out at the beginning because of the death of Coral, Marlin's wife, so parents may want to keep this in mind and skip the opening scenes. It is truly a film that crosses generational boundaries, as the box office figures show, and it destined to become another Disney Classic. The DVD set has many interesting bonus features including a documentary about the making of the film and virtual underwater aquariums."	5.0	A Fun Flick For All Ages	2003-12-26	5	5	0

Now that she is older, she only watches it occasionally, but she still adores the film.Rarely am I entertained by my daughter's entertainment, but as usual, this film works on multiple levels, entertaining the little ones, who are wowed by the bright colors and action, to the adults who are sick of listening to baby talk in other insipid children's programming like ""Teletubbies"" and ""Oobi.""  Several scenes (particularly with the 12-step sharks and possessive seagulls (""Mine!"")) had me laughing out loud and silently thanking Disney/Pixar for producing more quality family entertainment.My daughter can sit and watch any of the Pixar movies from start to finish, and Nemo continues the tradition of great Pixar hits.

Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies.	5.0	Cartoon Perfection!	2007-05-05	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ	Todd7	Finding Nemo (2003) is pure entertainment; it has humor, energy, breathtaking visuals, and premier animation. Most of all, it has a great plot- one that people of all ages can relate to. Never before have I seen an animated film that could show facial expressions on a creature that look so human-like and believable. I'm a big fan of underwater exploration, so there's a natural tendency for me to be biased in liking this film. However, even if I wasn't a big fan of the underwater world, I'd still love this film due to the appreciation of what went into making this film. I found myself laughing at the intelligence of the fish, and their wit and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, it felt like being in the ocean, due to the vastness of the area, and perceived danger lurking. I'm not a huge Disney fan, and have liked only a few other films, such as Mary Poppins, but this film has ignited a possible love for subsequent Disney films. I certainly will want to see Finding Dory in 2015. The extras are excellent viewing as well. The 2-disc collector's edition is superb.	5.0	A Disney Film That I Actually Love	2014-04-16	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A8U8JSMH2IA2T	Torik	This film is good value. The people at pixar have put together another great movie. I must admit this movie is very much overrated. It is NOT the best movie I have ever seen. The movie tells the story of a fish called Nemo who gets kidnapped by a diver. Marlin(Nemos dad) and his friend Dory (who has short term memory loss) must find Nemo who is trapped in a fish tank at a dental surgery. great laughs with Dory and a good storyline but definetely not the best youll ever see. Watch Shrek instead.	3.0	SOMETHING FISHY	2004-02-17	4	1	3
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AXSJ5IJM8IV4	tosismaguill	A man's wife is brutally murdered by a serial killer and his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), is left physically disabled. His father, Marlin (Albert Brooks), is left to raise him up on his own and they're all each other have left. In a twisted turn of events, Nemo is kidnapped from school one afternoon and Marlin is forced to chase the kidnappers down on the other side of the country - his only help being a mentally disabled woman named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and an address: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.This movie is suitable for children and adults alike because, despite the serious and rather dramatic issues at hand, the characters and story are both fictional; not to mention, the characters are fish. There is also a stoned turtle in this movie.	5.0	This is a great movie.	2012-11-15	27	21	6

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A35ZK3M8L9JUPX	"TREND700 ""TREND700"""	Life along the Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. An engaging undersea story that your kids will find cool. A treat for everyone.	5.0	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	2010-01-16	0	0	0

After at least a dozen fruitless forays into various video stores and retail establishments I said:'Look Karrie, everything I ever want I find on Amazon, let me try that and stop all this running around, I enjoy shoppin occasionally but this is ridiculous.'Being frustrated with the search she agreed.  I came home, got on Amazon, found the DVD and purchased it (at less than the prices we had been told by the video stores to order it).  It arrived in 4 days (quicker than promised), I gave it to Karrie who sent it off with her little treasure chest of Nemo items to 5 year old Braden.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A5CWLQF6QO3CN	"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B..."	"While you were thinking what new ideas could Pixar come up with after Toy Story and Monster Inc.? They put the answer right at your face. This time Pixar brought us into the marine world at the Barrier Reef where fishes struggle to survive and...well...have fun. Finding Nemo provides one of the most interesting and entertaining underwater experience to the audience after the spectacular success of the Little Mermaid years back. Technology has changed a lot since the Little Mermaid and what we have now are computer generated sea creatures that swim and talk like humans. The most interesting part of Finding Nemo was it managed to weave both human and ""marine life"" jokes together. The crown fish should be able to tell jokes is one of the very good examples. Also the Whale language is witty and amazingly funny. It is amazing the Pixar could put in so much charcter into beings that we don't think about much in life. The forgetful Dory, the Shark that wants to live a life with fishes as friends not food, fishes that want to break away from the acquarium etc. there are so much thoughts in the character building that you just feel like ""hey they are so real"". Lastly, since the movie has so much Australian reference and gags on the Aussies, it is even more fun to watch it in Sydney than in other parts of the world."	5.0	Surely it means more than Fish and Chips!	2003-10-28	1	1	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	Should I heap another praise on this masterpiece?  Why not?  Everyone should know that Pixar never gets it wrong, and, yes, they prove it again!  &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is entertaining, unpredictable, and most of all, very touching picture.The story involves a father and son -- only that they are fish.  Nemo is the only son of Marlin, a good-natured but slightly nervous clownfish who always worries about his beloved son, but too much worry makes Nemo rather uncomfortable in his school.  Actually, on the first day, the father and son have an argument about Marlin's over-protecting attitude.But when Nemo is captured by a human, and is taken away from the world Marlin belongs to, the desperate father takes chance to do whatever he must do.  But unlucky Marlin, the only help he can get is a scatterbrained fish Dory, whose memory last only ... er ... 5 seconds.The rest of the film you don't need any more explanations.  The delightful adventures of Nemo (trying to escape from a tank) and Marlin (trying to locate Nemo) is shown one after the other.  Maybe this way of storytelling somehow deprives the plot of the smooth flow of character change seen in, say, &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot;  However, the well-scripted film keeps on going, with its unpredictable turns given from interesting supports (including sharks attending some &quot;meeting&quot;), and as the film reaches the ending, it certainly moves your heart, possibly to tears.We must give voice actors due praise.  You never forget the great vocal performance of the pair Albert Brooks as Marlin, and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.  They deserve some awards, giving the CGI-created fishes the real life.  Possibly, these fishes are better actors than some Hollywood starlets.  And the CGIs are perfect, expressing the delicate movements of water, and slight shades of ever-changing colors in the south sea.In short, don't miss it.  The fact that it is an animation should not discourage adults from viewing it.  It is great.  It is terrific.  And it has a heart.  And a big one too.Don't forget to see the end of the film, in which you get the most uproarious gag in the film.  And one guest character from &quot;Monster Inc&quot; too.	5.0	Pixar Did it Again.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A16YRVQQA1VZM4	Tyler Free	Ok I'm 19 years old and I've seen a lot of Disney movies growing up. I'm a huge fan of their work, since they have interesting stories and a wide variety of characters and plots. However, Finding Nemo stands out above all of them, for me personally. Visually, it's breath-taking. I was in awe as soon as the movie started, just watching the lighting and subtle movement of the ocean's current was AMAZING. The story is anything but mundane. It's very unique and it is absolutely the perfect movie for parent and child. It's about growing up and for the parent to be able to let the kid grow up and not be so sheltered. Also lots of laugh and great musical score. Great movie all around.	5.0	My favorite Disney movie	2005-10-27	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1NDYL6D6QNVCI	"Valnastar ""Man With No Name"""	Many DVD versions of films seem to include extra features only as a way of justifying a high price without actually providing anything extra you'd want. That is certainly NOT the case with Finding Nemo! Disk 1 contains the widescreen movie and many thoughtful, good quality extra features. Disk 2 contains the pan-and-scan (fullscreen) version of the movie and DIFFERENT extra features than disk 1. The introduction on Disk 1 suggests that after watching the film once, watch it again with the &quot;Visual Commentary&quot; turned on. This includes the usual verbal comments, but also cut-scenes showing how key pieces of animation were done and a &quot;virtual aqauarium&quot;. Finding Nemo is a well-done and innovative DVD that actually justifies having two disks with more than just the film inside. The movie itself is entertaining on repeated viewings for young and old(er) alike.

Dory is funny and brave.Dory is funny because she forgets everything except when they find out where Nemo is. In the beginning she says ""Stop following me!"" She also said ""You're Nemo!"" when she finds Nemo.Not only is she funny she's also brave. I know because she doesn't scream when they go the dark part. She also doesn't scream when they see that big monster. She also doesn't scream when the jellyfish stings her.That's why I think Dory is funny and brave. P.S.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A7QYHLIRZLMLQ	"viagrafalls ""Peter Schmitz"""	"After his wife and all-but-one of his offspring get devoured by a Barracuda, the unfunny clownfish Marlin turns into the over-protective father of his last remaining son Nemo (who was named based on his wife's wish).During the very first day of school, Nemo is dared by a few friends to swim towards a boat. Seeing how his dad is already butting in, he goes a tad further than his buds bargained for, and is caught by a diver.The only clue Marlin has as to the new whereabouts of his son is an address written on the back of the diving mask lost by the guy who captured his son. Determined to get Nemo back, he then sets out on a long trip to find him.Along the way he meets a fish with a terrible short-term memory, a 'fish are friends' shark-group, and a bunch of surfer turtles (""Yeah, dude""), while Nemo can be found in a fish-tank surrounded by such oddities as old-timer Gill (Willem Dafoe), and French hermit crab Jacques who has a cleaning fetish.Disney's animation team really outdid itself with the animations. Everything in the movie seems to have been made with utter care for detail; in the back, often seagrass can be seen moving to the current, reflections look natural, fish move the way you expect them to move (Well. Mostly, anyway), and there's a gorgeous look at Sydney's bay included.The 'recipe' of the movie is one that has been used numerous times: Take a hero, add a quest, toss in a bunch of funny critters who help him/her, mix it with a tad of adventure, a pinch of bad guys, a tad of romance, and a humour-cherry on top. Still, the viewer doesn't get a 'seen this before' feeling.Overall, it's a funny and entertaining movie. Kids ought to love this, but Disney made sure older viewers will also be kept interested, even if it's just by the stunning visuals and the little references to other movies (""HEEEEEEERE'S BRUCEY!"")."	4.0	Entertaining, funny, and most of all gorgeous	2003-12-01	2	1	1

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	"First a warning--the opening sequence can be a bit frightening for small children. I'm not recommending against taking them to see it as it will create an opportunity for dialog with your kids, just make sure to prepare them for it or be willing to talk about it.Finding Nemo is another winner from Pixar. The opening sequence is amazingly detailed with eye popping animation that puts to shame just about any of the other computer generated animated epics that Hollywood has felt compelled to churn out lately. The story is fairly simple--the story focuses on Marlin's (Albert Brooks)attempt to find his son Nemo. Nemo disappears after he attempts to run away from home. He's captured by a Diver and Marlin's attempt to rescue his son begins. He's assisted by a dim fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Dory's lame brained attempt to help Marlin gets them into as much trouble but, ultimately, contributes to their salvation as well.Like Toy Story 1 & 2, A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo deals with many of the universal fears that children have. What sets it apart from other animated features is the witty script and the vitality of the visuals. Nemo manages to deal with frightening and common subject matters in a positive way that reflects the very qualities that parents try to pass along to their children. The soap box ""message"" quality one expects from such a film is buried deeply within an entertaining and thought provoking film.The performances by Brooks, DeGeneres and the talented cast contributes to the winning quality of the film. Films have always been puzzles; if all the pieces don't fit together properly, it doesn't matter what the image looks like, it just won't seem right. Pixar has managed to produce another winner and provide salvation for the adult who doesn't want to take their kid to another mind numbing children's film."	4.0	Exceptional film from Pixar	2003-05-31	2	1	1
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	ACU9MYBZTAGWI	Wayne Sanders	I originally saw this cartoon from Pixar in the movie theater. Marketed by Disney which later acquired the studio from Steve Jobs, it tells the story of an adventuresome young fish, who roams the ocean in search of his missing father, finding adventures and danger along the way.  This movie had the emotional story appeal of  Disney full length animated cartoons, like &#34;Pinnochio&#34; with more humor that appeals to adults, for example, a parody of 12 step programs where sharks struggle to overcome the temptation to eat fish. It's extensive use of computer graphics was a great step forward in animation.	5.0	Finding Nemo	2013-08-07	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AGUM1K2N3B8K2	"""webmaster90265"""	This is a great movie for anyone who likes fish and a great story.  It's the hilarious story of a clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is over protective of his son Nemo (Alexander Gould).  When Marlin runs into the loveable character Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) because she knows where he might be able to find him they run into sharks, turtles, jellyfish, pelicans, a whale and all sorts of other animals.  The only problem is that Dory has a terrible case of short-term memory loss.  As they travel the ocean into the EAC (East Australian Current) they work together to find Nemo who is stuck in a tank at a dentist's office.  Nemo and his new friends in the tank work together to come up with a way to free him before Darla (LuLu Ebeling) comes to pick him up for her birthday present and get him back into the ocean.  It's going to take a lot of planning and courage from both Marlin and Dory to find their way to the dentist's office and from Nemo and his friends to escape the tank and the clutches of Darla.  In the end, will Nemo find his way back into the ocean where he can reunite with his father or will he end up going home with Darla as her birthday present?This is a must buy for anyone who likes Disney and especially Pixar fans.  It is sure to be an instant classic to be watched over and over again.  The DVD extras include the great short film Knick Knack with audio commentary and 5 or 6 virtual aquariums you can turn your TV into.  The DVD also includes documentaries on putting this film together, which are amazing and makes you realize how much time and effort is put into making a digitally animated film look so real.  There are 2 discs, one disc has the windscreen version of the film and the other has the full screen version, both with tons of DVD extras.In all go buy this movie, it's one of the best Pixar movies made, and you won't regret it!	5.0	A MOVIE FOR EVERYONE	2003-11-09	0	0	0

Fitzgerald	Adults usually write the reviews here so from an adult perspective, this film is not as rich as Monsters nor the Toy Story films.  Those had many in jokes and adult themed gags.  I would say that Nemo is entertaining enough to see once, maybe twice, but adults will tire of it soon.Kids are another matter.  It is cute, colorful, and entertaining.  My only caution is that my son didn't like the lost mom and separation from dad plots.  Most of us grew up on Disney films which always had lost parents though.  I don't expect it to cause any major trauma, but more sensitive kids will be sad during those parts.  The humor is gentle and okay for tots.	5.0	For the kids, mainly	2007-06-04	2	1	1

It's family-positive, father-positive, and demonstrates bravery, friendship, and tolerance of those who require tolerance. (In truth, Dory would have driven me bonkers.)A few point rise above the sea-level of banality. Everything having to do with the seagulls is great, and kibitzing over the dentist's shoulder is a hoot. The turtles are cool (but they know that), and the minor characters in the tank really help. A few other points (""You made me ink!"") are fun.This movie never meant to break new ground, and doesn't. It's fun. Depending on how your little one handles mildly threatening scenes, it's probably kid safe. The animation is good, but that's normal these days.It's a sound, reliable entertainment product.

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A303AR58MOOYAV	"Woofboy ""Woofboy"""	"Disney used to be the King of animated movies.  Since full legnth animated movies first came out, Disney dominated the type of movie, but it seems lately, their animated movies have been getting worse and worse, and it doesn't seem like Disney is making ""Disney Classics"" anymore.  Another little company called Pixar, which is actually a small little divison of the much larger computer company called Apple Computers which makes some of the most imaginative computers on the market, seems to be taking over the animated movie business.  It's no wonder that Disney got a contract to have them make movies for them in the Disney/Pixar name for at least 3 more movies.Macs are some of the most imaginative computers on the market right now, so it's not surpizing that the same people that make really imaginative computers also make some really imaginative movies.  From Toy Story to A Bugs Life to Monsters INC, everyone knows Pixar, and their newest extreamly well done movie is Finding Nemo.Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo.  Marlin's wife and all of their kids with the exception of Nemo were eaten by a larger fish, so as Nemo was growing up, Marlin wias overly protective of him.  All of this protecting made Nemo get a little rebelious on the first day of school when his teacher took him to the edge of the coral reef and Marlin followed and tried taking Nemo home.  Nemo had gotten dared to touch a nearby boat floating in open water, and when Nemo's Dad came to save him from his teacher, Nemo decided to do it.  On his way back from the boat, he gets caught by a diver who captures him and puts him in a fish tank in the diver's dentist office.  After meeting with the other fish tank fish who are all from pet stores except for the tank's ""leader"" named Gill, Nemo finds out that he is a gift for the Dentist's Neice who is known as a Fish Killer because of her many unlucky attempts to have a pet fish.  Gill decides that he can't let this happen to Nemo, and tries various escape attempts throughout the movie.Meanwhile, Marlin embarked on a search for his son.  He met up with a fish named Dori who has a problem with short term memory loss.  Dori isn't really much help throughout the movie becuse she can't really remember stuff, but she can read.  After the boat pulled away, one of the divers masks fell into the water with the dentist's address written on the strap, and Dori was able to read this.  That turned Marlins search towards Sydney.  After close encouters with just about every type of sea creatures including sharks who are trying to quit fish, deep sea angler fish, jellyfish, whales, surfer sea turtles, and much more, his story spread until most of the ocean knew about him, and that's where I'm going to leave off.  It's a great movie, so if you want to see how it ends, you need to go and see it for yourself.Just like the computers that Apple makes, the movies that they make are very imaginative as well and it's not suprizing that their movies are better than any Disney animated movies.  I don't know what Disney is going to do when their contract with Pixar is up though.  Disney movies seem to have lost much of their imagination.  Sure, their animation is great, both computer and old fahioned, but their newer storys need help.  Maybe it's just budget cuts and Disney's not paying their animaters enough money to come up with good stuff while Pixar is, but lets just hope that great animated movies contuinue to be made, no matter which studio or company name makes them!"	5.0	Second best Pixar movie after Monsters INC.	2003-09-24	7	3	4

""Uh it scared my 3 and 5 year old kids, ahh its too scary for kids ahh, why is it G ahhh"" grow up you stupid parents. If your kids are afraid of it that is their problom, not the movies. All you parents can't write reviews. First of all it is called a ""movie review"", not a ""how did you react to it thing"". When you write a review you focus on how you liked it not on how your 5 your old over protected rich kid was scared by the sharks. I mean if you really hated the movie thats cool but don't just give it one star because you'r kids are to immature to handle a death they didn't even see in this movie.Anyway, I loved this movie. I have always been somewhat of a fan of Disney. I really like the Pixar company, they did a good jpb on all of their animated movies. I liked the story of this, and that if your a KID or an adult you can ENJOY it and LAUGH at it. There is humor kids will get and then humor that will go over the kids head and you will laugh at.

The vivid, eye-catching colors of the tropical reefs and underwater environment was especially a treat for ocean-loving, fish-interested, coral reef snorkelers like our family!Best of all was the characterization in the film's scripting, and the high caliber of talent that made this story line flow with such qualities as fear, sadness, perseverance, overcoming obstacles thrown in one's way, reliance upon others to assist us rather than trying to do it all on our own; making friends with people who we often-times misperceive at first, and then, by letting down our guard and letting that person into our lives, we find that they can become not only a person that we can bounce our feelings off of, but a potential friend, and, if we are really lucky, they could become our best friend in the making, for their compassion and caring exhibited by sticking with us,through the thick and thin, the peaks as well as the valleys that we call 'life'.The overall theme in the movie for all kids and adults alike to remember was extremely relevant to our current problems in relationships within/between families, friends, work-places, churches, etc.: Do not judge others, lest you be judged for you seeing yourself with a higher regard or level of esteem, which is a VERY unattractive attribute to possess. :(On the movie's positive and proactive side :), it alludes to reaching for a ""Highly Desirable Attribute List"", like realizing one's uniqueness from others as a blessing and not a curse; to not covet others then, and show pride for the inherent special gifts each of us have been annointed with also, and facing one's own flaws and fears, head-on, and not being ashamed to admit we are imperfect, we each carry painful or traumatic memories that can sabotage moving forward, which was the case in ""Marlin's"" overprotectiveness of ""Nemo"", after the loss he experienced at the beginning scene of the movie.  ""Marlin"", as well as each of us, collectively, need to learn how to evaluate and learn from a past trauma or hurt, not allow it to get us 'stuck' emotionally or become overly neurotic (I say that because we as mothers, or fathers, for that matter, PARENTS in general let's say it---whew, that's a more politically correct term to use--I'll have to remember that...anyway, I don't know of many parents that don't have some overprotective or neurotic fears about their children, especially with regard to safety, their children's well-being and age-appropriate development, and their child's happiness within healthy limits. So don't worry if you're a little protective...better that in this dangerous society of ours than parents that are too permissive with their children, or, worse, who could care less about their children. I think it shows a lot of character that ""Marlin"" (""Nemo's"" father) shows such a persistence to protect and then go try to find his lost son! Kudos for that part of the script! :)Subsequently, by utilizing a broader view, BEYOND SELF, to ""looking at the big picture"", welcoming and experiencing diversity out of curiousity, knowledge, further insight, and destigmatization of the ""we are better than them"" mentality that, as shown at the beginning 'going to school scene' of the movie.As long as groups tend to segregate and differentiate themselves with a 'Superiority vs. Inferiority Belief System', there will undoubtedly be continued & even heightened unrest between peoples and countries.  It is sad that the idea of ever living in a 'peaceful' world has now become a Utopian concept.We are robbing our children's generation, and their legacy onward, of the vital importance of acceptance of ALL peoples.  We MUST instill the message to our children, that everyone was created equal in {God's}/Our Creator's mind's-eye! So as parents, we have a responsibility to start modeling & exercising the attributes of humility and grace to others, so our children can see by example, hear by example, and learn by walking the walk, and not just lecturing them and talking the talk. Children need positive role models to instill what is right vs. wrong.It is our job, as parents, to ensure we get that message imprinted on our children's minds and hearts! The ensuing result will be well worth the foundational effort; by parents dropping their long-held prejudices and biases, and stopping the generational passing down of these same attitudinal biases against other peoples and cultures, we will be teaching our children the value of diversity, the mutual acceptance of one another's differences, and the burden of carrying around familial prejudices.On a lighter note, like a good comedy, I found myself cracking up, over and over again, by the subtle jokes by ""Dory""--the blue female fish who befriends ""Nemo""--Ellen DeGeneres does a fantastic job of playing Dory!My family loved it--the only thing that scared my 7 & 6 yr. olds at first was the shark part in the beginning...but once they learned that everything was going to be OK, my kids were able to relax and follow along with anticipation to the rest of the movie.I'd suggest everyone who hasn't gone to see this movie to go and catch a matinee with your kiddos...you'll be glad you did! Thumbs up to the producers/directors and special effects staff. In my opinion, ""Finding Nemo""should definitely be nominated for and win many awards in its category. GREAT JOB!

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much.  First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun.  Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old.  Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them.  ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks).  As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning.  Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling.  It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plotline--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors.  Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up""."	5.0	"""Nice"""	2013-02-23	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2060PAI3AXU7R	Zimmermans	We LOVE this movie in our house. My husband and I actually owned it before our kids were interested in sitting still long enough to watch a movie. We have been showing them various movies and this one is a favorite. Even my 2 yr old will sit through it. Well...ok..not ALL of it but she is 2 lol. She is more interested in this movie than a lot of movies.It is a lot of fun to watch and the animation is beautiful. The story is interesting enough for adults and easy enough to follow for preschoolers. Toddlers just enjoy the colors and the fish...and my 2 yr old daughter enjoys the shark parts.If you haven't seen this film you really should...especially if you have kids or are a kid at heart.	5.0	An adventure worth sharing	2013-02-11	0	0	0
B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A1JI9C3F1UBLUH	Zoe	The first time I heard about this movie, I thought it would be the worst PIXAR movie created.  My mom dragged me along to see it with my little brother, and I'm glad she did.  This movie kept me rolling!  It is the best PIXAR movie I have seen!  I am extremely pleased they created it.  You will be crying at parts and laughing at others.  The animation is beautiful.  And Dory, a forgetful fish, will be quite unforgettable.  Extremely cute and one of the best movies this year.	5.0	An amazing movie	2003-11-10	0	0	0

B00005JM02	Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)	A2XYGJ7FAK0QR7	"Zossima ""Zossima"""	The movie is about finding Marlin's son, Nemo, who has been captured and put into a dentist's fishtank in Sydney, Australia.  BUT THE MOVIE IS REALLY ABOUT FINDING MARLIN (voiced by Albert Brooks), the father, a well-meaning but suffocating father who doesn't want his partly disabled son to do anything risky.  In order to save Nemo, Marlin overcomes his fears of life off the reef, facing sharks, whales, and other ocean dangers in order to rescue Nemo.That Marlin is the one who is really rescued is attested by his bravery at the end in letting Nemo, with whom he has been reunited, risk his life to save their new friend, Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres).  FINDING NEMO IS AN ENDEARING FATHER-SON STORY ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF A PARENT TO LET GO AND THE INCREASED INTIMACY THAT RESULTS FROM DOING SO.PLUSES:* Pixar has outdone itself.  The incredible animation makes the Toy Story movies look like Steamboat Willie.* Just as with the Toy Story movies, the pacing of the story is great.  There aren't any dead spots.  Both the comedy and the drama are perfectly placed.PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION:I personally still think the Lion King is the best animated feature Disney has ever put out.  But that's because of the power of the story.  This is the best animation Disney has ever put out, thanks to its partnership with Pixar.I highly recommend it, but with the caution that THERE MAY BE SOME FRIGHTENING PARTS FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS, though my four-year old (who was frightened by Monsters, Inc., wasn't frightened by this.)	4.0	Finding Marlin...	2003-12-09	1	1	0
