B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3FBY225TM3BAJ	"Aaron ""Aaron"""	Hurray for the mexican director, the movie was way better than the first two, it has more feel, its darker, the camera shots are magic!Now, ill have to straight things up upon those that feel that the movie wasnt a match:To those that complain about the new Hogwarts: Its a LOT better imo, the other one look plain and empty, i love the lakes, the mountains and the more misty theme on this one, its how i imagined when i read the booksThose that complain about new Dumbledore: He was good, as good as Richard Harris, but hell... you just cant rate a movie 1 or 2 cuz an actor died, can you???To those that complain about Harry's explosive attitude: God, you cant expect harry to remain as when he was 11, Breaking News: Harry is growing. Personally, i think after all what Harry is living, its quite acceptable to see him over react as he did in the movie, so people dont complain about it...All the elements of the movie were better than the last 2 films, humor, scenario, actors. Tho i must agree that an extra 15 minutes to the movie to explain things that might confuse non-readers would have made it even better. So i take a star out of this cuz i know the movie can be hard for those that didnt read the book. But dont blame the director.	5.0	Alfonso Cuaron gave me satisfaction!	2004-08-29	8	4	4

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AVT2CST57MKDL	Abby	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a very well-made movie. Alfonso Cuaron, taking over the project from Chris Columbus, has done a remarkable job with every last detail of filming. Everything from the lighting to the cinematography to the musical score is breathtaking and amazing.The actors are all at the top of their game. David Thewlis, also a newcomer to the project, does a wonderful turn as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin. Another newcomer, Gary Oldman, plays escaped convict Sirius Black to a tee. The character was completely believable, and just as I had imagined him. Michael Gambon, as the new professor Dumbledore, makes a seamless transition into the role left behind by the late Richard Harris. And Emma Thompson steals all of her scenes as the loopy Professor Trelawney.The film is shot with lots of dark colors and off-kilter angles, fitting the tone of the story perfectly. Harry is being stalked in this story, and Cuaron goes to every length to make sure the audience feels the discomfort Harry does when he thinks he's being watched.The only downfall of ""Azkaban"" however, is that it's somewhat of a poor adaptation. I got the feeling that Cuaron had read Steve Kloves' script, but neglected to read the book. Many parts important to the audience(and to later books) get left out, and while the audience won't miss some of the cuts(Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, for example) some aspects that should have been included in the film were not. Furthermore, some parts of the book were left out that later become important to the plot. As a faithful reader of the series since book one, I knew what was going on, and was able to keep up, but those members of the audience who haven't read the book might get confused. This film(especially at the beginning) is somewhat exclusive to people that didn't read the series.But the films have taken a big leap forward in quality with Cuaron at the helm. While the ones Colombus directed were glossed over and disney-fied, but very faithful to the books, Cuaron's movie makes several departures from Rowling's novel but, as a film, is much more ambitious and artistic than its two predecessors. So to those who have read the book: I urge you to go see ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", but be prepared to take it with a grain of salt. To those who haven't read the books, or haven't read them in a long time: Read or re-read the novel before you see the film. It will make that much difference."	4.0	So close and yet so far	2004-06-06	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3MDWBF9LG5KXF	"ABF ""Angela"""	"The first time I saw this movie, I was wondering what movie I went to see.  The movie was hurried and choppy.  So much of the important story line was left out.  I knew I wasn't the only one when leaving the theater I overheard lots of people that didn't read the book asking questions about the movie.  Plus, it was very difficult to get into a movie that changed everything from its predecessors.  The total change of the castle and grounds brought the image of the kids going to a different school.  Honestly, I really hated the movie at that point considering I felt it ripped my favorite book to shreds.To be fair, I did go see the movie a second time.  I did like the movie a little better.  Why?  Probably because I could pay a little more attention to things that were happening because I wasn't in shock from the differences.  I still don't like some of the main elements of the book being left out.  And, personally, the lighting of the movie, reminded me of old movies like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""I think the director could have dealt better with adding a bit of ""realism"" and keeping true to the books.  I don't think his heart was in the right place of being true to Harry Potter.  He just wanted to create a ""masterpiece.""Will I own the DVD?  Of course... what Harry Potter fan wouldn't?  However, I know it won't be viewed as much as the other films."	2.0	What was that?	2004-08-25	8	4	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1PL8EEHJK1YKI	"Abhishek ""superimo"""	the third movie installment of harry potter series. the third book is the best book in the series till date. the story the plot was near perfect. the movie somehow was not upto the mark. they have made loads of changes in the movie. they removed everybody's favourite quidditch final (where harry rides his new firebolt), the ending plot changed a lot, the starting itself is different from the book. these and many other changes made the difference between a great movie and a ok movie. i am greatly dissappointed with the movie reading the book is better. the reason i am giving this review 4 satrs because the direction is great and the graphics look amazing. the story writer (for the movie) should be bombed and should not be allowed to write for the next movie in the series.the movie seriously lacked the punch every harry potter fan (atleast me) was hoping to see from the third installment. after all this is the best book in the series (till date).	4.0	could have been better	2004-06-04	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQATFS6MK9J7N	A bostonian	It deserves multiple viewings as it contained many plot layers as the Sixth Sense and rich and beautiful Scottish highlands backgrounds. Its cinematography was just stunning and its John William's score was just haunting. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis played the best fictional characters ever. Daniel Radcliffe had improved so much in playing a subtle but angst ridden teenager. Its CGI beatd Spiderman because its computer generated magical creatures blended into its natural environments (except near the werewolf fight).	5.0	Best Movie this Summer	2004-07-23	4	2	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1PAD4JIH8TKNV	"absintherocker ""absintherocker"""	I would have loved to afford this film with five stars, however I must confess that I found it very disappointing. You can immediately tell that it wasn't directed by Colombus, who had achieved a good mix of character/CGI on the first movies and served up a tasteful dish of both brilliant filmmaking and immensely pleasureable viewing. Azkaban is conceivably darker and atmospheric, which isn't always a good thing.Lets face it, this is fundamentally a story about a group of kids, so with all do respect to Renaissance inspired music and pseudo-philosophical exchanges between Professor Lupin and Harry - it just doesn't feel right.Professors Snape and McGonagall, whom I'm sure we all agree are superb characters, are practically non-existent in this film. Michael Gambon tries but fails miserably to recapture the heart-felt, touching performance of the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry is another sore spot; his anger gets seriously annoying at times (I can see him turning into Connor from the TV series Angel if he's not careful). Unfortunately, The Prisoner of Azkaban just isn't as funny and entertaining as The Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets.However go and watch it by all means, but do not expect the heart rendering, fun-filled adventure pack delivered by the first two.	2.0	Extremely Disappointing	2004-06-04	5	4	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	It's been too long since I've read the book to be sure but I thought that Azkaban was a pretty good movie. Apparently some things were changed/ altered but mostly the story seemed to be substantially like what I remember reading. I could've done without the talking shrunken head (in the interview bit on disc 2 J.K.Rowling said she actually liked it even if it wasn't her idea)and would've liked Harry's patronus to have been more like the book (I believe it WAS shown as a Stag at one point).The Hogwarts exterior seems greatly changed to me, as did Hagrid's cottage and the kids are really starting to change in appearance. Most of the computer animation seemed pretty good, Buckbeak the hippogriff was a little off at times. As always the general level of detail, considering that so much of what you see is a set, is incredible.I can't imagine that The Goblet of Fire can be shrunken down successfully but if it is done as well as this one I'll want to see it too.	3.0	3 &1/2 stars, better than most book/movie adaptations	2005-01-12	5	2	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2R1YK4VW451JA	"A. Cheng ""livingoc"""	The Harry Potter franchise has done it again. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is excellent and worth every ounce of your money and time.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the most poetic out of the Harry Potter films with its dark and icy overtones and constant camera flow, which makes the viewers feel Harry is constantly stalked. In the third installment, Sirius Black, a noted murderer and a supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and is now said to be after Harry Potter.Now for this movie, Alfonso Cuaron must be praised for his brilliant direction and his creativity. Viewers will note the small changes to Hogwarts and its grounds, but first and foremost, this film is a lot darker than the first two but it's also a piece of artwork. It's full of beauty and grace that a true movie should be. The acting is excellent (most noted is Daniel Radcliffe who plays Harry Potter. His acting has improved immensely from the first two. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black; David Thewlis is terrific as Remus Lupin) and the cinematography is beautiful.Every scene with Buckbeak the hippogriff is unbelievable. The CGI work on Buckbeak has got to be one of the best in movie history, every detail is shown and has got to be CGI at it's finest.  The special effects are brilliant beyond comprehension. Most notable are the Dementors, which in their own interity are creepy and scary enough to chill viewers to their bones. Every scene with the Dementors is chilling and they are the perfect translation to what JK Rowling wrote them as in the book.The film like the book incorporates a lot of humor and adolescent initiations, but the movie, like all film-book adaptations, is perhaps not the most faithful, cuts out a lot of the explaining, which can annoy staunch Harry Potter fans; however, it does help the movie move faster.The movie is excellent and is a visual feast that will make you grip the edge of your seat for life. Alfonso Cuaron has captured perfectly the book's essence and spirit and viewers will feel like they are soaring as the movie draws to an end wanting more and wishing for the next installment to come sooner.	5.0	The Best Harry Potter Movie Out of the Series!	2004-08-12	10	8	2

This is because I almost hated this movie. I do grant that the movie had gorgeous cinematography in many scenes but that it lacked in the rest. There are even some plot holes in there. The screenplay and/or director made the movie almost incompatable with the rest of the series if you have not read the books. There were some major scenes and facts needed to push the other stories along that didn't make it into the movie and scenes that did make that weren't nearly as important. Overall, I find that it is my love for the stories that allows me to give such a high rating to this movie because I was gravely dissapointed in it.	2.0	What was he thinking	2004-07-27	7	6	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3MV1KKHX51FYT	Acute Observer	"The Prisoner of AzkabanYoung Harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant. An insulting relative is blown away, and Harry leaves too. A magic bus takes him away. The special effects are extravagant, but seem senseless. The oddities are like something out of ""Star Wars"", amazing but irrelevant. The `Hogwarts' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy. Or do they have a short life in their future? Great power may create great faults.The computer generated images are what makes this film interesting. The hippogriff looks great! Let's hope it doesn't drop anything on the students. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, where they keep the wizards who have gone bad. Black is said to be going after Harry Potter! This time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain. The winter scene and the invisible Potter recalls ""The Invisible Man"". Overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film. The story begins to drag in the middle, but a big black dog shows up to drag Ron into his underground lair. A tree comes to life and attacks Harry and Hermione. Then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation. [Does any of this make sense to you?]Special effects are no substitute for a good story. It seems confused and meaningless. Can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people? All seems to end well given the prior events. Professor Lupin resigns, his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students won't approve of this behavior. Parents don't like a teacher who exploits the students.""Harry Potter"" panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who aren't fit to handle these powers. Or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class?"	1.0	Getting Older Not Better	2006-10-30	3	1	2

It was so dark, mysterious, and humorous, just like the book! Yeah, they may have changed some things, but you don't find many movies these days that are like there books, what I'm saying is: IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE! But it was GREAT! I LOVED IT!As for HP4, Mike Newell should keep it one movie, and up to 3 hours. Two parts would be rediculous! At least up until it was too long as one, but they can make HP 6 and/or HP7 up to 4 hours long, as well as its entertaining...it worked with GONE WITH THE WIND, so why not HP4, 5, 6, or 7?	5.0	WONDERFUL!	2004-08-22	4	1	3

"There's no doubt this is probably the slowest, film with the least action. Don't get me wrong it is very fun just like all the rest but im sure  a lot of us expected more. We never find out why it is Remus is a werewolf even if it does say in other films there could have been much more to go on if we had all this information, also why is it that Black and Lupin never told Harry they were the creators of the Maurders map? We didnt get a lot of information of this important bit either. The last is there is only a few references towards ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" and it didn't show anything about him whatsoever and that was really disappointing im sure for everyone also. I really didn't expect it to end so abruptly also with the cheesy potter smile and then credits! What a disappointment. We did get a lot of new info and that will go a good way in the other films."	3.0	YEAR 3	2013-10-17	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A19U6IZI8OQ811	"""adgreene11"""	HP:PA is a really bad movie, it was good to sit down and watch but it was scrambled to much. I am very appauld at the state the movie was in when it arrived on the big screen. Not only did it jump from one scene to the next it really didn't go into much detail on everything, like who was padfoot, prongs, wormtail, and moony? In the book it explained that and in the movie it left us totally out in the blue.Oh and another thing is that Harry got the fire bolt at christmas and Hermione told Prof. McGonagall that there might be something wrong with it that it could have a been tampered with to hurt Harry, but in the movie he got it at the end.Also the castle and Hagrid's cabin in the other two movies has been on the same level ground and in this one they are not, the castle was on a hill and Hagrid's cabin down below.Michael Gambon was no Dumbledore, maybe the knight bus driver, but he was no Dumbledore, now Ian McKellen who played Gandalf the White on the Lord of the Rings would have be the best Dumbledore. And he is the one who should play him in the next one.And the part where they were in the shrieking shack was really off. Snape came out of the hole floating in the air, but in the movie he ran out, what a bummer and also you didn't say a word in the book to make the tree stop like Lupin did, the cat Crookshanks touch the tree on one of its branches and made it stop.Harry also didn't go to Dumbledore in the third movie like he did in the book and that was the best parts.Also when Harry wore the invisibility cloak to Hogsmeade it was not that other guy with Draco, but Crabbe and Goyle with Draco when Harry was pushing them around underneath his cloak. Also Harry's head came out from underneath the cloak.Also Michael Gambon's part as Dumbledore was all wrong, he was too cheerful and way to perky the old Dumbledore was very serious and never laid back, he was always on his toes.Also there were more than one Hippogriff in the book and in the movie there was only one.During the one of the Quidditch Matches where it was raining Hermione put a spell on Harry's glasses that made them from fogging up, but in the movie he wore goggles.They left out the good part where Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle went out on the field dressed up as Dementors and Harry put the spell on them.However they were some parts I liked. The way that the Great Hall looked was amazing and the way that the Dementors looked were cool. I would also like to say that David Thewlis did an excellent job on Professor Lupin and I would like to say that Emma Thompson did an excellent job as Professor Trelawney. I would also like to say that Buckbeak was a very cute animal and I would love to have one of them one day.I would like to say that if you read the book you will be very disappointed and if you haven't you will be very lost.	2.0	Wrong way of Harry Potter	2004-07-10	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2Z5RFU4DH3T0G	"A. Fondacaro ""NiaTonyF"""	Cuaron must have spent some time in England, because the first two films were lacking something that England has in abundance: rain. In &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban,&quot; it's either raining, or on the brink of raining, just like England.I'm sure you've read all the reviews that hint at the sexual rumblings beneath the surface so I'll skip those. What stands out in this film are the cinematography, Rupert Grint, and one incredible scene where you have three brilliant British actors on the screen at the same time. Incidentally, this is also the scene where the true darkness of the film is unleashed, and give Cuaron good gropes for not making that scene too late in the film. The film is gloomier and more chilly than the first two (which look like Disney-movie romps next to this), but Gary Oldman's acting comes from a different place than everyone else's. When you put him on screen next to Alan Rickman (one of the most underrated actors of his age) and David Thewlis, this source begins to preside over the scene. Everyone's performance takes a leap to a higher level, even the kids, who are relegated to the corner of the room, like they're spectators in some British theater watching three masters. Look for Grint to keep pace; this kid is going to be around for a while if he can escape the childhood-star syndrom.In the meantime, Michael Gambon takes over Dumbledore's role from late actor Richard Harris and doesn't look back. No disrespect to Harris, but he had the role all wrong, and while brilliantly acted, it's not as effective as Gambon's hippie-cum-headmaster who winks, muses, drinks, and is in on the whole thing. Harris looked like they had him propped up on a board.And then there are rains, and clouds, and storms, and some of the most wonderful shots I've ever seen (the Hogwarts training meandering through the hills on a dark, stormy evening). I'm entirely grateful for the casting of Thewlis as Lupin, he's the embodiment of Cuaron's approach. Fully integrated into the character, not pulling strings from some remove.Look for the rest of the films to try and mimic this one, but with no success. I doubt any of the films will trump this one, in which case, we'll just have to grin and bear it. The year isn't over yet, but I haven't seen anything that comes close to how this film pulled me in.Just what is it? Perhaps the faded colors; the first two films had no filter at all. The colors were as they appeared, rich and clear. Cuaron lets this linger at the Dursley's house, but then drains the color out as we enter the wizard's world, leaving the ethereal impression of a warped world. Cuaron is also abandoning the whole &quot;look-at-this&quot; technique of pulling the camera back, giving us and the characters a moment to look around, and then resuming the action. Cuaron's style is too swift for any of those, and the camera angles have to speak for themselves. The result is that a normal film comes through, and not a kids &quot;gee-whiz&quot; romp. Gone is Chris Columbus's air of &quot;wouldn't this be fun???&quot; and we're left with a serious &quot;this world outside yours.&quot;	5.0	A movie about rain and clouds	2004-07-29	5	2	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F	Ahmed	The boy wizard has not lost his powers! Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban has always been my favourite HP book and I'm happy to know that now it'll be my favourite HP flick! This entertaining epic is by far the best HP movie in the series! It's the first one that actually comes close to the book and has the mysteriousness and the thrilling adventures that the book offers but the first two movie instalments failed to offer. What makes this movie better than the first two? It's the director, Alfonso Cuaron. Thanks to him, the movie is sinister, deeper and meaningful, thought provoking, scarier, and more visually stunning. The special effects are amazing. They are a thousand times better than what the first two movies came up with. I mean give me a break; in the 2nd movie they made the basilisk into a pathetic mechanical snake! Cuaron has managed to create a wizarding world similar to the one imagined by Harry Potter fans. In all the movies the cinematography has been great, so no complaints there but once again the third film's cinematography is a lot better!The story revolves around Harry Potter, the infamous boy-wizard who's attending his third year at Hogwarts: School of Wizardry. As the wizarding world and muggle world search for the whereabouts of Sirius Black, the evil escaped prisoner, Harry finds himself in the middle of another annual adventure figuring out that he is the reason Black escaped from Azkaban. This time the adventure is as good as it gets. To add to his usual troubles (Snape, Malfoy, etc.), dementors roam the lands sucking out the hopefulness and cheerful memories that make people joyful by replacing them with forgotten depressing recollections and frightening images from their past.Some of the best things: more Quidditch, this time the matches are extremely exciting! Harry, Ron, and Hermione are grown up now, the story's better, as is the overall movie. The movie marks a great accomplishment in production design!In short, Alfred Cuaron should be praised for this brilliant creation! At a time of great expectations, Cuaron succeeds.

I expected that a new director would change the tone somewhat, but what the heck happened to Hogwarts?? They changed the flat landscape of the school grounds completely - now it looks like they're all scaling the craggy cliffs of Scotland! Also, Hagrid's house isn't where it's supposed to be - across the lawn from the school and at the edge of the dark forest. It's fun to see our students growing up but some of the ""magic"" is gone and there's no reason to start messing with background elements that are supposed to be constant. That said, now that readers have the background of the story behind them, this story is much more complex and detailed & is still very engrossing. It's a winner, but that's because of J.K. Rolling's vision, not the director's. I just wish he'd been as concerned about continuity as he was about making his mark on this already successful series of stories."	1.0	Different, But Still Good!	2004-11-10	20	5	15

Krenz	I was very excited to get this special edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, however, was very disappointed with the extra features.  All along, they've advertised these Ultimate Editions as having never before seen extras and of course the coveted third disc with Part 3 of the special look at the world of Harry Potter.In both of the first 2 Ultimate Editions, they had the extended version of the film, with deleted scenes or extended scenes placed back into the film.  With this movie, they did not do that.At first I thought it was because they just didn't have scenes to fit into the film.  However, as any Harry Potter fan knows, ABC Family plays extended versions everytime they have a Harry Potter Weekend.  It just so happened that a week after I received my Ultimate Edition, ABC Family had a marathon and Prisoner of Azkaban was on the lineup.  They showed scenes not in the Ultimate Edition and this just upset me further.If you're going to advertise it as the Ultimate Edition, it better really be the Ultimate Edition!Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire better have the extended and extra scenes added in or someone is getting a strongly worded email!!!	4.0	A bit disappointed	2010-12-16	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ	"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover"""	"The first two movies of the series - Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets - are the only ones that ever made to DVD in the expanded editions.  Unfortunately, those editions are no longer available.  For those who own them, they are relatively clear videos and the expanded portions are important.  Unfortunately Warner Brothers does not seem to want to issue them any more, and those that followed, beginning with Prisoner of Azkaban, won't be issued that way.  ""Director's Cut!""  As the director wanted it.  Actually, what it means is WB set the time limits, and the directors made the best of it.  Prisoner of Azkaban would not improve much with the extended edition, but the transfer4 to Blu-Ray is a major step forward anyway.  The picture is clearer, and for a movie that has this much darkness in it, that's important.  The others in the series - Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows part one - all improve with the addition of Blu-Ray.They would also improve with the extended editions.  My suspicion is that WB will issue a 3-D version of the movies in the extended edition and be able to soak us yet again for more money.I am a late comer to Blu-Ray, and I haven't been won over yet by 3-D.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A379SAP75SPDHD	Alec Solomita	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best installment of the Harry Potter franchise. It is the most well acted of the three, due to the kids growing up more and a director who knows how to develop characters, and the addition of such great actors as Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, and David Thewlis, who I felt gave the best performance in the film, although Oldman and Thompson both were excellent as well. Michael Gambon also fared very well as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. What makes this film the best one is the fact that it does not rely solely on the book for storytelling and scene setting, as new director Alfonso Cuaron realizes there is no way to stay faithful to the book 100 % and have a great film. He uses the book as a guideline, and sets up conflicts that work well, such as the maturity and power of Harry, the creepiness of the dementors, and the escape of Sirius Black. This book was  my favorite of the series, and it will be hard for the rest of the movies in the series to top this, as this film is the mots magical and wonderful of them all, as well as one of the best family films of all time.	5.0	The Best Harry Potter Yet!	2004-07-04	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A20LY8E9NGYA4M	Alejandro Cortes	&quot;Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban&quot; is an improvement over the first two movies in almost every area. The first thing that comes to mind is the story: it's darker and more complex than before, and that's because the book is perhaps the best one in the series, and there is a different director this time. Chris Columbus (who directed the first and second movies) was replaced by Alfonso Cuaron. Cuaron is far more experimental than Columbus and it shows in &quot;The Prisoner Of Azkaban&quot;.The kids are now teenagers, and they also improve their acting techniques and abilities in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) shows more experience, and his character seems more complex than ever and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) is also very good. However Emma Watson (Hermione) made the biggest improvement of the three. In this movie Hermione is a key character, Emma projects in the film bravery and intelligence.The rest of the cast is as impressive as before, and the new additions in the roster are really great: Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) is as reliable as always, David Thewlis (Remis Lupin) is very good, Emma Thompson (Professor Trelawney) is very funny, and Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) brilliantly fills the void left by the dead of Richard Harris, the original Dumbledore.The special effects in &quot;The Prisoner Of Azkaban&quot; are more real and detailed, the magic and spells look great, but the new creatures are colorful and impressive, specially the Dementors and the Hippogriff. The photography shows beautiful angles and landscapes, as well as very realistic locations. And the music is very good too (courtesy of the great composer John Williams).&quot;The Prisoner Of Azkaban&quot; is more complex than the first two movies, and that may not be fully appreciated by younger kids or casual fans of the &quot;Potter&quot; film series, but those who prefer complex plots will appreciate better this movie. &quot;Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban&quot; is the best film of the series so far.	4.0	THE MOST COMPLEX &quot;HARRY POTTER&quot; MOVIE SO FAR.	2004-08-05	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1LMBOI3T91P87	Allan M. Lees	Despite coaxing some superior acting out of Daniel Radcliff (Harry), the new director's take on the series lacks consistency and charm. Every new director wants to make a change, but in this case the changes have amounted to stripping the richness from the movie and reducing it to a rather bleak (and simplistic) format.  There is almost no Hogwarts background, the acting from the other main characters is trite and sneering, and overall I was left wondering why on earth Warner Brothers chose Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n to direct the movie. Change for the sake of it is pointless.  The new Dumbledore seems to have decided to stress the first four letters of his name, and the stock villain Draco Malfoy has transformed here into a stupid leering simpleton. The result is that there's no dramatic tension of any kind.  Although everyone seems to have raved about the results, this reviewer found it flat, badly-paced, lacking in charm and frankly not worth seeing a second time.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2V40DTEZLBNKD	Allison Kalman	"All the negative reviews of this movie are so clearly from fans of the book unable to seperate the film from the movie.If you are huge fan of the books and cannot come into this film and view it as its own creation, you will be disappointed. The Harry Potter books are way to large and sprawling to make a good movie if directly translated. Film and books are different mediums with different strengths. All the little details that endear the books to their fans would be nothing but distractions if put into the film. And certain things that work in the storyline were left out entirely, saved for later movies (as with the fans biggest complaint, the ommission of Harry learning the origins of the mauraders map will simply be saved for a time when it will work better in the movie), or moved around.But who cares? This is an amazing movie on its own. It only makes me with that Alfonso Cuaran had 1. done the first two films and 2. agreed to continue on in the next film. He is the first director of this series to insist that things could not be ""too"" faithful, and be willing to change it around for the integrity of the movie. JK Rowlings herself has said that she liked this film, so fans should stop complaining as if he is ""ruining the series."" The direction is beautiful. The change of setting perfect. Few things were added, but those that were (like the clocktower) work perfectly with the themes running through this film.At times, the film seems a bit rushed, as even with the cuts taken it is still a large book to condense to this amount of time. Perhaps as the series goes on the directors will do what Peter Jackson has done, and offer extended editions, allowing fans to feel satisfied, as well as giving the directors the liberty to cut favorite scenes when they really are making the film too long and disjointed.Either way, this is a masterpiece of filmmaking. Beyond the direction, the acting has improved drasticly. Cuaran is taking advantage of the kids age and forcing them to really push their craft. Hopefully, he will stay involved in the future versions of the series and the new directors will be inspired by this brilliant new direction."	4.0	The first of the films to really stand on its own	2004-09-09	6	2	4

Things have to be changed in order to work, and some things are inevitably lost in the transition.That said, it's the best one yet.  The first two movies were mediocre partly because they tried to follow the books too closely and brought nothing to the story- why would you watch a second-rate edited version of events when you can read the brilliant original?Azkaban was darker, funnier, and more believable.  The changes made to the storyline didn't feel forced or unnatural.  What won me over were the details; seeing the characters out of uniform or goofing off with magic animal crackers...they're kids at a magic school, but they're still kids.  The acting was excellent all-round.I can't see Phoenix making the jump to the big screen successfully: they'd have to cut it down a lot or make two films.

Many critical parts in the movie were too short if not left out entirely. Great new cast members (Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon) compensate for this rushed movie. On a positive note the actors have grown into their parts and now that they have been introduced in the first two movies, we get to know them on a deeper level. We see more emotion in this movie.

WB's claims that the producers felt the theatrical version wasn't in need of re-editing is obviously nothing but an excuse.  While I heartily recomend the first two Ultimate Editions, I would advise skipping over #3 and #4 and buy the less expensive Blu-ray versions (which gives you the same movie experience for 1/3 the price), unless you are a compulsive collector.

Black has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban, which is supposed to be impossible to do.  The movie doesn't explain how Black escaped from Azkaban.  Harry goes back to Hogwarts, where he faints when a Dementor is near.  A Dementor is a guard of Azkaban, and they suck all of the happiness from you.  Harry, Ron and Hermonie discover that Sirius Black did not kill any of the people he was accused of killing.  Nor is Black a follower of Voldemort.

He really taps into the growing talent of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint pushing them to even more emotional and dramatic acting.  Now the bad:  this was a very poor adpatation of Rowling's book.  One does not expect a word for word re-creation of the novel, but a better job than this choppy version would have been nice.  Azkaban was not one of the larger books so one has to wonder what they'll do with the door-stop size novels that follow.  Of course, the effects are great, especially Buckbeak. I also thought Michael Gambon did an excellent job stepping into the shoes of Richard Harris.  Gambon's Dumbledore is different, but keeps much of the loveable wickedness from the novels.  The same cannot be said of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and David Thewlis as Remus Lupin.  Their performances were weak and lacked much of the passion from the novels.  Of course, if you're a Harry Potter fan, this may make no difference.  Either way, it is a good film on its own merits.	3.0	Poor Adaptation	2004-11-26	8	3	5

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2PCT57MWSAGX2	Amazon Customer	"When the trailer of this movie came out on the internet, I can't wait to see it...but after I saw it, I was disappointed. Many of my friends are disappointed too after watching the trailer. Why was I disappointed? Well, first of all, you know the trailer shows Sirius Black locked up at the tower, the Sirius Black is like, not really the right Sirius Black the cast-caller should have picked. He is not this type of really handsome man that the real Sirius Black should have been. Then when the movie came out, I went to see it with my friend. I was really excited because afterall the first two movies were pretty good and that maybe the trailer is different from the movie. But it turns out that the movie is like a completely different story from the book, which is not that good. The screen writer Steven or the new director Alfro or something like that changed the whole scenes into different ones to make the movie ended up the same way the book have ended. The whole movie tells the same thing as the book does, but not as clear because the actors tells these stuff at different places. There isn't the Qudditchs Cup like there is one at the book. There is no reason why Gryffindor played another (which is Hufflepuff)team, even though it showed that the Slytherin seeker, Malfoy is like have a so-called broken arm...but couple of scenes later, it just happened to be the qudditch scene and it wasn't playing against Slytherin, so people who watched the movie and haven't read the books are like, ""Oh, so each year Gryffindor team plays a different team."" which is not true. The whole movie's scenes are just like, different from the book scenes and yet, it does shows the same plot and stuff, but like I have said, not as clear as it should have been. At least the first two movies have mostly every scenes from the book, but this one doesn't have a single chapter of the book unchanged. Most of the people have read the book before watching the movie, like me, so they understand what the movie is trying to say, but the people who has never read the books would ask many questions on, ""How did this make that happen?"" or ""Why did Harry fell off his broom?"" or ""Why is Harry afraid of the dementors?""

An epilogue with Wormtail roaming the forests of Albania in search of Voldemort's lingering shadow, thereby fufilling Professor Trelawney's prophecy, would have served nicely as an ending.6) In the film, Wormtail is a bloated toad; in the novels, he is a wasted, thin, paranoid wreck of a wizard.7) For all its length, the film seems ""rushed"".8) Machines do not function at Hogwarts because of all the magical interference; yet Professor Lupin is able to play a phonograph with no difficulty.9) Ginny Weasley does not appear in the film at all.10) Ghostly knights on horseback barrel through the castle repeatedly; while the Bloody Baron, Headless Nick, and Peeves are nowhere to be seen."	3.0	These are the Shortcomings of Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-11-23	17	5	12

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ZPW3KVCAQYXM	Amazon Customer	The more I watch this film, the more I enjoy it. When I saw it in theaters, I loved it, but I felt like it moved very fast... Too fast, in fact, during certain important scenes. The exclusion of certain facts from the books is being overblown, as if a whole twist was left out of the movie, which is a bunch of hyperbole. I too think including the bit about the Marauder's Map wouldn't have taken very long, but it's just more information to pack into an already packed film. Another thing that is being overblown is the reaction to the way the movie introduces the Firebolt. No one should be this emotionally attached to an inanimate object.Prisoner of Azkaban does an infinitely better job than its predecessors at portraying the emotion between characters, and there are no better examples than the scenes between Harry and Lupin. The acting is complemented by the directing, which is complemented by the cinemetography and music (which is also substantially different in PoA than the first two movies).Michael Gambon, who replaces the late Richard Harris, does a fantastic job at playing the part of Dumbledore, which is much closer to the character in the book than Richard Harris' take on the headmaster was. The trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione is exponentially better. I think this is partially due to the fact that Steve Kolves has gotten better with porting the dialogue over. In the first two films, there were sequences where characters said very blunt things to help explain what was happening on screen; things that were made obvious enough just by the visuals. This only happens once in Prisoner of Azkaban by my count.I'm thankful Alfonso was at the helm of PoA. He took the films in exactly the right direction, and which a great amount of style. There are a ton of little camera tricks, large sweeping angles, complicated stretches of direction, simple but sensible shots, and a lot of artful editing. Add to that much improved acting and a better sense of magic to the surroundings, and you've got yourself a much successful adaptation.	5.0	Purists might be disappointed by some aspects	2004-11-30	9	9	0

The movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, is a dreadful flop.  It seems as they get older Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are growing out of the cherubic charm that endeared them to us, especially in the first movie.  There efforts in THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN bordered on grade school  amateurism and silliness!And don't get me started on Michael Gambon as a replacement for the immortal Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore.  I kept hoping that a headless horseman from SLEEPY HOLLOW ( a movie that better fit Gambon's personality and acting abilities) would appear and put an end to his pathetic nonsense.The writing and directing were especially weak. Where was Chris Columbus when we needed him?There were, however, a few bright stars.  The hippogriff, Buckbeak, was masterfully rendered.  And Gary Oldman, not surprisingly given his wonderful acting abilities, came through in spades as Sirius Black, the Prisoner of Azkaban. I given one star for him and one for Buckbeak.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A321VZSHHH8UV3	"Amazon Customer ""Rebecca Padgett"""	I really liked this movie and felt the actors have really matured in this darker installment.  I understand they couldn't possibly put every last detail of the book into the movie, like when Harry browsed and hung around the wizard shops for a week before school started, but there were some important key moments missing that I think hurt a little. As I have a huge crush on Alan Rickman, I wish the movie had more of Snape's parts from the book.  One of my favorite parts in the book is when Snape tries to make the mauraders map work and he gets a bunch of insults instead and Harry starts yelling at Snape in the same scene.  They took a lot out of that scene for the movie and I was a bit dissapointed as with some other things missing that I wished had been in the movie.  However, I can't complain too much, because I did have an excellent time in the theater and I'll be just like any other crazy fan waiting impatiently for my copy.  I do worry however about J.K. Rowlings books getting longer and longer (which I love),but does that mean the movies in the future will be more and more choppy so that they can make them about an hour and a half long?  I think the readers have matured along with the characters and I think we're all ready for longer movies.  Not that they have to be four hours long or anything (because my butt will fall asleep), but maybe a little longer to get some key points across.  Cuaron did an excellent job and my all time favorite scene where Harry finds out that he's the one who saves them and not his father, was executed beautifully on screen.

I actually jumped a centimetre off my chair at one point, but I can't remember when.The Dementors were freaking cool, Buckbeak looked great, and the quidditch scene was amazing.The Acting from the main three has improved, and although there wasn't much development of their characters, apart from the odd tantrum, I still thought they did a good job and am hoping for even more improvement in the future. Then of course there's the regulars, such as snape, and the newbies, like black and lupin. These characters are portrayed perfectly.There were a few things that I didn't really like. Draco and Ron were being a little too wimpy considering their character development in later books. Ron's supposed to lack confidence, but he isn't supposed to be wimpy. Instead of standing up for Hermine when Snape calls her an ""insufferable know-it-all"", he agrees, the twit!No explanation of the maurauders was another thing. Even though i already knew, I wanted them to say it, it would have only taken a few seconds and made a whole load of difference in understanding the film for those who hadn't read the books. Most importantly, the Shreiking Shack scene, the climax of the year's events, was far too rushed through and the character of Pettigrew wasn't built on like in the books so you could get to hate him. It was very much:'""YOU KILLED MY FATHER!"" ""No, he did."" ""What, the rat?"" *Whoosh*""Whoa, Rat-man!"" *Bit of grovelling by rat-man as he acts rat-ish* *Untimely Wolf transformation* ""Uh oh, Rat boy gone.""'We don't get a sense of how pathetic he is cause he's barely there for five minutes.

Having said that ""Prisioner of Azkaban"" is my favorite of the four Harry Potter movies.The plotline is very wonderfully done; It has a very frightening sense of immediatacy that kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. The intricate way each part of the plot is laid out, waiting for the viewer to discover it's place in the grand scheme of the movie is fantastic, dark, but with an intellgence behind it to explain why it is what it is. Nothing about the story is sacrified for the sake of attracing younger viewers.Also adding to it's likability is that Harry, Ron and Hermonie are no longer young children, but adolescants, still young and ackward at moments, but adapting more to their roles as wizards. Especially liked was the growth of Hermonie. Up until this movie, she seemed to play a major role in simply foiling Ron and Harry's plans with her constant sense of logic. In ""Azkaban"" she has aged and matured, taking away her childish know-it-all-ism, and replacing it with wit and intelligence. Also loved is the stage of ackwardness that accompaines anyone as they become a teenager - including all the confusion and first crushes/loves (Ron and Hermoine, Harry and Hermonie). It's very refreshing to watch characters grow up in such a real way.I give this movie a wonderful rating, it is a fantastic ride worth taking."	5.0	a thrilling, intricate story..	2007-02-02	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AFL7QEQTHUEXN	amazonker	"The third installment of the Harry Potter films was ready for a new director, and Alfonso Cuaron seemed a likely choice.  Chris Columbus was admirable in his fidelity to the plot of the first two books, but as Harry becomes a teenager and faces a more complex life, Columbus's candy-coated style is no longer appropriate.  So it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the ""darker"" style that Cuaron promised.In some respects I was not disappointed.  Cuaron's interpretation of Harry's world is defined by inscrutable shadows and colored in misty greens and greys, rather than red-and-gold tapestry of movies one and two.  This new palette is more natural, and in keeping with that, far more of the movie takes place out of doors.  Cuaron gives Hogwarts a greater sense of age as well, making a crumbling courtyard and rickety bridge over a gorge central to many scenes.  These locations, as well as the huge pendulum in the entry hall and clock face that Harry sits inside at one point, are a nicely subtle way to weave in the movie's (and book's) theme of time and how the past can't ever be completely undone.Cuaron handles some scenes very well, especially brief, telling gestures or moments that provide character definition, such as the bit where Hermione grabs Ron's hand which made it into the trailer, and another where the two of them have an awkward conversation outside the Shrieking Shack.  Other highlights include Harry and his dorm-mates up late eating candy that makes them impersonate animals (touchingly shows how very teenage they are); and a moment when Sirius, trying desperately to hold Lupin back from his change to werewolf, places his hand over Lupin's chest and says ""You live in this heart!"" - which is made all the more poignant because we know he can't stop the transformation.Some plot points have been sacrificed in order to keep the film to a manageable length.  Most of the time this works, as when Harry meets with Snape and Lupin in a beautifully lit nighttime corridor, precipitating the handover of the Marauder's Map and Lupin's realization that Peter Pettigrew lives; or when Harry receives the Firebolt from Sirius at a different point in the movie than in the book.  There were, however, two changes which seemed inexplicable to me.  First, the patronus charm is made into a shield of light rather than an animal which charges down the dementors.  This eliminates Harry's discovery of his father within himself through his stag patronus (he does see a stag of light when he rescues himself at the lakeside, but when we see him from the perspective of rescuer there is no stag, and this is never explained).  Similarly, even though Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are named on the Marauder's Map, the nicknames and their relationship to Lupin, Pettigrew, Sirius, and James Potter is never explained.  It would have taken only a few more minutes to add that explosition, which would have strengthened Harry's cinematic connections to his father tremendously.All in all, I think it's possible that the viewers who enjoy this film the most will be those who haven't read the book.  As someone who is very familiar with the Harry Potter book series, I kept finding myself hung up on the changes to the story (and just how much depth was lost) even as I enjoyed the beautiful cinemetography and deft handling of characters' relationships.  My hope is that whoever directs film four is able to take some of Cuaron's artistic sensibilities and combine them with Columbus's sense of wonder and attention to plot detail.  That would truly do Harry justice."	4.0	A grownup-oriented review for those who have read the book	2004-06-07	378	319	59

The one thing that pisses me off are the anti-Potter group. Not the religous, tight-asses of the world (cause really- who cares what they want or say??), but more like the ones who have decided it is too popular to be viewed by their discriminating pallet. I have a couple of friends who refuse to view or read any of Potter because it has gotten such hype! Remember the days of crap like Tron or Conan the Badly Written & Funded? Us sci-fi and fantasy people better embrace huge hits like Potter and LOTR because it proves to the money backers that we do want to see something other than drama and comedy. We do want it all- fantasy and adventure and laughs and drama - all on some strange planet or place or timeline. So let them make ANOTHER freakin' war movie and another boo hoo where everyone is dieing and ain't it sad pile of rubish. Even let them make their fluffy crap about cute woman who have it all and aren't they so clever- but please don't stop with the real stuff! We must support Dances With Wolves, Braveheart, Buffy, Angel, Potter, LOTR, Matrix and other such oddballs- let them know we want a different view and we want them to take risks. Surprise us. And please- by all that is holy- stop with the freakin' remakes. Do we really need another vomitous Cinderella story???

It struck me as completely lazy and nonchalant.  The director seemed to choose settings for scenes based on what was easy and convenient, instead of what was exciting.  And what happened to the costumes?!  The wizard robes were all abandoned for ordinary modern clothes!  Cummon...  Did he think we wouldn't notice?  And the acting suffered.  Everyone seemed to be playing along with the ""this is easy because we're cool, we don't have to try"" work ethic of the director.  In the end, there was very little sense of atmosphere in this movie.And here's the worst part:  the dramatic ending (which was one of the best literary endings ever) was totally and utterly botched.  It didn't even make SENSE!  My husband, who hadn't read the book, left the theater completely confused.  He didn't even know if the plot's major character was a good-guy or a bad-guy!!!  I knew, as I watched it, that he wouldn't know, because they completely skipped over the explanation that puts all the pieces together.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KHOIFBQYD5FH	Amy	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", released in theatres in June 2004 and on DVD/VHS in November of the same year is, simply put, the best of the series thus far.  Alfonso Curon expertly guides the characters towards maturity while simultaneously preparing Harry's psyche for the realization in Book/Film 4 that the magical world of Hogwarts is more than a fantasy land of child's play, it, like the real world, possesses very real, very mortal dangers.  Fans of the first two films may, as many of their compatriots, balk at the abrupt change between Curon's gritty-fantastic world and his predecessors softer, child-safe world that has been displayed in excruciatingly slow detail for the past two feature films just as many fans of the novel series balked at the death of Cedric Diggory in Book 4 and Harry's irritating but age-appropriate mood swings in Book 5.  Progress, as they say, is good- and natural.Fans who also demand that the movies regurgitate every line and scene from the book series will likewise be disappointed; many popular (but not key- come on people, there is a difference) scenes are missing and many fresh (and wonderful) scenes have been added.  The additional scenes add color and ""reality"" to the normal parts of Harry's extraordinary life while the missing scenes do not, overall, detract.  The reshuffling of the Firebolt scene does, admittedly, allow for a messy conclusion and the CGI werewolf is atrocious but neither flub is so great so as to warrant docking stars/ratings.  A reported additional 20 minutes of footage will be included in the DVD which may soothe the ruffled feathers of some fans but those who are entirely unable to cope with the shift in directors and condensation of the books (under JKR's guidance, mind) should not only not purchase this product, they shouldn't bother with any of the future films either."	5.0	Finally, An HP Film That Captures The Heart of the Series!	2004-09-14	18	9	9

The acting was better in this film, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron were as compelling as ever.There was an incredible amount of action in this film, and the computer graphics were amazing. I was especially impressed with the handling of the Dementors. I was afraid they would look like a rip off of the Black Riders from Lord of the Rings, but they took on a life of their own.The story was told in a very understandable way. Anyone who has read the book knows that it's pretty complicated. The writers managed to work in enough of the back story so that a friend of mine, who has never read the book, still had no trouble following the action in this film.The down side:I was terribly disappointed in the new Dumbledore. Michael Gambon didn't command the same respect and put forth the same authority that Richard Harris did. I think it's mostly to do with a dramatic change in Dumbledore's costume and demeanor.There were more changes than I really expected. Some little details were thrown in that made me cringe. For example: a shrunken head with a Jamaican accent that helped navigate the Knight Bus. Why???While the film was entertaining overall, it seems that Cuaron didn't have the same command of the material that Chris Columbus did. I only hope that Columbus takes more of an active role in the making of The Goblet of Fire.As usual, practice caution when taking young children to see this film. It's much scarier than either of the previous films.	4.0	Entertaining with notable changes	2004-06-11	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3HCN8KBB9PD8O	Andrea	"As a huge fan of the books, I must admit, I HATED the first two movies. Chris Columbus sloppily put together the events he felt were necessary, even though most of them did nothing to advance the plot. He was too busy worrying about doing a literal adaptation that he forgot to do a FAITHFUL one. What's the difference? Well, he got almost all of the events in the movies, but none of the character development or any of the rich spirit from Rowling's books. The acting from the kids was all very stiff, and the world itself had a very bubble gum feel to it. The magic of the books is that you as a reader feel like Hogwarts could be a real place. It's the way the magical world is woven into our own world. Well, I'm happy to say that Alfonso Cuaron's beautiful Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best film of the summer so far, and is the first Harry Potter film that captures the true spirit and essence of JK Rowling's marvelous series. What's better? Well, in a word: Everything. Where to begin?-The acting from the kids has improved tenfold. For the first time, I truly believed that these 3 are best friends, as they seem very comfortable with each other. They also seem much more comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter this time, and seems much less like a spectator in his own movie. He seems like a very real teenager. Emma Watson, the only one of the 3 that I liked in the first two, shows incredible screen presence this time. When she's on the screen, she's the star of the movie. Rupert Grint serves very well as Ron. The new cast members are great. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black, and David Thewlis, whom I must admit I was skeptical of when I heard of his casting, played Lupin, a very touching mentor figure for Harry, beautifully. Emma Thompson is also quite funny as Professor Trelawney. There's also more of Alan Rickman's brilliant portrayal of Professor Snape, which is always a good thing.The look of the film may be what is most improved. In changing the location to Scotland, Cuaron has breathed new life into Hogwarts. As he demonstrated in Y Tu Mama Tambien, he really knows how to evoke the greatest sense of wonder out of nature and his surroundings, and boy, does it show here. Hogwarts seemed more like this isolated magical place, but also more real at the same time. Which brings me to the cinematographer Cuaron brought on board. Michael Seresin gave this film a bolder, darker, grittier new look. As a result, again, everything seems more tangible, which makes the story all the more magical.The visual effects have also improved greatly. The dementors are pretty terrifying, and there's a very thrilling quidditch sequence in which Harry is being chased in the sky by them, in the rain, which turns to ice when the dementors are near and proceeds to cut Harry's face as he flies through it. (SPOILER AHEAD) I was also very happy with the werewolf. It looked exactly like a drawing Professor Snape presented to the class, and it didn't look like the cliched Hollywood werewolf. It looked more like what a half-man, half-wolf creature should look like. But the most beautiful sequence of the movie BY FAR is Harry's first ride on Buckbeak, the hippogriff. It was shot beautifully, and as John Williams's music swells and Daniel Radcliffe evokes a very genuine crow of glee, you can't help but feel like you, too, are riding this magnificent creature and get swept up into Harry's thrilling sense of freedom. The scene gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. It's easily one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen, and it doesn't involve any massive CGI armies coming to the rescue or massive elephants (I love Lord of the Rings, but this sequence was so much more simple, but just as beautiful and incredibly graceful).I've been reading some pretty negative reviews of this film, and it makes me sad. Many of the die-hard fans don't understand that books and film are two TOTALLY different mediums, and to compare the two is just foolish. They took A LOT out from the book for this movie. But as a moviegoer looking at the movie as being totally separate from the book, I didn't miss any of it. As a film, this isn't just a great Potter flick, it's a great film. Period. Not once did I get the feeling that I was watching a Columbus ""kiddie flick,"" but more like something ANYONE can enjoy. Adults won't be checking their watches on this one. Steve Kloves's screenplay is still flawed like his screenplays for the other two were, but Alfonso Cuaron told him to be less literal on this one, and focus on the main theme of a boy becoming a teenager and confronting his inner demons. Kloves did that, and his screenplay is much tighter this time around. There's no scenes from the book that were absolutely pointless in the movie (like the ""Norbert the Dragon"" scene from Sorcerer's Stone or the ""Knockturn Alley"" scene in Chamber of Secrets). Everything you see is there to forward the plot. The result of all of this change is a far superior film to the first two. As a film student, I can really admire this film from a technical standpoint, which is something I thought I would never get a chance to say about a Potter film. It's much more emotionally satisfying and still retains a great sense of fear and fun. Not only is this a great stand-alone film, but it's a great work of art. Thank you, Alfonso Cuaron, and I hope you return to direct Order of the Phoenix!"	5.0	Cuaron has saved this franchise!!	2004-06-12	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A258YXF3J05ML9	Andrea Kaelin	I am a devoted Harry Potter book fan who has thusfar enjoyed the WB attempts at recreating the magical realm of Rowling. The first two films were very well cast and executed by Chris Columbus and crew, but Prisoner of Azkaban was a big disappointment.1) It is a shame about Richard Harris (Dumbledore), and replacement Michael Gambon just didn't carry the role. In HP3, Dumbledore plays a larger portion of the plot than in HP1 or HP2 - but the bumbling idiot facade just didn't go over well in my opinion, especially in scenes where he interacted with the kids.2) Director Cuaron cleaved much of the plot(understandably, since you can't market a 6 hour film, though we Potter fans wouldn't mind it being so long), but it left much to be desired in the rearrangement of the events that rushes the viewer initially with the action of Aunt Marge's visit, and then slowly drags through the rest of the streamlined plot - ending with sipmle pleasure of riding the Firebolt - not resolution of truth and conflict.3) The empty places in dialogue - Cuaron leaves artistic expression to substitute explanation - and it makes it difficult for non-HP readers to grasp the entirety of the scenes. Specifically, when Hermione walks out of Divination without a word, and the chirping bird gets eliminated by the Whomping Willow. Dark is ok - but explain it, sometimes only a few seconds more of dialogue were needed to complete the scene.4) The humor was slapstick and lackluster. JK Rowling incorporated hilarious dialogue in her books - and so much of it would have been very easy to slip into the comparable scenes of Cuaron, snide, intelligent humor. Even attempts at sarcastic humor came off poorly.5) Sorry - but that's totally not what I perceived as a werewolf - perhaps something a little hairier?6) Granted that the kids were seemingly more relaxed in their characters, but did they abolish the uniform rule? Sloppy looking costuming, loose ties, untucked shirts, etc, just looked bad.As for the DVD -1) What happened to the cardboard box of the first two releases on DVD? Now its the cheaper, plastic casing. Yuck.2) Those 5 measly deleted scenes were hugely disappointing - you mean to tell me that ONLY 5 scenes in the WHOLE 2.5 hour movie were cut?3) Interviews were somewhat empty, and although nice to have, but the whole talking shrunken head thing was stupid. I don't even like the silly thing in the main menu - of all the scenes to make into the main menu - why that one? It was funny for the few scenes on the bus, and then, that should have been it with the talking head.Its a shame, because it looked like Warner Bros was trying desperately to include the 12 and under crowd in the marketing, and it just alienated the older potter fans. This is not a children's movie - and I think that if you aren't old enough to read and understand the books, that you shouldn't be the marketing target of this movie. Thusly, the plot shouldn't be watered down for the sake of the young'uns.Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favorite book, and I'll be going to see the 4th movie in 2005, but lets hope that the new director, Mike Newell can pull it off better than Cuaron - and let Cuaron get away from the Harry Potter series and artistically master something that needs the help, rather than strip a good quality plot down to bare bones.	2.0	Disappointed with HP PoA	2004-11-28	12	7	5

What a shocker! It did not match my expectations. It was almost as if this movie belonged to someone else instead of the Harry Potter series. However, I still liked it. Dan proves his valor yet again. Along with Rupert and Emma. Unlike the others, this one did not show enough detail. I know that they can't afford to give you too much because of its length. But, COME ON! They just zipped through each scene excepting you to understand what was going on. It was an if they took the most important chunk out of the movie that was essential, according to the book. And, what about their uniforms. Only the teachers were wearing theirs. It's almost like your going against the story itself! How do you know their Hogwarts students? I think the producer should give up now while he has the chance! I did not like how he handled things. The other two were carefully drawn out. You knew what was going on and why. It was nice to see David Thewlis as the good guy for once. The new Dumbledore didn't amaze me ether. He wasn't as lighthearted as the other one, or as talented. Although, he should have had a bigger part. But, the old one was still better. I miss Richard Harris!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The ending was still cute. All in all, it was still a good movie. Worth a one time showing.

The second movie flagged, and was limp and burdened by details. This movie sets a tone that the rest will need -- fast-paced, necessary ellisions, a movie that feels like a movie, not a book on screen. The pacing is excellent, the effects great, and you're whisked along from beginning to end. Much better acting, and Lupin is great.

Not only did he fill them, but he has delivered a fantastic film that is not only as good as the previous two, but surpasses them.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets immensely. I just happened to enjoy Prisoner of Azkaban immensely-er. The acting continues to get better and better, as Daniel Radcliffe turns in a very good performance. The movie stays true to the book, without repeating it exactly. It's the same, and fresh at the same time.The SFX team nailed the dementors. They really provided the most terrifying effect they could without actually coming off the screen and sucking happiness out of the audience.And then, the final sequence with the time-turner was executed to perfection. Buckbeak was awesome, Gary Oldman was casted perfectly. Lupin was played well, too.I just can't say enough good things about this film.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. Harry and his friends spend their third year learning how to handle a half-horse half-eagle Hippogriff, repel shape-shifting Boggarts and master the art of Divination. They also visit the wizarding village of Hogsmeade and the Shrieking Shack, which is considered the most haunted building in Britain. In addition to these new experiences, Harry must overcome the threats of the soul-sucking Dementors, outsmart a dangerous werewolf and finally deal with the truth about Sirius Black and his relationship to Harry and his parents. With his best friends, reprised in their original roles, Harry masters advanced magic, crosses the barriers of time and changes the course of more than one life. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron and based on British author J.K. Rowling 's third book, this wondrous spellbinder soars with laughs, and the kind of breathless surprise only found in a Harry Potter adventure.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"There were many changes to the Harry Potter franchise for the third film in the series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and they didn't just involve the story and the characters.  Alfonso Cuaron replaced Chris Columbus as director, and he brought with him a much darker tone to the films.  While every Harry Potter book has been dark, the level of darkness increases with each subsequent novel, so it only makes sense.  However, Cuaron overhauled the entire look of the film in order to make it scarier and darker.  Gone are the brilliant golden shades from the first two films.  In this one, an icy silver tone is used throughout the movie (even the Warner Bros. logo and the title are a cold silver as opposed to the bright gold used in Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets).  It is very rare to see a clear blue sky in this movie; a lot of scenes take place at night or during a very cloudy/rainy day.  Even the quidditch match occurs during a nasty rain storm.In Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the state of the wizarding world is in a panic.  A man named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Wizards' Prison, which, like Alcatraz, was viewed to be impossible to escape from.  Now Black is on the loose, and it is widely believed that he is going to seek out and kill Harry Potter.  Black was in Azkaban because of his loyalties to the Dark Lord Voldemort, and speculation is that he sees Harry standing in the way of Voldemort's return.Making matters worse for Harry is that the Dementors, which are the guards at Azkaban, have been stationed at Hogwarts to ""keep it safe"".  Dementors are very nasty creatures (which were probably once in the service of Voldemort) that feed on happy thoughts, leaving people temporarily paralyzed with unhappy memories.  Since Harry has had more than his fair share of unhappy memories (his parents' deaths is at the top of the list), the Dementors cause him to pass out.This year, two new teachers are appointed.  Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) takes over the Care of Magical Creatures position while newcomer Remus J. Lupin (David Thewlis) becomes the new Defense Against Dark Arts professor.  Also, Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore and does a great job with the role.  Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) begin to take elective classes such as Care of Magical Creatures and Divination, which is taught by the kooky Professor Trelawny (Emma Thomas, who does a great job hamming up the role).  But as the children have fun in school, newspaper articles keep reporting that Black is getting closer and closer to Hogwarts.Even though MOST people know the ending before seeing this film because they have read the book (which I really reccomend), I am still not going to give it away.  I will say that the climax is amazing.  There are great twists, and in a sense, a double ending which, while hard to explain, makes perfect sense and is great to see.The special effects in this film are great, much improved over the first two films.  Buckbeak the hippogriff (a sort of cross between a horse and an eagle) looks beautiful and much more realistic than Fluffy in Sorceror's Stone or the basilisk in Chamber of Secrets.  The quidditch match also looks better in this movie, but then again, it's very short, and pretty much the only thing we see is Harry going after the snitch.Ironically, while Prisoner of Azkaban is the longest of the first three books, it's the shortest of the first three movies.  While some of the cuts that they made were necessary and made sense, I was surprised at a few of the things that they left out.  Mainly, I couldn't figure out why they didn't explain HOW Sirius escaped from Azkaban, or why they didn't reveal the identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, the creators of the Marauder's Map.  While the movie was very strong, these two details would have made things clearer to the audience as well as to Harry and his friends.The first two Harry Potter films were good, but I didn't find them to be anything special (unlike the books, which I love).  This one, however, was amazing.  Hopefully, the next film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, will be as good or better."	5.0	Have You Seen This Movie?	2005-07-25	3	1	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3TZQNYSL8SZFM	"Andrew ""rewster"""	"This movie is really a step up from the fairy tale looking first two movies. Obviously the first movie was a kids book and was therefore a very kiddy movie but with the second, Columbus made a frigtening ending into a hardly scary finale which focused more on action than the drama of the moment. Not so with cuaron. He has taken a much more physcologically and thmatically scary book and made a movie that is exactly that. The movie is much darker with even the hogwarts grounds looking older and less pristine. But what Cuaron does exceptionally well on top of the scariness is the humour. This movie (at points) is rip roaringly funny. I will not spoil it for future viewers but it is really great tounge and cheek humour added on to the humour from the book.But with all this praise why the minus one star you ask? Simple. This movie in every scene seems rushed. Although it is relatively lenghy at 2 hours 19 minutes with the longest book in the series this time should at least have 30 more minutes added on. Not that their were scenes missing much (except they never do explain how Serious Black escaped from Azkaban a really well written reason in the book) but each scene, I think, needs more time to grow and settle, Instead each scene ends pretty uprubtely (sorry cant spell it) and although it gets the point across I am still left dangling in that scene when they charge into the next one. With many movies reaching the 3 hour mark (Lord of the Rings the prime example here and each of these books is shorter than the POA) it is not terribly wrong to think these should also be that long. The reasons for this change according to Cuaron are that adults cant sit through movies even as long as the previous films. Personally, i think thats odd considering the millions who saw the film anyway. Besides these films should justly portray the books not bow to the whims of the sleepy adults who shouldnt be their in the first place if they cant stay awake.I suppose that the transition from book to film was harder this time with such a long book but the editing out of really important material seems odd considering how great cuaron directed the movie as a whole. Even plot questions brought up in the movie are not answered and any audience member must ask why they were not let in on the secret. For instance  a viewer may leave wondering ""where did the marauders map come from?"" ""How was ______ (sorry no spoilers here) responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents?"" Who the hell are Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs? What was the deal with trelawny going all wierd and saying stuff about the dark lord? How did people react to black escaping? etc... But the thing about these cuts is even watching the film i did not automatically see them until afterward. That is why i give this movie 4 stars. It is so enthralling and well done that differences from the book are not noticable. It is just a truly entertaining ride.This movie is a must see it has great acting (the three kids have really grown in their abilities and skills) and wonderful visual effects along with well thought out humor. Go see Harry Potter and stay for the credits they are quite ingenious."	4.0	Cuaron has taken this film well above the others	2004-06-13	1	1	0

Still a good movie, but disappointing because it missed the best emotional parts of the novel. The movie neglected to mention that Harry's father was one of the creators of the Maurader's Map, and the special feeling Harry had that when he used it he followed in his father's footsteps. It neglected to mention his father's animagus form, the stag, and in doing so never gave the audience the idea that the stag patronus really came from Harry's father. Harry claimed he thought it was his father, but we the audience had no reason to believe him.In the novel, the emotional high of his father's possible appearance was matched only by Harry's mixed sadness/pride he felt when the truth is revealed. Sadness that his father did not appear, and pride that the patronus, his strongest bit of magic in his young life, had taken his father's animagus form. That the movie failed to convey this is inexcusable; it is to this day Rowling's best writing.	3.0	missed the heart of the book	2004-12-29	7	7	0

It was the best movie in the Harry Potter trilogy. It was more than expectected. It was a little less serious than the last two Harry Potter movies. It had more humor as well, compared to the last two which severely lacked that prospect. The most beautifully shot scene was the hippogriff ride. This movie was amazing, and it was not boring. I actually enjoyed it more than the Lord of the rings trilogy (which is okay but is very long, and very boring.)Harry Potter 3 was a movie that lasted 2h 30min, but felt like it only lasted 10min and I was almost dissapointed that it ended. Though there were a few things that I can complain about. There were many things that were different from the book. For example the script, the order of certain events, and added items that weren't needed. For example one thing that did not follow the order of events was when Harry got the firebolt. He was supposed to get it in the middle of the year(or so), but instead he got it at the end. This action deleted many parts of the book...but it made it shorter and not so boring. But this does affect the order dramatically. That was my biggest complaint, the order was a bit sloppy...but it worked. It was not as strict or organized as the last movies, but my last comment still stands...the movie was fantastic. I give it 5 stars, considering the flaws were covered well. If you hadn't read the book then you will think this is the best movie ever. It was done well, and it deserves that rating.

Reyes	&quot;Boo-hoo, the director didn't put everything from the book in the movie!&quot;-SHUTUP! &quot;Stupid Alfonso Cuaron added a bunch of new stuff in the movie!&quot;-SHUTUP! &quot;I miss Chris Columbus' loyal direction of the last two films!&quot;-SHUTUP! Potter fans, if the producers had to be loyal to the book and stuff in every detail from &quot;Azkaban&quot; into the movie as you'd wish, then we'd end up with a four-hour plus movie with no pacing and character development, much like the last two films.So what if Cuaron made adjustments to suit the proper tone of the movie? What works in print may not translate well onscreen: that's why I think watching the first two movies were as much fun as listening to someone else reading the entire text in a long-winded fasion. Where was the sense of joy, surprise, and imagination from J.K. Rowling's books that was missing in Columbus' &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secretes&quot;? All I saw were overblown CGI effects, wooden acting and stoic storytelling. Cuaron actually had the courage to say no to this crap technique and allow his version of &quot;Azkaban&quot; to develop organically and let the film makers and actors some freedom to interpret the material. The end result is the first Harry Potter movie that actually feels like a movie, not a dragged adaptation that slavishly adheres to the original source. The actors now glow in their performances, in addition to a sense of wonder and suspense that was lacking in the last two films.Like Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, Cuaron serves the material nicely without sacrificing crative vision.And look, if you're still upset about the changes made in the movie from the novel, than read the novel instead! It's not like he brought every copy of &quot;Azkaban&quot; and burned them. Better yet, catch a Hayo Miyazaki movie and see what a real fantasy movie is! Than you'll see what heights the genre can take, and how thanks to Cuaron, the new Harry Potter movie can finally be compared to those works.	5.0	Alfonso Cuaron's &quot;Azkaban&quot; Rocks!	2004-07-20	12	5	7

But if you try to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban without a pretty thorough background, you'll be quite lost. Nevertheless, Potter fans will surely enjoy this latest frolic through the world of magic. All the elements are there, even if there is a twinge of disappointment and some of the real emotion lost to time constraints and making sure all the relevant plot twists were covered.The Prisoner of Azkaban begins the summer before the kids' third year at Hogwarts. And, as Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now a teenager, his poltergeist-like tendencies pop up as he accidentally blows up his aunt at the dinner table. When he flees to The Leaky Cauldron, instead of the reprimand he expects, he is greeted with a message of caution from the Minister of Magic (Robert Hardy). Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), madman, murderer, and betrayer of Harry's parents, is on the loose and out to kill him. Dementors, the soul-sucking, evil guardians of the wizard prison Azkaban, are sent to guard Hogwarts, despite Headmaster Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) protestations that dementors are no protectors at all. And several times, Harry is endangered by these beasts that are there, presumably, to keep him safe. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is well liked by the students, and helps Harry with some advance anti-dementor spells. Harry comes into possession of a couple new fun and useful magic toys and learns more about the people and mysteries surrounding his parents.Make no mistake about it; the plot of Prisoner of Azkaban is very complicated. You may want to bring a cheat sheet and some paper for note-taking. But don't keep your eyes off the screen for too long lest you miss a key plot detail or a funny character building moment. And these 3 young, but quickly growing actors, excel at these. Their performances carry the very real awkwardness and hyper-emotion of being 13 (and magic). 2 scenes in particular highlighted their diverse abilities. A distraught but tough Hermione (Emma Watson) knocks a sniveling Draco (Tom Felton) to the ground in a moment that is both frustrating and triumphant. The other shows the Gryffindor boys in a moment of male bonding as they huddle around a bag of sound-producing candies. A very ""boy will be boys"" scene while still quite original, I found it very endearing. Even Ron (Rupert Grint) is beginning to come into his own and filling out a bit, though he is still quite bumbling at times.The collaboration with director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (of Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n fame) was also engaging and productive. His occasional teetering on the edge of PG made plenty of amusing moments for adults and teens while going over the heads of the kids. It also made for convincing adolescent interactions. The supporting cast was also quite colorful. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is both scary and intense, with enough mystery in his rabid eyes to know that something serious (no pun intended) is going on behind them. Flighty Professor Trelawney is played to perfection by the hugely bespectacled Emma Thompson; Dawn French is perfect as the ""fat lady"" portrait; and Alan Rickman continues to be the quintessential unforgiving and slightly skeevy Professor Snape.While these recognizable and sincere characters keep the film very down to earth, magic continues to reign supreme in the world of Harry Potter. The screen is dominated by the awe of flying mythical animals, werewolf metamorphoses, and dark weightless dementors. If you happen to get lost in terms of the storyline, the atmosphere should be enough to keep you aloft. The music was subtle and complimentary and while Rowling's original story may be sentimental itself, the film never took it any farther over the top.Unlike the first 2 installments, which are really whole stories unto themselves, Prisoner of Azkaban merely begins the tale of Harry's journey into adulthood, and the inevitable and continuous battles he must fight for the rest of the series. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban introduces a multitude of elements that will reappear in the films to come. It is here that the series begins to take on its true weight. It also leaves you wanting more. Once you've seen Prisoner of Azkaban you've become invested in seeing it through. For any Harry Potter fan it's a must see, but if you're not already interested, it might be a slightly confusing romp through the magic of special effects.- Alley Hector"	3.0	about this movie....	2004-06-05	1	0	1

Having read all the books, I was able to follow the schizophrenic scene hopping without getting confused.  However, so much was left out that the movie just seemed like a rather flat melange of Harry Potter mini-sketches.  Furthermore, there was an unfinished quality to it (definitely Cuaron's singular style) that just didn't quite work.  While there were some great special effects and there's no doubt as to the talents of the young stars, it just seems kind of sad that a book as wonderful as this had to be reduced to such a mediocre adaptation.

But first, for those interested in the movie, it is great - 5 stars.I give the DVD 2 stars because of the Johnny Vaughan. I have rarely ever seen such awful interviews. Just one example: unbelievably, one of the main questions for almost every actor is ""how many girls"" (he even uses the offensive term ""birds""...) have you been able to seduce thanks to your fame from the HP films. Even when the boy who plays the Dursley kid states early on that no one recognizes him in the street, Vaughan still asks (maybe even twice if I'm not mistaken) the same stupid, sexist question. (The pathetic attempts at humour using the Shrunken Head are also incredibly annoying.) What a lost opportunity.This is of course no reason not to by the DVD, but Warner Brothers should be embarrassed."	2.0	Excellent film, Fun extras, Horrid interviewer	2005-08-28	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3OT6IQ0YHGDCB	"ANT ""azraelart"""	"I was fortunate enough to catch the midnight showing the morning it was released, and coming so close on the heels of my finishing the book, it was a great contrast to what I had just read.  I usually try to watch films as if there was no book, as movies are meant to stand alone.  This film, though a wonderfully entertaining offering seemed to be trying too hard to do too much.  Fortunately, it does not fall flat because of it.What makes a good movie?  Typically, the best indicators are acting, plot, writing, flow, and directing.  As for the acting, the kids are growing up nicely and becoming better and better at their roles.  Granted, Harry (Radcliffe) gets most of the screen time, so there is not as much room for development of the others.  It was a little lopsided, but so many characters were treated, it was nearly impossible to give anyone a long look.  Still, the usual gang holds up well and the new Dumbledore (Gambon) does a great job of playing the part.The plot, lifted from the book of course, is played out nicely, but again when one tries to cram a 435 page book into a two hour nineteen minute movie, there will be a lot left out.  If this is a sticking point with you, be ready to ask yourself, ""Where did that part go?""  Again, as a stand-alone movie, the plot constantly flows and moves at a rather heady pace, but that can be a bit of a problem sometimes.  It seems as if they still tried to cram as much into some smaller spaces in order to speed things along.  It does flow nicely, though, and smaller audience members will not be falling asleep; they will be enthralled.The writing avoids the clich&eacute; and the over-used, while staying true to the book.  Again, it seems sometimes (very rarely) that it is forced and sped through to move the plot faster along, but not enough to be a hinderance.  Cute, funny, serious, and well-spoken would be apt to describe it.I don't think I need to mention the flow again, as I have touched on it numerous times already, but keep in mind that it will be fast-paced, even if it seems like it's going slow.  Every scene is an advancement of the book and it never lags behind.The directing is solid, the situations well played out.  Hogwarts changed it's appearance again, more so than ever before, but it can be overlooked for the sake of a new artistic license.  Even the Whomping Willow gets a a makeover.  The costumes, classrooms, and general layout remain the same, however.  The movie ends on a rather strange note, though.  It's not quite from the book per se, but again if someone were to make a movie strictly sticking to the novel, it would be about double in length.  For those who are purists to Rowling's works, you might be slightly disappointed, but not enough so to take away from your enjoyment of this film.  If you can accept a few changes for the sake of the medium, then you will have no problems seeing beyond what was omitted and enjoying the film for what it is.Just as a disclaimer, for parents of smaller children, like the book this movie is a bit more violent than the first two.  There are heavy themes of death and vengeance, plus some minor foul language (nothing you can't say on the air, mind you).Overall, despite the attempts to cram everything in, a superb movie with a lot of heart and an incredible ride to boot.  This one is sure to be one of the better summer movies this year.  Wonderfully acting all around and a great story to dig into!  Enjoy!"	4.0	Fantastic, but a little too crammed	2004-06-04	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A35QJ0WSNQVQEU	A reader	It's only fitting.  Prisoner of Azkaban was such a great book, so much better than the first two, so it's appropriate that we get such a great movie out of it.  The first two movies were admirable in their devotion to the story, but they sometimes they tried so hard to include every line from the books that they sucked the magic out of the story.Cuaron's touch is brilliant.  There are so many brief moments that make the movie so great, like Harry's ride on Buckbeak, one calming moment of pure joy.  Or the shot of the Hogwarts Express from afar with the dementor approaching and Ron's terrified hand on the window.  Or Lupin's (a great job by David Thewlis) many scenes with Harry, particularly the one outside in which Lupin talks about Lily.  Or the several references to time via the clocks.  And with the third book so serious, I appreciated Cuaron's dismissing of cuddliness.The acting is notable on two fronts.  One is Daniel Radcliffe, whose Harry is much more subtle and deep than ever before.  But the real treat is Gary Oldman as Sirius, whose portrayal is absolutely perfect.  I love Sirius, as so many others do, and was thrilled to see him get such a portrayal.  As the expected murderer, he's chillingly menacing.  As someone seeking revenge on Pettigrew, he's morally vengeful.  As a friend to Harry about to fly to freedom, he's touchingly caring.That leads me to my only complaint with the movie, its treatment of the scene in the Shrieking Shack.  It's such a tremendous scene, and so much is revealed, that I believe it should have been given longer treatment.  That way, we would have gotten to see the relationship between Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew to James and seen a more gradual accepting of Sirius's story from Harry.But that is ok.  Every other change made, including to dismiss the Quidditch cup, gloss over Ron and Hermione's fight, and give Dumbledore's wisdom lines to Sirius and Lupin, worked great in the movie.Even the scenery reflects the proper mood of the story, with most of the scenes set outside in a background of muted grays, browns, and greens.  If the story feels rushed, that's because a great amount of time is spent, as it should be, on the one fateful night that includes Buckbeak's encounter, the Shrieking Shack scene, and the beautiful Patronus.Cuaron has produced a masterpiece.  It's a shame he has decided to take a break for movie 4.  I can only hope he comes back for book 5.  It would only be fitting for the two best books to have the two best movies.	5.0	Tremendous	2004-08-18	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26O6MQFA36WBK	A Reviewer	"I am shocked at these negative reviews. I see people saying how much better the first 2 movies were, and I'm just shocked. This movie improved on the first 2 in every single way! The look of the movie, the camera work, the amazing views, etc. This movie gave you a scope of Hogwarts, unlike the first 2 movies. I can actually visualize the Hogwarts grounds because they actually showed them. The first 2 movies, though, just jumped from scene to scene. Prisoner of Azkaban, though, feels smoothly edited, and it flows nicely.The Dementors are creepy and intense, and although I wish they had explained the Dementor's Kiss a little more, (it would have made them more creepy,) they still were very well done. Unlike Columbus, (the director of the first 2 movies,) who'se idea was to duplicate the book scene by scene, Cuaron decides to put his own spin on certain scenes. Talking skulls, elephants in hotel rooms, etc.....the imagination is much more apparent. The movie's last half hour (or so) COMPLETELY replicates the fun and excitement of the books, something the first 2 movies were never were able to do. The book was still better, but this movie is really awesome, and comes very close to being as great as the book. Finally, the days of Harry Potter being treated as ""kiddy movies"" are over. When watching this movie, I get the feeling that the movie was made for everyone, whereas when watching the first 2 movies, I got the feeling that they were for a younger audience. And, based on comments from Mike Newell, who will be directing the 4th movie, the series will continue down this darker, more mature path, just like the books. Parents; keep in mind-this movie has some intense scenes.For those who are complaining about the lack of the Marauder's Map explanations...I would really like you to watch the Shrieking Shack scene again, and try to find out exactly where that whole explanation should go. Where can they suddenly start talking about the map? Try to figure that out. It just wouldn't have worked. Where in the scene could Lupin have suddenly said, ""You know....back when we were at Hogwarts...."" etc.? There will be plenty of time to reveal this in movies 4 and 5 (Espechily 5.)Flaws? Yes, there were some flaws. The action scenes, while cool, weren't exactly as thrilling as the ones in Chamber of Secrets. (action scenes that were sort of lacking included a werewolf chase, as well as the Quidditch match.) All the other action was great, though. I do also think that while all the details that were left out are BEST LEFT OUT, (for now,) I think they should have slowed down some of the explanation scenes to make clearer what was ACTUALLY SAID in the film. A very important explanation scene in the Three Broomsticks bar, as well as in the Shrieking Shack, move by a little too quickly and may confuse those who have not read the books. Also, the last....minute or so of this movie left A LOT to be desired. Why does Kloves continue to write bad endings? The first movie had an OK ending. The 2nd movie's ending was really horrible. This one, while not as bad as Chamber of Secrets's, is still lame. All I can say is that Kloves had BETTER NOT try to squeeze a cheesy, happy ending out of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Those flaws aside, though, we have a great Harry Potter movie that, while not as great as the books, is still really impressive, fun, exciting, and scarry."	5.0	The best of the Harry Potter movies	2004-11-29	4	3	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2YKEWJI4P5JKY	Arthryn	Simply put, this movie was a work of art in my eyes.  Alfonso Cuaron's direction puts the first two shame.  They were excellent, but appear bland and even chessy beside Prisoner of Azkaban.  Azkaban realized the grittiness that becomes more and more evident as the book series progresses and that was completely.  The movie portrays beautifully the transformation in Harry from little kid to a more mature teenager.  The wand scene at the very beginning was absolutely classic.The movie is itself is beautiful in all regards, from the character development, to the plot, and the scenery and Cuaron's overall vision.  Due to certain circumstances I saw the movie in the theater three times in four days, and the more I watched it, the more I loved it, which really says something.  It is dark and riveting.  Right now I am wondering if they are even bothering to attempt a PG rating.  The fourth book could easily be a PG-13, which would please me immensely.  I only hope that it lives up to the standards set by Prisoner of Azkaban.  I was devasted when I heard that Cuaron would not direct the fourth movie.  I am also ticked off that Cuaron was not even considered for best director at the Oscars.  He deserves it, but the Academy sucks.  In conclusion, this movie was brilliant.	5.0	The Darker Side of Harry Potter	2005-02-24	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1QG4TLIYZRL7L	"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim"""	"After experiencing the monotony of the first two films, I never expected I would go back to watch another.The only reason I started viewing this third installment is when Guillermo del Toro mentioned the film in a video interview posted on the website Rotten Tomatoes.  I found out that the director of Pan's Labyrinth, a superb film that revives and restores the original and true meaning of the authentic fairy tale, had either collaborated on this third Harry Potter film or was somehow connected to it.  If my statement as to the connection between del Toro and Harry Potter 3 sounds too abstract, that would be because the video on that site has since been edited down, so I cannot confirm or remember how he was connected.  I will provide indirect evidence shortly, but let me continue with my story.The year of 2006 has already become known as the year of the Mexican directors because the three most important films of the year were directed by Mexicans, as you would have guessed.  The first film is Babel, directed by Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.  The second film is Children of Men, directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.  And, the third film is Pan's Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro.  These are the top three films of 2006, all directed by people from Mexico.  Guillermo del Toro was not responsible for directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; that was directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, of Children of Men.  Anyway, the name of this particular Harry Potter film had kept popping up one-way-or-another in my research, so I borrowed the film from a friend and watched it.I found that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was remarkably similar to del Toro's new fantasy film Pan's Labyrinth, a film which had greatly impressed me for its dark and adult themes.  And, seeing that del Toro's name had not been credited on the DVD box made me remember the trailers I'd seen on Rotten Tomatoes for Pan's Labyrinth where del Toro mentions The Prisoner of Azkaban.  And so, this is my dilemma: one of the videos there for Pan's Labyrinth had been either altered or omitted.  I did not invent this story, but, admittedly, I probably don't seem too credible right now.  So, the only way I can explain is by talking about the similarities between The Prisoner of Azkaban and Pan's Labyrinth.They are similar.  The ""Alice"" character in Pan's Labyrinth goes under a tree trunk to take the key from the toad that lives there.  In Potter 3, it's Harry who goes under the tree.  In Pan's Labyrinth, the ""Alice"" character discovers a magical book that writes itself just before an action occurs.  In Harry, there is a magical book that tells Harry who is near him like a GPS monitor.  In Pan's Labyrinth, the ""Alice"" character draws chalk marks on her bedroom walls to create doors into another place.  In Potter 3, the house under the tree constantly moves with the tree.Pan's Labyrinth probably cost less than Potter 3, so del Toro wouldn't want to dump a lot of money into computer graphics, especially since he wanted to emulate the visual style of the stop-motion Harryhausen-animated fantasy films anyway, according to the interview still available on Rotten Tomatoes; in the Potter film, Hagrid shows to the students a creature called a hippogriff named ""Buckbeak,"" a creature appearing as a cross between Harryhausen's chicken in Mysterious Island to the Pegasus in Clash of the Titans.  Also, there are at least two darkness-related monsters in both films: the dementors and the werewolves in Potter 3; and, Pan and the Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth.  There are also a few small--as in having a small size--characters in both films: the fairies in Pan's Labyrinth and the were-rat in Potter 3.  Additionally, they are both extremely dark films, especially for a fairy tale like Pan's Labyrinth, and especially for a film franchise that never used darkness in its vision until its third incarnation, directed by a man who, coincidentally, is also a Mexican.  The two visual styles have too much in common for me to ignore a memory because I can't corroborate it, or even fully understand the mode of their connection, but they are connected, regardless.Since I haven't provided anything but a choppy review so far, let me make some semblance of a claim here.  This Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the only Harry Potter film of the four so far that actually held an interest.  The first two, directed by Chris Columbus, were based on very superficial plots that bored me to tears.  His second one was much better than his first one, but the two still longed greatly for depth.  Chris Columbus must've been listening to the consensual advice which probably sounded something like what I'm saying now about depth, and so the second would've had to have been an improvement over the first, but it wasn't enough.  The fourth one is directed by Mike Newell who has occasionally done good work, like the Al Pacino-Johnny Depp film Donnie Brasco; but, this is a different kind of film altogether, and a different kind of budget, too, and maintains that status quo of two-dimensional superficiality preoccupying this franchise.With The Prisoner of Azkaban, despite sitting though some similar nonsense that created problems with the rest of the films in the franchise--action without substance--this one actually has a lot of substance and it uses it to express the action, most of the time, except for those occasionally lapses back into the ""Potter-esque"" brainlessness that seems done as though it were a prerequisite to the Potter name.  Except for this, it was much more of an interesting film than all of the others put together.  Forgive me for saying so, but I also wish to note that the work of John Williams would have to befit the same lack of intellectuality that accompanied many of Spielberg's earlier films, which I did not like; luckily, he has become slightly more tolerable over the years, but not much, in his attempts at imitating the great Bernard Herrmann who composed Citizen Kane and several peak-Hitchcock films.I particularly liked the scene on the train near the beginning which reminded me of the classic Hitchcock train sequences of films like North by Northwest, and the Val Lewton-produced film by the classic horror director Jacques Torneur, The Night of the Demon (a.k.a. The Curse of the Demon) where at the end of the film the psychologist-protagonist is trying to pass the runic scroll back to the sorcerer who gave it to him.  There's even an homage through an unrelated conversation on ""Ancient Runes.""  The train sequence is very short, but it creates an immediate feeling of spookiness that is right out of the best of the classic horror films.The ""boggart"" is a monster of the id in this film, and this shape-shifting creature appears throughout the film, but the film generally doesn't delve in to the meaning of the subconscious mind maybe as much as other films like Forbidden Planet or Frankenstein, but it is integrated in with the story and more than a plot-based curiosity.One scene has all the students sleeping in a main room so the teachers can keep an eye on the students while the dementors are outside.  The idea for this part of the script might've come from Dario Argento's finest horror film, Suspiria, where, because of a student who is murdered, the teachers order the students of the dance school to sleep in the gymnasium, separated from the teachers merely by hung sheets.The ending with the werewolf fight in the forest at the end of the film is also very dark and an homage to the old Hammer Studio-styled visuals.The very beginning of the film, when Harry is having dinner with his family, reminded me of the Roald Dahl stories like The Twits or James and the Giant Peach, and this part seems done with some competence in its fantasy elements.  Even here, the film provides more depth than its others in the franchise.Actually, the film is nearly nothing like the franchise in that everything can be associated to some form of depth, either by the visual imagery or by the subconsciousness of the protagonist, like the scene where the English double-decker bus picks up Harry from his home.  Additionally, the acting is much more quantifiable here than before, and the pedigree of the cast appears higher, or at least the roles and the dialogue do.Now that I've given just a little too much away, you can go see for yourself what I mean."	4.0	I was Totally Taken by Surprise	2007-04-13	4	2	2

HELLO she took ALL the courses availabale!also, isn't sirius supposed to hav the remains of good looks, i mean, he used to be HOT before he was convicted... and they forgot all about explaining the nicknames... anyhoo, bout the other opinion. i must say, this one was more interesting than the other two-they were too slow.but this one is  too fast. it was ok, but disappointing. anyway, my suggestion is watch this movie, but deffinately read the book since you'll deffinately be enchanted by that!	3.0	dude, it's ok, but could (and should) b better	2004-09-17	5	4	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2WX1UESDOLXRE	"Ashley Quinn ""Ash"""	The third installment is much better and more memorable than the first two films. It's tough adapting an excellent book into an excellent film. Things are left out and new things are put in. The first two films left me wondering why more wasn't cut out of them to make for better movie viewing. It was like they were trying to cram as much of the book in as possible, resulting in drawn out stories. In stark contrast, this Potter film moves along at a pace I can stand, isn't as long (great for the attention span of children), is better written, directed, and played out.The three young actors (Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) have finally come into their own and look like they know what their doing. Radcliffe (Harry Potter) gives his best performance yet, and I'm sure we'll see even more growth in the coming movies.In this installment, we learn that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is after Harry Potter. That's the shortest version of the plot (there's more to it, but I don't want to be too long-winded), and I don't want to reveal too much more for the sake of those who may not have the read the book.Fanatics of the book may not appreciate that some of the book was left out, but if the entire book was adapted to film, the movie would be 10 hours long. For the sake of entertainment purposes, I'm glad director Cuaron took the edgy route. He gives us an excellent film, the best Potter film yet. Even the vision of Harry Potter is different. I thought this film had a better  feel for the book, even if it left stuff out.I've seen it twice, once in a regular theater and once in an IMAX. If you can get to an IMAX to see this one, I highly recommend it. What an awesome experience. Either way, I highly highly recommend this movie. It's absolutely breathtaking.	5.0	Much Better!!!	2004-06-18	3	2	1

I saw it in the IMAX and it was just amazing, but a few scenes must have been cut out because it was shorter then the regular version and the part where they find Sirius and Peter Pettigrew was really cunfusing and didn't make sense (one second they all wanted to kill each other, and the next Harry wanted to go live with Sirius?).  Otherwise, I'm just waiting for the DVD.	5.0	Excellent	2004-07-30	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2XXV9HF169LCF	A. Trotter	Ok, here goes:The sets are different from the first two, the actor playing Dumbledore takes a different spin on him, and the actors have definitely grown a bit.On the visuals: the primary crayola colors of the first two give way to subtle shades and darker fade-ins. The sets remind me of Labyrinth (I'm letting my age leak there), or an Escher sketch; the Hogwarts castle seems more mysterious, with more secrets and silence. It has atmosphere, which it lacked before. The placement of the castle is now more highlands than it was; the hills and mountains are steep and dramatic. It's terrific.Some bits reminded me of turn-of-the-century (the last one, not this one) silent sepia films. The music was lovely, as always, and had a bit more variety this time with the inclusion of some old twenties tunes on record. The new actors did a marvelous job. I think there was a tribute to Shreck in there... You'll know it when you see it, believe me...On the story: Some things were left out, and my completeist friend was gravely upset over this fact. I didn't miss what wasn't there: the story flows well, and if they put in any more of the stuff from the book the movie would have bogged down in detail. It was clean and perfect. As these books get thicker, the movies will be forced to cut more out; this one did so with grace and style. Nothing was changed from the story; not everything made it in, but nothing was altered either. So... kudoes there.On the actors: part of their change from the last one to this one was the change in style of the movie. Part was their own sudden growth, which also happens in the books. The character relationships are changing too, and that's done quite well. Malfoy isn't quite so much a cartoon villian in this one. The boys are begining to show signs of real boyhood as opposed to the sainthood of the previous movies, and Hermione - well, she had so much character from the begining, but she's settling into it now and does very well.All in all, this was an amazing and beautiful adaptation, visually stunning and begining to showcase some real talent by the actors, possibly due to some more strict guidance by the director.	5.0	Just seen it!	2004-06-10	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1R602SXNGOMJ4	A. Vegan	Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie.	4.0	Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous	2006-02-17	2	2	0

The characters are under-developed, large chunks of the plot are missing or inaccurate, the location of filming was moved - so this is NOT the ""original"" Hogwarts, and the feel of the movie is too dark to be appropriate. The acting is a bit better in this film in comparison to the first two, but there are several over-the-top, ""cheesy"" moments that ruin the general feel.This movie could have, and perhaps should have, been at least an hour longer than it is to ensure that the audience is not left with a ""huh?"" feeling. As a Harry Potter fan I would probably buy this movie just because I want a whole set - but I wouldn't buy it until it's very inexpensive - or until someone else is willing to buy it as a gift.In either case, it will sit on the shelf and definitely won't be watched nearly as often as the first two films."	2.0	Too Much Missing	2004-09-14	15	10	5

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33V3AFQ4XMA5	A viewer	While I am a great fan of the Harry Potter Series, and while I will definitely purchase the 3rd movie on DVD, I was somewhat disappointed with the director's treatment of the story. Some  crucial parts were missing, making it more difficult for those who haven't read the books to follow the story (i.e. the information as to why Professor Lupin knew the Marauder's Map) while other scenes were needlessly extended (i.e. the Werewolf scene). I also wonder why this movie was the shortest of the three, when the 3rd book is longer than the previous two. Also, the mood of the film, while darker than the previous two, was already quite dark. Given that Harry's life becomes even more threatened in the next books, how much darker can you go? I hope that the following HP movies will follow the original story more closely and include important information instead of artificially extending certain scenes to show off computer wizardry. Having said this, I thought that the cast of characters chosen for this film was very good. I particularly liked the director's choice for the roles of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. They were excellent. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, even though it didn't fit my expectations.	4.0	A viewer from Bellingham, Washington	2004-10-17	7	7	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"This is the third story, and my favorite of all the movies at least. Not sure about the books, but this one is the one that was best translated to the screen of any of the series. Maybe it's Buckbeak, the hypogriffe, or maybe Sirius Black, or maybe that marvelous time turner and the rerun of one three-hour segment in the lives of Harry and Hermione. Perhaps it's Professor R. J. Lupin, this year's Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. And we can't discount Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher who is even loopier than most of the staff at Hogwarts. Actually, there is so much to love in this film that it is one you really must watch several times to catch it all.First, the Dursleys get a visit from Aunt Marge, Vernon's bossy sister who raises dogs. She is so completely obnoxious to Harry that he loses his temper and blows her up. Not like a bomb; like a helium balloon. But as Cornelius Fudge points out, she was brought down over Surry and her memory was adjusted, so no harm done. But Harry thought he would be arrested and at the very least expelled from Hogwarts, so he takes a ride on the Knight Bus (hilarious trip commented upon by a shrunken head that hangs over the dashboard) and goes to the Leaky Cauldron. Fudge is waiting for him, and he soon finds Ron and Hermione, along with the entire Weasley clan, are already in residence at the Cauldron. Against advice not to ""worry him,"" Mr. Weasley tells Harry that escaped murderer Sirius Black is apparently searching for Harry to kill him.And then the story gets really complicated. But watch everything, even the things that seem to be irrelevant distractions, because it all gets woven together very skillfully by the end of the story. I simply don't dare to tell you too much, because the surprises are the best parts. Let's just say that one of the most important magical objects in the story is a map. So from the time the Weasley twins give it to Harry, keep your eye on that map. Even when the credits come up at the end, keep your eye on that map."	5.0	I Loved the Entire Series	2012-05-14	0	0	0

(For those who are have not read the 3rd book I don't want to ruin it for you)  I can though understand that the movie would have ended up being 4 hours long, but Gone With the Wind is 4 hours long, and people could have definitely sat through Harry Potter for that long.Aside from what I didn't like about the movie, I love seeing how all the actors have grown up as compared to the first movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1XXWYE9DGVCKF	"""beccisykes"""	I eagerly anticipated the release of the third film in the Harry Potter series for more than a year. But, when I finally got to see it I was more than a little disappointed. Although the standard of acting has improved greatly since the first two films, I felt this film lacked the magic of Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets.This film, like the book, sees Harry Potter become a teenager and enter a much darker period of his life. Harry's first two years at Hogwarts saw him battling a weakened Voldemort, whereas this year he must face the Dementors and escaped prisoner Sirius Black, forcing him to discover more about his past.The book was fantastic, so I had high hopes that the film would be too. But somewhere between evil Malfoy becoming a coward and Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow changing location, the storyline seemed to get lost. That's not to say it isn't a good film - the part at the beginning where Harry blows up his Aunt Marge was hilarious, and David Thewlis is excellent as Professor Lupin. It's just that the changes distract from the story. Michael Gambon has kept none of the mannerisms that the late Richard Harris brought to Dumbledore; Hogwarts had changed so dramatically I spent half the film wondering if Harry and his friends had transferred to a different school; and important parts of the story had been ignored or left out. (Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup; how Lupin knew how the Marauders Map worked; who Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were; why Harry thought the Patronus was his dad etc..)I couldn't help but feel that the new director was trying too hard, making the movie very 'artsy' and taking it somewhere it didn't need to be, and before the end was insight I found myself wishing Chris Columbus would come back.Harry Potter fans can only pray that Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) will do a better job with Goblet of Fire.3 stars - ultimately, to understand this film you have to read the book.	3.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-07-16	8	8	0

The acting was VERY good, the scenes very well done, and the dementors as creepy as we all think they are.  The new director has done many new things.  Instead of the whole movie being filmed at one angle, he has made the cameras come at scenes from the top, and the bottom. It adds effect and makes it a more grown up movie then the first two.

[which makes the 5th book hard for me to handle. :( ]anyways, i was very glad when this movie came out in theaters.  i had heard that it was very different from the book.  to be honest though, i couldn't tell, and it was probably b/c i haven't read it in a long time.  i just remembered the main parts and that was good enough for me. :)i personally thought it was awesome.  i had wanted to see this one ever since i first heard that they were going to turn them into movies.  i was very glad to hear that it would come out in the theater two days before my 14th birthday as well.the whole thing was awesome.  the way they set everything up.  the clothes were even a lot better this time around.  i thought that Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n did a very good job.the story is getting way better than the last two.  it just makes it better w/ harry, hermione, ron, and every1 else being teenagers.  the whole becoming of age thing makes it seem more for older audiences than the last two also.all in all, i am very excited for this to come out on DVD!  i can't wait to see it again. :)  it is my favorite HP movie/book, and probably always will be.  when it comes out, i recommend if you haven't read the book that you get this.  also if you aren't too pickey w/ whether or not it is exactly like the book.  or if you have as bad a memory as me and can't really remember much of what happened in the book anyways. ;)	5.0	MY FAVORITE HARRY POTTER MOVIE/BOOK!	2004-09-21	5	3	2

These books are truly works of art and to see them mutilated by some big conglomerate movie company is really disheartening for the true fans.	1.0	absolute disappointment	2005-03-03	11	7	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1PWFSIRW5WCQT	Ben	"Cuaron was definitely in the right when making the changes he did!  Columbus himself said he was too big a fan of the book, so he struggled to stuff as much material as he could into the movie.  As a result, Chamber of Secrets especially, the films had to move at a breathless, hurried pace, with the actors themselves even seeming out of breath.  Cuaron takes an objective approach to the film; he only wants to make a great movie, not to faithfully filmize the books.  I am as big a fan of the books as anyone (i've read each book at least twice) but theres a line as to how faithful a movie can be before its not a good movie anymore.As for the ""normal clothes"" issue, I thought that made the characters more emotionally accessible, as Rowlings books are more about coming of age and friendship than the magic itself, which just serves as a humorous and interesting backdrop. I know the ending was a bit silly, but it was unexpected! exciting! You remember the end of COS!  It was awful! Very sappy and misleading  (about the harry/hermione thing).  I thought the Ron/Hermione touches were great fan service and foreshadowing, though perhaps a little to obvious lol.  The one complaint:  even though she isn't more prevalent in the story until later books, Cho Chang first appeared in book 3, so I think she should have at least appeared as a cameo or something. But alas! of all the great things about this movie thats a minor gripe.People!  The purpose of a film is to give a new take on a book; to make new people interested in the story.  I know this film did that for me; when I didn't care about HP as much as I did like right after the first film.  Columbus's films had at least as many changes as this one did, so get off Cuaron's back!I can't wait to see how Goblet of Fire turns out, under the helm of Mike Newell."	5.0	whats the problem??	2004-10-17	17	9	8
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3CGOPCF6FR3GS	Benjamin Seeberger	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban describes Harry's strugge to find a father and understand his adolescent self, while portraying the world of magic as an ultimately more sinister and evil place full of hatred, mystery, and fantastic hope. The film builds on the premise of wickedness, expositing the horrors and the whimsy of the fantastic, while trying to give humanity a place in between. There are some very frightening scenes in this film, including a talking shrunken head, a lycanthrope transformation, and creatures of the dark known as dementors who have the power to look into your soul and do. This film is a brilliant adaptation of Rowling's book, offering the main plot elements while distinguishing itself into its own category of story, wildly different from Rowling's original feeling.STUDY GUIDE: questions to think about while watching the film...1. Humanity: In the film, Harry's countenance becomes darker, filled with angst and loneliness. He showcases the mind of a troubled youth. Yet he is a special boy, with prophecies hanging off his nose. Do you think Harry truly expresses his sorrow in this film, or is it overblown and laden with baroque? (Baroque means an overemphasis on the realistic.)2. Implications: Azkaban is much, much darker than the previous two films, from the creepy singing of Ray Bradbury's &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes,&quot; to the re-imagined perspective of the Whomping Willow. Alfonso Cuaron didn't change the atmosphere just for laughs. In what ways does this twisting of reality mean for us today? Is life actually that dark?3. Evolution: In the previous two films, wizardry was child's play. It was something adults did to amuse themselves, and something children did to fascinate their imaginations. Yet in this third film, wizardry is a horrible thing, a power which can suck the soul out of a man. In what ways does the film express both the danger and the importance of magic in Harry Potter's world?4. Realism: The dementors, a sort of flying nazgul without swords, are immensely frightening and provide for a seriousness up to this point not acknowledged in the films. Watching the film, we know they are not real, but in the film, they are the hinge upon which the fantasy gains its realism. Are the dementors real?5. Stageplay: Some of the book is altered for purposes of balancing the physical emotion that is tied to a film, and much of the story is rushed through. Does this affect the outcome of the story? Do you think this adds or detracts from the film?	4.0	Hollywood Teatime: romp through frightening and beautiful	2004-07-19	5	3	2

The biggest problem I have with the movie comes from the fact that I had read the books so many times there were things I wanted to see.I had never read the books when I'd seen the 1st 2 movies, so they were wonderful in my eyes, & even now not much seems missing between book & movie.  However POA being my favorite book was really screwy...I think a lot more needed to be explained & more scenes from the book kept in.  If you didn't read the books then you really have no idea about the Marauders map or its creators, which is important to realize why Harry's dad appeared in the form of a stag.I really missed the bit about Harry getting the Firebolt taken from him when he received it for Christmas.  To put something like that at the end of the movie somehow seemed really wrong.  The movie is a jumble of scenes from the book (& new ones) rearranged quick enough to give you a headache.  It seemed some scenes were just over too quickly & others just lingered.I'm a devoted fan to the series & can only give this movie 3 stars for it's lack of what made POA such a wonderful book.Honestly if this is what we're to expect from the Goblet of Fire when it comes out, then we can all plan to have the book in theaters to reference what exactly is going on in the movie.	3.0	I liked it enough to buy it...	2004-08-12	3	2	1

While I agree with one other reviewer that the movie left out loads of important information that is contained in the book, the film is still outstanding.  I would definatley encourage the viewer to read the book (before or after); it will make much more sense.  I think JK Rowling has proven to be one of the most important children's writers of the 21st century.

The book was the worst book there was(not to say it was a bad book, but just that it wasn't the best by far) but the movie hardly even scratched the surface of the entire story.I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that Dumbledoor changed. I know the first Dumbledoor died and the director couldn't do anything about that but there were a lot of better options for the roll of Dumbledoor than the one they picked.The other thing was that they changed the entire castle. The first castle was much more magical and more exciting. This second castle looked like any castle you might see a picture of in a magazine. It just didn't capture the imagination like the first did.This is a good movie, it just seemed like there were a lot of changes really suddenly that distracted from the story.	3.0	A disappointment	2007-12-18	2	2	0

I have all the Harry Potter movies in DVD, and I love them enough that I also purchased the BR versions!  This review deals with the packaging!  IF YOU HAVE THE TWO DISC SET, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Unlike the Ultimate Edition of SS and CoS, this does NOT include an extended cut. Foolish me - I though that they would use the same format for all of the Ultimate Editions.  Had I known, I would never have paid $27.99 for this.  I already have the two-disc set, so basically I paid $27.99 for one disc.The movie itself, and the special features are excellent.  If you don't already have this, it's well worth the money.  If you do have it, you might want to consider just how much you want to spend to get the one disc you didn't already have!  In today's economy, it's a pretty cheap shot on the part of a big corporation like WB to take advantage of people in this way.  If I hadn't already opened it, I'd send it back for a refund!I made the big mistake of assuming that Ultimates 3 & 4 would be in the same format of 1 & 2.  Wish I'd read the reviews before placing the order.  I was so excited to get them out, put them into the player, sit back and enjoy HP extended.  Hah!  Shame on me for not being more observant. I can only hope that this will help someone else avoid making the same mistake!BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!	2.0	WHAT?  No Extended Cut in Ultimate Edition?  Shame on WB!	2010-10-20	7	6	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1L2HDNL4XFL4H	Biggi	I have read Harry Potter from the beginning. And never watched a movie because I heard mixed reviews. I preferred my own vision. J.K. Rowling is just amazing and an old school, skilled, story teller. Now that my kids are getting older we have begun to listen to the book on tapes. Something my kids enjoy very much and because it is such a great book, I admit to being captured once again, even though I am not the one reading it. So we bought the first DVD's.1 and 2 are good. They left a lot out. But it still expressed the authors thoughts and voice enough that you got the picture and wanted more.So we just finished watching number 3.What the  heck was that?I get it, new Dumbeldore,and new director. You can't put the entire book into the movie etc.But everything is changed in this one. The fun the good scenes, like the gatherings at the great hall. And the Halloween scene with Sir Nick. This was all about the outdoors and the view of the director who , in my point of view, completely missed the point of this movie. Everything was cut, shortened or just didn't make it into this book. Moments that will continue on in the next book. And Ginny has hardly any part. But how does that then explain the happenings later on. Ron's new owl and so on. This is a rushed version of a story that was written very well but has been butchered for the movie. We were frustrated beyond. I hated the color. Green and gray or whatever. Who cares. This director changed it all and it made no sense. The professors have hardly an important role anymore. You see one or two times Professor Mc Gonegol. You never hear or see from Sir Geduggin and that the Fat Lady returns. Honestly, it doesn't allow you to bond with anyone. And the new Dumbeldor needs to slow down. He has little charm and is not as wise and smart. Or at least doesn't appear to be. 1 and 2.. yes there were cuts.. but that director understood what we enjoyed and loved about the book. Give me a break about Harry getting older. He is only 13. Haggrits hut was changed. What he just added on? And what happened to the forbidden forest? The magical creatures. Looks like backyard woods to me. The castle changed. Seriously. Where is the color and magical fun? The Weasley's house and the time spent there. And you need those moments for the next books/audio/ DVD, so you can understand. Ugh!. Frustrating. Thankfully we can listen to the tapes and get the correct version. It wasn't even explained why the willow tree was planted , for Lupin. Nothing was kept that was important. And seriously. This is not a regular school They should be wearing their ropes. What is with this wardrobe? They messed up so much and left out. Shame on the director for not thinking what the book is telling and expressing and people want to see, but for just looking at his point of view. I doubt he read the book or understood it. I mean, what the heck. He has a choir singing of goblins and witches at the beginning. That is not in the book at all. But that Harry was excited to be part of the sorting head moment.. because they had missed the others. That is not in there. And that Colin's brother was joining them. I mean. Those are important key information for what is to come. Very frustrating. no ceremony in the end that closes it up and points awarding or anything. This is a terrible mistake. Not worth the money. You can't just jump and change it all. The audience did not ask for it and enjoyed very much the version that stuck closest to the books. Shame on this director for stealing this away from us. These DVD's could have been a great hit. To think we had to wait 4 years for the next book because Warner Brothers wasn't finished making the movie. Yeah right. Shame. Blah. Not worth my time anymore.I guess it is for each to decide if they like it or not. Which version they prefer. But this one is not just different and changes it all... it is also weird. Leaves you hanging. And why are there ghost horses and riders constantly jumping through windows etc. That is never in the book mentioned. And that is another point. Where is Sir NIck's amazing Halloween Party? Why is he not part of the movie? They do have a good relationship. Dumbeldore never stands at a podium. He doesn't have to. He is a persona that everyone recognizes. He does not need to be singled out. Oh I am steaming over this crab. Too bad. NO wonder many are frustrated. I am. This is the shade of green and gray I have to watch now for the next few DVD's. Yuck.Very disappointing. I gave it a 2 star because it is Harry and some scenes are nicely done.But nothing specially mentioned about Hagrit keeping his position at Hagwarts. Yuck1	2.0	weird	2012-10-28	0	0	0

Serius Black, an infamous murderer has escaped from Azkaban and the adventure begins. Compared to the prior two movies it is not as long and I feel that at times it feels a bit rushed. The music is as good as the first prior movies and I love the performance of Radcliffe, Watson and Grint. A very good fantasy movie that is to please many children. Some scenes might be a bit scary for small children and a parents hand or a teddy bear can be there for comfort.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says ""Oh you just HAVE to read this!"" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the ""Potter films."" And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush?Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner - Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005) - has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death?Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death._____________________________________________________________________________________Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.)Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliche), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn!

He left out very important events, slicing a 400+ page book in just 2 1/2 hours (should have been at least 3 hours long.)  The crucial part of the book was between Scabbers and Crookshanks and in the movie they only had one small line regarding them.  Because the movie was so short, it feels like the events are always going too fast, like an extended ""climax"" of the movie that is overkill.  Very weak."	3.0	Very Disappointing!	2004-09-10	11	6	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1HBC0NBQJHT7X	Bookphile	I will preface this review by saying that PoA is my favorite of the HP novels and I strongly felt that this film did it justice.  It benefited a great deal from the change of director and there were some sweeping scenic shots in this movie that simply stole my breath, in particular the scene in which Harry and Lupin are having a discussion while on a Gothic bridge.  The grandeur of the scenery and the lonely aspect of some of the wintry shots did a great deal to enhance the longing Harry feels in his search for the man whom he believes betrayed his parents and led to their deaths.David Thewlis is a wonderful Lupin.  His face expresses so much and he did such a wonderful job of expressing the sorrow and anger and regret that Lupin feels over what happened to the Potters.  When he talks about Sirius, it's obvious how conflicted he is, how he is still unable to account for such a change in character of a man whom he thought he knew so well.  I also found his interactions with Harry very touching and Thewlis made it apparent that Lupin fervently wants to do right by Harry, to protect him as he was unable to protect James.Gary Oldman is simply a wonderful actor and his inclusion in the cast does much for the film.  His Sirius is wound so tightly that you can see the tension in every inch of his body, his mind so close to coming unhinged due to years of guilt and torture in Azkaban that I could feel myself holding my breath in the Shrieking Shack scene.  His interactions with Harry were powerful, evolving from hate and mistrust to tentative steps toward reconciliation and seeking to find something good in the ashes of Harry's tragedy.I don't like Gambon as Dumbledore.  I felt Harris did a much better job of capturing Dumbledore's true nature.  I know Gambon wanted to put his own twist on the character but it is to the character's detriment.  Dumbledore now comes across as feeble and befuddled and he doesn't exemplify the collected nature and almost constant sense of amusement that the Dumbledore of the books exhibits.My other dissatisfaction with the film stems from the inconsistencies of the effects.  Harry's Patronus is lovely and the Dementors are scary (though, truth be told, a bit too reminiscent of The Lord of the Ring's Nazgul) but when Lupin's werewolf form is revealed it's actually rather silly looking.  The Knight Bus looked wonderful but the scenes on it were too cartoonish for my taste.These are really minor bumps, though.  The strength of this novel lies in the story, in Harry's search for the truth about what happened to his parents and in his grasping for someone to offer him the guidance he so craves.  It is a story of great betrayal and yet it is difficult to truly hate Peter Pettigrew for his betrayal because his cowardice is entirely too human.  Most of all, though, it is the story of Harry's search for his identity, for his roots, of his desire and need to learn more about a past of which he knows so little.	5.0	Harry's unexpected father figure	2007-08-17	9	9	0

Well, the first two Harry Potter movies did a great job recreating Harry Potter, the third movie did not.  One of my main dislikes about the movie was that the plot and added character developement that happens in book three was, not lost, but weak.  The director seemed more interested in the glamour of film than the meat and potatoes of it.  Another thing that really got me was that the entire plot between harry and sirus was out of order.  Harry finds out half way through the year that Sirus is good, he even gets the Firebolt by then too.  Other reviews have pointed out many other disappointments invovling backstory, which I might add is very very important to the rest of the series.  One problem why this occured is because of the neglected sequencing of the film.  The relationship Harry builds with Sirus during the spring allows him to learn about that ""back story"" that is missing in the film.  So Alfonso pretty much dug his own grave when he excepted this script.  If they don't beef up movie 4, I don't know how they are going to complete the series.

DUMBLEDORE! ...it wasn't the same, he didn't even look or act remotely the same. he looked like an aging hippie, nothing like sir harris's Dumbledore. he acted like an autistic child, utterly devoid of the warmth and wisdom of the first two films... the kids on the other hand, are shining stars in the world of potter. can't complain there. professor trelawney was right on point compared with the book3rd, the direction... the directing style was interesting. i liked the darker feel, but when coupled with the altered storyline, it was very frustratingthe visuals... are interesting as well. i like the dark style. i felt like the werewolf could have stood a few more rounds in the animation studio. he was scrawny and bald. just the word ""Werewolf"" brings to mind strength and raw power, supernatural musculature (see the movie ""underworld"" for better renditions of werewolves) lupin's werewolf was just scrawny and pathetic.. on the other hand, the dementors were spot on. well animated, designed and scary ...but then, the whomping willow was way too small, hogwarts was located in an entirely different place, hagrid's hut was half a mile from the castle, it was just all wrong... i'm all for creative liscense, but when you have a structure already mapped out by 2 previous films, then the only thing you're going to accomplish by scrapping it is disorientation, frustration and angeroverall, this movie could have been a lot better. this was more like ""an interpretation of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban"" or, ""a highly abridged telling of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban""... i feel like i'm still waiting for the rest of the movie. i wanted at least 2 hours and 45 minutes out of it... if rowlings pulls a peter jackson with some ""extended editon"" nonsense, she'll have a lot more pissed off fans than she does now.. just get chris columbus back and it'll be ok jo!"	3.0	"this brings new meaning to the words ""hack job"""	2004-11-20	10	0	10
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KHO7K21MS7RL	"Braulio Cruz ""Braulio"""	Wow, this film is truly amazing, much better than Chamber of Secrets for sure. Alfonso Cuaron is an amazing director and he made an amazing film! Finally it does the book justice, not by being faithful but by keeping the sprit of the book alive in the scenes. In every scene there is something magical. Azkaban is a very dark Harry Potter movie but there is just enough comic relief to satisfy you. It stuck to the central plot and most of the stuff that didn't have anything to do with the main plot were dropped, but it's mostly a good thing because the flow of the movie is much better.The special effects are so good in this movie that it blows the first two away! Finally a Harry Potter movie with no more fake robots! I congratulate them on Buckbeak (the hippogriff) and on the Whomping Willow scene (amazing).The acting was much improved in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe who was stiff and inexperienced came out much better in this movie where he worked on a much more emotional side. Emma Watson is better than usual in this film and is the best out of the three. Rupert Grint, well, he is a good actor but all he does is make stupid faces in this film.The mood of this film captured the mood of the book perfectly and the flow of the movie is great, this made me love this movie. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because non-book readers may get a bit confused on this scene in the very end of the movie that goes really fast, the should have added 8 more minuets to it so the audience could understand it better, but other than that it was great. I liked how Cuaron made the teenage world in Hogwarts so perfect. It's cool to see them react like regular kids for once, like in a scene in the Gryffindor House dormitory where the boys where eating animal candies.Hogwarts looked so much better in this film, so much more like the beautiful ones we read in the books. Every inch of it was filled with detail. Some of you complain because Hagrid's cabin and the Whomping Willow where in different locations in this film, but so what? It looks much more like Hogwarts now and it's better looking.This movie is great and I hope Goblet of Fire is as good as this one (or if I'm lucky, better!)	4.0	The best Harry Potter film yet!	2005-01-17	4	1	3

The movie was enjoyable but I have the impression that the new director has never read the book.  The scope of the book required a longer movie to avoid the jerkiness of the action.  Some things that didn't make sense began with the first scene with Harry performing magic to read in bed...something Rowling made clear that underage wizards aren't to do.  Then Harry received the Firebolt at the end of the movie rather than in the middle of the action.  The action at the Womping Willow was totally out of place.  Where was Crookshanks to press the knot the quiet the Willow?  After all it was Crookshanks that made Scabbers run in the first place when Harry, Hermione and Ron left Hagrid's place using the invisibility cloak.  The relationship between Lupin and Harry never developed.  And Harry's patronus wasn't as Rowling described.  I would suggest a new director who's read the books more than once is needed.  Given the complexity of the next book in the series they need to consider a longer movie and fewer changes to the story.	4.0	Enjoyable but disturbing	2004-06-12	1	1	0

If you realize, however, that the book is much to long to include everything in a reasonable movie and just try to look at them as two different stories altogether, then you will probably enjoy it.  There was a new director for this movie, and he felt things like Hogwarts grounds needed to be changed.  It's a completely different feel than the first two movies, which I found to be quite irksome.  Other than that though I really enjoyed it, and I don't regret my purchase at all.	3.0	good movie, not exactly faithful	2005-07-26	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AGIRPW4M80NHN	Brian M. Donohue	"I'm at a loss to understand the tone of all these rigidly negative reviews of Cuaron's adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. What these critics fail to appreciate, in their inflexible rant against an artist who dares to follow his own muse, is that art is not meant to be repetitive or imitative. Why would I want to see a film that slavishly and superficially follows a book's plot and every twist of substory (never mind the fact that it would make for a four hour stint in a movie theater)?Clearly, JKR herself had no problem with Cuaron's work, perhaps because she understood that he was creating something unique with this film; and I agree with her. Cuaron has taken a marvelous book and turned it into a truly original piece of filmmaking. Rowling's metaphorical themes are held intact (the boggart of fear; the dementors of depressive illness; the deep currents of time and growth); meanwhile, Cuaron has given his extraordinary visual gift to these themes. His landscapes are rough-hewn and always layered: the characters are seen climbing uphill or juddering downhill; lurching over dark, uneven terrain, surrounded by oversized objects and animals which themselves appear possessed of consciousness (even the whomping willow seems more alive than it did in the prior film). The cgi is nearly flawless, and is never allowed to dominate the character development or artistic values of the film, but rather to serve and enhance them. The Buckbeak scene, set to another moving piece of John Williams ""flying music"", is an example of this--an adolescent boy is being given a humbling and exhilarating lesson on the human place in the magical realm of Nature, and his growth as an individual from this experience is palpable to any sensitive viewer.You could look anywhere in this film and see the same marriage of visual beauty and deep understanding of the metaphor--in the encounters with the symbols of the soul's night, the dementors; in the variously-textured teachings on facing fear and its source (the boggart scene, the meeting with the werewolf, the time-turner scene; and in the wonderfully-rendered depictions of the misjudgments and depredations of institutional justice (the Buckbeak execution scene and the collective's obsession with guilt and punishment in its mindless pursuit of Sirius). And finally, Cuaron does a delightful job of making Rowling's humor live and dance throughout this film: there is not a self-conscious or stagnant moment in this entire film.So I would ask the triflers and fault-finders to simply relax and let art be art. If you would like to see the story exactly as you want to see it, go back to Rowling's novel and let your own imagination guide you from there. But if you would like to see a film, then let the filmmaker take you into his experience through the window of his art. But if you want to see mere slavish imitation, then you are not looking for art, but rather for mere contrivance. For that, I would suggest an evening with the ""fair and balanced"" network."	5.0	Art is Freedom	2004-09-10	13	8	5

I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies that Chris Columbus directed, but this movie blew those two out of the water completely. Director Alfonso Cuaron transformed the entire series with this movie, making it darker, more artistic, and overall a better movie-watching experience than the other Potter films. A lot of fans are annoyed because of all the differences between the movie and the book, but I think the changes were done in a manner that truly makes Prisoner of Azkaban the best film out of the 5 we've seen so far.	4.0	Alfonso Cuaron's genius works with Harry Potter	2007-09-05	0	0	0

Hogwarts is no longer a cheerful place, well upkept with magic--instead it is a moldering ruin. The students go about dressed in grimy ""muggle"" clothes, and play their roles in a cheesy and slipshod manner. Even great actors came out looking like first year drama students in this film--and the mediocre actors looked so terrible on the screen that I kept wishing for the movie to end. Case in point--Harry's loud and unbelievable crying midway through the movie (what was the director thinking?!). How 'bout Dumbledore--now a silly old man with little depth or intellegence (forget about any feeling of hidden power like in the previous films). Major plot points in the book were overlooked (like who wrote the map, and Harry actually having a Stag shaped Patronus and why).

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3CNLK47TYVUVN	"Bryan Lim ""Bryan Lim"""	"As you know Christopher Columbus had directed the first and second book of the Harry Potter series and translated J.K Rowling's text onto the big screen. We have seen the hype about the first two movies. In the news, on the internet, everywhere, there is a Harry potter book out there on the shelves, a promotional poster for the movie and even little children trying who think they are Harry Potter by wearing a cloak, a hat, having a wand, slashing themselves with paint to make a scar on their forehead and buying fake nerdy glasses.The reason to the success Christopher Columbus' movie of Harry Potter to tell the truth is because of the actual books itself. People from all around the world had fallen involve with J.K Rowling's Imaginations of a Boy Wizard and to see Harry potter in ""real"" life would be even better. In My opinion, the first two Harry potter Movies aren't as what I had expected. The movies were good however not good enough to impress. Philosopher's stone and chamber of secrets were movies that I could not stand to see again after the first time and therefore, stopping me from appreciating the movie... I felt Azkaban was different, which was directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.The plot of The Prisoner of Azkaban Harry and friends Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts warnings of an escaped criminal, Sirius Black (who makes his first appearance on a poster having crazy laughs and screaming). At Hogwarts Harry learns that Sirius Black, who is rumored to have been behind the murder of his parents, has escaped from Azkaban prison. He is coming for Harry to help hunt Sirius down, Black ghostly figures (Who look like Nazgul from LOTR) called Dementors guards the school they have the ability to discover within a person's soul that which is most terrible. Their presence leaves a chill, Groundskeeper now has a teaching position and introduces the children to a magical creature called a Hippogriff, Meanwhile a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin make friends with Harry, but harbors a dark secret of his own. As a hippie-like fortune-telling professor and Snape gets a laugh from his menacing voice while saying the line ""turn to page 394.""There are reasons why this film is different and a lot better than the past two films.The way Alfonso directs Prisoner of Azkaban is just genius. He has put the theme of darkness in this film and made it so powerful. The acting from Emma, Rupert, Daniel has improved a lot, and had more impact on the film, we feel the emotions of Harry and the others and we can connect with the film. The scenery is amazing making Hogwarts more beautiful than a dark and ugly like the past films. The Special effects has been put to the minimal. Alfonso had relied on the strength of the characters to tell the story and only puts FX when it is needed. Azkaban, I think is more faithful to the book than the others and therefore, since the book is good, the movie was good too! John Williams, the conductor has made a big difference to past Harry potter music. He explores more themes, more action orientated, sweet and charming music to fit the movie. In the past, the Harry Potter theme that we hear in the start goes rolling on and on forever but this time, more music is explored and made impact to the film as well.Good music, fantastic acting, Gracefulness in the film make this Harry potter the best Harry potter Movie out of the three. It seems that the Harry Potter franchise is doing well compared to crappy sequels like the matrix. H.P 3 was fantastic and one of my favourite fantasy movies (but Lord of the rings was the absolute best!). Goblet of fire is released next year, November...Good: Exciting, emotional and mostly entertaining through the whole filmBad: Only few minutes of Quiditch, corny part where Harry spreads his arm like he's bird and shouts ""woo hoo"" like in Titanic while going over the lake. *shiver"	5.0	Cuaron has created Harry Potter as a Genius!	2004-06-20	5	2	3

I loved it. A lot of people complain about the fact that the movie is VERY different from the book, but for the most part, they were just a lot of minor changes... there were only two changes I consider ""major"" (Harry being discovered at Hogsmeade by Draco was cut, and there's no mention of James Potter (Prongs), Sirius Black (Padfoot), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), and Remus Lupin (Moony, and by the way - the movie pronounces the name wrong. The name ""Lupin"" is pronounced ""Loo-pawn"", the movie pronounces it ""Loo-pin"") creating the Marauder's Map). The only minor changes I didn't like was the lack of Quidditch, but that didn't really affect the story anyway, and the beginning where Harry used the ""Lumos"" spell to see his book, which should be against the wizarding law for underaged wizardry.Anyway... the acting has really improved. In the first movie, they sounded really... stiff. I also like how the actors don't seem to have much accent in their voices anymore (I'm not big on accents).

Having said that it is still flawed in ways that it should not be. I must admit before I go into detail that I have read this book at least twice, so I know this plot fairly well.This movie begins with Harry working on spells under his covers. Then his Aunt Marjorie comes over, who believes that she should belittle him every moment he is around. It gets to the point where Harry blows her up into what is essentially a giant balloon. He then runs away from home and a bus picks him up, called the Knight Bus. It is a wizarding bus that takes lost wizards to where they must go. Harry goes to Diagon Alley, to get his books and things for school. Then he is told by Ron's father that he is being hunted by a murderer that broke out of the prison of Azkaban, the prison no one has ever escaped. That is where this story begins.This is the first Harry Potter movie that, in my mind, is a good movie. The acting was by far best in this one, with excellent performances by Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney, David Thewlis as Professor Lupin, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Also the new actor for Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, does a good job. The new director Alfonso Cuaron does an admirable job trying to bring this story to life, but I think he could have done a better job sticking with the books story-line instead of one just based on the books.	3.0	Good, but I was still expecting a little more	2004-12-06	1	0	1

Though I haven't seen the movie yet, it's not looking too good so far and I've found in previous years that I'm pretty good at judging films just from their trailers. Firstly, what's with the wardrobe. In the previous two films you would never see Hermione, Harry,and Ron in regular clothes. Secondly, the scene with the boggart looks horrible, Serius Black doesn't look at all very kind or as J.K. Rowling descrbes him. Also, over half of the scenes in the trailer are from Hosmeade. Finally I don't even recognize what's going on throughout half of the trailer and I've read the books nearly a dozen times. The first film was excellent, other than the special effects. The second film would have been excellent had they left just a couple of the deleted scenes in to slow the pace down a bit (and cut that horrible ending where everyone claps for Hagrid for two minutes and the House Cup is totally left out). And this third film seems to be gettng even worse. Alfonso Cuoron doesn't seem to be keeping the films very unified. I think it would have helped so much if the series would have had the same director throughout.	3.0	Based on the trailer...	2003-11-18	17	4	13

Unfortunately I did see a review and knew that the director was planning on them wearing their muggle clothes more and it may have drawn my attention to it more than it would have had I not heard about it before hand.  So, if this review did the same to someone else, I apologize.  I do plan on buying the movie anyway.  Maybe the next time I will be able to get past the clothes and just enjoy the movie.

The theatrical release of the movie was a disappointment, but I had high hopes for the DVD release.The theatrical release of the movie lacked so much information it barely resembled the book. The story seems rushed and compressed to allow the run-time of the movie to fit into the attention span of a 4 year old. The characters are supposed to evolve and grow in the book, but in the movie they are stagnant and predictable. We know Harry is a powerful wizard, we know Hermione is very intelligent. But why has Ron become a wimpy, sniveling and outrageously cowardly character? He is very different from the Ron who plays wizard chess and sacrifices himself to allow Harry to continue in the first movie. But enough about the movie itself...The DVD is also a disappointment. I was hoping to see the gaggle of deleted scenes that were in the book but cut from the movie to produce such a phenomenally mediocre debacle. But the DVD only contains five deleted scenes. And those scenes are just an extra 10-20 seconds of things that did not need to be in the movie; so I guess I'm glad he deleted them. The cast and crew features are simply a list of the actors and their role in the film. The tours are a bore. The games are confusing and rely on your ability to handle your remote control, and the responsiveness of your DVD player.Overall, it is not bad and it is not good, it is simply mediocre.	3.0	The movie wasn't great but the DVD could be better	2004-11-27	5	3	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AYVC7GGWPIMEM	Caitlin Gulliford	As a fan of the movie it would be hard not to give this DVD set a good rating. However, I felt that the performace of the special qualities on these discs were fun and easily accessible. Like the DVD's previous to this one, the special features section is glittered with Harry Potter-ish designs to keep the viewer entertained and delighted at the feel of being apart of the movie. Unlike it's predecessors, to access the special features you don't have to go through non-sense games that make you feel embarassed that you are actually doing this if you are above the age of 7. There are good interviews with the cast (although the talking head was more of a moment killer than comical relief), a great interview with J.K. Rowling and Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n for fans of the book series, and fun interactive tours of the sets. I would definately suggest this as a gift to any fan, or even a guilty pleasure for one's self!	5.0	Not Four Discs, Yet Still Entertaining	2005-08-09	1	0	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABIK58VPYZL0H	Caitlin	As I read over the reviews, I noticed that a lot were from a young child's perspective. Well, I am 19 years old and asolutely loved this film. 'Philosoper's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets' were good films on their own, but the Chris Colombus took such great pains into making the movies exactly like the books so that even the completely unecessary information was in there. It made for an occasionally boring movie.What Alfonso Cuaron did was cut all the extraneous scenes while still relaying the plot line of the story. Yes, I was disappointed by the lack of Quidditch and the amount of backstory they gave on Harry's parents but it was still a greatly entertaining movie. It was more action-packed and had a much more mature feel to it - I think that's where the bad reviews are coming from.J.K. Rowling, the author of the series, had said many times that the books are going to get darker, scarier and more mature as the sudents get older. I think that Cuaron did a wonderful job realizing that and it showed in his movie. A lot of children may not enjoy this because it wasn't a play-by-play like 'Philosopher' and 'Chamber.' Teenagers and adults will be able to appreciate this film much more due to the way Cuaron directed it.And remember, J.K. Rowling had to have approval on the final script and the omissions it made. She obviously approves of this film. She even said on her website that she loved it and it was her favorite of the films so far. And if it's good enough for the author - the creator - of the series, it's good enough for me.	5.0	Best Harry Potter Film Yet	2004-10-09	21	16	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1GHUN5HXMHZ89	"C. A. Luster ""The Rook"""	My wife and I both loved this movie. She filled in the things that happened in the book that weren't in the movie, but in truth I don't think the fact that the movie didn't cover all the Quidditch match and a couple other things hurt the movie. My wife agreed and she has read all the books at least twice. If you resolve yourselve to voting negative on movies that don't equal the book, you will be voting negative on every movie ever made. They just can't do the books justice. It is physically impossible. So either stick to only reading books or be forgiving of the imperfection of movies. Now once you realize that you can start enjoying the movies for what they are, a nice rendition of part of the book that you can actually see on a big screen.Put yourself in the directors shoes, you can't make this movie to long or people will get bored. Now you must make it exciting and different from the previous movies, so you leave out things that have all ready been done such as a important Quidditch match. To be honest if I had to sit through a big Quidditch match again I might have walked out of the movie. It isn't that I dislike Quidditch, I just don't see the point of eating up movie time in every Harry Potter movie with a match. I say bravo director for cutting the match out and showing the things that were important and new. Anyone that says this wasn't exciting and fresh, is missing something. The addition of new characters and the new storyline was fascinating to me. I loved how they let me realize what was really going on. After the initial introduction of the chain of events I had my suspicions but it was unveiled to me in a delightful way that did not spoil anything.I loved the creatures added in this movie and the more adult storyline. After all Harry is growing older just like he does in the books. The tension builds like in the previous movies but this story was darker yet stronger than the previous movies. Don't get me wrong each movie has something that makes it special. I enjoy the child like innocence in the first two movies. Although that is no longer present here, it does not mean that this and future movies will not have a different more adult quality that are appealing. Just don't be surprised if the very small children don't enjoy them quite as much. Not recommended for small children since some early scenes will frighten them and not be explained till late in the movie.I realize most children will give me negative votes because they can't possibly comprehend that the movie can't be made exactly like the book. It's the adults that worry me. They should understand an inkling of what goes into making a movie and yet they freely criticize directors and studios as though it would have been a piece of cake to make the movie just like the book. I suggest you pay closer attention. Name me any three movies that are exactly like the books. Now if you somehow managed to come up with three, how many of those were hits at the box office? John Grisham, Thomas Harris, and Michael Crichton are three authors that books and movies are great. We all know though that the movies were not exactly like the books. The movies never are exactly like the books. This movie is no exception to that, and it is still a great movie well worth seeing and owning on DVD.	5.0	My wife reads the books, and we both watch the movies	2004-08-17	5	1	4

Let me explain.  It may have left out some of the details of the plot, although if you look carefully there are many little hints throughout the movie that allure to events from the book that probably only those who read them can catch, but the spirit of the book was much more like J K Rowling.  It was full of this playful sarcastic humor, rather than the fairly straightforward and everyday humor of the first two movies.  This truly brought out the feel of the wizarding world.  Also, the actors did a much better job this time around, and I thought the darker scenery of the movie is a good reflection on how much darker the books get further in the series...

There were very few light or comical moments in this one, aside from when Hermione punches Draco Malfoy. Go Hermione!! Also, I absolutely did NOT care for the new Dumbledore.

Just as the first two movies this movie keeps your interest.  Yet, my only flaw is that the 3rd book is full of so much it is hard to cut it down into one movie...I heard Movie 4 will be in two parts...which I think I may like better.  I wasn't feeling this movie as much as the first two although the more I watch it the more I get caught up in the movie.This book Harry doesn't deal with Voldemort but Sirus Black who they feel is a follower of Voldeort.  Harry runs away from his home because it is his last straw at the Dursleys.  On his way to Hogwarts Harry is encountered by dementors and is challenged in his wizardry.  I think that Prof. Trelawney is funny and well acted.  I think my favorite besides Harry is Ron though Rupert is great and his faces can entertain you alone.  Over-all this movie is well made for what content it had to work with.  I also love the Harry Potter books so much that even though I enjoy the movies the books are better.  If you liked 1 or 2 movies then you will also love this one.	4.0	The Wizard is back...	2005-02-08	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2D33W69ZMFGM3	catharine	Overall,I liked the way Alfonso Cuaron directed this movie, but I'm glad he isn't directing any more of the Harry Potter films.I thought that, visually, it was the best film yet. Chris Columbus (director of the first two Potter films) went a bit over the top and made everything  look like it was covered in stardust or something. It was kind of a relief to see that Cuaron did not do the same. His approach to the visual aspects of the film was much grittier and geared toward a bit older audience, which was appropiate because Prisoner of Azkaban is the first book in the series to get into slightly more adult themes. I was also impressed with the way lighting was used to give an entirely different feel to some of the same sets.What I was not impressed with was the story-telling. Unlike the first two films, it didn't come close to doing justice to the book. Important parts of the story, such as the origin of the Marauder's Map, were left out completely, while uneccesary (and extremely cheesy) parts were added in. I was especially disgusted by the adding in of a sappy, worn-out speech Sirius gives to Harry at the end of the film, and by the painfully drawn-out version of Harry's flight on Buckbeak. They could have left out that cheesebally stuff and used the extra time to put in the story of the Marauder's Map, which is one of the best parts of the book.	4.0	improved in some ways, cheapened in others	2004-08-07	7	6	1

I just much preferred Alfonso Cuaron's interpretations.  I like the fact that it's much darker than the first two.  The humour is sublte and the transitions from one scene to the other are great.  The new whomping willow has attitude and spunk.  Who'd have thought that a tree would have such traits?  There is one issue with which I was quite disappointed, and that was when Harry conjures up his Patronus when the Dementors were after him and Sirius.  It's just that what I saw wasn't how I'd imagined it.  What I had imagined was that his partonus would chase the dementors away and not just stand there and glow...Otherwise, the movie is great to watch, though I can understand why younger childern may get scared at some points...but kudos to Alfonso Cuaron because I think the movie looks and is great.	5.0	Better than the first two	2005-08-30	0	0	0

There are major parts in the books that are missing, and random parts in the movie that are not in the books. Dumbledore is all right, but I liked Richard Harris better. I also prefer the music in this one. I'm giving it three stars because it is a good movie, if you haven't read the books, but have been watching the movies, then you wouldn't notice things that aren't in the book, or missing parts. Hopefully Goblet of Fire will be better. Also, they changed the DVD case, and now it doesn't have a slipcover, which I liked better. The acting is still just as good as it was in the Chamber of Secrets. The major dissapointment in this movie is the scenes they added / removed.

Cunningham ""Cris Cunningham"""	My first thought is to mention that although the book scared me to death (and I loved every minute of it!), the film was far less sinister. Nevertheless, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n brillantly captures the mood of Azkaban in this third installment of the Harry Potter film series.A few elements that stick out in my mind -- (1) watching Emma Thompson as the mystical and eccentric Professor Trelawney. She really captured the essence of this character beautifully in what is no doubt an unusual role for her. (2) The time-turn sequence with Emma Watson and Danielle Radcliffe -- absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!!!!! It really ties together several loose variables in the film. I just wish they explained a bit more about Hermoine's class overload and why the necklace was indeed a necessity for her. In the film it seemd like more of a novelty object than a necessary tool. (3) new cast members David Thewils as Professor Lupin and Michael Gambon ias Dumbledore. Both were excellent, although I do miss Richard Harris' on screen presence.Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful, exciting, fast-paced adventure. It was wonderful to see how much the original three actors have matured through the years, both physically and professionally.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AJBW5CUY8WUU3	CDC	First, this is a film, not a movie.  What most of the reviews posted seem to miss is that J.K Rowling asked that this film not be another unimaginative literal translation of her books.  She wanted a film that complimented the books and encouraged Alfonso Cuaron to find his own voice in creating it.  And it was a huge success.  This is an amazing film about an extraordinary boy entering into the difficult and often painful period of adolescence.  While the first two movies were tedious translations of words to visual that offered no additional insight into any character or event, this film challenges you.  I had actually given up any desire to see the movies, because I had already read the books.  I don't need to have them read to me again.  In fact, I have told people to either read the books or watch the movies, but there was no need to do both.  But, this film left me stunned, excited and wanting to see it again.  This is what a true director does.  Cuaron has taken the essential plot and created a study of youth that underlines the themes already present in the books.  Who knew these kids could act and not just recite lines?  Every performance in this film is right on the mark.  The visuals are stunning and the darker color tones used throughout lend to the emotional atmosphere.  Overall, this is a film for thinkers.  It is not the typical Hollywood schlock without which the American public cannot seem to exist.  If you have no imagination, don't see this film.  If you want someone to spoon-feed you the story that you just read, don't see it.  If you love these characters and want to see an exciting film based on a great book that adds a whole new layer to the Harry Potter stories, then this is a film for you.	5.0	Finally!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1UX0L4L81QVS5	Centhena	"I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. My husband and I took the kids to see this film in the theater and I left horribly disappointed though they all, having never read the books, loved it. It was seriously rushed. The most important part of the book, in my opinion, was not given the attention it needed. The entire telling of Sirius's innocence and Scabber's really being Peter Petigrew lasted all of about 5 minutes when in actuality it was over an hour. Now of course they can't and won't make it take that long it would be ridiculous but they didn't have to rush through one of the most important pieces of the entire plot of the story. There was no explination of Trelawney's prediction or it's relevance. There was no mention of who Messers, Moony Wormtail,Padfoot, and Prongs were. No mention of James being Prongs and the relevance to Harry's patronus beign a stag, which in itself was very downplayed. They completely removed the fact that Ron and Hermione had a huge parting of the ways. The added bits to the time turning section were ridiculous. I can understand wanting to add more of Lupin as a werewolf for dramatic effect but really it could have been done better. ""Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?"" This is probably the line that offends me most. They wasted time with trivial things that weren't even in the book instead of putting in actual elements of the story. There was no reason to completely cut out Christmas it was like the whole movie happened in a span of 2 weeks because of this. And in doing so had to put his recieving his firebolt at the end of term. Which of course caused Ron's recieving of Pigwidgeon to be completely removed from they story. Preytell what exactly did he ride through out the rest of the Quidditch season? Since they did show his broom being smashed up are we to assume he rode a school broom which didn't happen? Not to mention they completly cut out Harry meeting Cho scaring the pants off Malfoy and Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup. Though Cho will be added in later the moment for Harry's patronus charging down Malfoy is lost. Though the second match is not that missed the last and final match was a rather important victory for Harry. It probably would have only taken an additional 20 minutes of film to show just about all of this since most of it happened around the same time. Quidditch being the exception. This is my favorite of all the books and perhaps I am a little overly critical but it is my opinion.I did go and watch the movie again and on the second go around I caught things that I had origionally missed. This is definatly a movie that you have to see more than once to really get the whole of the story that they have bothered to tell. This of course is due to the horrible rushedness of the movie. Upon my second and eventual third watching of this film I came to like it much better although the important missing elements and the changed and additional content still do not sit well with me the movie as it is is rather good. Although critical I like the movie and will buy it.I personally think that the directing of the first two were much better and the feel of the movies were better. Buckbeak was amazing though as was the flying scene and the Quidditch match although I didn't really see the point in making the dementors fly since they didn't. The cold and freezing water were nice touches though brought the feeling alive for the unread audience. Most of my problems with the movie can't be blamed solely on Cuaron though. Most of what I have a problem with are with the screenplay by Steven Kloves. If I had not watched the interviw with Jo speaking about the screenplay I'd never have believed she approved of it. And if i dind't know that he had written the screenplays for the other two movies I would never have thought this work done by the same person. But as long as she's approving then that's all that really matters as it's her work.The acting was wonderful and I think that Daniel, Emma, Rupert, and Tom are growing very well if their talents and sincerly hope they will continue to take on the rolls throughout. I also sincerly wish that Richard Harris had been able to complete the films as Dumbledore. It's just not the same without him. He was an amazing Dumbledore. Just exactly as I had envisioned him as I read. I am not fond of Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore. Instead of portraying him as an imensely powerful figure who is kind and caring as well as a little mad he portrays him as mostly just mad. Since the screenplay removed most of his ""fatherly advice"" and gave it to either Sirius or Lupin he seems to be a person who is just there, a person who not important or powerful.Although the majority of this review sounds like one giant bash I would like to reiterate that I do like and enjoy this movie. It just took me some time to get over my disappointment. I had been expecting another Chris Columbus film even though I knew the director had been changed. I had expected the film to follow the same feel of the previous two and be as close to text as they had been. It was in this that I was disappointed. Overall it is an excellant movie though it does not tell the story as I would have."	4.0	Opinion of an avid book fan	2004-08-16	5	5	0

The atmosphere of this movie is darker than the previous two and it is great to see the same actors/actresses back to play the characters we know. Harry's Aunt blowing up and floating away and the ride on the Knight Bus adds a little silliness to the film. Harry is starting to rebel a little which makes him identifiable to our own behaviors as kids when we rebelled or got upset or lost our temper. This helps add to Harry's character and make him seem, for all the magic in the world, seem so ""normal"" to us. The story seems to have passed character development for the most part and focused more on where the story is going, what has happened before (the parents and friends of our heros/heroinne now), and does a great job of using ""time"". We learn more about the dark past with Lord Voldemort, meet new characters (Prof. Lupin and Sirius), and established characters such as Haggrid and Draco seem to really come of age for lack of a better term."	5.0	Darkness Falls	2009-07-24	1	1	0

The DVD of the FRIENDS season was a sure hit, as was the novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and my magazine subscriptions to PEOPLE and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.  So, as usual, I was right on the target with HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER.In HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione return as teenagers to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard.&quot;We couldn't be more excited about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban being in the hands of such a relentlessly imaginative director as Alfonso Cuar'n and are thrilled about the new actors he has assembled to join our already established cast,&quot; said David Heyman.&quot;To be entrusted with such rich and beloved material, and given the opportunity to collaborate with this extraordinary cast and crew on the next Harry Potter adventure is an honor,&quot; Alfonso Cuar'n said. &quot;I look forward to bringing this intricate story to the screen and sharing it with film audiences around the world.&quot;&quot;I'm so proud to have been involved in this truly amazing film series, both as a director and a producer,&quot; added Chris Columbus. &quot;I look forward to seeing it grow as Alfonso and the cast and crew further our imaginations with their truly inspired work.&quot;Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black, the eponymous prisoner whose escape is thought to pose a great threat to Harry Potter; Michael Gambon plays the role of Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' venerable headmaster; Timothy Spall portrays Peter Pettigrew, an old friend of Harry's father, James Potter, from their days at Hogwarts; David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor who harbors a mysterious secret; Pam Ferris plays Harry's overbearing Aunt Marge; and Paul Whitehouse portrays Sir Caddogan, a Knight who becomes the temporary guardian of Gryffindor Tower.	4.0	Pretty good--not the book, but good anyway	2005-07-17	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ELZ5B0TVZDZQ	Charles E. Brown Jr.	"I found this the least satisfactory of the films.  The new director apparently took it for granted that the audience had read the books and didn't find it important to explain things.  Not only that, he sabotaged the screenwriter's plot exposition: when Fudge is explaining the resolution of the Aunt Marge plot the director tries to distract the audience with a dancing hunchback; later when McGonagall explains Black's (supposed) crimes to Rosmerta, the director has Fudge blocking the view of the women talking.  Then Hermione just happens to have a time-travel charm on her necklace -- no explanation of how she got it, or why she didn't use it earlier.Some good ideas: having the choir sing Shakespeare's ""Someone wicked this way comes""; the talking head; the idea of having the students dress in normal clothes instead of robes during their off hours (presumably Rowling agreed, and the subsequent movies followed it up); Thewlis, with that sickly look, was the perfect choice for Lupin.  But the central story ought to make sense."	3.0	The least of the 6 movies so far	2010-02-05	2	1	1

You know....watching a movie is supposed to be an experience. It's that experience that makes one feel the way they do (good or bad) when they watch a movie. Streaming on Amazon Prime is not the best experience for watching movies...in fact it's far inferior to that of watching on DVD/Blu Ray or at the theatre. It is for that reason alone that I rate this movie a 4. If streaming was better than it currently is...I would have given it a 5.	4.0	Streaming on Prime	2014-01-13	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A142W8NH9SRXS0	"Chay Chay Walker ""DVD and book reviewer"""	Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have become household names thanks to their starring roles in the three Harry Potter films, based on the best-selling books by J.K Rowling. The newest installation is, by far, the best of the three movies.There have been plenty of changes from the past two films. The actor playing Dumbledore has been replaced, and there is now a rubber band around his beard, which keeps on bothering me throughout the entire film. If he's going to play the same character then he should look like the same character-why would Dumbledore tie up his beard? It just doesn't make any sense. The spot of director has also been changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Curan. This is a good change, because Mr. Curan did a good job, especially since the second Harry Potter film is, by far, the worst of the three.The plot is that Harry Potter is continuing his studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy with his two best friends-Ron and Hermione. Harry is not normal, though, and there is a serial killer on the loose-Sirius Black. Harry's parents were killed by a dark wizard named Voldemort, and rumors had it that Sirius was a supporter of Voldemort, therefore he wants to kill Harry. Are these rumors really true though? And why has Ron's rat been acting strange lately? These are some of the many questions that arise throughout the movie that are, of course, answered at the very end.This is a well-done film, with great acting from all of the cast. I especially like Emma Watson because of her performance and because of her character, Hermione Granger, which is my favorite character in both the film and book series.This is not my favorite movie, because a lot is missing that made the book really special. A lot of plot lines and characters were either taken out or were downplayed, which is never much fun to watch. There's the thing with Dumbledore's beard, and the spookiness of dementors which are the wizard prison guards. I think the special effects teams went over-the-top with these, especially since THEY KNOW that a lot of children will be watching their film and may end up having nightmares. That's how freaky the dementors are.	4.0	Harry, Ron, and Hermione-The Third Time Around	2005-02-01	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANBSW3BALFRR2	Chet Fakir	I've read all the Harry Potter books and very much enjoyed the first two movies. So I was greatly anticipating this new, darker installment to the Potter movies. But this movie is a major disappointment. The direction, and especially the art direction, are completely misguided and poor at best. I wonder if the director even read the book?  The magic and wonder that permeated the first two movies is completely missing and an element of drab, shabbyness has been introduced.  Hogwarts looks like a dirty, grey gothic castle, and Hogmeads looks like a drab, colorless place that I wouldn't want to visit.  Where's the magic, warmth and color?  The characters no longer wear robes, but jump around in dirty sweatpants and jackets. What happened to the school uniforms?  The movie looks shabby and the color scheme is primarily a depressing shade of blue.  Even the first scene where Harry inflates his aunt Marge was disappointing, she was much nastier and comically pompous in the book.In fact everything is much worse than the book, which is not something I would say about the first two Potter movies. The director, Alfonso Cuaro'n, misses many nuances of the characters and plot and in my opinion sucks (why in hell did they use this jerk?).  Bring back Chris Columbus who did the first two.  He paid attention to the book's plot and the art direction was a thousand times better.  I understand that Cuaro'n wanted to bring out the darker aspects of the book, but he went way too far and over the top and changed the plot for the worse in many instances.For example (and these are only just a few) Hermione's reason for having the time turner was barely mentioned until the end of the movie and there was very little questioning of Hermione as to her unexpected appearances/absenses or mention of her taking extra classes by Harry and Ron. It was briefly touched upon. Prof. Dumbledoor has all the gravitas and power of Barney Fife but with a third of the personallity, HORRIBLE casting on his part. Prof. Lupin had a completely different look than described in the book and the werewolf was ridiculous looking. Prof. Trelawney was also completely different than the book and might as well have not even been in the movie for all her character contributed, and Crookshanks barely appeared and his enmity towards Scabbers is never touched upon. The relationship between James and Lily Potter, Sirius Black, Lupin and Peter Pettigrew isn't clear. No mention is made as to who Mooney, Padfoot , Wormtail and Prongs are or what their relationship they have to the Marauders Map or how Lupin knew it was a map or how to use it!  The dementors couldn't fly dammit, and didn't attack Harry in the air during a Quidditch match and on and on and on. The only thing in this movie that is worth a damn is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black, which was spot on, ie properly psychotic. If you are a fan of the books as I am, you most likely won't like this movie because it leaves so much out.  If you've only seen the movies, you may find this train wreck enjoyable, I didn't.  But I have to say you'll probably be confused  because of the poor editing and direction. In future I won't be going to see another Potter movie and will instead read the books.  Perhaps one star is too low a rating, but I feel disappointed.Update to the review: I for reasons known only to myself watched this awful movie again and have to say that one star is more than appropriate. The movie really rates negative points. BTW Harry's Patronus was not a blob of light as portrayed in the movie, but a frigging stag. I hope Cuaron rots in hell.	1.0	What a disappointment!	2004-12-28	22	14	8

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AY619EO3D9PR5	ChowhoundPlus	This movie captured the many striking elements of the book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  As the book represented a sort of turning point for the Potter series, so does the film.  Keep in mind that this vision of the novel--for it's not a rote, verbatim adaptation, and is in line with Rowling's wishes--is Alfonso Cuaron's. He owns this film, and he brings out the tension and excitement from the young stars in a way that makes the characters seem real.It's by turns hilarious, poignant, nerve-wracking (even when I already knew the plot!), frightening, and non-stop.  A great flick, fun for any age.  Also it has John Williams' best score in many years.	5.0	Full of fun, spookiness, and Potter quirkiness	2004-09-09	7	1	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AOKF42APFHSZ3	Chrestomanci	There seems little point in me writing a synopsis - or indeed, telling you about the film itself. Chances are you've already seen it, as this was one of the most popular films of 2004.  Some think this the best of the 3 HP films so far - others think it a disappointment. I liked it - but didn't entirely like the new layout of Hogwarts, as this seemed to jar when so much effort has been put into seamless continuity from one film to the next.In this case, the DVD extras are nicely done, but pretty standard. However, for fans of Harry Potter, the interview with J K Rowling offers a tantalizing hint at a possible future plotline. She comments that the film includes something NOT in the book - and yet, it is spookily close to something yet to be revealed in a forthcoming book. Interesting! Especially interesting as much of the film is so very closely adapted.My personal theory is that she was referring to the dialogue between Harry and Professor Lupin, in which Lupin infers that he and Lily might have been 'close' before she married James.Anyway, buy the DVD, watch the interview and re-watch the film ... and see what you think JK is referring to!	5.0	Is there a clue in the Interview?	2005-02-22	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"""Not all wizards are good,"" Hagrid told Harry before he ever passed through the gates at Hogwarts.  In the third installment of the franchise Harry learns that not all wizards--even good ones--are quite what they seem.  There's Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a recent escapee from the wizards' prison at Azkaban, who is believed to be seeking out our young hero with murderous intent; Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), the as-it-turns-out-far-too-aptly-named new instructor in Defense Against the Dark Arts; classmate Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), who begins to display some real competence at his magical studies; Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), who unexpectedly leaps in to defend Harry and his friends from peril; and even pal Ron Weasley's (Rupert Grint) pet rat Scabbers, who turns out to be the pivot-point of the whole tale.  Michael Gambon ably takes over from the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, and all the old cast, including Hermione Granger, Hagrid, the Weasley family, Draco Malfoy, Fitch, Prof. McGonigle, and the horrible Dursleys, are back in fine form.  Harry begins to realize his true powers in this episode as he learns to summon a protective Patronus spell, and a terrifying new menace, the Dementors, appear, along with a splendid Hippogriff named Buckbeak.  This may be the best of the Potter saga and is certainly required viewing for its fans."	5.0	All is not as it seems at Hogwarts	2010-11-19	0	0	0

I agree that there were ALOT of things left out of the movie, that the book explained, especially who Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs is.The change in Dumbledore was an unfortunate necessity, with the passing of the original Dumbledore character.  Also, I was thrown by the change in Location.  Why the new scenery?I think the new director did capture the darker side of this chapter well enough, and a bit of comedy with the scenes on the Knight Bus, but I think there was still room for more information in backgrounds if they hadn't spent as much time watching Harry fly on Buckbeak (an awesome sight and great effects, but still a bit long).	4.0	Prisoner of Azkaban	2005-01-07	3	3	0

But watching the Columbus films was like eating an angel-food cake: beautiful to look at and it all tastes great, but light and fluffy and not too substantive. Columbus made the Home Alone films, which looked pretty but were weak on story. This movie, however, was exciting and dangerous. Instead of trying to squeeze every last detail of the book into a marathon movie, Cuaron decided to focus on the story itself. The pace and imagery made the entire film feel like a roller coaster ride, with the viewer strapped in beside the main characters. Even though I knew the outcome of the story, I was enthralled and surprised at all of the right places. This movie is definitely darker and more ""witchy"" -- which is kind of what I had hoped would be the case for the first two films.Altogether, Cuaron did an excellent job with this film, and I look forward to seeing his name attached to other Harry Potter films."	5.0	By FAR the best of the films so far	2004-11-22	11	9	2

Sadly, it came to my attention that the studio (WB) decided to release the pricey DVD's  without them being extended.  So we will get the continued documentary and a couple of extras that are pretty pointless and the same movie we have always had.  No matter what the reason was for them releasing it this way, it is very disappointing because they advertised the entire series to be coming out as EXTENDED....I bought the first two (after already owning them on regular edition DVD) only to find out it was a waste of time because the rest of the series may not be extended... what's the point?	1.0	Not Extended = Not Ultimate Edition...	2010-10-18	9	7	2

I don't think he has even read the book thoroughly enough to truly understand it. PoA, my favourite book so far from the series after the 5th, was expected to be the best HP film yet by many Harry Potter fans, but it is the truth that many were disappointed. I used to think JK Rowling was kind of harsh with the whole sticking-to-the-book thing with the Chris Columbus, but now I can see that she said that for a good reason, because PoA turned out to be a wee bit better than just 'crap'.	2.0	Very disappointed.	2004-10-18	33	11	22
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3E327X6O3NYHW	Christi Rockwell	Like so many Harry Potter fans, I couldn't wait to see the newest movie.  Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed.I went to the movie with  a friend who had never read the books and my kids who've read most of the series.  As a stand alone movie I can see how this would be good (all my companions loved it), but it is not just a movie.As with the other movies, I expected that there would be things that were left out.  After all, the books are long and there is only so much you can devote to a movie.  But there were more drawbacks than just details (whole scenes, crucial information, hints) that were left out.  There were also some glaring inaccuracies which made this an extreme disappointment.  Many of the hints of things to come were left out entirely.  The drama surrounding Harry's Firebolt is gone since he doesn't receive the gift at Christmas, but at the end of the movie(?!).  The origins of the Maurader's map are entirely ignored.  Even my friend who's never read the book questioned why the kids didn't have the invisibility cloak with them during the final scenes (something explained well in the book and completely ignored in the movie).  I was particularly disappointed that Harry's encounters with the dementors didn't include the details about the powerful images invoked, but simply left the details into a few brief comments.  The great number of scenes left out is especially disappointing when considering that the series is well crafted with seemingly minor details from an early episode having great significance later.  Altogether too many crucial details have been either ignored or left on the editing room floor.The actors were a mixed bag.  The kids are obviously much older than their characters are supposed to be.  Daniel Radcliffe especially, in my opinion, has difficulty pulling off the role of a 13 year old.  The other kids were also more obviously grown up and less suited to the roles than they were in the previous films.  On the other hand, I was pleased with the additions of Michael Gambon (as Albus Dumbledore), David Thewlis (as Professor Lupin) and Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black).  Gambon was able to capture Dumbledore in a way that seemed true to the character in a way that was different than the late Richard Harris (not that Harris was untrue).  It made me almost wish I could have seen Gambon in the role earlier.  Thewlis was remarkable and seemed to fit rather well.  Oldman was amazing and it was disappointing not to see more of him.	3.0	Not nearly as good as would be expected	2004-06-04	5	4	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3N95R1VKWROWF	Christopher Schwinger	I checked out the Harry Potter series somewhat reluctantly, wanting to appraise for myself the popular hype and religious controversy, including finding out to what extent the series actually promotes occult practices.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the imagination in the first movie and found that other than the name &#34;witchcraft&#34; in the school title, which has always bothered me, it was more of an optimistic and exciting fairy tale than a serious, dark horror movie as I'd anticipated.  Movie 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) is as enjoyable for me as a Disney animated movie like Snow White.  The second movie was a lot more frightening and dark, becoming more like a horror movie, but I hoped that would be the exception in the series.  I gave the series a fair try by reading through book 4 (out of 7) and loved the 3rd book's (Prisoner of Azkaban) tone.  None of the books are &#34;bright&#34;, but book 3 didn't feel anywhere near as dark to me as the 3rd movie.  I don't know if others would agree or not, but I felt like the 3rd book had a lot of enjoyable, lighthearted stuff with &#34;Professor Remus Lupin&#34;, whereas the movie seemed to intentionally avoid having any frivolity.  The replacement Dumbledore actor after Richard Harris died is very pushy and intimidating compared to Richard Harris, also, and I don't know why the new actor didn't just try to imitate the breathiness and nice grandfatherly manner of Richard Harris.  The music in this movie was also much more melancholy than the previous two movies' music.  It's the only movie score by John Williams I have disliked--not on the merits of the music, but because the music darkened the tone of the movie so much, as if the perpetual cloudiness and darker characterizations of Lupin and Dumbledore didn't do that enough already.  If this movie hadn't deliberately tried to take a darker tone, but attempted to keep the same flavor as the first one while being faithful to the plot, I'd have enjoyed it.Definitely J. K. Rowling is a good writer, though I think overly verbose, and the films are made with the best special effects and abridged well from the large books, but this third movie ruined the series for me.  Its tone fits the fourth book better than the third book.  The fourth book, I found about the same time as I saw this Prisoner of Azkaban movie (which is #3 in the series), was an unpleasant experience in that it began to focus the series too much on school terrorism, with you becoming ACCUSTOMED to students and adults getting murdered at school.  I hoped the 2nd book and movie would be the exception in that, but from what I've heard, in every book starting with book 4, more and more characters get killed, often beloved characters, and there's a veritable bloodbath at the end of the series.  (Imagine how it'd feel for half the Fellowship of the Ring to get killed off at the climax of the Lord of the Rings series!)  That is a disturbing thing to regularly find in a fantasy series that is supposed to be for everyone's enjoyment, ESPECIALLY in a school setting.So I'm partly criticizing how this particular movie took an intentionally darker direction than the Prisoner of Azkaban book to the point where I found them hardly comparable, and partly criticizing how the book series shifted the tone into a more macabre direction starting with Barty Crouch and Cedric Diggory getting murdered in book 4, which I find as much a turnoff as the use of the word &#34;witchcraft&#34; in the school name.  I'm not saying it's a turnoff to have murders in a fantasy story, but to have school terrorism be so commonplace made me sick enough that I quit after book 4.  (Since this review concerns the Prisoner of Azkaban movie's same kind of obsession with being intentionally dark and macabre, that was why I mentioned that the book series started to become a turnoff for me the very next book, #4, The Goblet of Fire.  Harry Potter books 1 and 3 weren't as consistently dark and macabre, but starting with this 3rd movie and 4th book, it was mostly incessant.  I did eventually see the 4th movie because I had read the 4th book, even though I strongly disliked the 4th book, but my main criticism in this review is that the 3rd movie darkened the tone far beyond how the 3rd book seemed to me.)Of course I'm in the minority, probably representing less than 1 percent of people who have delved into Harry Potter, but since I have free speech, I wanted to express that I think the Harry Potter series is overrated.  Hopefully, even if you disagree with my assessment that the Prisoner of Azkaban movie is much darker than the book, you'll at least consider what I'm saying about how the series normalizes school terrorism and agree that our culture has become unhealthily saturated with macabre stories.	1.0	Turned me off to seeing any more of the movies	2014-05-07	5	0	5

I do recommend this movie but also have to admit that there were some problems with it and it was far from a perfect telling of the brillient book and story that the fans have come to love.Chris Columbus did a wonderful job with the first two movies, capturing the flavor and story almost too well. Alfonso Cuaron had big shoes to fill and maybe an almost impossible challenge as Columbus set the stakes so high. Overall though he did a good job. But it was far from great and can see where a lot of the fans can think of what could have been rather then what was.Harry Potter starts off his third year as usual. His aunt and uncle making life miserable and his Uncle's sister coming over for a visit makes things even harder. Harry winds up running away from home only to be picked up by a mysterious bus that only wizards can see. He soon finds out that a killer has escaped from the Prison of Azkaban and he is coming for Harry. If that wasn't bad enough the dark dementors from the prison are also searching for the criminal, Sirus Black and they will suck the soul right out of you leaving nothing but a shell of what you once were. Unlucky for Harry they don't hesitate to feed off of Harry at any chance they get. Once back at school Harry has the usual problems. Classes are as hard as ever. Especialy with the new divination class. Hagrid has become the new Care for creatures teacher where Harry meets Buckbeak, a hippogryph that takes an instant liking to Harry. And the new Defense against the dark arts class may be more then he appears. Overall its business as usual for Mr. Potter and it's a fun story that most will enjoy.I am very mixed over all on this movie. I agree with those who loved it and I agree with those who have fault with it. They did a lot right but also missed the boat on a lot of moments too. Cramming a book of that size into a little over 2 hours was probably a mistake. If this movie was 3 hours or even another 40 minutes longer, it would have made up for a lot of parts that were missing or cut due to time. Even without reading the book, the movie does seem choppy. Moments are quickly moved through and important details not even told of. Many things were just awkward and strained and I'm not sure if that was the directors fault or the fact they wanted to make this a 2 hour movie but this should have been the best of the three movies by far , as the book most definitely was but as it stands the movie is good but the first two are supurb. I won't go into everything the movie was missing or the many changes that were made as it is what it is. But the movie wasn't bad either. It had great moments and acting and does cover the main parts of the story even if they are altered and rushed. The movie starts out a bit slow but the ending more then makes up for this.I truly hope that the Goblet of fire will pick up where the first two movies started quality and fullness wise and not worry about cramming as much as they can into 2 hours but letting the story tell it self and give the fans what they have come to expect with the series which is top quality and true to teh story that a lot cherrish and adore. It may be unfair to blame the director for what happend but there is no denying that something went wrong with this movie that should have been a slam dunk easily. The fact that so many are mixed on this means it is far from the case and I do hope that the message is recieved loud and clear for the next movie.If you are fan it is ok to be disapointed as much as it is to love it as one of the best. But however you feel, please do buy this movie and enjoy it. While it may not be perfect as far as the book goes, it still is a lot of fun and has great extras and moments that you won't want to miss. Lets hope the next movie is one that all fans can agree on as Harry Potter is a great series that I hope doesn't go away any time soon. It may have been a step down from what most have come to expect, but it's still one that I will watch often and look for bigger and better things to come.	3.0	Pretty good but could have been much better...	2004-12-11	8	7	1

I am confused as to why people are saying they do not like the movie, I thought the camera work was excellent, The scenery made Hogwarts seem more real and like I imagined it after reading the books( Hagrid's hut and the Whomping Willow being further from Hogwarts), and the acting was awesome ( especially Daniel Radcliffe who has come a long way ). Many people who are loyal to the books like me are disappointed when they see the movie, what we have to remember is that to put all the information from the books into the movie, they would need hours and hours of movie time! Also, things need to be added and/or taken away to make it come to life on film( ex: The Buckbeak flight scene ). In closing I would just like to say I recommend this to all, young and old. It was not a disappointment and I look forward to the DVD in the fall. Thanks also to the director who did a fabulous job, he added some of the imagination and dramatic aspects that were missing from the first two films.	5.0	The Best HP Film Yet	2004-08-04	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1RRSEH8PUPMR3	"Cleopatra Rojas ""CR"""	"I am a huge HP fan right from the beginning.  I was amazed withthe first two movies, they were more than just cinematic special effects works of art but also shockingly true to the books.I wish I could say the same for number 3.  I am a 1st gen. Costa Rican American and was sooo hoping that Alfonso would do all Latinos proud with this movie (though I couldn't help but wonder why WB would fix what was so obviously not broken by removing the first director).  Unfortunately this movie was a sad, saddisappointment.Broken up and disjointed, at turns ludicrously silly and suspenseful this story barely resembles the story that we fans have come to love.  Even if you have never picked up an HP book in your life -unless you are easily wowed by special effects- this will be at best an annoying waste of time you'll never get back.  At least if you have read the books you have some idea where the story is headed, it not this will be a study in confusion.  Alfonso not only took out huge (and in many cases important) chunks of the storyline he also added (in many cases both unneccessary and idiotic)weird bits to the story as well. (The premature and forced romance between Ron and Hermione for instance, was just creepy.  We're talking huge Eeew factor here.) It's almost as if JK Rowling's story just wasn't good enough for our man Alfonso.I have heard many people refer to the ""darkness"" of this 3rd installment.  Wrong.  The real story was much darker.  This was a one dimensional cartoonish look at what was actually one heckuva whopper of a tale.While the acting on the part of the kids has greatly improved the acting for the adults seems to have dwindled (too little time on screen coupled with too little effort).  We saw far too little of the wonderfully sinister Snape for example and far too much of a divination teacher dumbed so far down as to be a caricature.  Emma Thompson did the best she could with what they gave her but it was absolutely painful to watch.  Most of our beloved characters were put on the backburner as Mr. Cuaron seemed determined to share his version of the HP story as opposed to JKR's.In short: choppy, spastic and intrusive directing, odd and bizarre characterizations, lackluster writing and ""after school special"" type over & under acting all adds up to a pretty lukewarm and disappointing movie experience (and a cold slap in the face of true blue loyal HP fans everywhere).  I don't know why WB thought they had to dull and dumb the whole thing down for us.  Do they really think kids don't know an obvious directors ego trip when they see one?  Hey, I'm young not stupid.My advice? Save your money, wait for the Goblet of Fire.  It's got to be better than this."	1.0	Save your money, Save your time...	2004-09-23	26	18	8

The film scenery was gorgeous and took my breath away; the acting was great and the film did a fairly good job following the plot of the book.It's definitely a more emotional, darker, and deeper film than the first two. It's clear that the actors are now teens; Dan and Rupert's voices are deeper and all of them are taller now.I loved that the Quidditch scene weather was realistic; it was November and this time, the weather is shown as a cold, rainy November day. Dan does a fantastic job capturing Harry's fear of the awful, ugly dementors and Harry's tears at finding out about his godfather and how his parents really died.I liked the way the film showed the seasons changing realistically and the mountain scenery was beautiful in addition to Hogsmeade, esp. during the snowy December when they visited.I liked also the deep scenes where Harry forms a bond with Remus Lupin and Lupin reassures Harry that it's not a sign of ""weakness"" that Harry is most affected by the dementors and that Harry faints at the dementors.There's also several foretellings, esp. with the dementors and Harry; in this film, it takes all of Harry's mental and psychological courage to fight the dementors and deal with his fear of them.Of all the acting jobs, Tom Felton did the best job of the young actors in depicting Draco Malfoy's immature bullying and mean-spirited taunting, esp. when Malfoy taunts Harry about his fear of the dementors.  Emma Thompson did the best job of the adult actors; she really portrayed the mysterious, eccentric, and sometimes scary Professor Trelawney to a tee.  It was hard to pick one best, but I'd say those two...Emma and Tom.  All of the actors did a swell job and the film was so true to life.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38U7Z88Q1MDWL	Cody Patton	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie of the Summer '04 season so far. Van Helsing plain stunk. Troy was ok but overall disappointing. This is the real deal (along with the hysterical Shrek 2). It's fun watching such appealing child actors grow up and become even more appealing. The director change worked great to add some edge to the series in this pivotal chapter that sees Hogwarts becoming a much darker, eerier place to go to school, especially if you're Harry Potter.The new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) does his best to fill the late Richard Harris's shoes, to as good effect as possible I think. David Thewlis brings real warmth and mystery to Professor Lupin, and the first scene in his class was probably the most entertaining classroom scene of the series so far. Gary Oldman was the perfect choice for Sirius Black, bringing the perfect blend of acting necessary for the complex character he portrays. The rest of the supporting cast is great business as usual (particularly Alan Rickman as the ever-sneering Professor Snape and Robbie Coltrane as the gentle giant Hagrid).As stated before, the three young leads truly carry this movie (which is appropriate considering their characters carry the weight of the story in the books). Daniel Radcliffe is now irreplacable as Harry. He brings new, more mature elements to the troubled protagonist this time around, and is for the most part believable. Rupert Grint is reliable as usual as Ron, although his character has changed the least and participates less in this one. Emma Watson is truly a starlet in training. She brings equal doses of spunk and charm to Hermione as effortlessly as an accomplished actress twice her age might. How old is she (14 now?)? Wow! I was blown away by her performance and her progress (although she was great in the first two as well!).This was a wonderful film that I have seen twice already and plan to see again. I'll definitely pick this up immediately when it hits DVD. I recommend it to all (although it would be wise to familiarize oneself with at least the first two films if not the books for minumum confusion and maximum enjoyment)! Lovely cinematography, creepy atmospheres, great special-effects, a grand score by old faithful John Williams and a mysterious, involving story make this the most charming and entertaing film the best thing in Hollywood so far this summer.

Who would want to sit through a 5 hour page by page exact visual representation of a 300 page book? Its a disgusting idea. Secondly, I can't sit through a movie and believe that a castle in scotland, has miles of bright green grass surrounding it, its not logical. Its as if Chris Columbus tried desperatly to create some magical land, but ended up creating some sort of childess mess. Thirdly, I think its idiodic for people to believe that if Alfonso Cuaron had created a page by page movie, that it would break records. No one wanted to go to the theatre to SEE a book, a BOOK is meant for READIING, a MOVIE is meant for VIEWING! They are two completly different forms of storytelling.Now to the Good stuff. My favorite part of the newest movie is how the director doesn't just shove magic under your nose and is like ""this is magic, except it"". He creates a world filled with magic, if you watch closely in such seens as the leaky cauldron and the shreiking shack. Sure they perform spells, but its not SOO stupid looking. The dialogue is much better too, the books are not aimed at 3 year olds, therefor the movies should not be, (Even if it was a page by page, the dialogue would be less childess, Chris really needs to learn his stuff) The Dialouge in this movie is much more complex, and deep.The only thing that I can think of thats terrible is the final shot of harry on his broom, its idiodic. but thats only maybe 2 seconds, otherwise if I am interested in watching a HP MOVIE~(not read a book) this would be the first one I would reach for."	5.0	PLease	2004-09-09	11	4	7

JK Rowlings ability to write inspires you to not read a childrens novel, but to read a novel that spans the generations.The movies though can be a whole new experince, when JK Rowling is only on the side, and a director is given a chance to do the movies with there own styles, and to create a new experince for fans of the books, and those who just enjoy a good movie.The themes of the books, and of the movies is a powerful one.From what we have seen at this point through trailers, teasers, pictures, and information from the set itself, this movie looks to be huge, possibly bigger then the first two. Prisoner of azkaban has been noted by many to be there favorate, and so its likly people will do what I allready do, and see it 3-4 times. yes, I know, im 20, but its still a age less story that touches the hearts of many, and is worth a look.as I have not seen this movie, I am going by the quality of the past two movies, and by what we have seen. as such I give it a 4, though that may change come june 4th.I recomend this movie for anyone looking to enter a world that may be fantasy, that feels real, because the charactors deal with everything you would expect a 13 year old to deal with, and then some.	4.0	Something wicked this way comes	2004-03-28	1	0	1

The trio has also improved their acting skills quite nicely.  And the additions to the cast--Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, etc.--were all fantastic.But to me, this film was a disappointment.  There were so many things that were left out and/or not explained that I spent the entire time wondering what was going on even though I'd read the book (for the umpteeth time)only the previous week.No explanation of the Marauder's Map, which is vital to the plot of the book and explains how Professor Lupin (and Sirius Black, for that matter) knows so much about Harry's parents.  The grounds of Hogwarts was completely different from the first two movies.  The kids were dressed in Muggle clothing (which actually wasn't all that bad, although Hermione looked like a Pink Power Ranger).  The script writer gave Hermione all of Ron's lines and made her sound completely out of character.  Ugh.I understand that they could not include everything in the book but the things they left out made the movie seem chopped up--or like a puzzle where someone had put the pieces all back in the wrong order and tried to pass it off as the original picture.I hate to think of the people who had never read the book.  I'm sure they were wondering what the heck was going on most of the time.Overall, nice to look at, but disappointing for those that like to stick to canon.	2.0	Visually Stunning But Still Lacking	2004-08-16	5	5	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.....especially now that it's available with a great Blu-Ray transfer.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark and annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound to go along with this new high-definitiion disc.  I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.	5.0	My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Film	2008-11-15	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	As the Harry Potter books become bigger and bigger, more must be left out to make the film fit in the allowable 2 - 2.5 hours running time.  Thus, the burden falls on the scriptwriter to include enough of the detail of Rowling's book so that the series is advanced, but not so much that the film becomes confusing for those that haven't read the book.  This film seems to reach that fine balance (that forever eluded Peter Jackson in the LotR films).  Thus, it is enjoyable for those that only know Harry Potter from the previous films, and includes enough inside jokes and plots to satisfy the fans of the books.The story: Sirius Black, convicted of murder and betraying Harry's parents to the evil wizard Voldemort, has been in the wizards' prison of Azkaban for the last 13 years.  When he escapes, it's widely assumed he will come after Harry, so the prison's guards - spectral horrors called Dementors - are dispatched to Hogwarts School to protect Harry and the other students.  Meanwhile, Harry has more mundane but no less important (to him) issues - teachers he hates, an unsigned permission slip, and battles with his rival Draco Malfoy.The new director, Alfonso Cuaron, brings a brand new look to Hogwarts, now situated in the rough and rugged Scottish mountains.  The school looks completely at home there, and one of the joys of the film is the mixture of the fantastic (hippogriffs, etc.) superimposed on the gorgeous scenery.  The Dementors are especially well-envisioned.  They are as creepy as the books suggest - so much so that younger viewers (say, less than age 10) might find them too intense.  However, the Harry Potter books grow steadily more mature and dark as the characters age - it's only right that the films follow suit.Purists will argue that many events and characters are left out of the film.  This is missing the point - the film itself is enjoyable on its own and self consistent, which is what is important.  This DVD edition looks great, as expected.  There are a few extras of varying quality.  There are a number of silly games involving the arrow keys on the standard DVD remote, but they seem rather pointless.  The interviews with the cast members (in small groups) are quite good, and there are some multi-angle features that allow you to explore the Hogwart's universe, which Potter fanatics will appreciate.	4.0	A good adaptation leads to an enjoyable film	2004-11-29	3	1	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BT578J4IZOK6	"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua"""	"Based on J. K. Rowling's book, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" covers the boy wizard's third year at Hogwarts and hit the big screen in 2004. The film opens at Privet Drive with the end of the summer holidays approaching. The previous summer, at the start of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry had been blamed by the Ministry of Magic for a spell performed by Dobby the House Elf in Dursley's house. This summer, Harry panics as he accidentally casts a spell on Uncle Vernon's thoroughly obnoxious sister. Knowing he's in trouble, he decides to go on the run - but, following a bumpy ride on the Knight Bus, the Minister for Magic corners him at Diagon Alley. Harry is somewhat surprised to be let off, given the trouble he got into the previous year - but relieved all he same.The Magic Community seems to be much more concerned with a very dangerous criminal called Sirius Black, the first person to escape from Azkaban (the wizard prison). He had been sent there after being found guilty of murdering thirteen people - twelve of them muggles - with a single curse about twelve years earlier. Widely believed to have been a big supporter of Voldemort's, the rumour is he's hunting for Harry. As a result, some Azkaban guards (terrifying creatures, known as Dementors) have been posted at Hogwarts for the protection of the pupils and staff.Harry is, once again, joined by Ron and Hermione at Hogwarts. There's a bit of trouble between Harry's two friends, however. Much of that is caused by Hermione's new pet Crookshanks - a crazy cat, who seems determined to kill Scabbers, Ron's rat, at every opportunity. This year's Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, is Professor Lupin who - like the Dementors, the three friends meet him for the first time on the Hogwarts Express. Despite the fact he dresses rather shabbily and gets strangely ill from time to time, Lupin actually seems to know what he's doing. He also proves to be highly popular with the majority of pupils, particularly Harry. There are a couple pf other new teachers introduced this year - one of them is Hagrid, who has taken over the Care of Magical Creatures class. Unfortunately, his first lesson leads to a bit of trouble with a Hippogriff. Another is Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher - who seems to be a bit of a crackpot. In their first lesson, she somehow picks out the Grim (a death omen) from Harry's tealeaves. Harry probably wouldn't have been too worried, only he'd already seen something of a death omen just as he was boarding the Knight Bus.The movie is very enjoyable, though a good deal darker than I had imagined. Despite the criticism I've heard of their performances in the previous films, I thought Daniel Ratcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were very good in their roles. (Draco, Harry's arch nemesis, would've stolen the show had his role been any bigger : Tom Felton plays the part of a strutting, arrogant, little twerp superbly. One of the most enjoyable scenes came when Hermione puts him firmly in his place). Professor Trelawney was also an enjoyable addition, played by the barely recognisable Emma Thompson. (Her ex-husband, of course, was also once on the teaching staff at Hogwarts : Ken Brannagh played the part of Gilderoy Lockhart in ""The Chamber of Secrets""). For fans of the Stone Roses, meanwhile, Ian Brown stops by the Leaky Cauldron for a quick drink. The film's effects are hugely impressive, especially the Dementors : their first appearance on the train was the best scene in the film for me. Parts of the book have been minimised or dropped - particularly the 'history' of the Marauder's Map, its authors and how Lupin knew how to use it. However, it's a very enjoyable movie and is highly recommended."	4.0	Dementors, Mad Dogs and a Howling Wolf	2006-05-20	0	0	0

While the first two movies were a little childish (OK I admit I still like them) but they were great movies, a little bright (TOO bright) and even though they don't explain much about the story, they're fun. And in the third movie, all the fun was left out.2. It get's as far away of the books as it can. A lot of things are left out like the Marauder's Map history and Lupin's, Sirius', Peter's, and Jame's past. The only things that are exactly as they should be, are the Dementors and the Time-Turner, but they don't even have 30 minutes in the movie!!!!!3. It's SOOOOO BORING!!! This is the kind of material that they play at your local retirement home so old people go to sleep. All Harry does in the movie is talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, and TALK with Lupin, and the cool bits don't even last like 5 minutes.4. The scene in the Shrieking Shack is too short, and while all the characters there fight and start telling the REAL story about Sirius and stuff, you're wondering what is going on there. YOU don't understand anything!!!!!! To understand the movie really well I had to see it a thousand times and read the books before I understood what was really going on.5. It's not a very easy movie to follow... WHY? Because when everything ""good"" is happening you're already sleeping.I've got a very long list about how BORING and BAD this movie is, I don't know how JKR could hire someone as Alfonso Cuaron to direct what might have been the best HP movie ever (or at least until The Goblet of Fire comes to theaters). If you want the movie because you like it, good, if you just buy it because you're loyal to Harry Potter and without this movie collection wouldn't be complete (like me), good, but if none of those two apply with you, then this is not a good movie for you."	2.0	Disgraceful movie	2005-09-28	11	8	3

A couple of them are....When Harry meets the dementors on the train, he says he hears a woman scream.  But it's never mentioned again during the film.One more is the fact that they never explain why the dementors are after Harry in the first place.  They are supposed to be searching for Sirius Black.However, I've never read the novels, just seen the movies.  Maybe in the novel they explain all these things.  Even the humor in the movie was dull.

This UE bluray set was released yesterday, Tues, Oct 19, and as anyone can see, has been reviewed by only a handful of people, almost all of whom give this a 1 star or less review.  Well over 1000 of the other so-called reviews relate not to the UE set but to the standalone bluray version previously released.Second, notwithstanding that I take responsibility for not reading the product description, if you are like me, busy with work, kids, etc., you make certain assumptions about respective products, especially those that are a part of a series that is marketed as ""Ultimate.""  One such assumption, as here, is that if the first two released UE sets incorporate scenes not otherwise part of the theatrical version, all other released UE sets will follow suit.  That did not happen here.  You sold me something I (and likely everyone else who is reading this) already own.  You made the cost of owning this one film a $75+ investment for all us.  I mean, why, why, why??? would a parent ever blow $35+ for a bluray set in order to what, learn about how magical creatures were created in the world of Harry Potter?  Please.  In a world where content is king, this is a bottomless hole.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.Warner Bros (its C-levels, BOD, and others responsible), you burned me on this one.

You burn me, and you lose my trust, trust in your capacity to understand my needs.  Yours is a business filled with risk.  You only need to look across the street at your MGM buds to know how true that is.  You may temporarily sustain your profitability through the manipulation of this franchise, but all good things come to an end.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2D83L4JT0K48Y	C. Rollins	I had average hopes for this movie - I was caught in the middle because I had thought that the second movie was too much like the first, but then again, I didn't want it to be too different because I realized that it should have the same feel throughout the series.  Using a relatively untested director worried me, and my concerns were realized.  Like many other reviewers, I thought that the movie was too rushed - in the first two I at least got the feeling that a year had passed during the film, while here it seemed that it all happened in a matter of days.  I too agree with those who were displeased with the apparent editing of the story.  I realize that this is necessary in order to turn a book into a movie (just consider what Peter Jackson did to the LOTR books), and I also realize that the control of that is out of our (the general viewing public's) hands.  However, what possible need existed that called for them to change the location of Hagrid's Hut and the resizing and locating of the Whomping Willow??!!  Somebody ought to have reigned these changes in.  I thought that since Chris Columbus was producing the movie, he might see to that.  Apparently not.  Still, disappointed as I was, I plan to add it to my collection - but then, of course, it would be silly to leave one of seven out, so that's not really a recommendation, is it?	2.0	To each his own...	2004-08-17	6	3	3

Im a huge fan of the books and i cant understand why J.K. Rowling would allow the writer and director to butcher her book! The magical effects in hp3 were far superior to the first two films. The acting was the downfall of the movie. All of the dialouge was either cut for the movie or rushed. And what was up with the cutting of the quitich cup. The quitich matches were soime of the best sequences in the first two films. winning the cup would have been a great picker upper for the film. The set of hogwarts was alsom changed. The grounds in the first two films worked wonderfully but they still changed it! The womping willow, hagrids, the hogwarts courtyard, and the grounds were all unnesserialy changed. The movie was still a good movie just all the change wasnt needed. Buckbeak was wonder full. ig uess in my mind the full potential of harry potter cant be met in a childrens movie. the story will become continually darker and the third one wasnt as scary as the first even with the dementors! i hear there will be a new director for the fourth film.

While all are in my favorite movies list, this one really hit me.  People are complaining that it wasn't what they expected, well, sorry folks but that's bound to happen when YOU'RE not directing it.  Roughly a 400 page book into what Warner Brothers gave Alfonso (141 minutes) is a very hard thing to do.  One page of script is rougly equal to one minute of screen time.  You obviously cannot fit a 400 page book into a 141 page screenplay.  There are going to be things left out.The filming is 100x better, the use of colors, scenery, and costume are top notch.  You see Harry, Hermione, and Ron (including all others) in a different light, you see them for once, as teenagers, not as students 24/7.  Even if it's not in the book, these kids DO have a life outside of Hogwarts.  You see Malfoy in an entirely different light, as the coward that he is deep down inside (and you WILL find examples of that in the books...)The introduction of Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore is harsh at first, but adds a lot to the character.  He loses the ""caring"" touch that Richard Harris had, but is very funny.  He is wise, and kooky, and you can see why Harry is so fond of him.And people, keep in mind, the decisions are not entirely based on the director.  The production is also affected by the PRODUCER, which is CHRIS COLUMBUS, who directed the first two.  Not to mention, the screenwriter, Steve Kloves, who dearly devotes/devoted years of his life to bringing Harry Potter to life.  He is booked all the way into, at least, 2007 with the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Overall, I would give this 4.5 stars if possible, but cannot here on Amazon.  It did lack a sort of magic that the first two had, but Harry, Hermione, and Ron are growing up fast.  Hermione blossoms and Ron and Harry are clearly growing into adults.  Malfoy's voice deepens and he even sports a new hair cut.Final note:  If you are not a fan of change, you might have a hard time with this one.  It's very different than the first two, but don't go into it, if you haven't seen it, with high expectations.  Let it all happen naturally, and you'll be in for a magical time."	4.0	Great	2004-10-11	13	9	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A249V9PP3MDDGE	"C. Smith ""Bibliophile extrordinaire"""	I have to say, I was a little disappointed in this movie. I try to seperate my love of the books from how I view the movie, but it is difficult. There are several important plot details left out and some new ones created unnecessarily. Adding in some of the left-out details would not even have made the movie much longer, so I was disappointed in that. I thought the movie was good and well-done, but it was not as faithful an interpretation of the book as the 1st two movies, directed by Chris Columbus. The movie was also somewhat unnecessarily dark. Darkness really pervaded the movie, but in terms of the books, this darkness would not really be appropriate until the fifth book, or perhaps part of the fourth. I really have to recommend the book HIGHLY over the movie, and quite frankly, it makes me very concerned for how much of the 4th book they will have to cut out to make it a movie. I wonder if it will even be worth watching. I still give the movie 4 stars, however, because it is good, and I do love the HP series, but do NOT expect it to be faithful to the book--salient details are left out. Think of it instead as being somewhat loosely based on the book, and enjoy it for what it is. Also, the kids have grown up a bit, and their acting skills have improved, so that is a definite plus.	4.0	Not the book come to life	2005-05-12	5	4	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A21B2TJBWCSK1R	Cubist	"At first, it seems like rather an odd choice picking the director of the racy, coming-of-age road movie, Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n, to direct the latest Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Studios are notoriously protective of their cash cow franchises-especially ones targeted at a young audience demographic. But, in a way, it makes sense that Cuar&oacute;n was chosen. Both movies are coming-of-age tales documenting the awkward growing pains of their respective protagonists. It is a fascinating blend of big budget pyrotechnics with a director who has a particular vision.For the first time in the series there is a director with a distinctive style behind the camera. Cuar&oacute;n instills each frame of this movie with infectious energy. He presents a wonderfully magical world filled with books with snapping teeth and a triple-decker bus that can make it thin and squeeze between two other buses at will. Every scene seems to move and there is a layering of styles. Every shot is drenched in atmosphere. The more multi-dimensional a film is, the easier it is to get pulled into it. The first two films felt like two-dimensional pictures trying to be three-dimensional. It took someone like Cuar&oacute;n to bring this franchise alive and he does it within the first ten minutes.The second disc contains the rest of the extra material which is a nice mix of behind-the-scenes featurettes and interactive games. Even the animated menus are done in a way that keeps in spirit with the movie, which is a nice touch.""Trelawney's Crystal Ball"" features five deleted or unfinished scenes, including more with Harry on the bus and a new (and foolish) portrait that guards the boys' dorm room.The most substantive extra on this disc is ""Creating the Vision,"" a 12-minute look at the making of the movie with Cuar&oacute;n and author J.K. Rowling. They talk about adapting her novel and Cuar&oacute;n talks about dealing with the abstraction of time travel.""Head to Shrunken Head"" is the most entertaining extra and features a series of interviews with the cast and crew of the movie. Our three heroes (Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) talk about how Cuar&oacute;n asked them to write a page essay about their characters (Watson wrote 16 pages!) and how they are dealing with the overwhelming fame garnered from these movies. For the adults, the interview with Gary Oldman and David Thewlis is a real treat as the two veteran actors tease each other and talk about how much their kids were thrilled that they appeared in this movie. Cuar&oacute;n talks briefly about moving the production to Scotland to shoot the outdoor scenes.""Catch Scabbers!"" is a game where you have to catch Ron's pet mouse, Scabbers, with three increasingly difficult levels of play. This takes some deft maneuvering with your DVD remote.""Choir Practice"" is a karaoke sing-a-long for the ""Double Trouble"" song from the movie.""The Quest of Sir Cadogan"" allows you to step into the armor of this clumsy knight and perform a series of tasks that involve a mix of memory games and quick navigation skills. Again, this is another one that requires you to be quick with your DVD remote.""Hagrid's Hut"" is a substantial Making Of featurette that starts with a look at how some of the real animals in the film were trained. Also included is a look at how Oldman was transformed into Sirius Black and how they did Thewlis' werewolf transformation (a clever mix of prosthetics and CGI). We also get a glimpse of how the creatures were designed and created. Cuar&oacute;n preferred old school effects to that of CGI but in some cases using computers was unavoidable.""Tour of Honeydukes"" is a really cool 360 degree tour of the candy store that makes you feel as if you are really there.""Magic You May Have Missed"" tests your memory as you must spot something specific that stands out or is missing from a scene.Finally, there is another 360 degree virtual tour, this time of Professor Lupin's classroom. This is a really nice looking extra that makes one feel as if they are in the movie.With Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban, Cuar&oacute;n joins the ranks of Terry Gilliam, Tim Burton and Peter Jackson as a filmmaker capable of creating textured fantasy films that don't talk down to kids and still appeals to adults. The characters have layers of grey areas-they aren't purely good or evil."	5.0	An atmospheric mix of Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam...	2004-12-15	10	6	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A854E5FCL8X1I	customer	In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Chris Columbus made room for Alfonso Cuaron as the new director for the third installment in the series. Cuaron's changes brought the series in a new direction, yes, but created a few problems, too.First off, all the familiar faces in terms of characters are there, with a few new ones. The biggest change in terms of casting is the new Dumbledore. After Richard Harris' unfortunate death soon after the release ofHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition), Michael Gambon was chosen as the next actor to play Dumbledore. The problem with Gambon's performance is the lack of warmth and caring nature of Harris' (especially because the character is portrayed as a kind old man in most of Rowling's books).Some things about Cuaron's direction that I did like were the increased amount of humor, but not at the expense of accuracy to the book. I also got a chuckle out of the use of the Whomping Willow to represent the changing seasons.The film is darker than the previous films and feels like it's target audience was teenagers and adults. The gloomier atmosphere, especially the creepy Dementors, made me think that this movie's rating was only borderline PG.One other flaw I think the film had was having Harry, Ron, and Hermione wear street clothes. I thought that having them display the styles of 2004 would date the film in years to come.Overall, the film is worthwhile entertainment. Not quite as amazing as its predecessors, but its good qualities outweigh the bad ones. 4 stars.	4.0	Flawed, but still worth watching!	2009-07-10	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1VWXL7HEI6SF0	cwbflute	"This review assumes that you've already either seen the movie or read the book.  I won't go into the plot here.I'll say upfront that this movie was brilliantly done.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n truly captured the darker, more complex mood that J.K. Rowling gave to the third installment of the series.  The cinematography and visual effects were excellent.  I also thought that the soundtrack was absolutely perfect (if interested, please see my separate review for the soundtrack).The kids are beginning to really mature in this film.  Their acting, which is evidently becoming more natural and fluid, has improved a hundred times over since Chamber of Secrets.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become closer in this story, and their friendships are even more important than before.  I get the sense that Daniel, Rupert, and Emma are also becoming great friends, as their friendships on the screen seem so natural.  The three have a great chemistry.  Some complain that the kids are growing too fast, but I just don't see it.  Kids their age simply grow at an exponential rate.  I assume this also holds true in the wizarding world.  They seem about the right age to me.The casting for the new characters is pretty good.  David Thewils is a fantastic Professor Lupin, and Emma Thompson is a perfectly clumsy and mystical Profesor Trelawney.  I did not, however, warm up so well to Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore.  But I think (hope) that will change with time.  Gambon is obviously a good actor, and I think that if I hadn't already gotten used to Richard Harris, I would have said that his portrayal of Dumbledore was convincing.  Hopefully, Gambon will grow on me in Goblet of Fire.Now for the ""qualified"" portion of my review. . . . I give this movie five stars from the perspective of someone who had read the book first.  I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed the fast-paced movie as much if I had not already known what was going on.  I did not, however, give this factor too much weight in my assessment because, given the time constraints of the movie, it probably had to be geared toward people who had already read the book.  Of course there were many missing details -- the background about Sirius and Lupin could have used more explanation, and the secondary characters did not get much face time -- but deciding what to cut and what to keep is incredibly difficult when you adapt a 435-page book (each page packed with information) to a 140-minute movie.  I believe that given the complexity of the story and the time constraints of the movie, the crew did a fantastic job with making those decisions; and that is why I give the movie five stars.  Remember, the perfect Harry Potter movie would be about 8 hours long.  That's just not possible.  (Although, if it were, I would certainly sit through it!)Now for my favorite parts of the movie. . . . (1) I think my favorite part of the movie was the time-turner sequence.  This was brilliantly done.  I even looked for flaws the second and third times I watched the film, and I found none.  Emma Watson was brilliant in this scene!  (2) Aunt Marge's ""blow up"" sequence was absolutely hilarious.  (3) The Hogsmeade scene with the snowball fight was fun, and Daniel Radcliff did an excellent job with the scene where he ""overhears"" that Sirius is his godfather.Long story short, this DVD is a must-have for Harry Potter movie fans.  I think this movie is even better than the first two, and the DVD will be a good supplement for when you don't have time to re-read the book!"	5.0	A well-deserved, but qualified, 5 stars	2004-09-07	37	29	8

There were a lot of very good actors and actresses, but they weren't allowed much room to show it off.Some parts of POA were very good, but generally it looked like an homage film to Tim Burton*. It seemed that Cuar&oacute;n disliked the important and enjoyable scenes (the dinner with Aunt Marge and inside the Shrieking Shack) and cut them to less than bare bones and then rushed through what he left. He completely botched the sub-story of the Firebolt, revelation scene at The Three Broomsticks and Peter being alive. Not to mention his pretty much ignoring explanation of the Potter-Black-Lupin-Petegrew friendship. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, might be brilliant in the role, but he was on screen so little who can tell? Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors and almost overcome his lack of screen time to put in an excellent performance.On the plus side, the special effects were flawless, pity that can't carry a movie.All in all, die-hard fans will make POA a moderate success, but nowhere near what it could have been with competent direction.  Best description I've come up with is that Cuar&oacute;n did to Harry Potter what Schumacher did to Batman.Someone wrote Cuar&oacute;n had breathed life into the Harry Potter franchise, well, it was more like he tried to suffocate it with a pillow.  Hopefully Mike Newell will do much, much better with GOF.* For the record I am a great fan of Tim Burton, but Harry Potter ain't The Nightmare Before Christmas."	1.0	Very disappointing.	2004-06-05	22	18	4

The first two movies directed by Chris Columbus may have followed the storyline strictly, but it was TOO strictly that they came out bad as movies. A good book doesn't equal a good movie!!!I have to say, this is the best out of all three movies. For a movie to be good, there has to be some kind of focus in the plot, which is what Azkaban had, and I just loved the graphics and scenery, which were much more explored in this movie than the other two. There's also improvement on the acting on behalf of the kids, quite apparent after several films of practicing now. Except Dumbledore... I feel like the first actor did a lot better: there was a graver and more powerful sense to him. The new Dumbledore reminds me of Professor Flitwick.Overall, this was an awesome movie, even if it didn't follow the book so strictly (which is actually a GOOD thing).

The visual effects look top notch quality and the scenes I watched are 100% true to the book's description of them. There is a lot more intensity in the characters acting from what I noticed and I doubt that any fan of these books will be disappointed with this movie.

Look closely at the packaging before you open the cellophane - if you're like me you may receive a 'full-screen' (aka cropped on both sides) version of the movie rather than the wide-screen version pictured on the product page and described in the product detail.  I'm not sure about Amazon's policy with returned open DVDs but I returned mine unopened for what I'm told will be a full refund.FYI my ordered was sold by 'Opti Shopper' (fulfilled by Amazon) and in addition to being full-screen it appeared to be marketed for sale in France - everything on the cover was in both English and French.Didn't want to bring down the overall rating for this movie by giving this non-starter 1 star, so settled on 4.	4.0	Movie is excellent - wish I'd received what I ordered	2011-04-05	2	0	2

So, i loved the first two Harry Potter movies. I was dissapointed when they left out very big scenes, and they didn't seem to flow together. This movie, however, was a complete discrace! I LOVED the book, absolutely, but i was appalled at what was taken out of the movie.To me, a necessity was the explanation of how the map relates to the whole Padfoot, Prongs, Wormtail, and Moony as the four friends. Lupin and Black were continually going on about how they seemed to know EVERYTHING about the map (""the map never lies"" etc etc) which they should, seeing that they made it, but to anyone who hasen't read the books wouldn't know that, so they wouldn't have any clue as to why they say that sort of stuff. Even my brother (who hasn't read the books) was very confused, saying stuff like ""how does he know?"" and stuff.Also, the ending was HORRIBLE. The whole deal with the Quidditch cup, and House Cup and everything was completely out of it. Its like it didn't exist! The first thing is that Harry got his broom in the middle, BEFORE he met Sirius and all that sort of stuff. All of the stuff at the ending (besides the whole time turning and stuff) was taken out and i felt it was a complete injustice to us who actually LIKE the books.Also, i found there was a lot of scenes that were COMPLETELY uneeded. There were plenty of just random scenery scenes, where they would show a bird just fly and get ""killed"" by the tree, completely unecessary, and uneeded.I also felt that the acting wasn't all that good either. I felt that Uncle Vernon, Dudley, and Aunt Petunia did a horrible job at the table with Aunt Marge, the only scene with the muggles. I felt that scene was very poorly acted and constructed. I could sense a sort of beginning where they wished to make it seem sort of caotic, but it didn't work at all, it seemed, almost, as if Harry blew up his aunts every day.Basically, more than once i felt like stopping the movie and filling in the HUGE and FREQUENT holes so everyone can understand.While i was ver dissapointed at the amount that was not included, i felt that the movie was very pleasurable. I think that if you're not a big Harry Potter fan, and don't really feel the need to have movies relate back to the book (if you've even read it) then this would be a good movie for you to watch."	2.0	Very Dissapointed	2005-06-18	4	2	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2O90ASBUFNO6X	Dandy Lion	Compared to the first two Harry Potter films, the third was a very poor comparison to the book.  A great many of the important details were left out of the movie, especially at the beginning, that are essential to set the stage for the plot.  This movie completely fails to capturing the magical mystical charm of Hogwarts; Dumbledore's demeanor doesn't project the same patriarchal figure as usual, Malfoy's appearance isn't quite as wicked, and the students are often seen out of their regular school uniforms which detracts from the strict boarding school atmosphere that the book portrays.  I certainly hope that future Harry Potter movies will reflect the same quality as the books  -- otherwise they should stop making the movies.Very disappointing!!!	1.0	Poor production !!!!	2005-07-23	9	5	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2P49WD75WHAG5	Daniel J. Hamlow	"As someone who's read all five Harry Potter books and was very much pleased with the first two movie adaptations.  For the third, I expected something darker given the nature of the novel.  Yes, there are some scary elements in the movie, and the movie is shot in areas with dim lighting, with a kind of forboding suspense eminent in The Others.Sirius Black, a follower of Voldemort, leader of Dark Wizards, has escaped from the supposedly escape-proof Azkaban prison, guarded by the hooded wraith-like Dementors, creatures described by Professor Remus Lupin as ""the foullest creatures that walk this earth.""  Upon close proximity, these creatures have the effect of draining people's souls.  Harry's friend Ron Weasley describes the feeling:  ""like I'd never be cheerful again.""  The whole key, as Dumbledore says, is remembering to find the light amid the dark, as Harry smiles at Lupin's remembrances of Lily Potter as a compassionate woman able to see the light in anyone.  Lupin is a key figure, helping Harry and his fellow students come to terms with their personal fears.However, Harry learns that Sirius is out to get him because Harry is the only thing stopping Voldemort from regaining full powers.  To make matters worse, the Dementors are stationed around Hogwarts to capture Sirius, and they can't tell friend from foe.The main leads are firmly solid in their roles, and the rapport they have tighter than ever.  So is the dialogue.  Yet again, Emma Watson (Hermione) is the strongest and most delightful of the three, still the Miss-Know-It-All but this time having the knack of suddenly appearing in class.  However, Daniel Radcliffe gives Watson a run for her money, as his performance as Harry is the best yet.  He expresses emotions of anger at his Muggle guardians and a moment of angst and rage when finding out something about Sirius Black.  And of course, it's a nice change to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione in other than just their flowing black school robes all the time.  They should be allowed to continue through all seven movies.Special things in the world of wizards include the Marauder's Map, a parchment that's like a portable GPS system.  However, the movie's strong opening scene of Harry causing his Aunt Marge to swell up into a balloon after she insults his parents is a highlight.  She is later seen floating in the sky in a shot reminiscent of Pink Floyd's Animals album.  But the realization of Buckbeak the hippogriff, part eagle, part horse, is a beaut, and makes me want to ride one.Whereas Chris Columbus tried to make the first two movies closer to J.K. Rowling's book, director Alfonso Cuaron clearly places style and ambience over accuracy, tying up plot threads, and length.  It was a bit jarring to see roughly a third(!) of the novel excised here, compared to a tenth in the two previous movies.  For example, the movie omits how Sirius escaped from Azkaban. Also, Divination Professor Sibyl Trelawney is described as a thin stick insect with glasses that magnify her eyes.  Despite not appearing as such, Emma Thompson gives it her best.  Given that, the movie could've been a half hour longer.All the other adult leads are great, especially Gary Oldman (Sirius) and David Thewlis (Lupin).  Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), wisely decides not to play the headmaster as his late predecessor Richard Harris did, and succeeds.It took me two views to make me realize that despite the quibbles, The Prisoner Of Azkaban worth the wait and the best of the three.  Mischief managed!"	5.0	I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good	2004-06-17	5	5	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	I put this review off for a long time because I wanted to re-read the book before offering final judgment on the movie.  I have to admit that I cannot add my name to the supposed list of people hailing Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n as the perfect director for this pivotal film in the Harry Potter series.  It is natural that a new director would make changes to redefine the world in his own image, but I think this movie makes far too many changes - I could forgive that, but some of the additions are just, well, silly and wholly unnecessary.  J.K. Rowling herself might love the shrunken head on the Knight Bus, but I have no use for it - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is not a comedy, and it does not need the intellectual equivalent of a man doing a pratfall.  At Hogwarts, you get ghost horsemen crashing through windows and thumping into the Great Hall.  There are a number of similar additions I consider useless at best.  Why throw these things in there?  It's not like you are starting with a weak story and having to pad the film.  Did Cuaron think he needed to add a few silly scenes in order to make the film appeal to children?  As if there's a child in Western society who isn't already a rabid Harry Potter fan.  And the clothing rubs me the wrong way - rarely do you see the kids in their Hogwarts uniforms in this movie.  And speaking of Hogwarts, it looks nothing like it did in the first two films; I kept expecting Julie Andrews to come strolling over one of the hills singing The Sound of Music.  All of these needless changes took away from my enjoyment of Rowling's story.  The fact that the kids are outgrowing their characters didn't help either - Neville, Malfoy, and, to some degree, Ron hardly resemble themselves from the first two movies.  I didn't like the fact that Dumbledore's attire was completely changed (and that little rubber band in the beard thing was - to me - horrible) - in my opinion, all of that added unneeded complications to the transition process from the late Richard Harris to Michael Gambon in this pivotal role.I'm not saying Cuar&oacute;n didn't do some things well, though.  The guys and gals who designed Buckbeak (in both model and CGI form) went well beyond the call of duty and should be praised.  Aunt Marge, Professor Trelawney, Professor Lupin, and Sirius Black were perfect embodiments of their literary selves.  Hogsmeade was an unqualified visual success.  The Dementors were brought to life very effectively.  Definitely, in many ways this was a very impressive film.  Notice I haven't mentioned the story yet.Ah, yes, the plot.  Obviously, I think the movie left out more than it should have to make room for a lot of unnecessary fluff.  What we do have, though, feels somewhat disjointed to me - just a bunch of scenes thrown together.  Obviously, I knew when the seasons changed as Cuaron went to the well too often with the soaring seasonal transitions, but I did not get the sense that a school year at Hogwarts had passed by the end of the film.  Speaking of the ending, I will declare that it was well done indeed.  It could have been confusing for younger viewers (assuming, of course, there might actually be one young viewer out there who hadn't actually read the book before seeing the film), so I was glad to see Cuaron really take the time to concentrate on bringing it off as seamlessly as possible.The extras on the bonus DVD are something of a mixed bag.  I think I speak for all of us when I thank the studio for not making us go through some kind of infernal maze just to find a deleted scene.  The five deleted scenes included here, though, aren't much to talk about.  The games and the tours of Honeydukes and Lupin's classroom will appeal to some, but the real meat of the extras comes in the form of the cast interviews (even though they do force us to endure more of that infernal shrunken head), the featurette on the extraordinary animals seen in the film, and the interviews with director Cuaron and author J.K. Rowling.I know I've been critical of the film, but that doesn't mean I don't love it.  I just think it could have been much better than it was.  Many of us take our Harry Potter extremely seriously, and I just would have preferred stricter adherence to Rowling's original story (and, of course, less silly fluff).	4.0	Well-done in places, but the changes go too far overall	2005-07-28	4	4	0

Alfonso Cuaron (the director) did a magnificent job.  He is so talented and was able to turn a movie into a film.  When compated with the first 2 movies, directed bu Chris Columbus, The Prisonor of Azkaban has improved visually creating a darker feel more similar to the books.  Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint's acting hsa dramatically changed.  They have all matured so much since the first 2 films.

Not that taking a book and making it verbatim into a film is bad. Indeed, I enjoyed the first two films very much.But in Cuaron's version, there are definitely stylistic differences between this movie and its predecessors, and between the book and the film. Like many other critics before myself have said, it felt more like a film than a staged reading of the book. Those that are sensitive to detail will notice the change in Hogwarts's grounds, and the order in which events took place. Granted, after both reading the entire series and watching the film, there were just a few things that I would have tweaked in the movie if given the chance.But overall, this was a very impressive film, and I felt that the three young leads have grown a lot due to their work with Cuaron, who pushed them more into the method style of acting, I believe. I think that after this film, they will all be more effective actors.I enjoyed the film very  much, and I look forward to purchasing it when it comes out!	5.0	Great adaptation of the book!	2004-08-14	4	3	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3L0FQYVHXTT5F	Daniel R Barnett	"I see a pattern forming here.  If you were disappointed with the film version of HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, then you loved the theatrical release of PRISONER OF AZKABAN.  The reverse also holds true.  My take is that this film, though it's based on what is arguable the strongest book in J.K. Rowling's series, is the weakest theatrical offering to date.First, the good news.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson shine once again as the enduring trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who must reckon with magical beasts, sanity-draining ""dementors,"" more treachery from Draco Malfoy, and an escaped serial killer during their third year at Hogwarts.  The role of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore is now played by Michael Gambon, who takes up where the late Richard Harris left off and gives his character a subtle eccentricity not seen in previous films.  Spanish director Alfonso Cuaron imbues PRISONER OF AZKABAN with a darker cinematic style that seems fairly appropriate for the more ominous turn the series is about to take.  He also throws in a few subtle jokes about life as a teenager that many adults can appreciate, and deftly handles the growing tension between Hermione and Ron.On the other hand, director Cuaron and scriptwriter Steve Kloves, who did a magnificent job transcribing SORCERER'S STONE and CHAMPER OF SECRETS, cut so much out of Rowling's original book that the script for PRISONER OF AZKABAN has holes big enough to fly a Nimbus 2000 through.  Gone is the eagerly awaited Quidditch Final, the source of Professor Snape's antipathy towards Harry, and the origin of the Marauder's Map.  Many characters seem underused, including the flaky Divination teacher Sibyll Trelawney (Emma Thompson), the stern but fair Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), and even Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Slytherin BMOC-in-training and Potter's archenemy.  Timothy Spall's performance as Peter Pettigrew seems played as comic relief, complete with exaggerated front teeth, and diminishes his character's utter despicability.  And even though the original book is longer than its two predecessors, the movie version weighs in at a mere 135 minutes - 15 minutes shorter than CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and a half-hour shorter than SORCERER'S STONE.  Thus, the elements that are left in the script seem crammed together and somewhat messy at times.All in all, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a somewhat mediocre film with some great acting and a darker mood, but substance clearly gives way to style here.  It's not enough of a disappointment that I want a refund, but it does make me wonder if the film adaptation of HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE faces a similar hatchet job.  It will take a steady hand to transform the occasionally unwieldy book into an enduring classic, but the Cuaron/Kloves team may not have what it takes."	3.0	Something wobbly this way comes	2004-06-15	4	3	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A23QOAXJSWIBS6	"Daniel S. Russell ""syzygy121"""	The latest Harry Potter film installment stands head and shoulders above the other two. Cuaron sure had his work cut out for him -- a book far too long to bring to the screen without major editing. In the end he and the screenwriter captured the feel of the book and the most important plot elements without making the film feel too abreviated or lost. Yes half of the movie comes from the last fifth of the book, but that is the most important part of the book.The cast is, as before, tremendous, especially Emma Thompson, and I greatly enjoyed the cameo by Dawn French as the fat lady. I didn't even recognized Julie Christie. Michael Gambon is a wonderful replacement for the late Richard Harris.The whole atmosphere works and adds the right touches of a sinister feel. The color scheme, cinematography and art direction are all above the standard for this genre, but restrained and controlled as not to get in the way of the story telling. The director of Van Helsing could learn a lesson here.This film is far darker than the previous two, as is the book, so I would definitely not recommend this for viewing by SMALL children.  As Harry ages, SO DOES HIS AUDIENCE!!!  This is definitely a PG movie, and the next may very well be PG-13, and rightly so.  I think the books are.In the end, the film succeeds in what it intended and in what it NEEDED to accomplish. Here's hoping the future installments can be this well crafted and masterfully told, despite their prohibitive length.****1/2	5.0	Brilliant directing and masterful storytelling	2005-02-20	4	4	0

Bogus physical comedy is toned down to an absolute minimum and it moves quickly. The new director far outweighs Christopher Columbus in storytelling and cinematography overall, because ""Scary Imagery"" is actually ""Scary Imagery"".I'm getting sick and tired of artisctly ignorant people complaining about the fact that the movie doesn't stick true to the book. Film and Book are two totally different art forms. Storytelling is told through pictures, and not words, and thusly event sequences and cuts have to be different. And yes, while certain parts from the books are left out,  the movie makers have no choice, because a movie has to be quick, and to-the-point, while books can drag out as long as they please. Someone griped that one-third of the book was about the magical broomstick, but please. Who would honestly sit through a 50 minute expos&eacute; on a broomstick?Overall, the directing was superb--in this movie you will find yourself clinging to your date's hand ever now and then--the acting has evolved into something worthy of praise, the overall atmosphere has changed as the characters become young adults, and the score is absolutely beautiful. Once you get over the fact that this isn't a seven-hour Lord of the Rings type sypnosis of a 435 page book, and accept the art-form that it is, you will enjoy this film, and most likely purchase it."	5.0	"Finally, a Harry Potter Film that Deserves the Title ""Film"""	2004-09-10	8	2	6

But they are more aware of his powers now and they almost fear him. But after an unfortunate ""baloon"" incident, Potter decides to take his leave for good of the family, and after a bizarre/entertaining bus ride and a visit to the Ministry of Magic, Harry is back at his real home of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But, of course, there is much to fear at school, this time with the prison break of the supposedly-nefarious Sirius Black (Oldman), who, of course, is looking for our young Mr. Potter.I was very interested to see how this movie would turn out, mainly to see how the new director, Alfonso Cuaron and the new Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon would pan out. As it turns out, while Cuaron did an admirable job, although he made changes I disagreed with, Gambon just didn't work out as Dumbledore. For one, he had a totally different look than the late Richard Harris did as Dumbledore. They changed his wardrobe extensively, even though it had been nearly identical in the first two movies. They obviously couldn't make Gambon exactly like Harris, but the way he portrayed Dumbledore, it was like they wanted to create a totally different character. Gambon was more playful and curious, contrasting the stoic nature that Harris portrayed so nicely in the first two movies. The changes were just too drastic, especially this deep in the series, and especially given the immense popularity of the books and the movies. Harris' death was very unfortunate, and to Gambon's credit, he tried admirably to step up to the role. But it really didn't work at all for me.Almost everything about this series is high-profile, but the one possible exception to this would be the script and screenwriter. Steve Kloves has written the first three movies, and he will continue to write the others, and I don't think he gets enough credit for his work. Yeah, the books are probably better than the movies, but that is almost always the case with any adaptation. But I think Kloves, who wrote a favorite of mine, Wonder Boys, does a great job with the script, with some nice dialogue and a nice, cinematic adaptation of the plot. I've heard arguments about what they left out of the book, but honestly, you just can't have everything from the book in the movie. I would've liked to see some more Quidditch, but I guess there is not that much in this book. Oh well.Director Alfonso Cuaron creates probably the most beautiful Potter movie yet. His sets are quite lushly created and it is all shot nicely. What I didn't really understand was why they made such drastic changes to Hogwarts. In the first two movies, Hagrid's hut was right near the forrest, but in this movie it's in a totally different location, at the bottom of some hill. I don't really know why they changed it, because it's obviously different, and if there is some explanation as to why it's different, they don't give it. I didn't like his work with Gambon at all, but he does bring out a lot more in Radcliffe than we've seen before. Overall, he does a fine job, but there are some of his decisions that didn't really pan out for me.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban does work on many levels, but some of it just doesn't work at all. Potter looks older, Dumbledore looks younger...well, he is younger, technically, and while this is visually beautiful and a fairly entertaining movie, it doesn't quite conjur the same magic as the first two movies."	4.0	Great, but not like the others two.	2005-04-01	3	1	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2JLSHTST2SP1I	Danno	"By the standards of ""Van Helsing"" or ""Phantom Menace"" or most so-called blockbusters, ""Prisoner"" is an excellent movie. On its own merits, however, Alfonso Cuaron's take on the ""Harry Potter"" franchise leaves a lot to be desired. The first two films in the series have a timeless holiday classic feeling about them; I can imagine them being enjoyed by children in 2050. ""Prisoner,"" on the other hand, is going to look seriously dated in a decade or so.The 'Potter' series, for those not yet familiar, chronicles the adventures of young Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who learns he has magical powers and attends a boarding school for wizards.Cuaron made two odd directorial decisions. The first was to allow the young cast to spend much of their time in casual play clothes rather than in their robes and British school uniforms. Big mistake - they look like neighborhood kids waving wands in a park rather than gifted youngsters attending a school of magic. The second, stranger decision was to omit huge chunks of the book that actually moved the plot forward. We never learn, in the movie, how the mysterious Sirius Black escaped prison and the extent of his bond with young Harry Potter. We're also never given the chance to understand the dynamics in the friendship between Black, Professor Lupin, and Harry's late father. The new villains, the Nazgul-like Dementors, are appropriately chilling but - once more - aren't really explained. In their place is a silly, extended fight scene between a poorly animated werewolf and a griffin.Perhaps the 'Potter' books are so popular that Cuaron believed he could skip over hugh chunks of the plot, knowing that his audience had already memorized every word. Peter Jackson nicely avoided this problem with his 'Lord of the Rings' films, as did del Toro with his 'Hellboy' movie. If you haven't read any 'Potter' books, you can enjoy this movie on a superficial level and appreciate the various chills and scares Cuaron provided for Harry Potter and his friends. As for me, I hope that the franchise's growing pains are over, and that ""Harry Potter IV"" will be a consistently better adaptation."	3.0	Growing Pains For Potter Series	2004-11-30	11	10	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3MKHD3AKS69BH	"Danny Kim ""Taste"""	"This review is addressed to all the reviewers who complained about book content that was left out of the film.  There are always things left out of a film.  Why?  For example, if a peripheral character doesn't reinforce the main storyline, the writer, who in this case, Steve Kloves (screenwriter of the first two films) excised from the final script.  So story content decisions likely did not fall into director Alfonso Cuaron's duties, thus it is not fair to blame him for that.With most Potter films running over two hours, most theaters can't show the movie more than 4 times a day on a single screen.  That extra show is very important for a theater's first theatrical weeks when the interest is high.  Ultimately, they probably shot most of the stuff that people are complaining about, and they'll end up on a special edition DVD as deleted scenes.  Most people who are not fanatics of Harry Potter don't have an attention span that could follow the film for more than two and a half hours.  That's already pushing the envelope.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", in my opinion, is the best book thusfar.  Sirius Black is the most intriguing character of the series alongside Professor Lupin, and both are in this film.  David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are two of the finest actors in the world.  Emma Thompson isn't a slouch either.  They elevated the level of performances, including that of the principal three: Harry, Ron and Hermione.  Harry's scenes with Lupin were some of the most genuine, character-developing of the entire series.  This film possessed, in a word, depth, that was sorely lacking in the first two films.  The first film established Harry's backstory.  It was pleasant.  I believe I slept through most of the second film.  It was, coincidentally, the most dull book of the series.  Chris Columbus seemingly directed the film on auto-pilot.  For most non-Potter fans over 10 years of age, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" has the most to offer as a genuine cinematic film.  I recommend it on that basis to the general public."	5.0	A Little Education on Running Times (Features Left Out)	2004-11-26	8	6	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A239PPUVV8O0U0	D. A. Reed	They definitely picked up the pacing with this one! In Harry's third year, a deranged murderer escapes Azkaban and is on the hunt for the young wizard. The writers for this one and the director really trimmed the fat of the story and just focused on Harry and the hunt for Black. We quickly get through the Dursleys and the Leaky Cauldron scenes and after thirty minutes we're on the Hogwarts Express. Not even the first two had us on the train after thirty minutes. The cast continues to mature and add depth to the roles and continue to get better. Michael Gambon joins the cast as Dumbledore, replacing Richard Harris and in my opinion is the better Dumbledore, especially now in the recent two where the character's more involved in the action. And he has good comedic timing. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black, but he's not in the movie enough, in my opinion, to really bring an impact to the character. David Thewlis portrays Lupin as a caring teacher with a dark secret and Emma Thompson is great as the looney Prof. Trelawny. There's a little more tension and action in this one and John Williams score is a great upgrade from the rather drab music of the first two installments.	4.0	More Like 4 and a Half	2009-11-04	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2F8LV729N9H9L	"Dark Harbinger ""generally freaky oddball"""	I awaited the release of this movie with great anticipation.  The first two movies gave a real impression of being in the UK.  Having been on assignment in London for a week just prior to this film's release I was greatly anticipating feeling that flavor again after I returned home to the States.What I struggle to place a finger on is the lack of English 'feel' the movie actually had.  As soon as Harry, Hermione and Ron got on the Hogwart's Express it felt like they were coming to Hogwarts in North America.  The only thing I can think of is that Cuaron's bias as a North American bled through into the movie.  From the changes in the Quidditch uniforms from the first two movies to this one, to the changes in character clothing (lack of the UK prep school uniform look, toward the North American casual) it just felt... wrong.Overall good movie, and well done with the young actors adding to their collective acting chops, but still left me wanting more richness.  David(?) Thewliss steals this movie as a tremendously well cast Professor Lupin.  I missed the original Dumbledore, though the replacement was passable.	3.0	Good, but not great	2004-08-24	7	6	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	Conventional wisdom has always been that the sequel is never as good as the original, however in recent years several movie franchises have rocked and even outright bucked this theory. First there was the appalling `Phantom Menace' that was followed by the not-quite-as-bad `Attack of the Clones.'Then there was the excellent `Fellowship of the Ring' that was followed by the even better `The Two Towers' and then the academy award winning `Return of the King.' This past summer we also saw that `Spiderman 2' was leagues better than its blockbuster predecessor.Yet there is another franchise that seems to also be improving as evidenced by this year's `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.' The movie handily bested both 2001's `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' and the following year's `Chamber of Secrets' in both sheer invention and ingenuity - not to mention special effects, acting and nearly every other department.What can explain this welcome trend of ever improving entries? In all the cases mentioned above the fact was that the initial entry had to set the stage for the following pictures. In `Phantom Menace' we had the origins of Anakin Skywalker to introduce and in the `Lord of the Rings' series the filmakers had to set up the history to the ring and start the hobbit's journey. Similarly in 2002's `Spiderman' director Sam Raimi was obliged to explain how Peter Parker came to gain his powers. A similar fate befell the first Harry Potter - both when J.K. Rowling wrote the book and director Christopher Columbus made the movie.Some feared that the third installment would paint a darker and more foreboding picture of Harry's time at Hogwart's following Columbus' departure from the director's chair (he did stay on as a producer) in favor of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Well, the movie is darker and more foreboding, and better for it. The story suits the directing style of Cuar&oacute;n and his presence elevates the movie to the very top of the Harry Potter canon.As the title suggests this installment features the escape of a prisoner from Azkaban - the supposidly villainous Sirius Black (played wonderfully by Gary Oldman). It is feared that Black is out to exact a revenge on Harry Potter.This movie is full of visual delights and the dark tone is a welcome addition. I also liked the time plot device towards the end of the movie (to say anymore would spoil much of the surprise).As with the previous two DVD releases many of the special features are a little too juvenile for adult collectors, but we are treated to some interesting (and informative) interviews with the cast and crew (and Harry Potter creator Rowling) as well as deleted scenes. It would have been a welcome addition to have Cuar&oacute;n provide a commentary however.Fans should note that this DVD is also available in a special three-movie-pack with all three movies in widescreen. Whichever selection you make you will not be dissapointed.	5.0	The series just keeps getting better	2004-11-17	11	4	7

It is obvious that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban will do extremely well in the box office.  With the change in the new director, the movie looks amazing.  As a huge potter fan, I am delighted to finally see the magic of the movies come to life for me.  With the music change from John Williams, and the stylistic directing of Alfonso, the new style that the movie presents overall is breathtaking.  Being my favorite book out of the series, I will be highly evaluating this one!  Looks so good!!! I advise everyone that isn't even into this movie, to see it!  nothing short of an amazing cinematic portrayal!	5.0	Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban	2004-05-15	9	4	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"Alfonso Cuaron has breathed new life and given a whole new feel to an already remarkable series of films.  With ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", Cuaron takes a beloved book and turns it into a beautifully filmed, fast paced story that will keep both old and new fans enthralled.  The director of the sexy teen coming-of-age movie, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", seems to be completely in tune with the teenage mind.  As J. K. Rowling's series of books begins to move into the troublesome years of adolesence, this movie definitely needed someone like Cuaron who could capture the angst and complexity that young people deal with as they begin the road toward young adulthood.New additions to the already superb cast include Michael Gambon who takes over the role of Professor Dumbledore for the late Richard Harris.  Also new to the Potter films is Emma Thompson, a long time favorite of mine, who plays wacky Divination professor Trelawney.  And, of course, there is David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, who play Professor Lupin and Sirius Black respectively, two major players in the life of our young hero.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also show continued improvement in their acting skills as they fall effortless into the characters that have made them famous.  Alan Rickman continues, with perfection, as the mysterious and always grumpy Professor Snape as well as Dame Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, who we actually see very little of in this movie.The effects are incredible, especially Buckbeake, who is beautiful and pretty much flawless.  The ride Harry takes with Buckbeake is a beautiful moment in the film, a complete treasure for the eyes!  The dementors are exactly as one would imagine, giving the viewer the chills that they produce on anything that they come near.In order to keep the pace of the film, certain things had to be left out but overall it is not really important.  Cuaron keeps all that is important to the story and adds a rich, new chapter to an already crowd pleasing group of films.  The only downside is that now we must wait for the next installment, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"".  I hope the next director will live up to Cuaron's vision of Harry Potter and the world he lives in.  He has big shoes to fill!  GO SEE THIS FILM---YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"	5.0	Bloody Brilliant!!!!!!!!	2004-06-04	6	3	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	As Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) begins his third year at Hogwarts, the prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), long thought to have been a henchman of the dreaded Voldemort, has escaped from the mystical prison of Azkaban.  It is generally thought that he will come after Harry since he had a hand in his parents' deaths.  To protect him, the fearsome Dementors, soul-sucking creatures that function as the guards of Azkaban, are patrolling the outskirts of Hogwarts.  Of course, everything is not as it seems.Alfonso Cuaron takes over as director and gives the film a whole new look, a bit more dark and reminiscent of Brothers Grimm than Chris Columbus's previous takes on the series.  I felt that this was an interesting way to go and thoroughly enjoyed the set design and photography.  The CGI was mostly successful.  I loved the Whomping Willow and especially Buckbeak, but the werewolf was disappointing.  My only real problem with the story was the same as the book: it's dangerous to introduce time travel as a plot element.  Couldn't that potentially become the solution for many problems?  Now, whenever our heroes suffer a setback, I'm going to be wondering why they don't just go back in time and try again?	4.0	Potter's third year	2004-06-08	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AKDWOFX1HYRZR	David Reese	First off... try not to listen to some of the despariging reviews some people have written about the movie not doing the book justice .  While the movie doesn't copy the book page by page, it gets the story across in an entertaining manner.  People griping about not including the origins of the Maurader's Map need to keep in mind it's a nice backstory element... but certainly not integral to the main story.  People also gripe about not introducing Cedric or Cho in this film.  To that I must respond with:  WHY introduce them in this film when they have no influence on the story being told?  Sure they both play major parts in the next movie/book... but there is little reason to have them in THIS movie.  The only thing that *I* feel should have been taken from the book and filmed is the way the book ended (I won't spoil it for people who haven't read the book.)  All in all, it's a good movie..  Good special effects, good acting, and a good story.  Another fine entry in the Harry Potter film franchise.	5.0	A good movie	2004-08-09	20	13	7

The first thing that went wrong was that there was more Science-Fiction than the other movies.  I am not a big SCI-FI fan.  Another thing that was wrong with this movie is that it was choppy.  The scenes were not in order to make a smooth movie.  The movie was sort of predictable.  I didn't read the book, but I could tell in the end Harry was going to fight one of those big black monsters.  Why else would they leave the scene where he learns to fight one.  The movie was drug out a lot.  If I made the movie, it could have been an hour and a half.  Last, what was with the color? Is it me or was the movie darker?

The story-lines in the movie were a bit rushed, and not much was explained thoroughly, but even with that the movie was still very enjoyable.  You didn't need to read the book to enjoy the movie, and everything necessary to the story-lines in this movie was introduced and explained with enough detail for you not to get hung-up.Why 4 stars?  The immense departures from the book.  Had I never read the book, I might've given the movie 5 stars, but as many reviewers have said before, there are just tons and tons of scenes either missing or displaced in the movie.  Mr. Wealsey telling Harry about Sirius Black happened later, Harry getting his Fireboly happened earlier, etc.  But look at the first 2 movies and then look at their lengths: 2:32 and 2:41.  Comparing page counts, if this movie had been done in a similar fashion, you'd be getting into the 3 hour range.  The director should be commended for making a _movie_ and not just an adaption.The one real sticking point I had was the fact that the placement and location of many of the buildings/important rooms were changed noticably.  This probably had been done to facilitate the story-line and help with the visual aspect of the movie.  If I had just seen this movie, everything was perfect.  But, for instance, Hagrid's house was moved with a Stone Henge-like structure added overlooking it.  The Whomping Willow also changed position, as did locations within Hogwarts (Gryffindor's secret entrance for example).	4.0	Good as you could hope for...	2004-07-20	2	0	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	Director Cuaron has created a darker cinematic vision that matches J.K. Rowlings own deepening sense of complexity as the series continues.  Here, Harry Potter, after the usual disastrous break living with his aunt and uncle, returns to Hogwarts a much more mature - and volatile - teenager.  Sirius Black, the man rumored to have had a hand in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped from the famous prison Azkaban, and is said to be after Harry.  The Dementors, terrifying beings (reminiscent of the LOTR Wraiths) that suck the soul of out those who get in their way, are sent to guard the perimeter of Hogwarts, although they also pose a danger to the inhabitants, particularly Harry.  When the new Professor Lupin takes a liking to Harry, Harry begins to put together pieces of his history as well as to realize some of his inherent powers.  With best buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry gathers his strength to face Sirius.In Cuaron's hands, Harry, Hermione, and Ron appear as true teenagers, often dressed in contemporary clothes inside of only their black gowns.  They bicker, goof around, and help cover for one another like true adolescents.  Daniel Radcliffe had grown into his role with authority so that even spunky Emma Watson as Hermione no longer upstages him.  Michael Gambon picks up the role of kindly Dumbledore without flaw.  Perhaps because we've already seen so much explaining Hogwarts, the school is more of a natural setting in this film.  Of course, with any adaptation from book to film, some things have been left out, and others are not adequately explained; however, all in all, this is a competent adaptation which will delight fans.  Even those who haven't read the book will be able to follow the plot.Not recommended for young children, as the Dementors will give them nightmares for a long time, this film should appeal to older elementary school children through adults.  The special effects are seamless enough to whisk viewers into this world of wizards and witches and all the strange creatures that surround them.	4.0	The Best Harry Potter Movie Yet	2005-04-12	7	3	4

Dessaso ""A Serious Reader"""	I am one of many adults who simply love the Harry Potter series.  Imagine, then, my disappointment after seeing The Prisoner of Azkaban!!!  The one thing that upsets me most about book-to-movie adaptations is the tendency of directors to ignore the heart and soul of any good book--the story itself!!  Rowling really outdid herself in The Prisoner of Azkaban--a superb cast of characters (in addition to the regulars), lively dialogue, a fantastic plot complete with twists and turns, and a thoroughly satisfying ending.  The book literally lingered with me for days afterward!  I was SO looking forward to the movie, thinking that there was NO WAY a director could mess it up.  Silly me!  The story was virtually unrecognizable, out of sync, disjointed, and eventually pointless!!  Why???  Rowling writes so that anyone who can read a book can follow her stories!!  So, why didn't the director????If you haven't seen the movie yet but feel you must, don't waste your (or your parents') hard-earned money.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AOYTQFRLD8VLP	Deborah Earle	"Alfonso Cuaron directs this third installment of the ""Harry Potter"" saga--the one in which the young wizard does not deal directly with his great adversary.It begins one late summer evening at the home of the Dursleys(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw)where young Harry is in bed practicing magical incantations, resulting in a light from his wand so brilliant and extensive that a puzzled Uncle Vernon repeatedly checks on him, only to find the 13-year-old(to whom Daniel Radcliffe has loaned much of his own prankish nature) feigning sleep whenever Vernon opens his bedroom door.Soon Harry endures a visit from Vernon's canineophilic sister,Marge(Pam Ferris), who brings her small dog with her, and takes the Dursley's line against Harry, who grows angry at all the lies told about him and his dead parents. Her retribution for hacking off the young wizard is initially the inexplicable breaking of the glass from which she was drinking, but after one last wrongful accusation against Harry's mother, Aunt Marge begins to inflate in a scene remiscent of the fate of Violent Beaureagarde in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". But instead of turning blue, she flies through the double doors leading to the Dursleys' backyard, and is soon aloft over Privet Drive. Despite Vernon's warning that Harry won't be able to return to Hogwarts due to his illicit use of magic, our irate young hero packs up and leaves, realizing how alone he is while sitting curbside outside a playground as evening sets in.But the call of Hogwarts is never ignored.A big black dog in the bushes across the street snarls at the teen, but he is unexpectedly rescued by the Knight Bus, a royal blue triple decker including beds and a chandelier, which, as conductor Stan Shunpike(Lee Ingleby) explains, is dedicated to rescuing stranded witches and wizards.As his wild ride to the Leaky Cauldron, courtesy of driver Ernie Prang(Jimmy Gardner) begins, Harry inquires about a man pictured on the front page of a newspaper Shunpike was reading, and learns that he is Sirius Black(Gary Oldman), an escaped convict from Azkaban, the Wizards' maximum security prison, who was affiliated with Voldemort.An ornamental shrunken head, voiced by Lenny Henry, provides moments of comic relief during the trip.After his arrival, the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge(Robert Hardy), tells him that the matter regarding his aunt has been resolved, and of his consequential re-instatement at Hogwarts. The Minister has kindly taken the liberty of having Harry's textbooks sent over, including a very tempestuous Book of Monsters with which Harry will have a tempestuous confronation in his room in the company of his unfazed pet owl, Hedwig.The next morning, he is happily reunited with a quarreling Ron(Rupert Grint) and Hermione(Emma Watson), who need to keep their pets--Hermione's cat, Crookshanks and Ron's rat,Scabbers, apart from each other.At breakfast, Ron shows Harry the article of his family's summer trip to Egypt as the Weasley twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Platt), tease him about repeatedly showing the article.Mrs. Weasley(Julie Walters) checks to see if Harry is all set for school while Mr. Weasley(Mark Williams)warns him that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to kill him.With this new concern on his mind, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley siblings board the Hogwarts Express. In what will be an ironic moment, Mrs. Weasley hands Scabbers to Ron through the train window, warning him not to lose him.Occupying the only available compartment on the train, the three are seated by a sleeping Professor Remus J. Lupin(David Thewlis), who wakes up in time to stave off a sinister dementor, a banshee-like guard of Azkaban, who was searching the train for Sirius Black. Harry, whose soul was nearly sucked out by the dementor passes out, and is given a piece of chocolate by Lupin, who subsequently goes to speak with the driver about this incident, to help him regain his strength.During the banquet opening the schoolyear, Headmaster Dumbledore(Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris), introduces Lupin as the new defense Against that Dark Arts Professor, Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane) as the new Care of Magical Creatures Professor, and warns that the dangerous dementors are in place to protect the school from Sirius Black.Dumbledore's observation about about light being found in the darkest of times is embodied by the sight of Harry and his roommates yukking it up with magical candies that cause them to make animal sounds or emote steam from their ears. But they had to get past Dawn French's overbearing and untalented Fat Lady to reach their dorms.Outside, on a proverbial dark and stormy night, the sinister airborne dementors stand guard.Among the new subjects they  learn are Divination, taught by Professor Sybil Trelawney(Emma Thompson), in whose class a skeptical Hermione will later have a breakdown, the Care of Magical Creatures, in which Hagrid introduces the Hippogryff, Buckbeak who Harry is allowed to fly as part of a demeonstration on dealing with such a creature. While the flight is initially one of trepidation, Harry soon enjoys it immensely. But soon, Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton), spoils the fun by provoking Buckbeak, who in return, knocks him down, injuring him slightly. Draco's exaggeration of the extent of his injuries, making the situation more critical than necessary.In Lupin's class, students learn how to turn the objects of their worst fears into something funny. But the lesson ends abruptly when Harry encounters a boggart in the shape of a dementor, Lupin intervenes, fearing it could turn into Voldemort.While other students take a field trip to nearby Hogsmeade village, Harry, whose permission slip for the trip was unsigned, makes use of his time talking with Lupin, who explains why Harry is more affected by dementors than most, and shares his memories of Harry's parents.The lad listens reverently to the story of his mother's kindness, and with puckish self-consciousness regarding the talent for trouble he inherited from his father.Things intensify when the devasted Fat Lady reports Sirius Black to be in the castle. Shortly thereafter, Professor Snape(Alan Rickman) inexplicably tales over Lupin's class, skipping ahead in the text to a section on werewolves, on which students must write essays.A perilous Quidditch match, played in a storm, ends with a fulfillment of Trelawney's prophecy about Harry's having the grim.Ending up in the hospital with his broom irreparably broken by the Whomping Willow after the game after a dementor attacks him.Lupin's mentorship of Harry continues and he promises to teach Harry how to fight the dementors in special after-class sessions.Winter finds students en route to Hogsmeade again.Harry's intial attempt to sneak over to Hogsmeade to join them beneath his invisibility cloak is foiled by the Weasley Twins, who see his footprints in the snow and drag him aside to introduce him to the Marauder's Map, which shows the precise whereabouts of everyone at Hogwarts. They teach him how to open it and close it to keep prying eyes from viewing its contents.On his illicit journey to Hogsmeade, Harry steals Neville Longbottom's (Matthew Lewis) lollipop in the candy store, and while still invisible, singlehandedly beats up Malfoy, Crabbe(Jamie Wylett) and Goyle(Josh Herdman), when they corner Ron and Hermione.Revealing himself to his best friends after the bullies are chased away, the three travel through the village. Pausing outside the 3 Broomsticks pub where proprietor Madame Rosmerta(Julie Christie) greets Professor McGonnagall(Maggie Smith) and the Minister of Magic, Harry hears his name mentioned in their discussion. After sneaking into the pub's private room, he learns about Peter Pettigrew(Timothy Spall), how Sirius killed him, after betraying Harry's parents, and the astonishing fact of Sirius being his godfather.Harry will step up his private lessons on fighting the dementors, and deal with Sirius Black under Lupin's tutelage.But with Ron and Hermione, he will also face the grave injustice involving Buckbeak. Trelawney's other prophecy, stated while in a trance, will play out, and young Harry will have to control his youthful, passionate anger to sort out the truth about Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, as well as Scabbers and the mysterious dog he encountered the night he was driven to the Leaky Cauldron.Things come to a head inside the Whomping Willow and the Shreiking Shack, getting even more muddled just outside of those areas.

Jason Isaac's character Lucius Malfoy makes me happiest out of all the characters in the books. Sure, he isn't really the same from the books to the movies, but I like the movie look best and the book act the best. ^.^I think Jason overkilled the parental abuse thing, which isn't at all in the books, but oh well. Life goes on. He's used to playing abusive characters. -Smiles.-I love that Draco and Snape have some awesome moments in this movie. GO SLYTHERIN! ^.^ Yay.REALLY good movie. Certainly the best so far. Can't wait for the 5th one. Going to it dressed up as Lucius.

Meeks ""Dedra Meeks"""	I must admit, I haven't read a single Harry Potter book, but I fell in love with the movies.The latest installment to the Harry Potter series was no disappointment.  There were plenty of laughs, excitement, and suspense.  True, the new director has revamped the old Chris Columbus look of Hogwart's, but it serves the movie well.  As the kids grow older, their experiences and emotions are becoming more intense and mature.  The film reflects this.The only problem I had with the film was the opening scene involving Harry and his terrible relatives.  This segment was shot with practically no close-ups, which robs the viewer of character reactions.  The scene could have been a hilarious one, but fell flat...simply because we weren't able to determine facial expressions.	4.0	Dark and Different	2004-11-24	1	1	0

After Chris Columbus was gone (thank God) the HP franchise got Alfonso Cauron. Alfonso got it right. The sets were great, the screenplay was awesome, the directing fantastic, the acting, very good. While this movie is not perfect, it still amounts to a recommended film on my list. The film has a much darker tone than the last two, this tone helps the film alot, it's much more easy to take seriously. John Williams cooks up his best score of the series, making it moodie, creepie, happy, and at points terrifying, the best of this score is probably the children's choir singing ""Double Trouble"".I highly recommend this film, for me, it is currently (December '07) the second best film of the franchise."	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban	2007-11-26	5	5	0

But of course all of us fans are honor bound to love them and watch them a ridiculous amount of times.  But this movie really threw that way of thinking out the window.  If you ask me, the third book in the series is where the story truly begins.  It seems fitting that that one is the best film so far.  With great charactors like Lupin and Serius, you just know that this movie is definatly going to be a landmark in the box offices.I think the new director did an extremely good job picking up where Chris Columbus left off.  I really think this movie is the funniest one yet.  And tho it's really sad that the man who played Dumbledor has died, the new Dumbledor did a very good job as well.When I went to see this movie, I knew that they would have to cut parts out.  Even though i wish it could have been exactly like the book, I really like what they did with it, it was really good.After seeing how good this movie was, I just can't wait untill the fourth one comes out.  It'll be awhile of course, but I'll be ready!!	5.0	As the actors get older, the movies get better!	2004-06-20	0	0	0

And, believe me, you HAVE to have read the book for this movie to make any kind of sense. For that alone, I'd give HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban three stars.Some HP fans are raving about how this movie is 'darker'. I beg to differ. This movie is TRYING to be darker. The dementors scared my little brother, but they were really rather silly. They fluttered around and froze things. The scenes they were in got even weirder and more detached from reality.My father, who has not read the books, couldn't connect with any of the characters, and didn't even want to. No one in the movie was very likable, and it was hard to be sympathetic to Harry, who was extremely one-dimensional. I felt sorry for Lupin, but that was only because I read the books, and I don't think they got the right actor to play him (though David Thewlis did fairly well with the material he'd been given).Snape was only in the movie for about ten minutes. Most people would agree that Snape is one of Rowling's most interesting characters, and Alan Rickman is a wonderful actor, so this was very disappointing.The director clearly assumed that the audience would know what was going on, so he was very lazy about setting scenes, introducing characters, and explaining things. Even if everyone in the audience had memorized the book (and not all of them have), he should have been less lackadaisical about providing a decent setup.Ron couldn't be in a scene without saying b***** h*** at least once. This apparently counts as 'mild language'.Some scenes made no logical sense. Why, for example, do Snape and Dumbledore discuss important matters while walking through a dorm room filled with (supposedly) sleeping children? This seemed like a really pathetic way to provide vital clues for the hero. The director might have tried to make it a bit more plausible.Some scenes were so stylistically arranged that I was certain they were dream sequences - but they weren't.Some scenes were meant to be funny, but weren't. Some scenes weren't meant to be funny... but were.I'm giving this movie two stars, because it was not a 'good' movie. Good movies have characters the audience can connect with, plots that are new, engaging, and unconfusing, and, most importantly, have a point.This movie had none of the above. Instead it had a limp little conclusion that should have come at least a half hour earlier. It wasn't a good movie.I'll leave it to others to decide if it was a good portrayal of the Harry Potter books...	2.0	Harry Potter and the Lousy Movie All About Him	2005-09-24	7	4	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RSHGNHZWRQVS	"D. E. Muchnicki-Hurwitz ""hurwitz63"""	"This movie is truly a huge accomplishment. Alfonso Cuaron, the brilliant new director took the bull by its horns and made this script that had great potential into a cinematic masterpiece. The acting is cleared up, all of the main trios' skills improved stunningly. The cinematography was beautiful, showing off the breath-taking landscapes of Hogwarts (and Scotland) in many scenes, including the wondrous scene of Buckbeak's Flight across the lakes and mountains of the campus. The soundtrack was the icing, topping off these lovely scenes and fitting along so well that you hardly notice it is even there. Alfonso Cuaron travelled into grounds that Columbus should have, ones that made this movie a huge improvement over the first two. Everything was so natural, so believable. his tendency for showing the Hogwarts campus in more depth and adding in tiny details and interactions between characters gave this movie the atmosphere the first two lacked. Finally, in this third installment, viewers were pulled into the movie, and actually cared what happened next, hoped for the safety of the kids, wondered endlessly as to who was the bad guy. But not just that, there was a lovely added sense of humour that this director held that made this suddenly dark dark movie give many times for the audience to catch its breath, and the lessen the tension. But no humour could lessen the tension at the dramatic climax to this movie which was pulled off spectacularly. As my son said:""I have been in contact with many fellows of mine who saw the first two movies and laughed at their simple, candy-coated, watered-down staleness. But after seeing this movie, they are in love with the series, the director finally showing audiences that Harry Potter isn't just a child's story.""The reputation of Harry Potter is cleaned up, finally a movie worth standing in front of the series so flawlessly created by JK Rowling.

The first two movies, while still magical, lacked somewhat.  The feeling was that of an over-budgeted BBC TV special.Though I love the books, I can't help but feel the movies deserve better treatment.  I am a fan nonetheless and am thrilled with the excitement of the upcoming ""...Goblet of Fire"".  Hopefully, our young actors will hit it on the nose.  But what do I know.

Finally, Harry Potter is brought to the screen as a movie...and not as a book-on-film!Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the other films. But I think most of my enjoyment came from watching them with a large group of my children's freinds and family.I believe that the first two films suffered from a painfully loyal adaptation of the books. Of course, they couldn't get everything in there...but they sure tried. I love many of Chris columbus' movies, but it felt like he was somewhat imprisoned by the author's iron pen.And then comes this film. One that honors the book, for sure, but finally realizes that the movie must stand as a movie -- which means it must 'move.' It must have either strong plot movement, character arcs, or both.And it also gets the tone right, I think for the first time. This is not a happy story. It is a dark, edgy world that Harry inhabits. I understand that it must be appropriate for the kids who made it the biggest selling book since the Bible...but it also needs to be what it is. And it's a dark story full of death and madness and magic and evil! It's like Shakespeare for kids!I could say more, but I just wanted to acknowledge that they got it right this time...because I am getting excited to see if they get it right again in about a month...when the next installment reaches theatres.Thanks for indulging me.Derek Rydall	4.0	Harry's Story Released From the Prison of Dull Adaptations	2005-09-26	3	2	1

I don't get why people say Prisoner of Azkaban is best one?!! No it is not Chamber of Secrets and both parts of Deathly Hallows are the best ones. This movie does follow parts of the book, but does not follow it really good. Everyone was good in the movie except Ron. It looks like another British Actor who looks like him took his place and acts like if he didn't know who Ron is. Any time I see this movie or hear about it it puts me in a bad mood. The ones who like this movie are either people who haven't read the books or regular people. If you are huge a Harry Potter fan you will be disappointed and just read the book.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2C6909TX15RUW	D. Hickey	"I wasn't even planning on reviewing this movie. It's merits are so self-evident that reviewing it here seemed superfluous. After reading a handful of the ridiculous comments others have written, however, I changed my mind. The two films Christopher Columbus (of Home Alone ignominy) directed are slavishly devoted to the books on which they were based. The results are excremental regurgitations of Rowling's material. They are lifeless, joyless things with nothing to offer a discerning viewer, although they apparently double as a cheap babysitting service to prudish parents with no aesthetic convictions.If Prisoner of Azkaban failed to break box-office records, it's because fans of Rowling's books have been disappointed too many times in the past. This is a shame because Alfonso Cuaron's film is the only one (to date) worthy of its source material. His willingness to depart from the text results in a fresh and entertaining film that completely captures the spirit of Rowling's book. Cuaron is a director perfectly suited to the task presented by this film. He has worked with small children in the past with incredible results (see ""A Little Princess""), and his coming of age story ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is one of the smartest films made in the last ten years. In Azkaban, Cuaron uses his considerable talent to great effect. He humanizes all of the stale characters he has inherited and gets his extremely talented cast to turn in commanding performances. The transformation of starlet Emma Watson is only the most obvious example of his success in this regard. Alan Rickman finally gets screen time in the third film, which comes as a welcome change. The new additions to the cast are all superb - including Michael Gambon tasked with the thankless job of replacing the late Richard Harris. Gambon slips into the role of Dumbledore. Instead of doing his best Harris impersonation, Gambon plays the Hogwarts headmaster as an aging eccentric cryptohippie which is just fine - even if it does force some reviewers to confront the bourgeois prejudices of their class conscious children.Cuaron's film is full of unexpected gems. If you're a micro-managing Potter purist you might be bothered by the fact that Hogwarts has some surprises you aren't expecting. But if you're a fan of movie magic, you'll be swept up in this film and you'll remember what it was you liked about the Harry Potter books to begin with."	5.0	The Only Harry Potter Movie	2004-09-18	12	7	5

That aside, the actors continue to amaze, especially the trio (Harry, Ron, and Hermione). They are maturing with each film, and it is apparent.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3IJKC4XNOU9CF	"Distagon Rollei ""boardgame mania"""	"The film was truely adapted from the book, but just missing too much important information!! I think if the film was made in part 1 and part 2, will be a lot better! However, the scene of the dementors attacking Harry Potter and Sirus Black, then Harry Potter cased the spell in the opposite side of the lake, it was excellent! Exactly the same as the book and my imagination! (only that I imagined the lake was bigger)There was too much information missing in the movie:1) The ghost house they mentioned was in fact the house Professor Lupin hided during full moon when he was young. When he transformed into Werewolf, it was painful and he made some very terrible screaming, that's why people thought it was a ghost house.2) The magical map was actually made by Harry Potter's Father, Sirus Black, Lupin and the Wormtail! They were good friends when they were young in Hogwarts. They were very naughty, wondering around Hogwarts and found out all the secret passways, some even Dumbodore doesn't know! The four names on the map ""padfoot, wormtail, moony and staghorn?"" (can't remember exactly the names, but something like that) are their nicknames! Padfoot as a dog, wormtail as a mouse, moony and wolf and staghorn as a stag (male deer).3) The 3 friends knows Lupin is a werewolf, so they transform themselves into animals, play and fight with the werewolf in the ghost house during fullmoon. James Potter transforms into a stag. That's why Harry saw a stag on the opposite side of the lake.4) Prisoners in Azkarban normally turn mad because the dementors sucked out all their happiness. Only Sirus Black could survive because he had a strong mind and always keep guarding his happy memory, something like that, can't remember very clearly. In the book Sirus Black was very powerful and misterious, since he only appears in the last 1/3 of the book. In movie....5) Remember in Harry Potter 1, Hagrid rided a bike from the sky, carried baby Harry Potter to Dumbodore? in the book, (actually book 1 already mentioned, from Hagrid's mouth.) Sirus Black arrived the murder scene earlier, when Hagrid arrived, Sirus Black decided Dumbodore could protect Harry Potter better, so he gave his bike to Hagrid and let Hagrid take the baby away.6) Sirus Black found out it was Wormtail who betrayed James Potter, when he got the mouse guy, Wormtail shouted Sirus Black was the servant of You Know Who, cut his finger, transformed to a mouse and ran away. The Wizard Ministry arrived and found Sirus Black, and a finger, so they thought Sirus Black killed and destroyed the mouse guy. And locked him into Azkaban.7) Wormtail then hide as a pet in Wisley's family for twelve years...8) Harry Potter should received the new broom half way through the story, and didn't know who sent him the gift. Later found out it was Sirus Black.9) At the end of story, Harry should receive Sirus Black's picture and he became clean and tidy, more human again.10) In the scene of students practicing defense against Boogie in the cupboard, in the book Lupin's fear should be a silver sphere, which no one knew what it was in the beginning. In the movie it was too obvious that his fear was a full moon (with cloud!?)11) In movie it didn't explain why Hermoine went mad and frastrated, it was because she took too many lessons.12) Harry Potter fainted every time when he met the dementors. However, everytime before he faint, he heard of his mother's screaming before she died. This was the memory deep inside Harry Potter. He heard a little bit more each time he fainted, so as the story goes, he actually want to meet the dementors so he could find out more about his parents' death. Which was an very dangerous desire.I understand the movie is only around 2 hours and sacrifices have to be made, and since Harry Potter was the main character, the story of the previous generation had to be eliminated. But sadly that was the best part of the book, so I was terribly disappointed.Anyway, if you enjoy the movie, I strongly recommend you to read the book, you will not be able to put it down once started reading it!!"	3.0	Greatest book/Worst movie in Harry Potter series	2005-12-29	4	1	3

Kleber ""Snooky"""	"This review MAY be a bit of a spoiler, so please try not to read this unless you've read all 7 books. :)The biggest gripe I have with this movie is when the Firebolt appears.  I resent that they do not show McGonagal taking the broom and examining it for possible curses and/or hexes, then giving the Firebolt back to Harry after it had been thoroughly examined and found to NOT have any curses or hexes.  This is why I say this movie does not stay ENTIRELY with the book.  This moves does stay with the book OVERALL.  I just don't like where they brought in the appearence of the Firebolt, although, for the way the movie was made, it works for the movie.  But I still would rather they had stayed more with the book.But I do have to say that the filming of Buckbeak was absolutely TERRIFIC!!! :) :o :)  He looked so real, like an actual real live hippogryph, as though the animal really existed.  If you buy the movie for only one reason, Buckbeak would be it.  It's worth it to see just Buckbeak! :)However, another slight gripe I have is the ""modernizing"" of the clothes worn when the kids are not in class.  DO all the kids, especially those from wizarding families, actually wear ""muggle"" clothes when not in their classes?  How do wizarding families dress casually?  How ""modern"" do the clothes have to be?Another gripe I have about the movie itself is they don't have Harry returning to the Dursley's at the end of the year.  Before book 7, I thought that was really important, but now I'm not so sure.  All I can say is that it would have stayed more with the book had they included Harry going back to the Dursley's.The Dementors were mostly what I'd imagined what they'd look like, but they showed too many pictures of the air turning cold around them.  Just the dementors on the train, at the Quidditch match and at the end are enough, I feel.  Had they cut out the pictures of the air turning cold around the Dementors, they would have had more time to stay more with the book. :)As for the picture and sound effects, I thought they were all great.To summarize, the movie stays with the book, on the whole, but there are a few places where they do NOT stay with the book.  However, the movie is worth the money just to see Buckbeak! :)"	3.0	Although Buckbeak is GREAT, the movie does not stay ENTIRELY with the book...	2007-08-06	5	4	1

And i am a huge fan of movies. A movie has to be a real stinker for me to not like it but this one. Its missing a crucial element that many people would call a ""plot"" theres hardly any continuation in the story. It starts with him recieving a letter to go to Hogsmeade. Wheres Hogsmeade? Then Aunt Marge comes. Whos she? Us Harry Potter fan know, but someone who doesnt wouldnt have a clue.I found myself wishing i could pause the film and fill in all the blanks it leaves.Two huge things are left out of the book. One, the only quidditch final so far that Harry plays in and wins and the other, he is never told that Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were his Dad and his friends, a HUGE revelation in the book.The only reason i gave this movie two stars instead of the One it heartily deserves is because, it was Harry Potter and no matter how bad, that has to count for something.

When I fall in love with a series I want to own the best of it in perfect condition. When I heard of these ultimate editions I immediatly jumped onto Amazon and ordered the first two. Of course first researching greatly to make sure they were the best. They were outstanding and greatly enhanced my Harry Potter watching experience. Best of all they had everything; character cards, extended editions, commentaries, picture books... oh it was glorious. I completely satisfied. So I foolishly broke my own rule and bought the next two editions without my usual extensive reshearch. Ah dissapointment, these next two had only three disks and were cheaply made. And they were missing the best part. The extended edition. Well I had already bought them but am now unsatified and will have to get the better and true ultimate edition, when and if it ever comes out. Until then, my current unsatisfactory editions go into the trash. 60 wasted dollars. If you are a perrfectionist like me and want the true ultimate editions of Harry Potter years 3 and 4 DO NOT BUY NOW. However I do strongly suggest years 1 and 2. REPEAT, RUN FAR FAR AWAY FROM ULTIMATE EDITIONS 3 and 4. Save your hard earned money. I will not be puchasing ultimate editions 5 and 6 until they include everything they should. If you must own the Harry Potter movies now, get the Blue ray box set with all 8 disks which is nothing but the movies in beautiful blure ray.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38UHOCEKSUOSP	"dominion_ruler ""Bryan"""	This movie serves many purposes, and one I see is a transitional period between the first two Potter films into the next two currently out.  The three main characters (Harry, Ron & Hermoine) have quickly grown up, both in terms of physicalness and intelligence.  Each film has also become inreasingly darker, and the Dementors alone in Prisoner give this a very creepy tone that surpases anything we've seen yet.  The story, took me a few viewings to figure everything out.  It contains a bit more depth and detail than previous films, and younger children may not be able to pick all of it up immediately.  What I loved most about the first two films, seems to be a bit lacking in Prisoner.  While there is an interesting story, it takes itself more seriously, thus eliminating some of the great action, humor, and time spent on typical Hogwarts characters.Lack of tight pacing is the biggest reason I don't like Prisoner as much as the other Potter films.  There are smaller details that bothered me as well.  Quidditch is one of my favorite things to watch in the Potter films, however there is only a very small scene of a game in this film, seriously lacking compared to the previous two films.  Draco is still up to no good, thinking he's a teeange villain, but he comes off as a complete wuss in this film.  His father, Lucious, was missed in this film after a nice performance in Chamber.  Valdomort, is not in the story either, though the events of Sirius Black do relate to him.Things I do like though are also smaller matters.  I enjoy the hippogriff in the film, who actually plays a role in the story, and isn't just there for the cool flying scene we first see with he and Harry.  Though the Quidditch game is very short, it was neat while it lasted, taking place in a heavy thunderstorm, displying some impressive effects.  I even enjoyed the map that Harry receives that shows who all is walking Hogwarts at present.  And then there is Professor Snape, who is played as good as ever by Alan Rickman.  As for Dumbledore, no longer played by the late Richard Harris, the new Micahel Gambon seemed unfitting, at first.  After watching the next Potter films in the series, I feel he fills the role quite well.Overall, this is a great film, just my least favorite in the Potter series to date.  Remember though, things begin to get very dark in this one and the story takes some patience to follow.  This is a transitional film in the series, leading to the very much improved and solid Goblet of Fire.Acting - 4.5Action - 3Characters - 4.5Story - 4Overall - 4	4.0	Becoming more adult oriented	2008-01-04	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3RTMB76CJWY9U	DonAthos	"The theme for my reviews of the first two movies in the Harry Potter series complained that 1) they were too frantically-paced, trying to fit everything in at the expense of the overall film and that 2) they were geared to be ""children's movies"" even though the Harry Potter series does not read particularly like children's books, and has a much wider appeal than that.The new director, Alfonso Cuaron, manages to answer both of my complaints, despite starting out with a novel that is both bigger and more complicated than either of the ones before it.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban slows down the pacing of the film series, and gives us some time to catch our breath. Scenes like showing the seasons change by reference to the whomping willow, and Harry and friends eating candy at night (which Columbus doubtless would have cut), remind us that the plot events in the film don't happen in a rush, but take place over the course of a school term.Also, the more intelligent direction, and the darker shades and feel to the film, let us know that Azkaban was not filmed entirely for the under-twelve crowd, which seemed true of the first two movies. The novels themselves get darker over time, it is true, but they were never the glitter-coated candy factories suggested by the first two film adaptations. Adults can watch Prisoner of Azkaban and finally understand that, there might be something for them in these novels after all--an impossible conclusion to draw from the earlier entries in the movie series.Otherwise, as a lover of the books, I only had a few disappointments from details missing in this film. For instance, the lack of explanation about who authored the Marauder's Map was a sore point, as it could've (and should've) been addressed by 30 seconds of dialogue. Still, it will become increasingly impossible to include everything from these books, as Rowling continues to write them larger and larger.Overall, a good movie and a much better adaptation of the third Harry Potter novel than were made of the first two. Director Cuaron easily surpasses Columbus' vision, and leads me to have hopes for the upcoming Goblet of Fire movie."	4.0	New Director Cuaron Does it Better than Columbus Did	2005-11-14	3	2	1

If you purchased the first two Harry Potter film series, then ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" must also be included. How can you leave this film out?  If you are Harry Potter fan, then this DVD is already in your collection. Reviews will only further the controversy between book and film.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is cutting a fine edge between any age family movie and teenager plus movie. As Harry grows up his audience must grow with him. Unfortunately this leaves the younger kids out. ""The Prisoner"" gets more into the scary, horror genre with the black robed Dementors. If I met a Dementor I would be scared to death. Just thinking about that scenario scares me and I'm middle aged.""The Prisoner"" sets up the next step in the Harry Potter series, hopefully as a PG rating and not a PG-13. I would like to see a G rating for the entire series. But as Harry learns his craft he will encounter more black witches, dark warlords and horror characters. The detailed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, well thought out characters, scenery and plot is courtesy of J. K. Rowling's imaginary mind.I have only seen the Harry Potter films. I think by not reading the Harry Potter books I am not inclined to scrutinized and compare inaccuracies with the movies. I just enjoy the films as entertainment. For two hours or more I can divulge myself into an outstanding, well-filmed movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2LP1ZP8E7UQSC	Doug	If this was the first Harry Potter movie, it might be worth a couple more stars.  Unfortunately, it was billed as the third in the series.  I'm sure that the egomaniac that directed this dissapointment feels that he has the true line into the soul of the books.  He might even be right but many of us who purchased this DVD expecting to be entertained for our dollars wasted our money.  The previous movies set a tone that was fun.  Maybe they went too far in that direction but they set a standard that has not been lived up to.  Change was inevitable and probably necessary as the tone of the books is changing.  The fact that the primary characters are growing up and the regrettable loss of Richard Harris all dictated changes.  The bottom line is that when I order a green shirt and get a red one, don't try to tell me that I'm color blind.  At least I can return the shirt.I appreciate cinematography, special effects, staging and suspense created by a skillful director.  If that was what I wanted I could have bought any number of drama or horror movies that would have equaled the dark tone of this movie.  I feel ripped off, not because it's a bad movie but because it deviated from the reasonable expectation.  A clear victory for ego over predictable consistancy.

Happily, by taking a Magical triple-storied ""Knight bus"", he eventually meets up with Hermoine and Ron upon returning to his own enchanted environment. The dichotomy of these living conditions would prove to be quite frustrating, I would imagine, yet Harry perserveres through their ignorance, fear, and subsequent petty aggrivations.The storyline in this sequel is somewhat more involved than the previous, with a most magnificent twist at the end, as he and Hermoine veritably travel back in time to correct the potentially lethal circumstances to save his god-father {Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman, whom you will remember as portraying Count Dracula in the magnificent Francis Ford Copolla version} from the deadly effect of the Dementors, which I must say, are quite impressive creatures themselves, and My personal favorite herein. I see very close comparisons with a certain segment of Black Magicians I know... , the so-called ""Proteus"" notwithstanding.This year, along with the fine resident instructors, there are some new members of the school staff as well as promotions: Professor Lupin {also a werewolf, ergo, the similarity to the latin ""lupus"" for wolf}; Professor Sybil Trelawney {a schizophrenic, crystal ball-gazing fruitcake}; Hagrid is promoted to Professor of enchanted creatures.Malfoy remains a rotten little [...], despite being a part of the fine House of Slytherin, and eventually is the recipient of a broken nose, compliments of little Ms. Granger.Again, in order to condense the film into a two-hour time frame, many scenes whiz by too quickly, but still remains a wonderful compliment to this most imaginative and enchanting series conjured by veritable ""word witch"", the nucleic J.K.

Harry leaves his invisibility cloak beneath the humpbacked witch.7. Harry and Ron and Hermione are using the invisibility cloak to go to Hagrids to see Hagrid. (Need help on this one because we don't remember all the details.)8. Scabbers bites Ron's hand, and Ron comes out of the invisibility cloak to grab scabbers. Harry and Hermione chase after him beneath the invisibility cloak. They leave the invisibility cloak outside the willow which tips snape off about the cave beneath the willow.9. Snape mentions seeing the Marauders map on Lupin's desk when bringing Lupin his potion.10. Snape loses his Merlin 1st Class award when Fudge discovers Sirius has escaped the tower.11. Snape enters the Shrieking Shack wearing Harry's cloak, in the theater release. In this one, he just walks in.12. Harry visits Snape's office because Malfoy saw Harry's head in Hogsmead, and reported it to Snape. Harry sees Snape's pensive and uses it. He sees his father tormenting Snape as a student, and Lily stopping it.13.

It does have a few great scenes, the actors all shine in spite of the bizarre directing, and it is Harry Potter.  But be prepared for disappointment.  There is a lot of wasted screen time with the willow tree (which this director put in a completely different location), as well as wasted time on some inane and pointless talking heads that he wrote into the script (presumably for comic relief, but to most adults they will just come off as extremely annoying).  Most of the dialogue is good, though I found the scene with Sirius and Lupin (when Lupin turns into a werewolf) nauseatingly overdone.  There are also giant plot holes, including the origin of the Map, which is not only extremely important, but also very obvious even to those who have never read the book.  Lupin tells Harry ""yes, I know it's a map.""  That is all.  No explanation, no back story, nothing.  Harry's patronus appears at one point as the Stag, but they never explain why or even mention it.  The dementors, on the other hand, are portrayed in a different manner than the book; however, it works well.

Holden ""Da Reel Deal"""	"I read ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" just before seeing the movie, and to my surprise, I didn't hate the movie.  Sure, a few things were changed or deleted, but you have to expect that with a movie based on a book.  I know that the first 2 movies were hardly changed at all, but this film was different:  darker tone and a new director.  It was going to be changed based on those factors alone.  Also, if every single detail from the book were put into the movie, the movie would have been drawn out too much (not so much in length, but in story), and for those who haven't read the books faithfully, they would have gotten bored  with so many explanations.I'm giving this 4 stars because it's a really awesome movie with great cinematography...but I was (and still) weary about one factor:  the new Dumbledore.  Not that he doesn't look great or go by the book, but to put such a different take on an established character is just not a great idea.  I mean, I can look past it, but most audiences can't.

Some have said it would be confusing to those who weren't familiar with the series' plots.  Some said it was too dark.  I actually felt the second movie, not the third, was confusing, and I appreciate the darkness in the movies.  The whimsy of the first books fades into darker and more complex plots as the series goes on, but the books only get better.  I was quite comfortable with the movie's version of the plot and didn't feel at all confused.  Since then, I read the series and although there were certainly plot differences, this book was also over 100 pages longer than its predecessors so obviously, some things had to be cut.  I don't envy the screenwriter, but I loved the movie before and after I read the book.  I think he captured the essence of the book, and that's all you can ask for.  Can't wait to see what they do with the fourth book, regardless of who directs the film. I'd like to see this guy come back.  (I was however surprised in the cinematic changes in the sets--Hagrid's hut and the position of the Whomping Willow, etc--but who cares?! The cast and plot is great!)	5.0	In my opinion, the best yet of the movies!	2004-08-12	16	14	2

The problem I have with the film is not so much as what you would see on the screen, but what you see in the packaging. Warner Bros. has decided that they haven't made enough money on this franchise yet, and has scaled back their packaging from the nice paper cases to the standard cheap plastic.Anyone who has a movie collection has got to be at least a little frustrated with the studio. Think what your DVD collection would look like with the first two LOTR extended edition DVD sets sitting next to ROTK in a cheap little plastic case. And why?

For instance in the last scene Dumbledore was supposed to lock the to kids in the Ward and it ended there. That aint even close to the end according to the book. Also the kids did not have thier uniforms on all the time they were in school. In my opinion I think they should have.I hope the next movie follows the book a little closer, because the goblet of fire is probably the best book after the first one. All in all though it was a pretty good movie and when it come out on tape I will purchase it.I believe they need Cris Columbus back as the director he was much better.	4.0	HP & the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-06-13	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABR2S8LWEISP9	"""edenburn2"""	The only reason Scabbers hung around so much was because there was so much cheese in this film. There was no time spent at the Dursley household, which by the way is the only place humor should be found in the HP films. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job writing the book, and it did not deserve a rewrite from a director who either has not read the book, or has a reading retention problem. The effects would have been good, had you been able to focus steadily on the screen. The camera needed a petrificus totalus spell cast on it so that one could watch. The camera swayed, shifted, zoomed, faded, twisted, turned, tilted, and slanted more then cameras for the 60's version of the Batman television series. You get so dizzy, like you spent 2 hours in a dryer spinning around.Hardly any Quidditch, hardly any Percy, hardly any background story as to the relationships between Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, Snape, and Harrys parents. Flashbacks would have been great instead of narrated stories showing people looking around out of breath. Flashbacks from Lupin, Black, and Snape were NECESSARY. The Whomping WIllow moved, where was Dumbledore and McGonagall? Wasn't the Firebolt a Christmas present?I sincerely hope that Christopher Columbus takes a good look at this, and decides to come back to Harry Potter for future films. When popular books get made into film, you need to stay true to the writings and take less creative license to alter it into something it wasn't. And for the love of all things Potter, Director Cuaron needs to read the book before filming.	2.0	Loved the book...	2004-06-05	14	8	6

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1S64NSCJWKQXE	E. F. Blenk	I hadn't read any of the Harry Potter books until I saw this movie. I watched the first two in the movie theatre and thought that they were very childish and shallow, though fun at times and certainly worth the time.But when I saw Prisoner of Azkaban I finally came to realize what Harry Potter is about. It's not just about magic and stairs cases moving around and 'what you would imagine a magical school to be like', its a complex story about three wonderful characters. This movie may leave out some of the plot points that I have come to appreciate now that I have read all of the books, and yes I think it might have done well to at least show the stag coming in the second Patronus scene, although you can actually make out the antlers coming out of the cloud so its not like they inexplicably forgot all about it. I think they just had to make sure they covered up Harry completely which is harder to do in a movie than in a book, even though they did defocus the first scene across the lake, as if framing from Harry's point of view as he passes out. And i also think that they could have made the connection to Harry's father, although Black's final speech to Harry about 'those who we love remain inside of us' is still stirring and not inappropriate at all. It is also much better coming from Sirius than Dumbledore (who makes the speech in the book) because Sirius is the one who really knew James and Lilly and misses them so much.I've seen Goblet of fire a number of times and I can recognize that the director of that film - Mike Newell - was impressed by Cuaron's cinematography and tried to incorporate that into his film, all the while remaining oblivious to what really made Cuaron's movie a master piece and by FAR the best movie yet. Cuaron got wonderful performances out of the main three, particularly in the emotional scenes mostly shared by Harry and Hermione. I'm sure that the actors who play the main trio are extremely talented, but they are also so young, and they clearly respond strongly to the director's comments which is why they have very different performances under the three directors.Mike Newell went for the semi-serious teenage boarding school approach which resulted in very static portrayals of the main three. This is especially apparent with Hermione who hardly seems to escape from a perpetual bad mood. Did the director forget that Hermione, although certainly high strung at times, is also so kind and helpful to Harry, and when the chips are down, and Harry is in so much danger, the beauty of her character emerges. She no longer cares about rules, and school and lessons and 'cleverness' she just cares about her friends. Which is no doubt why she is in Gryfindor and not ravenclaw. Getting back to the PoA, Hermione is exactly how she is in the book.The cinematography truly is beautiful in the PoA, but so is the character direction, the innovation of the magical world and even the depth of the story. When Peter Petigrew speaks to Sirius and Remus about Voldemort, we can feel a real sense of dread and history. We see the landscape of Hogwarts, how it is a school of the outdoors as well as of classrooms and hidden chambers. When Harry flies on the Hippogriff we feel his sense of freedom and his desire to escape the prison of the Dursley's as well as the isolation brought from being 'the boy who lived'. It is subtle, there isn't narrative to fill in the gaps or unnecessary dialogue. The film works as a film. It uses sight and sound as well as feeling and dialogue to show us the hearts of the characters which is what I think Harry Potter is about. This films shows us WHY Harry can be the one to defeat Voldemort. Because he is this normal person who has friends and who loves them and whom he equally relies upon for love.The other movies just go through the motions.But there are still three movies to go, and many more brilliant moments to take advantage of, but they need a more talented film director than Mike Newell to capture them as well as Cuaron. Why not bring Cuaron back?	5.0	They must bring this beautiful style back to the 5th movie.	2006-03-21	4	4	0

I do not use the extra stuff included in these movies. I only buy them for the movie.  I already owned all the movies in blu-ray when thye began releasing them in the Ultimate Edition.  I read somewhere that this edition was the extended version so I ordered the first two.  They were slightly disappointing since they only had the extensions we have been seeing for years on ABCFM-TV but they were, at least, extended.  Thinking I would get more of the same, I ordered the next two releases, Ultimate Editions 3 & 4.  I was shocked to see they did not even have the couple of extra scenes shown on TV.

It was clear that either the screenwriter or director didn't care much about the characters or the plot. Hermione and Ron seemed to be mere stage dressing for Harry, and many of the character interactions seemed to lack just a few more line to help it all make sense.The most coherent theme in the movie is the idea of time.  Quite a bit of film was dedicated to showing a great pendulum that was incorporated into the castle, a clock tower, representations of moving solar systems, and the whomping willow reflecting the changing seasons.  One thing that was not clear was Hermione's use of time. She appears and disappears a few times, but her overburdened schedule, exhaustion and irritability are almost entirely left out of the screen version.  Ron makes one comment about her being in two places at once, and that's it.On the whole, the way the characters were handled is rather poor. Ron's character is cut to almost pure window dressing.  He has a few ""mental""'s and other signature Ron comments, but that's about it for him.  His antagonistic relationship with Hermione and Crookshanks seems to be an afterthought when it's displayed at all. The connection of Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs, as nicknames for Lupin, Sirius, Pettigrew and James is skipped altogether. There is also no mention of Harry's patronus, the stag, being connected with his father.There was one bright spot of human emotion in the characters of the film.  Harry and Lupin form a good bond.  This relationship is the truest and most authentic in the whole movie.  Dumbledore is another character that was handled well.  He comes across as jovial and kind, but his personality has some strength behind it.I thought the casting for the new characters was very good.  The new Dumbledore was at least as good as the original, if not a tiny better.  The new teachers were believable in their roles, and I liked the addition of the headless hunt running through the castle.  I would have preferred to have a CGI Crookshanks to the real one, only because it would have been possible to show a little bit of the cooperation between Crookshanks and Sirius as a dog.All in all, it had some nice features, but it wasn't up to par with the first two.  Directors and screenwriters need to realize that when they adapt a popular book, the audience has already fallen in love with the characters and plot.  Their job is to add the images and make it come alive.  If there is a 4th installment, I hope the writers and directors pay a little more attention to character development, and less to interesting cinematography."	3.0	Not nearly as good as it could have been.	2004-06-04	206	121	85
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A31Y33VOAWZHI6	Elias Wolff	This is by far my favorite Harry Potter film. We all know Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is an awesome director, and here he shows it.First, I will comment on some of the other reviews. It seems that the puritan fans of the series (the books), don't appreciate the fact that Cuar&oacute;n took some liberties with his adaptation. I strongly disagree. First, given the fact that films and literature are very different forms of art and communication, in order to make a story interesting and fun, you just can't narrate them in the same way. Talking about subplots being trimmed, that is just out of pure necessity, but I'm convinced they made very good choices.Plus, it's exactly this liberties, exploited to the best, that makes this film so enjoyable. To this, the time line is adapted quite freely, and the way time regression is handled is just splendid (I dare say, more interesting than in the book).All characters are getting more complex (they were fairly two dimensional in Philosopher's Stone), the cinematography is simpli beautiful, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black fits perfectly.Funny thing, being this chapter my favorite, and the only one where Voldemort doesn't make an appearance.One last thing. I you haven't read the book, and you plan to, this is a very rare case where it may be advisable to watch the film first, since the surprises are, in my opinion, more shocking here, but that may be to each taste (bad thing, once you do one, you ruin a little the other).	5.0	Best of the series, so far.	2006-09-22	4	3	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3EHXVP24OLLKM	"Eliza Bennet ""Lizzy"""	"While this was my favorite book of the series, it was my least favorite movie. I understand the  movies are getting darker as Harry grows older, as do the books ,but I think the director made a mistake in making it as scary as a ""Halloween"" or ""freddie kruger"" type horror movie! They have to realize the main audience of this series are children! My 8 year old son LOVES (I should say loved) HP and could not WAIT to see the movie. Well, all I can say is he was TERRIFIED and had nightmares for over a month after seeing it. It was awful. He HATED it and cried and cried to me and said, ""mommy, why would they make a movie for kids so scary?""I wonder the same thing myself. There was absolutely NO reason to make the werewolf scene as graphic and scary as it was. None.  The dementors did not scare him, even though they are actually much scarier in theory. The werewolf could have been handled the same way, kind of veiled and hinted at rather than full-blown special effects that would rival any hollywood horror flick.Aside from it being way too scary for kids under 13 or 14, I took issue with the huge plot changes.  The director may not have liked where chris columbus placed hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, but how can he just completely change the set and not think we will notice? Not that the new set was BAD, it just was completely different from the first, and kind of insulting to the audience, like we are too stupid to remember that hagrid's hut was never down a steep slope near a lake.The other issue I felt was huge was the maurader's map plot not being at least explained a little. The fact that harry's dad made the map with his best friends lupin, pettigrew and black, and that they were all animagi was an integral part of the story. If you don't understand that,how can you know that harry's dad really was the stag that saved him from the dementors? If you didnt' read the book you would not truly understand the movie.So, while it would be ok as a stand alone movie, I think it fell short of the goal, which is being a cohesive stepping stone in a series. Too much was changed and left out. Plus, it will scare the living daylights out of any child under 13.Parents be warned!"	4.0	Too Scary for kids!	2004-12-12	12	6	6

Suffice it to say that I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first two. While Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are maturing in their acting styles, they're losing the childness that I liked so much in the Socerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the fact that hardly anybody seems to be wearing the school uniform anymore; in fact, during the entire last half of the movie, Harry and Hermione wear jeans and sweatshirts! Where are the Gryffindor cloaks, the ties and scarves, that were ever-present before?Another thing- the director has seemingly forgotten about Quidditch. Aside from a brief scene somewhere around the middle, Quidditch is completely gone from the daily life of the students at Hogwarts. It seems to me that, as more Harry Potter movies are made, the more the director sacrifices quality for quantity or nothing at all.However, I enjoyed the scene with Buckbeak- those of you who have read the Prisoner of Azkaban will know what I'm talking about.	3.0	Doesn't live up to the standards of the first two movies	2004-07-29	2	2	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1655SGPPUUCRP	Emily Todd	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is by far the best Harry Potter film yet!  The challenge of translating the beloved books to screen has indeed taken some time to perfect.  The first two films were good, but not great.  This one is great.  Everything comes together; the acting, the story, the flow, and the magic.  If anything, I felt that the first two films really lacked that magical, wondrous feeling of the books.  Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n captures this and then some!  I was truly enchanted by this film and I think that Cuar&oacute;n should be given the credit.  He really pulled together a film franchise that was most definitely taking a nosedive.  People were becoming disinterested with the films and all that Potter had to offer.  It was all becoming the same and fairly repetitive.With the books, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was where J.K. Rowling's writing style and the storyline began to change and get much darker and involving.  This was the perfect opportunity for producers to turn things around and they did beautifully.  The magic is back!As the franchise matures, so do the youthful actors.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all matured tremendously and really become their characters this time around.  Before it was ""Look, there's Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter!""  Now, Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter.  In addition to satisfying performances by Potter newbies Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, audiences get to enjoy the always-wonderful Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, etc. And while it's sad to see the deceased Richard Harris gone from his role as the lovable Dumbledore, we couldn't have asked for a better successor than Michael Gambon.The story is extra-dark this time, as Harry returns to school for a third year with the knowledge that the murderous Sirius Black has escaped from prison and is likely to be looking to add Harry to his roster of victims. It's not particularly reassuring that Hogwarts is being guarded by a spooky group of Nazgul-reminiscent (""Lord of the Rings"") Dementors, as they're just about as dangerous as the man they are trying to capture and certainly more scary!  Harry, Hermione and Ron get themselves into loads of trouble this time around, as they try to sort out who's really dangerous and who is on their side."	5.0	"""Something wicked this way comes"""	2004-11-16	12	8	4

I also realized my favorite parts from the book hadn't made the cut into the movie and the scenes were all out of order.  Although Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n did a nice job of piecing the scenes together.

This newest movie did not have the same feel as the first two Harry Potter movies.  I kept finding myself looking around to see if I was in the right theater.  The movie was too dark and confusing.  It did not seem to match the book.  I was surprised the author had allowed this director to produce the 3rd movie in this way.  I wanted to see the whole movie because it was a Harry Potter movie but at the same time the urge to leave the theater early was pretty strong.  We were all a bit disappointed by this movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3RGXKP7B6GZ5U	ENGteacher2000	"When I heard the mixed reviews from my friends about ""Azkaban,"" I thought it prudent to wait until it came out on video, rather than spend theater-level bling on it. Truth be known, I'm very glad I didn't. I found myself sharing the sentiments of Comic Book Guy on ""The Simpsons"": ""Worst movie ever""--well, in this series at least. Now, I'm not all negative: Buckbeak and the dementors were quite well done, and Dawn French makes an excellent Fat Lady. But the storyline, character development, and even the geography of this movie seem muddled, hurried, and downright inconsistent. When was Hagrid's Hut ever down a ruddy great hill? Where's the smooth slope in the first movies? And where does this bridge come from? And this pendulum in the front door? And why are kids wearing Muggle clothes to all-wizarding Hogsmeade? The first movies thrive on a close rendering of Rowling's text. We WANT to see the books come to life, and we had up until now. I believe that part of what makes the LOTR movies so powerful is their sense of cohesiveness, brought about, at least in part, by one director and one vision. Too many cooks spoil the stew and all that.Lost is the sense of continuity and close reading of the text found in ""Stone"" and ""Chamber."" I found the movie highly compressed in terms of plot, with many events happening on top of each other, or not at all in the book. Important characters like Lupin and Pettigrew get only a broad stroke, hinting at who they are. The Marauder's Map is integral to the story, yet gets treated like a mere plot device in the movie. Many scenes got Reader's Digested: for instance, the scene in the Three Broomsticks where Harry is learning about Sirius from the conversation among McGonagall, Fudge, Flitwick and Hagrid. This scene offered the opportunity for some first-class acting from folks we just don't get to see enough of in the other movies, and it's given a quick brushover--what a shame. Overall, the movie felt rushed and embryonic in comparison with the others. And now I see we have yet ANOTHER director for ""Goblet."" Please, just give Chris Columbus whatever he wants, and let's get back into the winning groove of the first two."	2.0	How Do I Spell Relief? C-O-N-T-I-N-U-I-T-Y	2004-11-27	12	8	4

It has an emotional richness that rises above some of the silliness of the other films. Prof. Lupen as the new teacher and Sirius Black are both strong and complex characters, both with their inner demons and hidden strengths. Lupen and Potter's talks are amongst the most moving moments in the entire series - talks about finding a mentor and retaining one's confidence in the face of fear.  John Williams' soundtrack is excellent and really sets the mood.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SW80RQNB3DMK	EquesNiger	"First off, I have to confess I haven't read a single one of the myriad Harry Potter books out there. In that regard, I might have enjoyed the film better than some of those who had, and who complain that the film doesn't adhere too strictly to the book. I know that I had my apoplectic moments in ""The Two Towers"", in particular, being a die-hard purist when it comes to the sanctity of Tolkien's story.This is, by far, a much darker story than the previous two and, based on what I know of the books, later installments are darker, still. In some respects, the heroic trio of Hermione, Ron and Harry behave a bit more like members of Slytherin house in this one, with Harry and Hermione in particular indulging in temper tantrums, knocking and breaking things (occasionally someone else's body parts) and generally doing exactly what the rules forbid, albeit for noble reasons on the most part. Regardless, the set and tone for the film could be straight out of and Edward Gorey picture book.The film starts off with perhaps a more real-world view of the Dursleys and their treatment of Harry. In the previous two films, this ""child abuse"" was treated with an almost comic gloss which I, personally, found a bit demeaning to the reality of what real world children in that situation experience. Here, it's ugly, and rightfully so.Once Harry attempts to return to the ""sanctuary"" of Hogwarts, he encounters the Dementors, his implacable enemies throughout the film, and Prof. Lupin, who, in this film at least, supercedes Dumbledore as his primary adult ally. Snape's malevolence seems more directed at Lupin, his colleague, than any of the trio, with Snape actually engaging in a bit of a rescue of the three at the end, or at least trying to. Despite his ominous attitude, Snape shows a tremendous sense of duty and integrity regardless of House affiliation. Then again, I am partial to anything which Rickman does as an actor.Disappointing is Sir Gambon as Dumbledore. He doesn't possess the weight and charisma one would expect of the character, though Sir Harris is definitely a difficult act to follow.The true stars of the show, as it were, are the three young actors, and the set. Watson and Grint continue to demonstrate a tremendous future in their chosen careers. Grint, in particular, can eloquently express in his facial expressions alone what Radcliff has yet to ascertain how to do with all of his acting tools, combined. Regardless, Radcliff shows some maturity and is less stiff and more believable in this installment, provided one overlooks those scenes where extreme emotion is called for. Watson, without a doubt, is destined to be one of Britain's leading ladies in her adulthood.The set design of this film is superb. While the previous Hogwarts and Diagon Alley settings were more Medieval Fantasy for the former, and Dickensian Christmas for the latter, both have undergone a much needed update. Diagon Alley now looks and feels like a piece of late Victorian society, with coal choked and dingy industrial revolution streets, while Hogwarts itself appears an old castle periodically updated to the Victorian age. The classrooms are stunning, particularly that of Defense Against the Dark Arts, where Lupin holds sway.  The environs of the castle itself reflect a much more pagan and magickal aire, with dolmens and other mysterious archeological relics abounding. Finally, as a fan of Prague, I was delighted to see that the set designers had incorporated an astronomical clock into Hogwarts, though it's location of the pendulum at the entrance was unlikely, at best.The story itself is perhaps less thrilling than any of the past, but the caliber of the acting carries the film to the top of the three, in my opinion."	5.0	The Best of the Three So Far	2005-01-09	11	7	4

I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.  I also enjoyed this movie immensely.  I agree that changes were made and things were moved around but the overall feeling of what JK Rowling was trying to convey remained the same.  I am not sure when but I did read an interview once that stated that JK Rowling approved of what Cuaron did with the film.  If she was OK with it, then I am too.As the books get longer, it becomes harder and harder to fit everything in.  Artistic licence had to be taken in order to make it manageable.  When you go to see the film, it may be helpful to remember that it is a movie in its own right and to view it as such.  Do not immediately start judging it based on how the book went and you should enjoy it just fine.For the people who say that too much was left out, I agree with you in some respects.  There were aspects of the book which were left out that should have been kept due to the fact that they play important roles in the next books.At least with the movie being different, people can't say, ""oh well I've seen the movie so I don't need to read the book.""  :-)Oh, and one last comment.  To the reviewer who stated that they didn't like the set location due to it looking more like Scotland then England...  Hogwarts Castle is located in Scotland.  While the students all depart from Kings Cross Station in London, the Hogwarts Express takes them to Scotland.  Please do not feel that I am in any way infringing on your rights to review..  I respect everyone's opinion regardless of whether it agrees with my own or not.  I just wanted to point out that little fact.  Perhaps it might give you a greater appreciation for the cinematography in the film.  Feel free to disagree with me anytime.  :-)"	4.0	A movie in its own right	2004-08-19	5	5	0

But beeing a great fan of J.K.Rowling, I have to admit that the third movie was much worse than the previous two. I think the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, made a serious error when trying to rewrite the story in his own fashion. It was clear to everyone that he won't be able to write as wonderfully as J.K.Rowling does. Alfonso Cuaron skipped too many episodes and made the movie look like series of peices. There is absolutely no connection between the scenes. The roles of characters are also reduced to be more simple. The part with  Harry's stag Patronus and the relationship of it to Harry's father was simply skiped, like so many other parts.Some other reviewer mentioned the Muggle clothing in the Hogwarts School of Whitchcraft and Wizardry. Nonetheless, I feel that I must comment on it too. It startled and disappointed me...Did anybody notice that the Hogwarts grounds were modified? I certainly did, to my great surprise. What for???The following is my most important objection to the movie. The new actors don't look in the least like what the fans imagined them to be. Also their personalities are sometimes simplified, sometimes exadurated, not at all following the original plan. Sirius Black looks slightly hysterical when he announces that Scabbers is an animagus Peter Pettigrew. Where's his renowned bravery? When Remus Lupin fights the Dementors on Hogwarts Express, he is actually SMILING. Can you imagine a person smiling when he fights a Dementor? When Dumbledore welcomes the students to Hogwarts, he looks like Jesus Christ crucifyed on the cross. Speaking about Dumbledore...what can I say? No offence to the actor, but the new Dumbledore was terrible, simply ghastly. For some reason, he is always dressed in rags. Where are the handsome embroidered robes from the first two movies? Why does he have to pat Ron on his injured leg, if he knows that hurts him? It's not humorous, but foolish. When Harry and Hermione return to the hospital wing after setting Sirius free, they see Dumbledore-and does he acknowledge their heroic deed? NO!!! He simply says ""what?"" when Hermione declares ""we did it!"". ""What"", indeed!In average, the movie was not very bad. It's just a pity that  the new director modified the plot. (Or should I say, ""deleted the plot""?)If he followed J.K.Rowling's plan, the movie of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban would have been so much better."	3.0	The new Potter movie not nearly as good...	2004-09-03	8	5	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1FZGU5P9ODJDR	Eva-P	I started out being a little disappointed with the film, but as I sat through it with my daughter (who is 25), who had never read this book in the series, I could tell by her reactions that she was not only enthralled, but well able to keep up with the important points of the story. The dementors actually affected her very appropriately, and we're talking about a serious horror genre junkie, here.I loved the new set, and having lived in England at one time, found the darkness, the heaviness of stone, and the dreary light very suitable and realistic.  I also found the landscapes and village scenes wonderful as well.Considering the length and complexity of this book, I thought the director did a good job of pressing in the important highlights while still keeping it under 4 hours.

It was all so vivid.Kids in real life grow up and have different stages in their lives through adulthood, why shouldn't fictional characters? If some readers don't like this type of writing, then read elsewhere because that's just what Ms. Rowling is doing, simulating a REAL LIFETIME, not some sort of Charlie Brown perpetual childhood (which is ok, but not what's going on in these stories).The people that are complaining that this is too mature, horror-flickish, etc. are probably the same one's who don't want their kids having access to proper sex education or protection, then moronically freak out when they get pregnant or get STD's.

Not only that, but the story is DRAMATICALLY changed. Intregal plots are completely removed and stupid twists are thrown in that are not remotely similar to what happened in the book.

They're complaning about all the stuff that got left out. (No Quidditch final! No Sneakoscope!) They're grousing about how different Hogwarts castle and grounds look, and how drab the colors are, and how the Dementors aren't supposed to fly, and, and, and...Lighten up, people!""Prisoner"" is definitely the best HP film so far. Cuaron knows that this is where the series really takes a darker, more mature turn, and directs accordingly. I loved his use of atmospheric tension and cool scenery. In every film, Hogwarts seems to have evolved into a different edifice; much of the action here takes place in a part of the castle we haven't seen before: a courtyard with a fountain, steep steps leading to a circle of standing stones and then to Hagrid's cabin, a massive iron clock with a pendulum that swings back and forth before the entryway...this stuff is GOOD!The special effects are all superb. The Dementors, drifting around in their torn robes (or is that skin?) and sucking the life out of everything in sight, are creepy as heck. Buckbeak the hippogriff is gorgeous, and the scene where Harry rides him across the lake is one to cheer at. The inflation of Aunt Marge and the Knight Bus are hilarious, the brief Quiddith scene is gripping, and ""Prisoner"" may be the first-ever movie to take a scientific view of what a werewolf would look like (something half-human, half-wolf has gotta be unnatural, and also kind of sad). The Whomping Willow has also evolved; in addition to the big pounding limbs from ""Chamber of Secrets,"" it now has several thin, whippy branches that it uses to knock people off their feet. Hey, I liked it. And the time-travel sequence, with its subliminal ticking clock on the soundtrack, was -- in Ron's words -- brilliant.The acting hits all the right notes. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all matured quite a bit, in their acting as well as their bodies. Radcliffe has presence on screen; the scene where he learns that Sirius Black was his parents' friend who betrayed them to Voldemort has real pathos. All the old adult actors do their shtick again, and we've got plenty of new faces as well. David Thewlis projects weary kindness as Lupin, Emma Thompson is wonderfully spacey as Trelawny, Gary Oldman balances calmness and dementia as Black, Michael Gambon does a nice job showing us that, in the books, Dumbledore is actually a little unhinged, Pam Ferris makes a perfectly detestable Aunt Marge, and Timothy Spall plays Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew as if he really was part rat. Props all around!Okay, the film wasn't perfect. I missed the Quidditch and thought that Crookshanks the cat got ripped off (featured prominently in the book; hardly there in the movie). I was annoyed that they didn't really explain the relationship between Lupin, Black, Pettigrew, and Harry's father, and what they did for each other. Without that context, the apperance of the silver stag at the climax makes no sense to anyone who hasn't read the books. I missed Sir Cadogen, the mad knight, although I loved what they did with the moving paintings otherwise (watch for the giraffe). And, as always, I wish the movie could have lingered a bit more instead of marching doggedly from important plot point to important plot point. ""Prisoner"" is actually shorter than the first two films, even though the book's longer....would it have killed them to take the extra three minutes to explain who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were?Apart from these minor qualms, I really loved ""Prisoner."" But I don't think anyone should let themselves be influenced by the pro-movie and anti-movie camps. So if you've got a friend who saw the movie and can't stop whining about how Neville and Ginny weren't in the scene on the train with the Dementors, don't worry about it!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A73DFWJE0CGY6	"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee"""	"First, I must say that I have read all the books so far (at the urging of my college English professor - thanks, Mary), I've seen all the movies, and I long ago accepted the fact that you cannot expect a movie taken from a 700-page (approximation; don't really know how many pages there are) book to bear very much resemblance to the original. Get over it.Now that that's out of the way, this was my favourite of the Harry Potter movies. My favourite moment, by far, was Hermione giving Malfoy a well-deserved slug on the gob, but I've been waiting for it to happen; it doesn't do a lot for plot advancement, but it was satisfying.Harry has had it with his insufferable Muggle relatives and, after an unfortunate moment with his piggish aunt (in which he blimpifies her for remarks about his parents; I quite enjoyed that as well), takes off on his own with all his worldly goods. It doesn't take him long to consider that his timing might have been a bit off, as he sits in a creepy deserted park at midnight and wonders if that's really a vicious black dog across the road. Miraculously, just as he's about to find out, along comes the Night Bus (""for...the stranded witch or wizard""), a device I honestly don't remember being in the book but might have been; here, it works well as a way of getting Harry out of Muggle-Land and back in the magical realm.Delivered to the Leaky Cauldron, he hooks up with his friends Hermione and Ron and is put on the Hogwarts Express. It is there where we are first introduced to the Dementors, evil wraithlike beings assigned to find and retrieve Sirius Black, a convicted killer who has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is on the hunt for Harry, who also happens to be his godson. Perhaps because of his connection to Sirius, the Dementors home in on Harry, who is rescued by another new - but subsequently recurring - character, Remus Lupin, the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher.They arrive at Hogwarts under the cloud of the Dementors' presence - the creatures are supposedly there for protection - and the year begins, with the requisite bad choices of magical beasties on Hagrid's part (as professor of Magical Beasts, he unerringly chooses some critter that is an overall menace to the greater part of the student body)and the consequent accident which seems to be a plot device. I enjoyed the hippogriff, and it proved important to the story; but it did take a while to get back to the hunt for Sirius Black. This line of the plot was aided by Ron's older twin brothers - underused, in my opinion; I enjoy every minute they are on screen - who, being the scamps they are, possess a marvelous map - nicked from the school custodian - that shows where everyone in the school confines might be found. They give the map to Harry, and from there the pace escalates toward the eventual confrontation with Sirius Black and other bad elements.I do have one pathetically minor quibble - the Whomping Willow must be able to move from place to place, as it seems to be a mile from where we last saw it in Movie #2. And this movie - aside from a mention here and there - is totally devoid of any manifestations of Lord Voldemort, which perhaps is not a bad thing.Overall I found this movie to be more watchable than the other two previous - it's both darker and lighter than the second one; there is more humour used here, but on the other hand, the whole Dementors thing is too intense for little kids, as is the werewolf segment - and, yes, the book is better. The book is ALWAYS going to be better. Your own imagination is a great and powerful tool. But as cinema, this is not bad at all."	4.0	was i watching a different movie than you-all?	2006-07-29	3	2	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1VK37V9TWJEHD	"'floaty pen' ""debbie"""	This movie is definitely better paced than previous two as well as manages to hold the viewer's attention better. The direction is not the absolute copy of the book that we saw in the earlier movies and its better for it. As the books get longer after this, it would obviously be impossible as well as unnecessary to have such verbatim copies.The movie, perhaps through more muggle clothes or usage of language or the cinematography, manages to make the atmosphere more real than the fairytale quality of the previous movies and therefore may be more palatable for the adult audience. Its a crucial positive because the adult audience feels more involved as the movie makes the jump out from being too wrapped up in a wizard world atmosphere which few can consistently relate to, (especially in a movie where emotions cannot be as well communicated as when described in books).The special effects are great, the magic is seamlessly woven into the storyline and does not stand apart as isolated instances or become the focus in themselves, the pace is definitely more focused towards the climax of the meeting between Harry and Sirius.Dumbledore does not have the soft cottonwool feel but Michael Gambon manages to bring a tougher edge to the character which however is not quite Dumbledore, Ian McKellen from Lord of the Rings would have been preferable. Harry's acting is marginally better, Sirius is perfect but the rest of the cast does not seem to have improved in their acting skills. Even Prof Trelawney's character has been much curtailed in this movie which inhibits the exhibition of the true histrionic skills of Emma Thompson. Prof Lupin, contrary to the book, seemed quite well fed and latently energetic which jarred my perceptions a little.Unforgivable liberties with the book were the flying dementors, I thought they could only glide (though I must say apart from the flying, the dementors were perfect), the deletion of the all important last Quidditch match which was crucial in Harry being able to successfully do the Patronus charm later and the rather shortened climax which may have baffled most of the people who had not read the book, as also deletion of smaller things like Crookshanks stopping the whomping willow from thrashing about by pressing a knot, explanation of padfoot prongs wormtail and moony, Harry's receiving the firebolt for xmas,etc. And what was all that sci-fi style white light doing in the scene regarding the patronus charm??!! Buckbeak and the werewolf version of Prof Lupin were great though.Overall good pacy movie but could definitely be improved and some key features should not have been deleted for the sake of brevity. I would have given it a 4 if it was just any other movie but in the context of the kind of expectations that we have from harry potter movies, I will have to give it a 3 in terms of the satisfaction that I received from seeing the movie after all the hype.	4.0	Good movie, could be better	2004-07-12	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38JWSLCF9AYOZ	Fluffy's Owner	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban earns a 5-star review from me (typical). One factor is the acting, which went from superb to perfect! Another is the increasing dark and increasing interesting story. Make no mistake; there are funny moments in the film, too. For instance, the candy that makes you sound like a creature. Another example is when Harry pelts Malfoy with snow, invisibly. Of course, Hermione demanding an apology from Ron is worth a laugh as well. As we watch each film, we see more of Harry's world. Things begin to make sense: how did Voldemort know where Harry's parents were? Who is Scabbers, the rat? Why did Hermione decide to change her hairstyle in subsequent films (yes, that is covered in the film). To those of you who want to know the answer, she thought her hair looked horrible, after seeing it from the back. Anyway, despite that humorous moment, this film, is a great deal darker than the first two, although nothing in it is as creepy as the basilisk scene in Harry Potter 2. The dementors are pretty frightening though, and who could not cheer when Hermione, wanting to give Malfoy what he so clearly deserved, punched him in the face. The hippogriff ride was certainly invigorating. Of course, there is even more character development. Hogwarts also has a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher again. If it sounds like I think this film is stupendous, I do! I recommend that you buy it at once. There is a great probability (99.9%) that you will be glad you did!!!!!!

While I liked the first two films, they didn't catch my attention. Then came the awesome Prisoner of Azkaban directed by the equally wonderful Alfonso Cuaron. I am a huge fan of this man's style, and he does not disappoint with this movie. Not only does the whole theme of the movie grow darker, but it's visually stunning to look at. Cuaron certainly knows how to bring out the best in young actors as well, giving more depth and emotion to the characters. And as a bonus, the growing on-screen chemistry between the actors really shines. Most especially the sparks between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. These two were made to star on-screen together. They light up their scenes.SIMPLY FANTASTIC!	5.0	Prisoner of Beauty	2005-12-28	2	1	1

I was really looking forward to this movie.  The acting was fine (the ""kids"" are getting better) and the animation and special effects were great.  However, if you hadn't read the book, you'd be totally lost.  The plot kept jumping around with no explanation of how they got from one place to another.  I got the impression that Cuar&oacute;n was trying to fit everything in but didn't have enough time so he just jumped from one scene to the next with no tie-in.  My husband has not read the books.  Although he watched both previous movies and was looking forward to this one, he walked out within the first half hour because he found it so confusing and, thus, unenjoyable.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A200QDK7RNEC13	Fran Jehann	"This movie isn't as well done as the first two. It starts with Harry practicing magic (lumos - wand for light under the covers) when the book depicts him using a flashlight, being careful not to practice magic at home as an ""underaged"" wizard.  The use of photo animation was too much in many places.  Sometimes it felt like a comic strip, other times it was too hazy, out of focus, and dark.  Realizing the book must be shortened for the screen, too many explanations were left out, and anyone going back to the book (as I did) wonders why some of the changes were put in at all.  Why the bridge?  Why does Hagrid live in a comic book house?  At first I didn't like Lupin's characterization, but then the reason for the scarring of his face was shown as he underwent the transformation into a werewolf.  Snape's tonic to keep Lupin safe to the students wasn't explained, and very little of the animagus angle was even mentioned.  The character playing Pettigrew was truly great, and Snape was, as usual, the star.  I like the series enough to give this a four rating but a three and one-half would be more like it.  I will purchase it, when available, for my collection, not because of its excellence, but because it is part of a set."	4.0	A Little Late and Far Too Short	2004-06-17	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2MRZPTMYFADUV	Frodo	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" succeeds on many notes but fails to execute the more important elements of the story. But first I'll note the positives, because although this movie is flawed, it still had some GREAT stuff.Briefly, the famous wizard Harry Potter is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School. But a fierce dark wizard Sirius Black has done the impossible - escaped from Azkaban Prison. Everybody's lives - especially Harry's are in danger. This film is the third chapter in a series of films based on the novels by J.K Rowling.Firstly the music, which is always a great listen has gotten even more magical. There's an original song called ""Double Trouble"" which is very clever and definately transports you into the world of wands.Secondly, the special effects are also great. Two particularly good installments are the Dementors (horrifying ghostly spirits) and Buckbeak the Hippogriff (a half eagle, half horse creature). The overall special effects were good. Although it doesn't come close to ""Lord of the Rings"" standard, they were certainly better than the last two films' visual effects.Thirdly, the young actors (including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) put in a much more passionate performance playing our heros Harry, Ron and Herminone. I also loved seeing some of the great actors back in the robes including Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and Dawn French (to name a few).But although the technical aspects of the film were above average, the actual film was a huge disappointment for me, and I'm sure for millions of other Harry Potter fans.You see, the attitude of the film was completly mis-initerpretted and was more of a comedy bash and less of a movie about good versus evil. Yes, Rowling's original stories are very humourous and ingeniously witty, but there is another serious and haunting side of the books that was too vague for my taste. The emotional side of the film was overpowered by unnessecary wise-cracking. Like I mentioned before, I am all for humour, but there was simply too much of it for the motive of the storyline. It's a story of horror, of evil, of heartbreak - all of which were very poorly conveyed and I was not impressed.Secondly, was the wussiness of the wizard jock Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Malfoy is not a clutz! He is a sinister, cunning and spiteful teenager. Again, this important element of Rowling's stories were overwhelmed by silly humour.And finally was the ending of the film. While the opening was brilliant, the ending is a repulsive close-up still of Harry's wind-pulled face as he flies his broomstick, and just ends the entire film on a pointless note. Another minor issue was Hogwarts' sudden change of location but I wasn't really fussed about that.Maybe I'm a little bit critical, but as a passionate Harry Potter reader, I was really unimpressed by how this film turned out. The books get substantially darker as you move through and that darkness simply wasn't outstanding.But as I stressed earlier, this IS a pretty good film. The acting, music and visual effects really were very well done. Although I didn't appreciate the  overhumour, I DID enjoy some of the fresh jokes and had particularly loved Ron's facial expressions (whoes character WAS fairly faithful to the novels).I really hope the fourth film is a bit more faithful to its novel, because it is a MUCH darker story. Nevertheless, I am lookng forward to its release! :)So in conclusion I enjoyed this film alot apart from those couple major flaws. I hope this review is helpful and shows you not only the good sides, but also the aspects that could have been improved. It was a good effort, alot of fun, but not quite in the right spirit of things."	4.0	Fun, but not in the right spirit of things	2004-08-14	7	3	4

Like the turning back in time scene, if he was going to have the characters go back in time and see themselves, their movements would have to be excat in what the doubles do and say and how they say it. Like this whopper of a mistake:In the scene where Harry and Hermione go back in time see themselves talking to malfoy and his crew, Hermione ( the one in front of Draco ) has her hand behind her head the first time. the second time she has her hand to her side. heh, heh, bet you didn't catch that ine and this one, too:In the same scene, when Hermione punches Draco, didn't she spin around this first time instead of already facing and hitting him the second time?I caught thses mistakes.

The darker theme does help this movie a lot. Most people said it didn't follow the book well.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AYFZRUH5K6G16	Gail M. Barnes	"Well, everyone keeps saying that the new Harry Potter film is the ""most adult"" HP yet... Big Problem.  Harry Potter is NOT AN ADULT.  He is 13 in the current film.  Gritty, dark, stiffling realism?  None of these things have a place in the magic world of a child wizard.Hagrid's charming little house, filled with strange giant sized things, is now a dark and dirty shack filled with unpleasant looking debris.Hogworts is a crumbling ruin, lacking charm, good lighting, or the lofty spaces in both the novel and the first and second film.  It's claustrophobic.  The grounds have gone from these wonderful sweeping expanses of green velvet, to rocky, muddy, steep hills that increase the closed-in feeling.  The lake which is to play such a major role in the Goblet of Fire is now a dirty little mud hole, and the loch which appears in several scenes is gratuitous.What is it with those blood thirsty, horseback riding ghosts?  Where is Nearly Headless Nick and the other charming, ghost, characters that would not frighten children?In order to move the complex plot line along, this director has chosen to emphasize a series of events which gloss over the main emotional threads in the novel.  It neither lays the groundwork for the 4th story, nor the 5th, in which Sirius plays a major role, and it fails completely to treat the Patronius Charm with the gravity it deserves.The elimination of the wizard's robes, and the adoption of jeans and cords for the characters, destroys much of the sense of otherworld which Chris Colombus and J.K. Rowling achieved with such skill in the first two films.The entire sequence involving the Shreaking Shack was much too truncated. This series of events laid the ground work for the Time Turner to be used, and for Dumbeldore to acknowledge that Sirus was not guilty, something he already knew, that was brushed aside in the film.  Snape had almost no role in the filmbut he was instrumental in creating havoc in the novel.Buckbeak is amazing, but once again, modern special effects have been moved center stage by a director, and the plot and story line pushed to the background.  The Knight Bus was amusing, but what is it with the talking, shrunken heads?  And in Hogsmead, too...That does not appear in any of the novels and using the heads kept the character of the conductor on the bus, and his discovery that his passenger was Harry Potter, from even being addressed.  This matters in Order of the Pheonix.Petunia is an obsesive compulsive house cleaner.  The new Dursley Manse is a dingy, mustard and brown, 1960's multi-stripes and flowers concoction that is over run with clutter.  This totally violates the character of the Dursley's which was so deliciously created in 1 and 2.What is that dead animal thing that Hagrid is wearing?  Since he has been wearing the same leather coat for the past 50 years, why did he change for that red, rat-pelt affair?This strikes me as an attempt by a new director to put a unique stamp on a project that is much beloved and familiar to millions, by changing every subtle and obvious thing on the screen to make all that went before obsolete.  It was stupid and unnecessary and left me very angry that someone would darew to destroy themagic and charm of Harry Potter in some vanity gig, and pretty well butcher the nuance of the story in the process."	2.0	Things I hate about The Prisoner of Azkaban.	2004-06-20	13	7	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AA50ZQDY2TPK5	game-dude	"I used to be the kind of person who thought Harry Potter was bad just because it had magic in it, but there were quite a few things that made me realize how dumb that was.When I first saw ""the Prisoner of Azkaban"" I thought it was good, but it was definately darkler and more mysterious, which is how a series should run.  This one, though, is also confusing around the last 45 minutes to the last hour or so.Harry runs away from the Dursleys early after Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge comes to visit and he loses his temper and blows her up into a balloon.  Then he runs off onto the Knight Bus where he hears of Sirius Black and later on learns that Black has escaped from Azkaban to come and kill him.  These things don't dwell on his mind a much after a dementor from Azkaban attacks him and allows him to hear his mother screaming on the night that Voldemort murdered his parents.  Then, after he is denied access to Hogsmeade (because Uncle Vernon didn't sign his permission form) and forced to sit through the first Divination lesson (Divination was a terrible addition to the series by the way as it was boring, though it serves for comic relief), he meets Buckbeak, Hagrid's hippogriff.  Later on, Malfoy is scratched by Buckbeak and Hagrid loses the defensitory case.  Buckneak is sentanced to death and Harry, Ron, and Hermione only think about this up until the time when Hermione puches Malfoy in the face.  After that, everything gets extremely confusing all through the time you meet Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew, down to the point when Sirius escapes, being an innocent man.  Then, the ending is basically Harry as he is leaving his third year when he recieves a Firebolt (the fastest racing broom to date) from Sirius (though only Harry, Ron, and Hermione know it) and dashes off into the sky.There weren't very many additions to the series.  I mean, besides meeting two new characters and learning about who betrayed Harry's parents, the series is basically the same edge-of-your-seat movie that I love to watch fifty times a day.  However, despite the fact that there isn't much new, ""the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a fabulous movie on the whole and definately one you want to buy.The worst thing is the loss of Richard Harris who plays Dumbledore in the first two films.  Poor Richard died in 2002 and so he coudl not play Dumbledore in this movie.  While Sir Michael Gambdon is still a great Dumbledore, Richard Harris potrayed the softness and humor that Dumbledore manifested as well as the seriousness of Dumbledore when he needed it.  So, yeah, we all agree in my household, Richard Harris was better at it.I definately think that if you buy any one Harry Potter movie, you need to buy all four of the Harry Potter movies.  We have them all, of course.  My mom even wants to collect all the music.  We're pathetci in our house when it comes to Harry Potter.  We have all six of the books and one of the video games.  Can you believe they're going to make us wait till 2007 for the next movie and the last book?

Though I know they cant put everything that the book had into the movie, I was slightly disappointed that they didn't. Still a great movie, but read the books, then see the movie. You'll see the difference. Loved the actors and how they portrayed the characters! To me that was excellent.	5.0	Great movie!	2013-03-05	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AG8K92N37MT27	Garnet	Having seen all of the Harry Potter movies, I'm not quite sure why this one tends to stick out in my mind and comes in second after the two part Deadly Hallows as my favorite of all of the movies.  I think one thing is that, when I first saw it in the theatre, it kind of stuck out for how different it was from the previous movies.  This one was far more gritty and dark in some ways, giving an impression of two things.  First, that Harry Potter was growing up and so the issues he was having to deal with were becoming more and more adult.  Second, that how the film was made had more of an edge to it...it made the world seem a bit less spangled and filled with child-like wonder, but far more REAL.There are overtones of time throughout the movie, from the focus on the giant clock in Hogwarts that we see Harry peering out of, to the seasons that pass via the Whomping Willow tree, to the giant pendulum swinging by the front door.  This emphasis seems to give the movie a sense that time is catching up and that he will soon be forced to deal with You Know Who.Spoilers:The movie starts with a bad day at the Dudley house, as if there are any others. I wasn't that thrilled with the extent of the Night Bus scenes, but once we got to the Leaky Cauldron its hard not to focus on all the stuff happening in the background, a colorful view of Harry's wizarding world.  The introduction of the dementors is horrific, as it is meant to be, and soon we end up meeting the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Prof Lupin, another favorite.  One of the best funniest pieces was the scene where they learn how to fight back against a being that takes on the shape of their worst nightmares.  One will never look at Prof Snape again the same!  Emma Thompson is dippy and wonderful as the Prof of Divination and I absolutely ended up adoring Sirius Black as played by one of my favorite actors.The story unfolds rather calmly and I suppose that some might think it a bit slow, but it is far more complex than the previous movies, and once we start on the time loop it is well worth watching a second time with all of that in mind.  I really enjoyed Hermoine in this movie as she took charge of events, and Harry coming into his own in order to save himself.This isn't so much a movie for the younger kids who might have enjoyed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, though they also both had their scary moments.  They only get darker from here...	5.0	First Step Into A Larger World	2013-12-13	0	0	0

I wanted to say that I have the first two Harry Potter Ultimate Editions on blu ray, and they are very high quality.  They have wizard cards, digital copies, and the makings of the films.  They also have these hardcover picture books with Harry Potter stuff in them.  The best part of them is the extended edition option, which includes more scenes that are in the book.  I was very impressed with the extra footage in the Chamber of Secrets additional scenes.  Anyway,one of my Harry Potter sources online has November 25th as the release date for #3 and #4, and I think it is accurate as the first part of #7 comes out a week earlier.  I knew it would come out around that time.  When it comes to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the movie was very well done.  Every one of the films is given first class treatment and they are all worth the purchase, including the 4th one which left a ton out of the book.  My dad never read Harry Potter, but he loved the time turner thing with Hermoine in this movie.  I love this movie.	5.0	A definite buy - November 25th!	2010-07-04	4	3	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AAEP8YFERQ8FC	General Breadbasket	"There's a new director, new places and older faces in ""Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban"", the third film adaption of J.K. Rowling's fantasy series. I didn't think it was good as the first two films in the series, even though the look of it all was pretty much as good.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is due for his third year at Hogwarts Wizarding School, and things bleak, and not just in the stormy skies above. The mass murdering wizard, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), is on the loose, and as a result the creepy black - robed dementors have been called in to guard the school. Still, there is fun to be had this year, Harry discovers. This year, they have a friendly new Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and third year students now have access to the wizarding village of Hogsmeade. But dangers and mysteries spoil most of their fun. Why is Sirius Black coming after Harry? Why is Professor Lupin often ill? And why does Harry keep seeing images of a spectral hound?Before I'd read the third book (or any of the others) I saw this on DVD and had no idea what was going on, and didn't like it terribly much. I've read the first three books now, and things are a little bit clearer now. I definitely think you have to be familiar with the books before you watch the films. Rather than an ordinary film, I like to think of these movies as a motion picture illustration of the novels, a picture that moves, rather like the potraits that move in the world of Hogwarts. Even then, bits that added to the intrigue and adventure, bits that I would have liked to have seen had been left out. Oliver Wood's feverish desire to win the cup was completely absent, for instance. Actually, did Oliver Wood even appear? I know Ginny Weasley appeared, but only for a fraction of a scene. Also, some things that are left in don't have the weight that they did in the book, like the mystery of Hermione's multiple classes, and her dislike of her silly divination lessons.Even with so many things left out, the film seems to drag on a bit, particularly towards the end. There's just something lacking in the mix that doesn't keep you as interested. I don't think this is the fault of the director, or the screenwriter, or of J.K Rowling. I think that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was just a really tricky book adapt into a movie. Actually, I'm starting to think that a lengthy TV serial would have been a better option for Harry Potter's adventures. That way, it could have been really thorough, and all the plots and subplots could have been explored. A cartoon series would have been a good option, even. Ah well.For what is there, for the most part, is done fairly well. Director Alfonso Cuaron lets the kids be a bit more relaxed on set, letting them wear casual clothes and encourages them to be themselves, which they can be as their acting keeps on improving. The effects are evocative, too. I didn't really like the faded, washed out colour scheme, but I suppose it does keep with the atmosphere of the book.It was interesting to see what an all star cast had gathered on this film, and many of them are people I admire. Dawn French plays the painting of the Fat Lady former Fast Show member Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, British comedian Lenny Henry plays the talking shrunken head. Apparently Warwick Davis (from Willow) is in the film too, but I didn't see him (is he the little man who is conducting the choir, perhaps?). Michael Gambon now plays Dumbledore, and he plays it differently to how I've grown used to. He seems a little more self absorbed, a little more stand offish, not the kind, grandfather figure that played him as. Perhaps there is a reason for this, perhaps not. I'll just have to keep reading the books and watching the films.The special features are once again very well done. The menu narrator's warm voice is like an old friend. I hope they keep him for the rest of the DVDs. The special feature menus this time around have a Marauders Map theme.Like always, there are many and varied special features. There's, of course, the five deleted and alternate scenes including the two with Sir Cadogan (played by Paul Whitehouse). Paul Whitehouse is one of my favorite comedians and character actors, and I really wish these scenes had been left in the film. The world needs more Paul Whitehouse. There's the ""Catch Scabbers"" game, where try to follow Scabbers across a table covered in junk using the remote keys (I found this game a bit frustrating). There's a triva game called ""Magic You May Have Missed"" which quizzes you on various minor details within the scenes of the films. There's tours to Lupin's classroom and Honeyduke's Sweet Shop. Lupin's tour is interesting, as it takes place within a scene, and it really makes me wonder how they shot it and put it together. There are candid interviews with all the cast and crew, hosted by an ordinary man and that extraordinary shrunken Jamaican head, who jollies up everyone. There's a montage played to the music of the Hogwarts choir (the ""Double, Double Toil and Trouble"" song), a featurette about all the stunt animals, a special effects/making of documentary, an featurette/interview with director Alfonso Cuaron & author J.K. Rowling, and a preview of the video game adaption.There's also a game called ""The Quest of Sir Cadogan"" where you get to be Sir Cadogan (voiced by Paul Whitehouse) and race through Hogwarts completing little mini games. Get to BE Paul Whitehouse? Brilliant! I was very excited about this game! If you win, you are given a tour of the wizard potrait gallery, which is a pretty pleasant reward.If you have a DVD ROM drive on your PC, there's a few extras to enjoy there too, including a Hogwarts timeline, wizard trading cards, and another preview of the video game adaption. You'll need a recent version of both Macromedia Shockwave and QuickTime to run it though.Not the best Harry Potter book to film adaption, but I think it was the best they could do, considering the tricky material they had to adapt. Still, it's worth a look for fans."	3.0	Mentors and Dementors on DVD	2006-07-16	1	0	1

King ""movie fan"""	"Ultimately,it is Kloves,the screenwriter, who has diluted the intensely moving and magical masterworks of J. K. Rowling.  ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" proves to be no exception.  There is not one producer or director, no matter how gifted, who can elevate these classic books to classic cinema, when dealing with the unimaginative voicings of Kloves. He resembles a dementor when tackling these books for the screen; draining them of the strong emotional undercurrents that are the most defining elements of these stories; leaving these movies sadly incomplete, at times lifeless and unforgiveably dull. His lack of creative vision prevents him from effectively transfering Rowling's magic to the screen, denying the moviegoer of an experience that could be transformative. Those who have not read the book are unmoved and lost at ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"".  The ""Potterheads"" fill in the blanks and ""recall"" the emotional impact they received when first reading the novel in order to satisfactorily complete the moviegoing experience.I am an eternal optimist and am hoping for better results in the future; results that will produce stronger and more powerful interpretations of Harry Potter's and J.

Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's interpretation on the book gave it the depth it deserved by showing us(the moviegoer) that the story need not be the same static state that the book is in.  The addittion of the pendulum clocktower was to give emphasis to the story's subplot of time but unfortunately many seemed to have missed that.  Also the scene with Harry and Buckbeak was to show Harry's continuing ""freedom"" from the bounds of childhood (and possible refference to book 5?).The only fault I found with this movie was the time.  I have heard that parents may be happy that they don't have to sit through an extra 30 minutes of movie but in my opinion this movie would not be suitable for those of the  younger crowd that would need parental supervision at the showing of a movie.  I hope the movie of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire takes this to heart and makes it a two-part movie."	5.0	Best one yet	2004-09-06	9	4	5

Let me start off by saying this is the best movie in the harry potter series. I know I was not in it, but it went above and beyond all fans' expectations. First, the kids' growing maturity is evident because, well, that part really isn't acting. It is these kids become more mature, better actors than they were before. Second, This book seemed to be the favorite of every hp fan, so there was no doubt that the movie would be the favorite. I shudder at this fact, wishing that I had been Lupin instead of Lockhart. However, I must say, Lockhart was an extremely enjoying role to play. Third, the first movie spent a lot of time unwinding the plot, the second movie had a little more unwinding, but this movie, was everything unwound, just more deep, dark secrets of harry's past. Last, the suspense in this movie is amazing, it is becoming more 'PG' with every movie, as it should.  The scary moments are scarier, the creatures are freakier, and everything is just better over all. I definetely give props to Alfonso Cuaron for creating such a well-crafted film.

In fact, I've spent the whole day since I saw the movie discussing it with fellow fans.  So I think I can speak for a large number of people when I say that there were several things about this movie that disappointed.  Okay, they had to jettison a few things for time, I get that.  I'm not going to obsess over the tiny details (like spiders that keep their legs and gain roller skates), only the important ones.  Like, Harry leaving obvious footprints in the snow that would have gotten him caught immediately.  The leaving out of what would have been a quick but very satisfying scene in which MWPP was explained.  And, especially, the mutilation of the Three Broomsticks scene in which Harry finds out about Sirius and his parents.  I have no problem with the dialogue, as much of it was direct quotes, but the set up made it look as though McGonagall and Fudge were dating or something - ewww!However, if you are not too terribly obsessive, you will quite enjoy this movie.  My seven-year-old did.  And so did I, most of the time.  There were scary parts that were VERY scary, funny parts, emotional parts.  The Monster Book of Monsters was done wonderfully.  The interplay between Ron and Hermione was sweet, especially the scene in which Ron does an unintentional Malfoy impression.  The whole time travel thing was very interestingly done, if predictable.  And the effects were so good, I never found myself trying to pick out what was real and what wasn't (a pasttime that can ruin a movie; see Matrix Revolutions, for example).I could have done with less ""bird/owl/leaf artfully floats through the air""; get rid of those, and they could have freed up several minutes for, say, Quidditch scenes.  And, though I can't complain about their acting ability, I was less-than-impressed by the casting of Sirius and Lupin.  To be quite honest, they weren't handsome enough for my fanfic-whetted appetite.But all in all, it was a very enjoyable film which will find its place beside the first two movies in my DVD collection as soon as possible.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A36U96CCCBOEXA	GixxxerKim	Sometimes it rushed through the plot.  Especially in the beginning and the somewhat confusing end.  Readers of the book will recognize that.  That is one of the reasons I gave it 4 instead of 5.Yeah, you'd think the new Dumbledore actor would have seen the other movies and tried to keep consistency.  He was way to energetic and talked too fast.  However the scenery in this movie is SO beautiful and showed a more expansive view of Hogwarts and the adjoining grounds.  The plot was QUITE interesting with twists and turns.  Daniel's acting stays the same.  Some of his scenes where he is supposed to be angry are kind of unconvincing as well.  His facial expressions and eyes don't show the emotions he is feeling at times.If you didn't read the book, you might be confused a bit toward the end.  As all of the movies, you can't put every part of the book into the flick, still the movie does well.  Special effects, and keeping the same actors (as well as they could) are a few of the great qualities that the series has.Otherwise it is a KILLER movie bound to be one of your favorites in your Harry Potter dvd library.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1FAKZ848PO3V8	GLENN WHELAN	The greatest magical feat by the Harry Potter world is that it has made readers out of millions of children of all ages. It doesn't take a wizard to know that means the stories would be interpreted for the big screen. The first two films in the series came across well, each a pretty but overly-plotty document of the book. The films tended to be slavish to their appropriate books which resulted in a two and a half hour running time. Of course, fanatics of the books would take the opposite view, that the films were lacking as elements of the books were abridged or eliminated. As the books double or triple in size, the filmmakers have to face facts. These movies are going to have to abridge the stories not only better, but more. And the more that is cut, the angrier fans will get.Hail to the third film, under the helm of director Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien). We are now flying the most streamlined broom yet. Little time spent on introduction; the story comes across more focused, less episodic, darker and scarier.Most importantly, this film best captures the fun of the books.The superb cast remains intact here with the exception of Michael Gambon filling in Dumbledore's shoes, vacated by the passing of Richard Harris. His Dumbledore is a different take on the role. He comes across a bit younger, not as wise, sort of a 120 year old flower child. Emma Thompson joins the cast as Professor Trelawney, her coke-bottle glasses worth many a laugh. David Trewlis takes on the duties of the abandoned Defense Against the Dark Arts professorship, a job that always comes under scrutiny within each Potter story. Finally, and most relevant to the entire series is the introduction of Sirius Black, portrayed by perennial lunatic Gary Oldman. He is a welcome addition to the legend.As expected, the special effects are better this time around, less rushed and already established. Beyond that the darker, grainier cinematography and creative camera work make the film less pristine, more real. After the third film, you have a much better idea the dangers of Quittich.The adaptation of J.K.Rowling's storyline by Steve Cloves is a marked improvement on the first two, successfully eliminating more details without hindering the story process in any way. (Calls for scenes to add depth are erroneous, that's what the book is for). The story hinges on time and time travel and is well executed on screen. The largest weakness here involves a large important battle between a dog and a werewolf, neither of which are fully introduced into the story until late in the film.One of the most amazing elements in the whole film series is watching the three young leads, Daniel Ratcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Gint, grow up... quicker than any potion or spell would allow.The bonus materials in this particualy disc are hit and miss. Most valuable are interviews with cast and crew but the world could do without the ridiculous shrunken head as a running theme.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is solid entertainment, hopefully opening into even more streamlined films in the franchise.	5.0	A Magical Film	2005-11-19	1	1	0

From the first gleeful scene of the awful Aunt being blown up, to Crookshanks the cast to the last flying scene, the film is a joy with very little to pick at.  In fact, I can't think of anything to find fault with at all.  And one thing I like about all the Potter films and especially this one is the importance of real versus public perception of people and truth.  The evil murdering criminal turns out to be a wrongly accused man and the best Defense Against Dark Arts teacher is discriminated against because he is of the Werewolf persuasion.  Harry and his friends coming to understand people and that just because something appears in the newspaper it is not necessarily true is one of the best things about the series.  The need to find out for ourselves is so necessary to growing up well and I think that is the reason for much of the appeal of Rowling's work.	5.0	My favorite Potter film	2010-06-19	2	2	0

Had it got no relation with the book, it would still remain a very beautiful film at least on visual level (and not only).The film might seem to many not strongly enough related to the book. For this I have found a very useful solution: I simply view the book and the film as two separate pieces of art. Because if you view(ed) the film as ""the definite realisation"" of the book this would mean that there's no more room for your imagination. That the book is actually that film and nothing more. So, read the book and imagine and don't expect to see the exact materialisation of what you imagined here.If you've read it, you might be disappointed.If you haven't read it, despite some unclear plot strands, you should be satisfied. ( May be they will clear the strands for you in the next movie, I don't know.)The film's principal merit is that it creates a wonderful atmosphere. Rainy, murky, mediaeval in modern time.Well, enough have I burdened you with theory. The only thing that slightly annoyed me was the dementors were too tattered. But I got used to it. They have tried to show us a new side of Daniel Radcliffe ( he took me the most time to get used to). They've made him sit on a rock in the snow and cry after he discovers Sirius is actually his Godfather. He really didn't handle the scene. But probably I should follow more strictly my own advice and not view him as ""what definitely is not the Harry Potter I imagine(d)"". But as I already said, I'm used to him by now. Hogwarts Castle has undergone some development, the Whomping Willow has been moved to a new place, as has Hagrid's Cabin. The Ron - Hermione attraction, of course not as subtly as in the book, is emphasized on. Buckbeak is magnificent.All in all, this is the best of the Harry Potter movies to date (although I wouldn't discard the other two), looks very believable, leaves you dreamy and in a good mood after watching it, and can be watched again and again and again.-Oh, and John Williams has composed an inseparable part of the film with some wonderful new themes."	5.0	Depends	2005-06-26	3	2	1

In my opinion the second movie is even better than second book. Actors like Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart) did excellent job!We all expected with eagerness to see the third movie, even more that the book ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is our favorite- great story with strong new characters (Sirius Black and Remus Lupin). What a disappointment! The new director paid attention mostly on the effects and I think the third book deserves more than effects.I don't think David Thewlis (Professor Lupin) and Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) are most appropriate actors for those roles. However there was a director's hit- Gary Oldman was perfect for his part (well almost- without tattoos J) I still wonder why the director made Tom the Innkeeper to looks like weak-minded and spared so much time for scene with wizards' bus, but leaved out why Hermione needs time turner and more, and more... no need to repeat Lin and other guys with close to mine opinions.I believe that people who read the book will understand what I mean. But maybe others, who haven't read it are more lucky- they have chance to like the third movie."	1.0	Disappointment	2004-12-18	9	5	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A28AHXQES8RKJD	"Gregory C. Bray ""greggbray"""	"In his attempt to bring Harry Potter to the screen with his first two installments, Columbus was so laborious in carbon-copying the book to screen, that he forgot the more essential elements of adaptation, and of screen time.While I'm sure soccer moms and younger kids will probably be more attached to the saccharine visions perpetuated by the first two films, it seemed that those films were just trying too hard.  All the kodak imagery, the lack of character depth, the awkward pacing---Columbus's hands were wet with effort, and it stained the films more or less.The 2nd film was a vast improvement, don't get me wrong.  But the films still lacked something more visceral.Harry Potter TPOA, is a film that finally brings Harry's world to the screen in a way that the previous attempts could not acheive.  I'm so over joyed at the direction that Cuaron has taken with this film.He frees himself of CGI locations (more or less), and shoots on locations.  Yes, Hogwarts looks different in this film, but when you have a different artist doing the tranlation, there are going to be some visual differences.  And this time, it FEELS REAL.Ask any comic book collector what the Bat-cave looks like, and he/she'll tell you that it depends what artist is drawing it.I actually found it to be an improvement.Cuaron really focuses on the young actors' growth as actors.  No longer do we see them in quick cut close ups, as to not notice their greeness in the acting world.  Now they are compelled to act in longer camera shots, with more complex character psychology, and just a more compelling script.But what's more important is that this film feels magical.  MAGIC FEELS REAL.  The scares are real, not those cinematic 'everybody's going to be okay, we can see the troll is really a poorly drawn cartoon and is acting all dumb and silly' scare--but a real, deep in our guts 'are these characters going to make it?' scare.  And it's this type of visceral experience that young kids really need.  If a kid, growing up, is going to learn how to face fears, he/she must be able to handle something like this film.  To laugh it off later as a film. If we shield the child from films such as this, they're going to face a losing battle when they enter the 'real world.'The performances from all the characters are dazzling, but one of note is Dumbledore.  Yes, it's a different actor, Michael Gambon (the original Singing Detective, and featured in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow), who dons the robe and hat vacated by the late and brilliant Richard Harris.Rather than trying to shun his acting responsibilities with a poor impersonation of Harris, he creates his own character--and one that seems far closer to the source material.  A strange hippie of sorts.  He seems a bit crazy from the outset, but then we see how he can spin his own magic, and by the end of the film, I was cheering for him.  ""Good night"" indeed.Finally a word on adaptation:  This was the longest of the 3 books adapted so far. Material is going to be cut out for narrative considerations.  It's translating one medium to another.  It can't be a literal translation, or you'll bore the audience with plot elements that, although interesting in the book, just wouldn't work in the film.  But that's the process of adaptation.  If you want the book, then read the book.  This is an entirely different medium with its own rules.  Cuaron understands that.  Columbus, for the most part, did not.I found the streamlined narrative to be exhilarating, liberating, and just a great time--the kids I was with all enjoyed the film immensly as well.  A real family film.  Perfect for the kid at just about any age."	5.0	Christopher Columbus is Thankfully Gone	2004-11-26	13	8	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOW""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first movie in the series to feature a directorial change.  Alfonso Cuaron(the 1998 edition of ""Great Expectations"") steps in for Chris Columbus.  Mr. Cuaron delivers a unique Potter experience, and his ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is arguably the most creatively nimble film in the franchise to date.This time, Harry(a very good Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts under the threat of an escaped murderer.  It is whispered that Sirius Black betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, and has now escaped from the wizard prison seeking Harry's death as well.  Harry must also contend with dementors, the dark guards of Azkaban who permanently extract true happiness from their victims.Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are again solid as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  Newcomer Michael Gambon plays a different variation of Albus Dumbledore, less distant than the deceased Richard Harris.  David Thewlis is particurlarly enjoyable as Remus Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who takes kindly to Harry. Gary Oldman is absolutely superb as Sirius Black.The single thing in this movie that I truly didn't care for was the handling of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, and it goes as far back as J.K. Rowling's novel.  In the novel, the creature comes off as a distraction and something the author should have edited or eliminated.  The character translates to the screen with as much pizzazz as modern visual effects can bring, but still falls flat for me.  It's a much worse version of Fawkes The Pheonix from the previous book and movie.With a darker soundtrack highlighted by a choral version of the Shakespearean verse ""Something Wicked This Way Comes,"" ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is mostly excellent."	4.0	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is exceptional"	2011-03-09	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2NAD5Y9A6O09O	Groundskeeper Willie	It's a good film. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is improving (thankfully), and I identified with him as Harry. I couldn't really accept David Thewlis as Lupin, but he did alright; that was because I had a picture of my own for Lupin and he was FAR from it. I did like Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, and I like the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)--I expect great things from him...The story suffers a little bit in the transfer from literature to film, leaving a lot of explanation and backstory for just the readers to know. I felt like it was almost incoherent at times, trying to throw the stuff in from the book but it really didn't fit together how the film was set chronologically. That definitely was a downfall; it got almost confusing because the screenwriter or director, or whomever is in charge of that, tried to cram so parts in but not in the right places so it didn't fit.Due to some odd cuts, there are GAPING holes in the plot that don't exist in the book. I won't tell you what they are, in case you haven't read the book or want to see it and analyze holes etc for yourself.My final gripe is the costuming. Rather than stick with the school robes like in the last two films (and the books), Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran around in normal 21st century clothing. It took me out of the fantasy of some of the story, but it is an interesting change I guess. I would've stuck with the robes, because it just fits better and honestly that's how it is in the books.But I'm saying all this criticism from the book's standpoint. It's a good film, lots of fun, and well made. I thought the direction was a little weak, with staging etc a trifle odd. But I got over all of that and enjoyed it.My final thought: I completely disagree with many critics who are saying this is the darkest of the movies. The second one surpasses this one in pure creepiness, and if I'm honest, I may have been disappointed in how not-dark this film was. The book is dark but stays a bit lighthearted...I couldn't take some of the film seriously due to the quasi-darkness that came through some goofy jokes.I wasn't disappointed, though of course much more and much better could have been done. If you haven't read the book, read it, and see the film. It's fun and I recommend it.	4.0	The New Potter Blockbuster	2004-06-04	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1MJS1YRKNMU04	Grrgoyl	"I've been putting off buying Year 3 for months due to the poor reviews about the lack of an extended edition.  I love bonus material more than anyone, but I couldn't put it off any longer in the hopes of a new ""ultimate and we really mean it this time"" edition (not that I'll be surprised if the studio tries to triple dip.  I've learned never to underestimate corporate greed).I've never seen the ABC Family extended version, but unless it includes more than the four deleted scenes on this disc, totalling all of 5 minutes (or less), I sort of understand the decision not to re-edit the entire movie just to incorporate this little bit.  The scenes are nice for die-hard fans, but not remotely essential and easy to see why they were cut.  Still, for the lack of an extended version I subtracted a star.What does irk me is disc 2, which so far seems to be only more tiresome games for the kiddies with no real bonus content.  Don't know for sure, I gave up after two games.  I don't know which would be more annoying, having to fight through the pointlessness to get to actual material or fighting through it with nothing to show for it at the end.  So I skipped to disc 3. (EDIT: Found them, in the ""Hogwarts Grounds"" and ""Divination Class"" sections.  Thankfully don't have to play games to get them (I still haven't forgiven WB for the hoops I had to jump through to get to one deleted Snape scene on the Sorcerer's Stone first release).  Here there's a tour of the creature shop and a very entertaining 45 minutes of cast and crew interviews.  Except no sign of Alan Rickman.  Am I the only one who remembers he's in the movie?)Disk 3 has some really in-depth material.  Halfway through the featurette on creatures I placed my order for Year 4, because it's been so long since I've seen any new HP material (well, since DH Pt 1 in November) and it really is (almost) worth the purchase price.  This disc also includes a ""trailer"" for the Film Wizardry book that I've had on my wish list since Christmas, that makes me give it more serious consideration.So far there's precious little Snape content (which is what I REALLY care about in the franchise), but my hopes are still high for the final movie to take care of that.My new concern is a website I came across speculating that WB will abandon the ultimate editions for the second half of the series and go back to a more ""conventional"" special edition.  I really hope this isn't true, having now invested myself into four oversized volumes on my shelf that will look damn silly next to four more regular cases.

I won't even go into all of the things that were left out and distorted by tis movie because it would take too long to write.

The Whompimg Willow wasn't even on school grounds in the movie and since when is Hogwarts the site of Stonehinge?When I saw this movie I felt betrayed and saddened and I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone who is a Potter-Head because you WILL be disapointed, very disapointed.I gave it 2 stars because it is a Harry Potter product.	2.0	WTF Alfonso?	2006-01-25	2	1	1

They changed things around to make more suspense, and it works, the dimentors will scare the crap out of young children, hell that hand of the dementor in the beginning still gives me the chills. The dialouge was change, and again i like that, i can't speak for anyone else who has watched it, but i like and that's just how i feel.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ZP8PIYL4EHTP	"G. Vernon ""gv"""	"After two cloying, cutesy Chris Columbus sweets, the Harry Potter series has at last delivered for its fans on the promise of the books.I guess it takes three tries to get it right. Finally a movie about a boy wizard that actually feels like it could be be happening in the real world, right under the noses of Muggle England. Finally a Potter movie that contains large doses of menace, mixed with teen angst and clever plotting that pays off in all ways.While I enjoyed Potters 1 & 2, they felt so forced and so self-conscious under the weight of efforts to ""get it right."" For examples of what I'm talking about, witness any scene with the Malfoy character. He's meant to be a foil to Potter and his friends, but he's little more than a cartoon character with expressions done about 5 levels beyond what's necessary. It's not that the actor is a poor actor so much as it's a director who doesn't trust his audience to follow the bread crumbs without telegraphing the message with enourmous cue cards. Columbus practically screams at the camera, ""Malfoy is the bad kid!"" with every preformance he forces out of the actor.All it takes is seeing the same actor in ""Azkaban"" to see the difference. Given proper leadership, Malfoy has graduated from monotonous caricature to actual character.Gone is Dobby, the Jar-Jar Binks of the second film. Gone are the over-the-top line readings doubled up with cutesy music cues from John Williams. In their place is a well-paced, clever film that captures the best the series has to offer without pandering to the slower members of the audience.What's remarkable is how immediately the new direction of the series reveals itself. As with the first two movies, ""Azkaban"" begins with yet another unfortunate interaction between Harry and his obnoxious relatives. This time, the scenario plays out in a way that feels well-grounded, carrying gravity and yet with humor that is inherent in the scenario without being slapstick or shouted with a bullhorn. Same actors as the first two movies, but the volume on their performances has been turned down to excellent effect.And so it goes, through a film that features the finest resolution of the three. It's almost impossible to say what's so great about the finale without giving away what makes it so fine. I'll just say that for me, I didn't have it figured out at all. Just when I thought we were back in the land of frustating dead ends or loose ends, we were actually in the hands of a clever director who didn't once tip his hand. Bucking the trend of almost every film series, this one is at its third installment and just keeps getting better. I can't wait for the fourth!"	4.0	The best of the series	2004-11-27	4	1	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AU0H3OAITW79Y	"Harry Fan ""CEG"""	I agree in someways that this is a very good film.  The scene of Harry riding Buckbeak over the loch is beautiful.  However, that scene and a few others, I feel, could have been either shorter or removed all together.  The choir at the beginning was really unnecessary, but letting the audience (all of whom have not read the books) know why Professor Lupin knew how to work the Marauders Map is.  I believe everyone should read the books, but the reality is, for many children they are just too far above their reading level.Questions unanswered include:Who are Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs?Answer: Lupin, Pettigrew, Black, and James Potter.What is the signifigance of Harry's Patronus being a stag? Answer: James Potter turned into a stag to keep Moony (Lupin) company.How did Lupin know about the map?Answer: He's Moony.Why did Snape follow Lupin?Answer: Because he forgot to take his potion and Snape was taking it to him.Why did Lupin take a potion?Answer: To help keep him from turning into a werewolf each month.  He did however become quite ill.Then there were other changes from the book and from the previous movies.  Hermione was never seen struggling to study all of her subjects.  Further, what could have been a really awesome scene of Hermione telling off Professor Trelawny was shortned and made quite uneventful.  Hagrid's cabin was obviously moved from its previous location and Dumbledore no longer manicures his nails.  His fingernails were disgusting in this film and what was with the pony tail beard?I hope that Mike Newell or Warner Bros. does not sacrifice important details for the sake of keeping the movie within a certain time frame.  Harry 4 & 5 will need to be longer than the previous movies or far too much will be left out.  Let's not forget that Gone with the Wind is nearly four hours long, an Academy Award winner, and a classic.

Put it next to the book and you will be greatly disappointed. Book 3 is my favorite of the series but my least favorite movie.The book misses major series mythology points. The most gaping hole is the Marauder's Map. For me leaving this out destroyed the movie for me. Although this being said the greatest disappointment for me was the lack of the Dumbledore/Harry moment at the end. All of the books have them and I was extremely saddened and disappointed that this was left out. They did incorporate elements of the Dumbledore/Harry scene from the book into the Lupin/Harry scene in the movie but there is an element between Harry and Dumbledore that was lost. I think this will effect how non-book audiences view the Dumbledore/Harry relationship in the next two movies. Especially the fifth one.Another part about the movie I hated was the womping willow interludes. Total waste of time.As far a the DVD goes the case is completely different from the first two. It is in a hard case which is great! The extras on the DVD leave a lot to be desired. I expected more from the deleted scenes. Interviews with the cast are fun but the Shrunken Head bit is annoying.The shining gem of this DVD is the interview with JK Rowling in which she states that the movie contains a couple of clues as to what happens in upcoming books. This will sure get us watching the movie over and over guessing at what clues have been left for us.In the end Harry has survived Voldemort and we shall survive Alfonso Cuaron.	3.0	Stand Alone	2004-11-30	6	5	1

This movie truly reflects the major events in the book (even though I wished that the movie could be a little bit longer).  This 3rd HP movie finally shows a realistic Hogwarts - the aging but still majestic castle, the creepy and dreadful Dementors (sooo scary!!), Hagrid's big hut, the Dark Forest, the Quittich games, etc.  I loved everything about this movie because - to me - it best reflects the growing dark mood written in the book.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZNUWINTZYFRS	.	I saw this movie in theaters after only having read the first Harry Potter book, years before. I liked it so much that it got me interested in reading the other books as well.The Prisoner Azkaban movie was a wonderful companion to the book. The first two movies were not nearly as good as the books. They missed the mark of fantastical wonder, opting instead for childlike wonder akin to Kevin McCallister walking into Duncan's Toy Chest in Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, which was also directed by Chris Columbus. In terms of sticking to the book there were some missing elements, as always happens with adaptations. But the main elements were there and they worked very well.What Cuaron brought to the movie was a darkness and seriousness that really matured the movie series to a proper level. He handles the terror of Azkaban and the Dementors very nicely, not skirting around their inherently horrifying qualities.The cinematography was excellent, and the set design appropriately accentuated the emotional weight of the story, such as in the scene when the Hogwarts Main Gate is dramatically locking up or when Harry is standing in front of a giant clock pendulum.In short, the story introduces a lot of gravity and emotion to the characters and the story of Harry Potter, and it was extremely important that the movie portray this. The fact is Harry is growing up and the responsibilities that come with that are difficult and painful.

Apparently it boasts some kind of arthouse direction by noted Mexican filmaker Cuaron, but basically it's more of the same, which is nothing bad.All of the Harry Potter films have been extremely orthodox, which is their greatest strength. They're literal (and very skilled) adaptions of the books, with no real surprises in terms of acting, special effects and naturally the plot; it's very much like what you imagine when you read the books. Prisoner is as good as the book was good - a slightly subtler, more involved plot, a less dramatic finale, a darker mood - but in the end exactly what you go to the theater to see. I guess Cuaron must have done a good job, because the film is so seamless, but I have to say I don't really see his touch.	5.0	It's another Harry Potter film...	2004-06-05	0	0	0

As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films.	1.0	No Extended version - NO SALE	2010-09-18	16	12	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A457S8SW690NM	hi	First off, I was intending a creepy version of the Harry Potter movies. That's not what I got. It was supposed to be scary and very creepy. Well, it wasn't. This movie would have been a lot better if it would have been rated PG-13. That would have made a good interpretation of the book. First off, the 3rd book was the best one. It was excellent. But, this movie somehow managed to ruin the whole book and everything for me. This movie is very weird and really dark. I didn't like this peculiar interpretation of the book with lots of strange moments where I was scratching my head, thinking, what the heck?????This movie is weird especially thanks to the wierd bus driver. The movie was also boring to me and after a while, it lost my interest. Sure the visuals were great, but I can't say the same for the strange, boring movie.	2.0	2 and 1/2 stars	2005-09-07	4	1	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1H72DULSEGDX7	hiphopgirl_1000	From the first scene where you see Harry trying to read in secret, you could tell that this movie was going to be way more mischievous than the previous two. Truly hats off to Alfonso Cuaron(Y Tu Mama Tambien) for bringing us into a more menacing world for Harry and showing us the depth of character that had been missing in the first two installments of the series that left them stale. Believe me, Christopher Columbus did a great job imagining Hogwarts and everything, but Cuaron finally brings Harry out of the innocent phase.The plot centers around Sirius Black(Gary Oldman), the first person ever to have escaped from the famous Azkaban prison; he had been convicted of helping Voldemort murder Harry's parents and it is believed that he is now after Harry. Things don't get better when ghoul-like, soul sucking Dementors, who are searching for Black, strike fear in Harry like no other. But Harry himself is no longer the innocent stepped over child. Cuaron shows for the first time the darker side of Harry, a boy struggling to deal with the raging hormones of adolescence in what is to be a very interesting 3rd year at HogwartsDaniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, have finally come into their own with their respective characters, especially Watson, whose charm and wit usually makes her the center of the scene instead of Radcliffe. Radcliffe himself has become more assertive in his role and shows that he is much more than eye-candy.Fresh faces like Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Lupin(David Thewlis), who always helps Harry out of hot spots, and Divination Professor Trelawny(Emma Thompson, sporting some pretty exaggerated glasses) adds to the already great cast of characters. Thewlis, the lanky professor Lupin, was one of my favorite performances in the movie. His scene with Harry on the bridge was one of the best moments in the film. Michael Gambon, who replaced the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, gave a respectable performance, though I felt he lacked the overall assertiveness of Harris.New to the series cinematographer Michael Seresin left the colorful scenes of the previous two movies and shot this one in much darker, muted tones, which fit perfectly with the darker sense of the movie itself. The visuals and special effects fit quite well with the overall foreboding mood of the movie.Unfortunately, with all the good points in the movie, it came short on only one point, plot. Azkaban was definitely the best book that Rowling wrote in the series, and the longest of the first 3. Cuaron didn't want the movie to be too long so he cut out most of the side storylines and made the shortest film out of the last 3. Sadly, the ending really felt a bit rushed and choppy. I only wished he focused a little bit more time on it. I was enjoying the movie so much that I felt it needed to be longer, where as the last two, I was ready to leave by the end. All and all this movie is deserving of 4.5 stars, but I'll give it 5 because of those harrowing looking Dementors that looked just like I thought they would. Overall a much darker film that is aimed at an older audience. Parents will have to make the decision as to whether their child can take the film, as there are quite a few scary scenes, and the time travel part of the plot could be very confusing to young ones.Number 4 in the series with director Michael Newell(Four Wedding and a Funeral) coming in November 2005 is one that I will definitely not miss. The bar has been set higher. Lets see if Newell can beat the magic of this film.	5.0	Darker, but with much more depth	2004-06-07	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2MYJ8LCPSRZHK	Hwee Zern, Lye	Absolutely the best Potter movie yet. Cheers to Alfonso Cuaron for turning the increasingly bland Potter franchise to scale new heights in technical achievement and cinematography. This feature film differs from its predecessors by being less slavish to Rowling's sprawling universe. Klose have done a great job this time around by just concentrating on the essentials: Harry's journey through puberty and of course the truth behind the fate of his parents. Not forgetting the young stars of the film. Radcliffe, Rupert and Emma have truly shown great acting prowess. They seem to be growing more comfortable with their respective roles. Though with Cuaron's guidance, they had in fact sparkled their performances to breath new life in the characters. Yes, excellent marks to the supporting cast. As always Rickman as the wonderful Snape. Good work to Gary and David for the new roles. Gambon does a splendid portrayal of Dumbledore. Superb CGI-effects with the Dementors, Knight Bus and advanced magic 'expecto patronum' as stand-outs. I love Cuaron's camera-takes in this film: close-up shots of objects and a much darker cinematography. He and Serensin should be commended for their excellent work. All in all a great movie to watch and likely one of the best films of the summer!	5.0	Prisoner of Azkaban rocks! It's supreme!	2004-06-18	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2O9QQP0HGUWKO	iluvkanyewest	this is a perfect film (although not as perfect as the book), with deeply scary moments, funny moments, and romantic moments. You can clearly see in this film the spark between Ron and Hermione, as they hold hands. My favourite characters are Hermione Granger - for being the best actress in it and the funniest (and the prettiest), and Ron - who makes the scariest moments feel funny. My least favourite character would be Harry Potter, for his self-obsessiveness. Always needing to be the center of attention, you could even feel jealous for him fainting infront of the dementors as he got so much attention, and then falling off his beloved broom and taking private lessons. I think that, since the screenplay writers and Daniel Radcliffe, have read The Order Of The Phoenix, they have taken new emotions from that book and put them into book three, which is wrong. Such as, he is getting very agressive which is only shown end of bk 4/bk 5. The film is excellent, but nothing compared to the book. The downfall in my opinion was Dumbledore, who now seems to have a low and hollow voice compared to Richard Griffith who put on a very believable wise and old voice, which he could no longer bring out - although the new dumbledore looks almost exactly like Mr. Griffiths. They also missed out a lot of the book - such as Harry and Ron being mad at Hermione for telling McGonnagal about her feelings that the Firebolt was jynxed, and a very interesting point is that on the marauders map in the film, they spelt Moony with an 'E' inbetween the 'N' and the 'Y', whilst in the book its spelt M-O-O-N-Y! Overall, the film is extremely good and improved acting-wise than the first two films.	5.0	i solemnly swear this is the best film of 2004	2004-06-19	2	0	2

I did expect it to be a little more faithful to the books. But some parts just threw me off. Like at the END of the movie is when Harry receives his Firebolt. That really threw me off. If they didn't mention it at the correct time, why throw it in at the end of the movie when it makes no sense? The acting was outstanding. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do it again to captivate the viewers and make them believe that they are Harry, Ron and Hermione. Also, in this movie, Harry has that unstructured, rebel-without-a-cause kind of attitude in this movie, which Daniel has portrayed quite well (also, for all you girls in charge of the Daniel fan club, he's looks really hot in this movie!) One thing in this movie that I really didn't understand was was Alfonso Cuaron wanted to show a ""romance"" between Ron and Hermione so early in the movies? That has not showed up in the books at all and I thought that was a bit tacky, and gave away the result of their relationship. Another thing that I noticed is that in almost all of the movie, they are wearing normal clothes, which really takes away the magic of the book in my opinion. Once in a while, sure, but about 95 percent of the time they were wearing normal clothes. That caught my attention. Other than these mistakes and annoyances, I thought this movie was awesome. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson is great, and I believe they did a fantastic job, and I hope they act in the rest of the movies, given that they are somewhat loyal the the books. More than this movie anyway. But if you are looking to see an exciting adventure and a taste of romance at its roots, this is the movie to see. But if you are a very loyal and faithful Harry Potter addict, I'd just say, be prepared to be a bit angry."	4.0	HP 3: dissappointment or not?	2004-10-16	9	7	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HPIGG3YN8FSN	"Informed person ""Uncle Sam"""	Finally, a Harry Potter film which transports that special spark one feels from reading the books, to the silver screen.  By far and away, one of the most moving, powerful chidren's films ever made.The qualities that make the books unique and amazing are fully present in this adaptation.  The mature reworking of the themes of loss, memory, time, and the depth of emotion underscoring the thrilling storytelling, are all here.  The cinematography and editing are spectacular: they capture on film what I envisioned in my mind as I read the book, which rarely happens with film adaptations of great literature.  The visually ravishing imagery, with it's muted yet sparkling tones of silver, green and deep blues, the lush outdoor settings coupled with the mundane, the existence of magic as an organic element of the action rather than a self-conscious attempt to wow us, (as in the Columbus-directed installments), should be used as a blueprint for the rest of the series, as it springs directly from the emotional tone of the book.  The use of widescreen framing to capture the epic scope of the story, and the excellent moving camerawork, placing the characters within a realistic yet otherworldly context, shows just how much Cuaron connected with this material and took it to heart.  Even the way closeups are worked into subtly, and earned dramatically, rather than liberally sprinkled throughout the action to underscore what the imagery should have told us already, was perfectly done.Cuaron clearly understands kids, and he vividly remembers that terrifying, and as Mavis Jukes, a well-respected children's author in her own right, commented, magical moment when we learn that we CAN face all those frightening things that await us in our future, that we can face ANYTHING that comes our way, and that we must find that the power, the power to overcome, lives inside us, and not inside another.  There are few moments in film as deeply moving, heartbreaking yet uplifting, as the moment when Harry realizes that his dead father will not come to save him, and he conjures the Patronus to save his own life and that of his godfather, discovering that he's much more powerful a wizard, and human being, than he ever thought possible.  Whatever else was missing from the book in the film, Cuaron couldn't have realized the intentions of the source material any better than he did, and Rowling acknowledged that when she said that this film was her favorite of the three.Radcliffe, and his costars, have improved dramatically as actors as well, which helps tremendously, and I think having a truly competent, innovative director, (one who elicited amazing performances out of the children in his captivating adaptation of A LITTLE PRINCESS), was just what was needed to bring all these kids forward artistically.  Had Columbus directed this film, we could have expected only perfunctory performances.  Cuaron knows how to get his actors to connect emotionally with the material, and Columbus has never had that talent.  Witness Radcliffe's particularly impressive improvements in the scene in Lupin's office where he attempts to conjure a happy memory powerful enough to repel the Boggart-Dementor.  It's an astonishing accomplishment for such a young actor, and helps us to believe that he will further amaze us in the incredibly difficult and intense emotional scenes to come in the film versions of both GOBLET OF FIRE and THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.All in all, this film was a great experience; deeply felt, emotionally satisfying, and still a thrilling adventure of a story.  Let's hope Cuaron comes back to make another Harry Potter film before the series is through!	5.0	Masterpiece of Fantasy Filmmaking	2004-08-08	5	3	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AEV06TB13GK13	"Injection ""Antibiotics"""	"The following views are told by the views of a dissapointed child who had their hopes and imaginations crushed by the terrible ideas in the recent movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; but the DVD features had also contributed to the strenuous amounts of dissapointment to the true, literal fans of Harry Potter and this movie had caused confusion to the non-fans as well, I hope that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will not sink as low as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, These are a few things that caused PoA to be terrible.1. Harry used a lumos spell in his bedroom at the Dursleys house in Privet Drive, you are not supposed to use magic unless it was an emergency in front of muggles (it was not even in the book).2. Aunt Marge floated out the door, when in the books, Aunt Marge was supposed to float towards the ceiling (talk about over acting).3. The Knight Bus contained a shrunken head which was quite annoying, even in the DVD. Dobby was annoying too, but it was needed for the story to continue. Ernie Prang looks like someone's blind grandfatther and Stan Shunpike looked like a hobo or a bum living on the streets, the new hunchback Tom, the innkeeper looks like someone from the Addams' family.4. Harry was supposed to receive The Monsters Book of Monsters from Hagrid at the Dursleys, but instead he got it in The Leaky Cauldron.5. Lupin looks like an old man from the 1940's with a very aggrivating mustache.6. The Sneakeoscope was not even shown in the movie, not even Pigwidgeon, or the owls that came to the Dursleys.7. Dementors are not supposed to fly, they are suppossed to glide and water is not supposed to freeze when they come near. They are not supposed to chase Harry in the air during the Quidditch game.8. The new Dumbledore and Trelawney looks like drugged-up hippies from the 1960's and Flitwick looks like a monk from the Dark Ages, what happened to our dear old Flitwick. Cornelius Fudge's new look reminds me of a character from the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.9. New characters that do not even appear in the book suddenly appear in the movie with a much bigger role.10. Buckbeak looks like a fake chicken and too much time was spent on Buckbeak's Flight, when Harry screamed out with his hands out, it reminded me of Titanic, ""I'm King of the World."".11. Things are pronounced incorrectly, like Expecto Patronum! and Boggart and Sir Cadogan.12. The new Fat Lady was more obnoxious and so out of character, she was not supposed to sing. I miss the old Fat Lady from the 1st film, Sir Cadogan barely even had a role in this movie.13. Students barely wore their robes, the robes made it feel more magical. Instead they wear crappy clothes, this is not a Gap commercial.14. Draco was not supposed to give Harry an origami bird and neither should there be anyone struck by lightning. Students do not paint there face for a Quidditch game.15. In the Marauder's showed rooms that did not even exist in the books and it was not supposed to show footsteps, it was only supposed to reveal a dot, and Peter Pettigrew was not supposed to show up on the map when Harry saw it.16. The Firebolt scene was jumbled-up, looked even more beaten-up than the Nimbus 2000, and did not even show up until the final scene which made me want to vomit.17. Trelawney's prediction was all wrong and looked fake as if she were going through a seizure.18. Many parts of the story did not show up in the movie at all, like the argument about Crookshanks and Scabbers, Scabber's true identity, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Hermione purchasing Crookshanks and the books for the courses she was taking through her birthday money that her parents gave her, Sirius Black giving up his position as secret-keeper to Peter Pettigrew, Hermione leaving Muggle Studies class, Lavender Brown losing her baby bunny, Binky to a fox, Hermione's turn with a boggart, Lupin drinking the wolfsbane potion, Sirius Black breaking into the dormitory, Snape's version of Sirius, Lupin, James, and Peter and how he was almost killed by the whomping willow when it was set by sirius during the transformation, but James saved him, the marauders were unregistered animagus, and othere parts of the book that did not make it into the movie.19. Honeydukes looks like a place where people smoke, sell, and buy drugs. Harry was not supposed to take the blood-flavored lollipop from Neville. The Shrieking Shack and other scenes were too rushed in this film. Harry's crying made me want to throw up. Harry was supposed to throw mud at Draco and his gang, but instead he threw snowballs at them.20. Lupin looked like a hairless mexican dog when he transformed into a werewolf.21. The sets (the whomping willow, too much time was spent when the birds kept hitting into the tree), scenery (Hagrid's hut was moved into a steep hill instead of the by the castle like it was supposed to.), locations, actors, and camera techniques changed.22. The acting went from bad to worse, The dialogue went from terrible to horrible. There were too many instances with shrunken heads, mirror (reflections), time (growing up), giant pumpkins (Pumpkins cannot grow in Hagrid's Hut in June, it would have rotted there), and hideous dark crows. This movie tried to be funny, dark, creative, and different from the other Harry Potter films which ended up to be the worst Harry Potter film so far. This movie was too short, not literal, not accurate, and the director did not even read the Harry Potter books.23. Hermione was not supposed to grab Ron's wrists, it is so wrong. There was not supposed to be anything between the 2. I felt as the director had decided to add fanfiction ideas and string up rumors that are not true. There are only 5 deleted scenes. Everything in the 1st 2 films were much longer.24. Alfonso Cuaron should not be able to the direct any more Harry Potter films, Mike Newell is already wrecking Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from what I have seen and heard of so far. I am hoping the director for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will do much better because so far, Harry Potter has been inking lower with each movie, I am afraid that the next Harry Potter film might bomb. My hope is quickly fading as I hear more about the next Harry Potter movie.I heard that this Harry Potter movie foreshadows events in the last 2 Harry Potter books, if that is true, then the 6th and 7th Harry Potter books will be ruined, Only time can only tell when I know what happens."	1.0	A dissapointment	2004-11-27	32	17	15

Whoever made this film obviously did not respect JK Rowlings inspiration, writings, or anything for that matter. To start with the writer or director or whoever added things to this film which werent in the book. Theres an annoying black in and black out between sceens sort of like in old films, that got real old. The packaging is different and does not match the other two much better films in the set. The new Dumbledor is seriously lacking, it's a shame the first actor passed away. Where were the robes???? In The books, wizards and witches didnt wear muggle clothes, especially in their world, but in this film they all have on every day normal muggle clothing even when runningaround school, I hardly saw robs at all except in a few scenes. The few good things about this film include an excelent Dementor design, good charecter casting for Professor Lupin, Professor Trelawnny was wonderfull, and Hermoine's time turner was beautifully designed.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A319SKSB556033	"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews"""	There are some sensationalist reviews here that believe the hype that everything Harry Potter is great and give the movie five stars regardless (the book was definitely a 5 starrer) but this movie ain't so great I'm afraid.Prisoner of Azkaban is my fave Harry Potter book so far (and was more than welcome after the weak Chamber of Secrets) but the translation from book to film loses 90% of JK Rowling's story.Every single second, every frame of this film is utterly devoted to being nothing but pure exposition for a plot that has no mystery intrigue. If you have read the book then there isn't much point in seeing this as you'll already know the twist. But I didn't want this to bias my opinion so I gave it a go anyway.As I have said, there are no subplots. Everything focuses on the Sirius Black story. Character development and mystery are non-existent. It almost feels as if Harry, Ron and Hermione are the only students at Hogwarts because no one else gets a mention and Draco Malfoy is reduced to wimpy, comic-relief. The strangest change of all is the presence of Dudley (a funny character) with NO dialogue at all.I liked Professor Lupin in the book, he was a rebel, renegade teacher who broke the rules and was one of the best mentors Harry has ever had. In the movie he doesn't do much and the character never really comes through. Same goes for Snape (a character I am liking more and more), he barely has two lines to say. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore is cool and naturally authoritive but he's got nowt to do either. Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny has five minutes of screen time and Hagrid has two scenes.The relationship between every character and situation is very much defined in the book. In the film all of that is stripped away in order to tell the Sirius Black story as quickly as possible. Which would be fine if the Sirius Black story could make the film stand on its own. It doesn't.Alfonso Cuaron may bring a new look to the film and a more modern edge but I blame him and Steven Kloves for the hasty rearranging and muddling of JK Rowling's story. Sure, some sacrifices had to be made in adaptation. But Prisoner of Azkaban dilutes the story to the point of obscurity.The rumors of Goblet of Fire being released as two separate parts (ala Kill Bill) bodes well as it will offer the chance to tell a more complete story. But so far the Dursleys have been cut out and it will start with Harry already at Hogwarts.For a much more atmospheric and exciting mystery try Young Sherlock Holmes. A film with many alarming similarities to the Harry Potter world. This movie may look good with a new director doing a fresh take on the Harry Potter universe but there are so many restrictions weighing this franchise down and it's REALLY beginning to show.	2.0	Anorexic	2004-06-05	18	12	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1P2WKXH6I7W0G	"Inuyasha lover ""frodisgirl18"""	This movie is wonderful.  This is also my favorite thus far of the books.  This chapter is much darker than the previous two, simply because the book gets darker, and continues to darken as the tales go on.  The first two films were more geared toward children while still keeping the novel's plot.  This movie is more real,...that is to say, it is so close to capturing the feelings and events in the book that it almost IS the book.  Instead of cutting out and lightening scary or sad moments that are in the book, the director keeps it real.  Harry Potter isn't just for kids anymore. :)	5.0	More Real	2004-11-18	8	6	2

Alvi	"I haven't read any of the books, and I saw this movie years ago when it came out, but recently watched it again with the family.  It was better than I remembered.  The story, acting, scenery, special effects, etc. are all quite good, so we all enjoyed the movie.  I just don't care for the darker mood of the movie as compared to the brighter original, and there's nothing particularly ""deep"" here.  There's also a time travel aspect of the story which generates the usual logical contradictions, but it's handled smoothly enough that the contradictions can be ignored.  So I'll go with 4 stars rather 5, though I can still recommend it to people interested in a fantasy action movie which has some scary elements."	5.0	Better than I remembered	2011-12-10	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BFIYZYNK54QX	"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale"""	"First, I have to say that I have never read a Harry Potter book. Although I know several people, including my wife, who LOVE the books, and they have had very positive responses to this series of films. For a non-reader of the books, I have come to love Harry Potter through the films. Many believe that since the films are not strict enough to their adherence of the source material, they shouldn't even bother. I can't argue with that since I have never read any of the books, since the films are so good, I don't really intend to anytime soon. I actually dreaded the first of the Harry Potter films (""...and the Sorcerer's Stone"") but after its release on DVD, I really enjoyed it. I found the cast to be incredible, particularly its three young stars whose talent belies their age. The second film ""...and the Chamber of Secrets"" was even more enjoyable since the film got to play with the characters more without the pains of exposition. I found that Chris Columbus, who I thought was a relatively talented screenwriter but not a very good director, finally started taking some cues from his mentor, Steven Spielberg, for his work on the first two Potter films. Now we have a new director in Alfonso Cuaron and a very different tone to the series. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is much darker in tone, in story, and in pallette than either of the previous films. The performances are stronger and more mature and the subject matter is decidedly less child-friendly. This film is literally and figuratively Harry Potter's puberty; a time of great change and fear and development. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are all pitch-perfect in this film, as are the newest members of the story, Professor Lupin (Another brilliant performance by the great David Thewlis) and Sirius Black (the always fascinating Gary Oldman). This film should almost have been called ""Chamber of More Secrets"" since the film has so many vast and important revelations that the world of Harry Potter will change forever. I almost forgot to mention the wonderful Alan Rickman, who once again reprising his role as the serpentine Professor Severus Snape, has a much larger part to play in this film and in Harry's future. This film also is forced to deal with the very unfortunate loss of Sir Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but bounces back because of the great Michael Gambon taking the character in not a different direction, but certainly a change from the sage-like saintly portrayal of Harris's into more of a spry and jocular Dumbledore, one who can command respect but still has a great twinkle in his eye. All in all, this is a great film, not just as a piece of summer escapism, but as a real film that could hold its own against almost any of the recent award-winning films."	5.0	The Best of the Series, and the Best Summer Release thus far	2004-06-17	7	5	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3F3B6HY9RJI04	James Duckett	It was fascinating to see the world of Harry Potter and Hogsworth brought to life through the eyes of a new director.  It would have been interesting if Chris Columbus, who I think did a marvelous job with the first two Harrys, had actually done all seven movies.  But the task is overwhelming and no man (with the possible exception of Peter Jackson) could handle such an incredible task.There are many differences between Columbus' vision and the new one brought by Cuaron.  The biggest difference I noticed was a lack of color in Cuaron's world.  Columbus' Hogsworth was full of color and fun while Cuaron saw a more adult, dry, and dangerous world.The huge difference is the detail of the story.  Chris Columbus did a very impressive job with sticking with the details of the book but Alfonso Cuaron stuck with the main storyline from the book.  The result is that while book 3 was the largest of the first three books, the third movie is the shortest of the first three movies.In other words, Harry Potter purists beware!!!  There is a LOT that is left out.  While I did enjoy the newly streamlines story, I wish that some of the finer details weren't left out that would have given the world of Harry Potter a lot more life.For instance, the creators of the Marauder's Map are never revealed in the movie.  Also, the depth of the friendship between Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin, and the Potters is barely touched upon.  The movie doesn't even share that James was an animagus and why it was that Peter and Sirius were.  I'm sure such deletions were approved by Rowlings, which means it isn't important in the overall scheme of things, but I still feel that they could have made the movie a bit longer so everyone could appreciate the information.  There was soooo much more.  And a second quiditch match with Harry's new Firebolt could have brought this movie to a whole new level.The acting is FANTASTIC and Daniel Radcliff, aka Harry Potter, really is growing up in front of our eyes.  Please, oh, please let the main actors stick it out through all seven movies!!!  It was exciting to see him actually playing with his friends in one scene.  While Columbus had to work with largely inexperienced child actors, Cuaron gave them their best performance so far.And here is some praise I have NEVER given to a movie before.  The closing credits were original, fun, and (gasp) entertaining!!!  I've never sat through closing credits without a blooper real going on, but I did this time.  Trust me, stick around a while after the movie and watch the closing credits!In the end, any Harry Potter fan should see this movie.  Even those new to Harry Potter should give it a shot.  Despite the cuts, I'll be coming back to watch it several times in its theater run.	4.0	FANTASTIC!!!!!  But too much was left out...	2004-06-04	0	0	0

Mckinley	"The first two Harry Potter movies, although very enjoyable, had an weirdly ""too perfect"" feel to them, like Disney World, with all the bright colors and exceedingly clean sets. This third installment has a more textured, ""real"" feeling to it. The computer graphics blend in nicely with the live action and is far superior to the computer graphics in the previous Harry Poter Movies. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other Hogwarts familiars have all grown up quite a bit, and boy, does it ever show in their performances!! Their acting has improved a lot with age! Lupin and Black are great and the new Dumbledore is adequate, he certainly looks the part, though I doubt will ever truly fill the robe of dear Richard Harris. The plot stays very true to the book, as best I can remember it. My only nit-picky criticism was the altering of the Hogwarts grounds. Hagrid's hut was definately not in the same location as before, and there were several other anomalies, but as I said, that may be getting pretty nit-picky. Overall, definately 5 stars and definately my favorite Harry Potter movie thus far."	5.0	Best HP So far!	2005-02-25	1	0	1

I understand this disappointment but it is a movie and most times they cannot put everything into the movie that is in the book.  The thing I hated most was the look of the movie.  The first two movies were magical.  Every scene was beautiful.  Take the Dining Hall for example.  In the first two movies, it was majestic.  The tables were beautiful, and the area where the professors sat were beautiful.  But in this third one, most of the sets looked like they were bought from the sets of some low class B-movie.  Hagrids house looked like a shack and was trashy.  When i think of the Harry Potter World i think of magic and adventure.  I do not think about going to the movies and watching another Beverly Hillbillies movie.  That is what this movie reminded me of.  The scenes with harry flying on the hippogriff were really well done and so were the dementors, but the rest of the movie looked like there wasn't enough money left to make the movie truly spectacular.  I hope the new Director for the fourth movie will see this as well and bring us back to the magic that made the first two movies loved throughout the world.	1.0	Director sucked	2004-09-20	19	8	11
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1RECBDKHVOJMW	"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana"""	"Director Alfonso Cuaron, (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""A Little Princess""), has successfully introduced pizzazz and a dark edginess to this Harry Potter film. The movie's ambiance is totally different under Cuaron's guidance - grittier, grimmer, and more visually stunning, with a subdued color scheme. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" based on J. K. Rowling's third book, is my favorite film to date. With a screenplay from Steven Kloves, and Cuaron's creativity, this is the darkest, best written, most entertaining and original of all three movies.Thirteen year-old Harry, (Daniel Radcliffe), has moved into adolescence, along with his friends Ron Weasley, (Rupert Grint - whose voice is now quite wobbly), and Hermione Granger, (Emma Watson, who has become a delightful young woman). Moodiness, raging hormones, teen angst, voice change, developing bodies, romantic feelings and unstable emotions are the usual symptoms. Harry is finally expressing his anger at being left in the care of his cold, unloving, wicked aunt and uncle. He even talks back to the Dursley's, (with good reason!). In the opening sequence Harry risks expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, by practicing magic in the Muggle world, when he turns his despicable Aunt Marge into a floating human dirigible.The start of Harry's third year at Hogwarts coincides with the murderous Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban Prison. Gary Oldman is outstandingly creepy as the escapee. Black, a wizard and an alumni of Hogwarts, is looking for young Potter. Harry has been told that the mass murderer betrayed his parents and is likely to add their son to his extensive list of victims. He was once the Potter couple's best friend, which made his betrayal all the more terrible. Dementors, terrifying robed wraiths that suck the life and the soul out of their targets, are guarding the school against the escaped convict's entrance. It makes me wonder who is guarding the students against the Dementors, much scarier creatures than Black!! Oddly, Harry experiences blackouts when in the presence of the Dementors. And shapeshifters, lycanthrope's, patrol the school grounds. Also, be on the look-out for a knock-out Quidditch game.While the riveting plot is about Sirius Black's hunt for Harry, the film's underlying themes are growth, maturity, loyalty and friendship. Harry has always been curious about his parents, dreamed of them, fantasized about them, longed for them at times - especially when in the care his Muggle relatives. Now he is left to cope with his own survival and the enormity of his loss. The tragic murder of his mother and father has become more vivid, more concrete, as he has become more emotionally mature. His parents as individuals, who they were and how they lived, take on new importance. They have become real people to Harry, instead of an idealized couple in a photograph. He is determined to discover the truth about whose betrayal led to their deaths. Professor Lupin, a new faculty member, in quiet, personal conversations with Harry, reveals more of the Potter's history and their personalities. Lupin was a close friend and sees, in Harry, a strong resemblance to both his parents. This aspect of the movie is very poignant.The presence of magic and the fantastical permeate the film - making it all the more enchanting. Dining room tables are cleared through wizardry. Talking shrunken heads hang from the bus driver's dashboard. Portraits on the Hogwarts' stairway come to life. The extraordinary Marauder's Map, used to determine everyone's whereabouts, as well as geographic location, comes into Harry's possession. Dumbledore uses magic as a gesture, nonchalantly extinguishing a candle and then re-igniting it with a wave of his hand. There's even a shrieking shack, and the Knight bus, a bizarre blue double-decker that literally squeezes its way through traffic. A strange combination of bird and steed, called a hippogriff, is introduced, and flying with him beats traveling by broomstick any day!The school faculty has returned, as has the class bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Headmaster Dumbledore, (Michael Gambon takes over for the late Richard Harris), presides over the group of academics who include: Professor Snape, (Alan Rickman), who has the art of sneering down pat; Deputy Headmistress and Professor of Transfiguration Minerva McGonagall, (Dame Maggie Smith), has the ability to turn into a cat; and beloved forester Hagrid, (Robbie Coltrane), who has been promoted to professor, proudly teaches Care of Magical Creatures. Professor Lupin, (David Thewlis) is new and has taken over teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. Emma Thompson is divinely ditzy as Sybil Trelawney, who teaches Divinations - reading of crystal balls and tea leaves.While it is extremely difficult to condense a 435 page book into a 136 minute film, most will find this adaptation faithful to Ms. Rowlings outstanding novel - except for a few Hogwarts diehards who don't understand compromise. I think the book's spirit is wonderfully captured here. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is pure delight.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A24UE12AQQBN81	Jane Austen Girl	Remember, these are all my personal thoughts and don't apply to everyone.For the most part, this is, I'll admit, a very good movie. I know that it is the movie and not the book and that directors are always going change something, but really, get some things right.Now I'm not saying that this was a bad, untrue movie, it was excellent. But they changed things that really didn't need to be changed. For example, the layout of the castle and the grounds. And Fred and George's and Malfoy`s hair, and the outfits. It shows their style and stuff, but just leave it!I do like how Cuaron added a bunch of scenes that showed how close Harry/Ron/Hermione and the Gryffindors were. And that they are getting older and such things, which helps you get to know the character better.But here come the complaints:1. There was hardly any Quidditch! And no Quidditch Cup!!! I know the plot is getting thicker, and there isn't a lot of time but really, give the kid some fun! And the Cup is a very cool thing, especially in Oliver Wood's last year.2.I think that the Sirius/Harry scene at the end should have been a bit longer but, as I said before, there isn't a lot of time...3.They didn't even tell who made the Marauders Map!! That is a VERY important thing, I think. I think that people should read the books before they see the movies anyway, but if you didn't then you would not know.4. I do not like David Thewlis as Lupin. I know this is up to personal opinion, but I thought he was too old and too creepy. Just not someone that I could get close to and I think that you have to get close to a character that important.5. The werewolf and Patronus! The werewolf looked more like a man-wolf to me. Werewolves are supposed to look like a very wild wolf. Look at any of Mary Granpre`s illustrations and tell me they got it right. And the Patronus, they didn't even say that it turned into Harry's dad...Oh, I really liked Gary Oldman as Sirius Black though. At first I was worried that he wouldn't be right, but he as close to perfect as I think that you can get. And I like Buckbeak and the new Dumbledore. He brings out the joker side of Dumbledore. But I am definitely buying this movie, no matter what complaints I have. It is still Harry Potter and still a good movie. It has its faults though.	4.0	Could be better, Could be worse	2004-10-11	9	7	2

I'm going to make this short and quick, if you watched the movie without reading the book first then you were probably like me, confused and a little frustrated as to what the hell was going on.  I ended up buying and reading the book to find out just how much info they left out and how everything connected finally with what was going on in the movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2IMDRKRNSKQ0F	"Jane Sullivan-durand ""extremeparent"""	How can anyone possibly think that this is a decent film!?  The Director (more accurately put, as i stated above 'The Harry Potter Nazi') has completely mangled the plot and any connection this book had to the movie.  Have any of you noticed that Harrys patronus is not a stag, or even an animal at all, but it a great pulsating ball of light?  There is also no mention whatsoever of The Quiddich Cup, which should have been a very important piece in this film, and to top the exclusion of Quiddich off, Oliver Wood doesnt even appear in this film!  Another thing I didn't like was the darkness of the movie, I dont know about you, but i had to turn the brightness up on my TV to be able to see anything at all.  The students also rarely wore robes, instead trading them for street clothes, and when they did wear robes, they looked as though they had been dragged through a hurricane, with all the stains on them, and you cant tell me that Daniell Radcliffe ties a tie really that bad!  They also cut out many scenes that were very important to the film, seeming as though they took some of the scenes out of the hat, arranged them randomly, and added in some of their own.  There were also many unrealistic things in it, worst of all being that if Snape ever caught Harry roaming the corridors at night, he'd give him detention for a week, not just let him walk away with Professor Lupin.I can however think of one work to sum up this movie, 'yuck'.Let us hope that the director does not follow in Alfonso Cuaron's footsteps.	1.0	Harry Potter Nazi	2005-08-21	6	2	4

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AICOZAZA1METM	"Janie Clayton ""Lina Inverse"""	Why is everyone bitching and moaning about how dark and depressing this movie is? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!  And, I hate to break it to you, but things only get worse from here. People die in the next couple of books and it looks like Harry is not long for this world. I personally thought that the use of the clock to deal with the continuing theme of time was quite clever. I also thought that the Chris Colombus movies were plodding and they were too caught up in too many tiny details. If you want to deal with all the little detail, just read the damned book! Sometimes you can't translate everything over. Cuaron, in interviews, did deal with the issue of the stag patronus, saying it would be covered in a later movie. It's not like you don't know what it means anyway. About the uniforms, I don't know if anyone noticed during their dozen trips to the theater, Tom Riddle's uniform is different than Harry's. It is concievable that possibly Hogwarts decided to change uniforms over the summer and JK Rowling didn't think it was important enought to mention. The whole point of this tirade is that you cannot put directors or screenwriters in straight jackets and prevent them from adapting a book to a movie because it is just that: an adaptation. Gone With the Wind, when you factor in inflation, is the most successful movie of all time, and it is not religiously adapted from the book. I don't think anyone is quibbling about it. I don't think most people have even read the whole damn thing.  I just hope if JKR kills Harry you don't all get pissy at the director when he makes the movie scary.	5.0	Did you think soul-sucking demons were going to be perky?	2004-10-24	17	11	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2UXU21SUAV4B6	Jan L. Nadeau	Another spell-binding adventure in the Harry Potter series.  I have read every book more than once and I eagerly await the films.  This one is again fantastic and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Not quite as much humor as the first two, this darker story features the dreaded Dementors, the Azkaban Prison guards, as tormentors of Harry Potter.  I thought the effects were stunning and especially the fearsome Dementors.  My only objection is that if one has not read the books some of the details that were left out might be confusing to the moviegoer.  Particularly the details that were not included about who created the Maurauder's Map.  As the Map is one of the highlights of the movie, I thought they could have spent a few minutes in dialogue explaining how it was created.  Aside from that, it is an exceptionally well-acted film full of drama, humor and the 3 young stars are even better in this third film than the first two, getting better and better with each one!  Children and adults alike will love this movie, although it may be a bit scary for very small children.  Get aboard the Hogwart's Express and enjoy this tremendous 3rd in the Harry Potter series!  I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which is being filmed now!	5.0	It's back to Hogwart's - Hooray!	2004-07-07	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2OU415LB9I5J6	Jason C. Wilkerson	Just prior to the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, tragedy struck when Richard Harris, the actor who played Albus Dumbledore, died of Hodgkin's Disease. After the mourning period was over, production had to look for another actor to take over the role. Having just come off of Lord of the Rings, Ian McKellan was a fan favorite to portray Dumbledore, but he opted out of the running because, after playing Gandalf and Magneto, he did not want the burden of portraying a third iconic character. Friends and family of Harris lobbied for the part to go to Harris' long- time friend Peter O' Toole, but in the end the role went to award-winning theater actor Michael Gambon.The role of Dumbledore wasn't the only thing to change between Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban. In the interim Chris Columbus stepped down as director, and in came Alfonso Cuaron. At the time Cuaron seemed a fairly unlikely choice, as his previous effort was the extremely adult Spanish language film Y Tu Mama Tambien. Hired on the strength of A Little Princess, Cuaron breathed cinematic fresh air into the series. His vision makes the wizarding world feel older and more lived-in, as if it truly is the ancient world Rowling portrays in her novels. Magic also feels more like an everyday occurrence in Cuaron's wizarding world, rather than a surprise element as it is in Columbus' films. In this adaptation, Cuaron also adds details to the Harry Potter story that even J.K. Rowling wished she had included in the books (most notably the shrunken heads).Cuaron also enhances the realism of Harry Potter by portraying the normal everyday aspects of kids living in boarding school. Prisoner of Azkaban includes extra scenes and quick glances of the characters joking around, fighting, and doing other things that kids do; the kind of content that is notably absent in previous installments. Watching Prisoner of Azkaban reminds you that, although Harry, Ron and Hermoine often find themselves in extraordinary situations, they are still kids. Another thing I have to admit I didn't notice until my most recent viewing of these movies is the weather. It's important to note that in the first two films the weather is always pleasant; giving a feeling that this magical world is one that is always perfect, always sunny. The world of Prisoner of Azkaban is a much darker one, with storms and turmoil that fit the mood of the series so much better.Prisoner of Azkaban continues the tradition of casting great theater and film actors in new roles. David Thewlis (Seven Years in Tibet, Naked) joins the cast as Remus Lupin, the newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor,  and Academy Award-winning actress Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Howard's End) plays Sybil Trelawny, Hogwarts' professor of Divination. One of my personal favorite actors, Gary Oldman (The Professional, Sid and Nancy) also appears in the film, playing the titular prisoner Sirius Black.For the younger cast members, this film is a huge leap forward in their abilities as actors. As Harry Potter begins to develop more angst and signs of rebellion, Daniel Radcliffe shows off some of his best acting in the series. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also show amazing growth as actors. A story Cuaron tells shows just how much each of the actors inhabit their characters. When he first took the job as director, Cuaron assigned Daniel, Emma, and Rupert the job of writing a paper about their characters. Rupert, in true Ron fashion, never turned in his paper, while Daniel wrote a one-page summary. Emma, in a move that would make Hermoine proud, chose to write a 16-page essay on her character. Being so in tune with their fictional counterparts really helped these young actors create more convincing portrayals of these well-loved characters.According to Rotten Tomatoes, Prisoner of Azkaban is the most critically acclaimed Harry Potter film. Unfortunately, it is also the lowest grossing Potter film as well. There are some speculators who would argue that the drop in receipts was due to the change from the winter season, when the first two films opened, to a summer release. At this point, however, the series was still doing astounding business; at $795.6 million worldwide, Prisoner of Azkaban was  the second-highest grossing film of 2004.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2010-11-24	4	2	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3IM1WJQYH0YXM	"Jason Hart ""Polymathic"""	"A lot of people are less than enthusiastic about Alfonso Cuaron's take on The Prisoner of Azkaban, and I must admit that I too was a little displeased at first. There are some interesting--some would say unnecessary--changes to the geography of Hogwarts (a new location for Hagrid's cabin, and the addition of the clock tower in the front of the school, for instance), as well a whole new directorial style that perhaps threw some people off.But it seems to be the creative license taken with the plot that has caused the most discomfort for die hard fans of this imaginative and playful series. This movie is easily the least faithful to the letter of the book so far, and many fans can't seem to get past that.I say it is least faithful to the letter, but in spirit it is right on target. This is the story where Harry begins to really delve into his past, learning more than he ever knew about his parents. This is facilitated by the appearance of Professor Lupin, an old school chum of Harry's father, and the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban, whose relationship to Harry I shall not divulge for those few who have been in a coma for the last several years.In essence, this is a coming of age story, and Cuaron really hits the nail on the head in this respect. His treatment of Harry's reaction to learning the connection between himself and Black is brilliantly played (I love the shots filmed from under the invisibility cloak in the Three Broomsticks), and Harry's relationship with Lupin was also spot on. And let's not forget the clever asides displaying Ron & Hermione's budding romance (surely you can see that one coming?!).The casting, as usual, seemed to have tapped into the collective imagination of the fans. Who better to play Professor Trelawney than Emma Thompson?! Pam Ferris actually WAS Aunt Marge, and Gary Oldman played the dissheveled, slightly mad Black to a ""T"". It's like they were plucked straight from my mind and placed on the screen.To top it all off, the entire atmosphere of the series has taken a turn for the better with this movie. As much as I love the first two films (and I love them dearly), they now seem a little rigid in comparison. Cuaron really captured the playfulness of Rowling's books. Whether it was the Whomping Willow batting a twittering bird out of the sky to signify the end of the carefree summer, or Hermione wondering aloud about how her hair looks from the back, this film at times seemed to be winking at the audience.This also came across in the musical score, once again brilliantly composed by John Williams. From ""Aunt Marge's Waltz"" to ""The Knight Bus,"" Williams deftly captured the mood of Cuaron's film, and it seemed to me that he opened things up a little and had a bit more fun this time around. I cannot recommend the soundtrack enough for those who listen to this brand of modern-day classical music.There's only one real problem with this DVD (not the movie itself), and it's the same problem I had with the previous two: where is the director's commentary?!!! I'm dying to get the inside scoop on these films, but so far have been denied in this respect. Hopefully we'll eventually get some Special Director's Cut 6 1/2 Year Anniversary Edition or whatnot, although I'd rather they rewarded their loyal fans by including the commentaries in the initial releases.So to all those who were disappointed with this take on Harry Potter, watch it again and see what you think upon further review. It took me a couple of viewings to really appreciate what Cuaron has done with this film, so don't give up on it before really giving it a go. It is, as Ron would say, ""bloody brilliant!"""	5.0	The Best Yet!	2004-10-05	14	9	5

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JXVV1QJ68PAX	Jason Wilkerson	The first two movies were pretty good, visually stunning, and they followed the books to a tee. But in a way the latter is a problem, after watching it you don't really feel like reading the books again. And while Chris Columbus did an okay job with the film, he's not a film maker, he's a blockbuster maker.Enter Alfonso Cuaron, a true filmmaker. Of course people are going to have a bit of trouble with it considering that Hogwarts looks different, the school grounds look different, and Cuaron took a few liberties with the plot. Of course, as his own artist, he really is supposed to do that isn't he? He has to artistically represent the book the way he sees it, which in my opinion is closer to the way JK Rowling intended it. (Especially considering the fact that she said that this movie is her favorite of the movies.)Not to mention that the kids are such good actors now. In the first two films Columbus hid their mistakes by trying not to keep the camera on them too much, rather than actually teaching them. Cuaron decided to have each character write an essay on their character, he taught them how to respond to situations when in character, and had them watching movies that will help them develop their acting skills. All the teaching definitely shows in this movie.The cinematography is a lot better, as well as the interlude scenes, like seeing the Whomping Willow (which is quite a bit different in this movie from COS) beat a bird in thin air, or seeing an umberella floating away in the storm at the Quidditch Match. The effects are brilliant, and you can definitely feel the characters as they move into their teens. And the Dementors and Buckbeak were excellent and very well done.Anyone can find something wrong with this film if they choose to look at it the wrong way. Don't look at this movie as an extension of the book, or you'll be disappointed, just look at it as it's own entity. It's a great movie on it's own, but doesn't completely match it's prequels except in characters and actors, and kind of moves around some of the things in the book as well as adding in it's own things. I would say go and see the movie, just don't think too much about it. I'll definitely be buying this the day it hits the shelves.	5.0	The Best of the Books, becomes the best of the movies!!!	2004-09-29	17	4	13
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A115GSA4Z6E5ZG	JayDigory	I haven't read the books. I've seen all 3 movies and I think this one was the best of the three.Yes, they left things out. Yes, a few things were out of order...but this is a movie not a book.I felt this was a better movie, because it had the length and pacing of a movie.My big complaint with the first 2 was that they were structured just as the books were, one chapter after another. This lead to the first 2 films being WAY too long. Even watching them on video I could barely sit through each in one stretch. You could just count the chapters as they ticked by, it was almost like I was watching 20 episodes of a 30 minute television show all strung together.In contrast, the 3rd film is a normal movie length and the plot and pacing is brisk and exciting. I was never confused by the plot as some reviewers have suggested was a problem. It all made perfect sense to me. And what's more, I was absolutely absorbed for the length of the film. I never felt like there was a slow part that was there just so the movie would be absolutely faithful to the book.Hearing that there were parts left out of the film just inspires me to read the book and explore the story in more depth.This film definitely had a lot more emotional impact than the first too, as well. Cuaron is a much better director than Columbus.	5.0	I thought it was great.	2005-04-26	9	5	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1U839SUCAZUBM	Jay Gambol	"An excellent adventure with loads of directorial style, a welcome change from the static diorama-like feel of the first two movies. The move to Scotland creates a depth of reality to the setting that grounds flights of fancy. I'm no Harry Potter fan, but watching the other films (and reading ""Order of the Phoenix"") has convinced me that Rowling's love of creating delightful details, much like JRR Tolkien's love of creating linguistic effects, is best kept in the background for the translation to screen. ""Prisoner"" succeeds in this, thankfully reducing the requisite Quidditch sequence that was so tiresome in ""Stone"" and ""Chamber"", and allowing the fantasy world to exist in and of itself rather than being pointed out and explained at every moment.The color palette is a briskly refreshing change from the Thomas Kinkade golden glow of the first two movies. Blue and gray gives a gritty, even cruel edge to the environment.David Thewlis turns in an excellent performance as Lupin, with a quiet and piercing bit of social commentary involving concerned parents not wanting their children to be taught ""by someone like me"" and then shutting the various boxes, cases, and closets of his office. Michael Gambon recreates Dumbledore, reducing the ethereal saintliness and adding a faintly perilousness to his humor. Dumbledore must be taken more seriously, it seems.I was disappointed by the relative lack of screen time given to Gary Oldman, but his best scenes turn the premise of the apparent plot on its ear, and are very touching.All three of the principals are growing in stature, ability, and, frankly, looks. The varying ways of wearing school uniforms and the presence of real-life clothing makes for a welcome contrast to the fantastic elements, such as the time-turner and the wands. Emma Watson is still a bit stiff, but perhaps that is part of her character. Rupert Grint is ever more appealing, and adding a bit of welcome roughness to Ron. Daniel Radcliffe expresses the ever-more-obvious darker aspects of Harry's power and past with unexpected skill.The magic itself felt tangible, real, and far from laughable, as it had in the first two movies (with the exception of the revelation of the villain in ""Chamber""). Indeed, the ultimate confrontation between Harry and the dementors was a scene where a very simple visual and sound effect transformed what would be a silly premise into a scene that thrilled, inspired, and awed.Simply, an excellent movie, and one the non-Potter fan can enjoy (probably more than the devoted Potter fans would.)"	4.0	Finally, an excellent entry into the series	2004-11-24	6	5	1

The serentiy and that forboding mood he has given the story and the new development he has taken in telling Potter's 3rd year was impeccably done.Acting wise, with top rating actors, there was no shortage of talent in this film. The three protagonists gave their best performances to date, especially Emma Watson, and made me feel satisfied with their acting abilities. The new casts members were good, too. Emma Thompson was absolutely hilarious. The Dementors and Buckbeak were marvelously done and rendered.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the most magical of the three Harry Potter movies to date. The special effects have far surpassed my ability to guess how they are done. (The scene with the protean Boggart, a-swirl with phenomenal computer graphics, apparently, is fascinating as spectacle and translates perfectly from the book.The level of acting is the best yet. Daniel Radcliffe positively seethes as the adolescent Harry. Michael Gambon does a passable imitation of the late Richard Harris doing Dumbledore. Emma Thompson is suitably daft and daffy as counterculture throwback Professor Sybil Trelawaney. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Herminone Granger) are more than passable as Harry's boon friends and confidants.The look of Hogwarts is perfect -- a masterful translation of the book to film, not a slavish reproduction. The Whomping Willow is frighteningly menacing. Clockworks are on prominent display, echoing the book's time-travel theme. Creatures (especially the winged hippogriff) are rendered so subtly and perfectly that it's hard to believe you are watching the whirl of colored pixels rather than a real beast. A critical time-based plot twist is expertly handled and may provide your family with hours of discussion and argument. It did mine.""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the perfect gift for the little witch or wizard in your family. Perfect for every Potter fan 8 and older."	5.0	Picaresque panoply of pixelated perfection	2004-10-14	19	15	4

Seeing this movie was an incredible disapointment even compared to the other movies that have come out.  It strayed immensly from the book and I don't think that they should even attempt to make Goblet of Fire.  To make a movie of a book that is so long and so brilliantly written when a decent one cannot be made of a book that is half it's length will crush any avid Harry Poter fan.  The attempts to turn the Harry Poter books into box office hits like the Lord of the Rings is futile and a waste of time.	1.0	Not even close to the book	2005-06-13	14	4	10

The main reason I even write reviews is to rate using the stars. We should have the option to rate with the stars alone, and/or write a review. I don't know many people that have the time to actually write a review for every product they own. Furthermore, I just feel as though it's helpful to see what others have rated a specific product.

When it does, it makes sense. a great example is Harry's Firebolt. Once you see the film you'll understand why it was a good move. My only complaint is that they didn't dwell on the Prongs, Padfoot, Moody and Wormtail story. Bottom line: best Potter film, however, to get the full expereince read the book AS WELL. Reading the first two books wasn't neccessary to 'get' the movies. I'm anxious for &quot;HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE&quot; due Nov. 18, 2005.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1N4XTWM54BZUK	"""jeffre_l"""	I am no longer supporting Warner Brothers and the Harry Potter movies as the third one has deviated too far from the original books. Sure, the effects are nice and the new feel was nice, but unfortunately none of this has any relevance as the movie DID NOT DEPICT THE BOOK. No doubt, this movie has received amazing reviews from adult critics, but I doubt that any of them have read the books--and if they have they have not done so with an appropriate level of appreciation for the stories in general, or JK Rowling's overall message throughout the novels. What the writer and director did was pick a few key points from the novel, use those exactly, and then use his own imagination with the rest. This led to key points being left out entirely, as well as certain features completely rewritten. Want an example? The firebolt that Harry received he got much earlier in the novel, Professor McGonagall confiscated it, and then it was returned to him under the insistence of Oliver Wood---who, might I mention, made no appearance in the movie. Instances like this were all too common and are the reason I hope that if more movies are made they are done so with more care to the original books.--a disappointed fan and lost supporter of Warner Brothers	1.0	Lost Supporter	2004-06-04	11	8	3

This movie is darker and it is definetly not for children under the age of 10.  This is primarily because the plot is darker and more complex.  Younger audience members will not understand.

Sirius Black ( a great Gary Oldman) has escaped Azkaban and is on his way to ""kill"" Harry at Hogwart's.  New characters are introduced, including Professor Lupin (played by David Thewlis) who plays a mentorship role to Harry.  The movie is darker than the first 2 movies, as the storyline continues to follow the progress of the characters at Hogwart's.

I feel Cuar&oacute;n did a good job as far as creating a darker atmosphere overall with the movie.  He did, however, leave out many crucial parts to the story line, which would leave non-readers of the series confused.  I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this film, it was still done great, but just doesn't live up to the greatness of the book or the standards set by Columbus with the first 2 films.	3.0	Nice Try for Cuar&oacute;n	2004-11-23	5	3	2

I consider myself Potterholic.  When I entered the theater to see the third movie, my hopes were high.  New director, new point of view.I walked out extremely disappointed.  The flow of the movie seemed choppy at best.  The director seemed to spend too much time on certain aspects of the story and not enough on some very important parts of the story.  For example, he seemed to ""throw"" Professor Trelawny's vision in almost as an afterthought and did not explain it much.The back story for PoA was about Harry's father's boyhood friends.  Mr. Cuaron seemed to neglect that little aspect towards the end of the film when Harry encounters Pettigrew, Black, and Lupin in the Shreeking Shack.  It left the viewer disoriented and wondering why the sudden change in Lupin's opinion of Black.The only positives about the film is it was darker and more spooky and the kids are growing as actors by leaps and bounds.I do intend to purchase the film, but only because I don't like to have holes in a series.View at your own risk, just don't read the book prior to it.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3TSX8V1OBMIOM	JennMars	"One of the truly remarkable things about Jo Rowling's books is that virtually everything that happens has some impact on the plot. And reading the professional reviews of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (POA), it seemed that a tremendous job was done in bringing the book to the big screen, telling a story that was compelling for fans of the books and those few people (my husband included) who've never cracked the cover of one.I left the theater wondering what movie those critics were watching.  Unless you've read the book, POA is a murky, confusing mess.  And if you have read the books, you're likely to leave the theater as disappointed as Ron when he receives yet another maroon sweater for Christmas.In an interview, Alfonso Cuaron said that he tried to ""strip down"" the story of POA to its ""critical"" elements.  Fans of the books, and movie buffs who expect the film they're watching to make sense, will find that Cuaron and the writers conveyed those critical elements in a series of disconnected short scenes that create confusion rather than exposing the plot.  Adding to the confusion is the exclusion of information that IS relevant and crucial to the storyline.Among the critical missing material: the relationship of Black, Lupin, Pettigrew and James Potter; the senior Potters' use of the Fidelius Charm (which explains why everyone thought Sirius Black was the Potters' betrayer); and the confrontation between Pettigrew and Black (which explains why the wizarding world is so afraid of Black). It took me 15 minutes after the movie ended to explain the backstory to my husband, who'd enjoyed the first two films tremendously because the story was clear even to someone who hadn't read the books.I was also disappointed at the elimination of other scenes that were less plot-relevant, but which would have lightened the pervading dark tone and highlighted the talents of the film's adult actors.  I was really looking forward to the Christmas dinner exchange between Profs. McGonagall and Trelawney -- the image of Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson playing that scene made me laugh out loud on the train as I re-read the book before seeing the movie.  Sadly, Smith and Thompson never appear together in the film.  And what happened to the exciting scene of Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup??Many of the criticisms I've seen from young Harry Potter fans are with the departure from literal interpretation of the books.  I didn't have a problem seeing the characters in street clothes or with the plot changes that were made (so Aunt Marge flew up into the sky, it doesn't change the story and got a big laugh in the theater).  A slavish, literal translation would leave people disappointed ... and an adaptation that included all the critical elements and scenes that foreshadow future events would probably take 4 hours to tell.And that's the real problem Warner Brothers faces as they adapt the later novels for the big screen.  Too much material that's critical to understanding the story will have to be left out to make 2.5 hour movies out of the next two books in the series, which are considerably longer than POA.That everything in the books seems to be crucial to the plot makes Rowling's books delightful to read, and the films so difficult to make.  I hope a better job is done with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, or it may just be the last Harry Potter movie I see."	2.0	Is Harry Becoming Too Complex for the Movies?	2004-06-07	0	0	0

However, if they were to truly make the movie based on the book, then we'd have a movie well over 3 or 4 hours. Now, as much as I like a book and want the movie to go in accordance with the original script (book), I don't want to have to sit in a theater seat for more than 3 1/2 hrs. So, although I was disappointed when I saw the premiere, after buying the DVD and watching it couple times over and going over the directors' commentaries as well as JK Rowling, I guess they did an all right job.  Now if JK Rowling (who had her say in the making of the movie as far as what she wanted)was satisfied with the overall making of the movie, then I can't complain...but I do hope the director for The Goblet of Fire can make a movie that is worth the book....All in all, I think Alfonso Cuaron did a fairly decent job, considering he was not there for the first two....I think people who are fans of the Harry Potter series should purchase this DVD. It does follow the plot of the book as much as possible and though certain parts were put out of context, I did like how the director managed to show how our characters were entering their teenage years, and developing into their own.	4.0	When show biz takes over....	2004-12-12	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A17J76Z2LVP8VL	Jeremus	"My favorite BOOK of the series and my LEAST favorite movie of the series so far.  I know movies can't always follow the books they're based on EXACTLY-- however, this movie left out some pretty important stuff.  Not only that, but things were added to the movie that were not in the book.  So here's the good, the bad and the ugly about ""Prisoner of Azkaban""...First-- the good:  It's not a bad movie.  The acting's good overall.  There's a lot of action and a good storyline with a couple of twists and turns toward the end.  The scenery is beautiful and you see a lot more of the grounds surrounding Hogwarts than in previous movies...and there's a beautiful scene of Harry's ride on the hippogriff.  If you've not read the books but you've seen movies 1 and 2 (or at least know the Harry Potter basics), I think you'll enjoy yourself even if you don't know what the heck is going on all the time.  (It IS the third of a series so you DO need to know something of the first two to really know what's going on.)Now-- the bad:  If you really liked the first 2 movies, there are some major changes in this one that are hard to get used to.  First, many of the sets are completely different.  Now Hagrid's hut is far away from the castle across a long bridge and down a steep hill... and the Whomping Willow (that nearly destroyed the Weasleys' car in movie 2) is out in the forest-- not near the school.  (These sets are also used in movies 4 and 5.)  Also, many of the faces of other students you're used to seeing in the background (like Susan Bones, Lee Jordan, Oliver Wood) have been replaced by new unfamiliar actors-- some with speaking parts but you can't identify them with characters in the book.  (Neville, Dean, and Sean are there, but there's a strange unidentified boy running around with Draco.)  Then there's Dumbledore...  When Mr. Harris died, they understandably had to find a relacement.  But Mr. Gambon plays a much different Dumbledore than Mr. Harris did.  He's not bad-- just different.  He looks different, dresses differently, moves around quicker and just doesn't have that powerful calm presence that is associated with the character and which Mr. Harris achieved so well.  Also, it's a little weird that Professor Flitwick, who was portrayed in the last movies as an old grey haired wizard, is now much younger with short black hair and a moustache!  Some people enjoyed the ""new look"" of the movie... others (including myself) didn't.Okay-- now for the ugly:  For those who've read and enjoyed Book 3, I think you'll be anywhere from 'somewhat' to 'severely' disappointed.  There are (of course) a lot of nitpicky things I could mention (like Lupin's moustache, or dementors flying instead of floating above the ground, etc.), but there are some major problems. First, there are things that are not in the book but came right out of the director's head:1. Talking shrunken heads (with Jamaican accents for some reason) that seem to be everywhere.2. Tom, who tends the Leaky Cauldron and is described as stooped and toothless in the book, is now bald with a hump and a limp and acts like some freakish Igor in an old Frankenstein movie.3. Then there's the infamous first seconds of the movie where Harry is using his wand to practice magic at the Dursley's-- which I don't have to tell anyone who's familiar with the books OR the previous movies is a BIG no-no!  Considering the penalty Harry receives in Book 5 for using his wand outside of school... well, let's just say that a little research would have gone a long way.4. Then there's the ""Fat Lady""... It isn't the film time that was wasted having the Fat Lady refuse the students entrance to the Gryffindor common room until she could break a wine glass with her voice that's the problem... it's the fact that the SECRET entrance to Gryffindor Tower is (according to Cuaron) right off the main staircase where everyone can see it!!5. And even though the hippogriff in the movie is as it's described in the book, the other important magical beast towards the end of the movie is absolutely NOTHING like JKR described him (and it would have been a lot scarier if he he had been)!And now it gets REAL ugly:  Without giving away the ending or twists in the story-- key important bits of information that are revealed in Book 3 are left out!  For instance, the Marauder's Map is given to Harry, but its origin and inventors are never mentioned.  Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban, but how he was able to do it is never revealed.  No mention is made of what James Potter (Harry's dad) and his friends were doing while at Hogwarts or why.  The reason for the Shrieking Shack and the Whomping Willow is never explained.  Why Harry's patronus manifests as a stag is also never explained (even though it does appear as such in the movie).  Such information would have given this movie more depth and is one of the reasons the book is so popular.  It gave a peek into the life of Harry's dad and broadened Harry's world a little.  Without James Potter and his friends doing what they did all those years ago, all the events in Book 3 never would have happened and Harry's third year at Hogwarts would have been as boring as my 8th grade year in Junior High.  Why none of this was included is beyond me.  Had it been, it would have been a much better movie.**My recommendations:  If you want depth and explanation and a good background story that ties everything together... get the book and read it.  If you just want a good action/adventure movie that you can watch with the kids and not be completely bored out of your mind... get the DVD.**Parental note:  This movie is rated PG for violence (monsters and ghouly dementors and such) and may be a bit too scary for the little ones."	4.0	The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...	2007-08-25	6	6	0

I thought at first that the new director was totally to blame for this Swiss cheese version of the book.  However, I must extend the blame to the screenplay writer Steven Kloves and J.K. Rowling.  Mr. Kloves' scriptwriting shortcomings were visible in Chamber of Secrets but became really evident this time around.  Ms. Rowling deserves a cold look of disdain because she signed off on the whole project. I will have to seriously consider whether I want to add this DVD to my collection.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2OVJ5O4MQ0XE0	Jess	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Movie Review - **** (out of *****)Here, we finally get to see everybody's favorite young wizard-in-training get the screen treatment that he deserves.  No, there has not been a truly great Harry Potter movie yet-but this is a step in the right direction.Alfonso Cauron brilliantly brings several sensations to Potter that weren't there the first few go-rounds:  genuine, subtle emotion, a brisk pace, and a sense of unease and danger.  One thing he also brings to the series is what it really needed:  a sense of freedom.  The biggest problem with the first two movies was that they feared that if they strayed from the books in the slightest they'd never live to be classics.  This movie understands that a movie must break free from its source material and become an entity of its own while never entirely straying from its roots.  Kloves and Cauron know what to take out, what to keep in, and what to add to keep the pace and flow of the movie.  The only section that needed a bit of work was the ending, in which a lot of information must be absorbed in a short amount of time-but that is a small complaint.The plot revolves around Sirius Black, a convicted murderer who is the first person ever to have escaped Azkaban Prison-and he's after Harry.  As the movie progresses, Harry learns that Sirius Black is related to the events surrounding his parents' murder.The greatest power of the book was its unique themes-truth and irony.  Unlike Columbus, whom I doubt could tell you the main theme of Chamber of Secrets, Cauron brilliantly focuses Prisoner of Azkaban on those two aspects, and on Harry's growing sense of longing and the difficulties of his adolescence.Possibly the aspect of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that will give it its unique identity apart from the other films is its artsy style of directing.  Anyone who has seen Cauron's previous films knows his range of imagination and innovation, and he brings that to this film, making it feel at the same time like a big-budget production and a smaller film meant for the art theaters.  He deftly mixes metaphor and insight into nearly every frame of the picture, creating a type of Potter which we haven't seen before, and I doubt we'll see again.As previously mentioned, however, the film is held back from being great by some slight blunders in the storytelling.  Certain events will lose some viewers; however, those who can understand will find a rich and vivid story that is told by a master storyteller.  The bar has been greatly raised, and the stage is set for everything to change.	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2005-11-21	3	3	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2I3JGSWLITVUU	Jess	The director of this movie definately didn't stick with the books, and that's made me as well as loads of other people unhappy. Very important information was taken out (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs!) and unneeded scenes were added in (the Gryffindor boys eating that candy and making animal noises - how was that important?!). I'm really upset with the director. Chris Columbus did a much better job. Hopefully the newest director won't mess it up for everyone again.	3.0	Too much change.	2004-09-12	12	8	4

I must admit that I was disappointed with this movie. It strayed from the book so much that key elements were missing. If you hadn't read the Prisoner of Azkaban you wouldn't understand a majority of the movie and what made the book so special. Everything was out of whack and sequence. Fellow reviewers have already mentioned particular instances of which I speak. The cinematography of the first two movies is beyond amazing. This new director tried too hard to make the Prisoner of Azkaban ""spooky"" by making the entire movie grainy. It bothered me. The first two movies looked so magical and this movie didn't even come close that capturing that same essence. The Prisoner of Azkaban was by no means a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't as good as it should have been."	3.0	This one lost some magic...	2004-08-12	5	5	0

Director Chris Columbus seemed to have a better handled on the story-line & the way the story should be layed out than Director Alfonso Cuaron.  In my opinion, Cuaron should have read the books rather than ""fly by the seat of his pants"".  The story line in the 3rd film was a bit dismal and sketchy to follow.  Overall it seemed as though the audience was thrown into scenes rather than have the scenes properly explained.  For instance, when 'The Fat Lady's' picture was slashed, the movie never explained why she was slashed up to bits.  Why Sirius Black wanted to get into the Griffindor Tower.  When Aunt Marge was ballooned out, she never floated outside.  Or in Lupin's class, Harry never faced the boggart with the rest of the class, Lupin's fear was that Harry's worst fear would've been Voldemort & didn't want to spread panic throughout the rest of the room.Disappointing job Director, absoluting disappointing.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2YI2W3ZRCU25L	J. Freeman	"This is the most refined and most developed movie yet in the ""Harry Potter"" series.  It has a stylish, more mature feel to it, thanks to the directing of Alfonso Cuaron.Cuaron makes use of an iris effect throughout the film, with wonderful results.  Scenes open and close in a dreamy, otherworldly sense that only compliments both the setting and the storyline.While much of Rowling's world has changed since the first two films (directed by Christopher Columbus), it has, for the most part, been improved upon.  The castle and its grounds feel older and darker, mirroring the characters' growth into moody adolescence.Younger viewers (and a handful of older viewers, for that matter) may be frightened by the on-screen depiction of Rowlings' dementors, which are every bit as fear-enducing as the text would lead one to believe.Daniel Radcliffe and Co. have done a fine job as well in this latest installment.  Their acting skills are much-improved, and the actors seem to have much better chemistry between one another.This is an enjoyable film for Harry Potter fans and cinephiles alike.  Cuaron has adapted a great book into a very well-made movie."	5.0	Azkaban Doesn't Disappoint!	2004-12-29	2	1	1

So much was taken out that should have been left in, stuff that was just a bit important to the plot. And, ok, I realize that Dumbledore had to be changed because of the passing of Richard Harris, but the casting department could have done a little better. I even heard that he acted like a hippie on PURPOSE, acting on instructions from the director. And did Cueron really HAVE to make the ending so stupid?? I had been looking foward to this movie more than the others (it's my favorite book) and was very disappointed.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8TM0DXHWJ6UL	"J. G. Kleinhans-Coghill ""Complete Critic"""	This movie is really good. It stays true to the essence of the book while still incorporating new ideas and looks for things. I mean really, what's the point of having a movie follow the book EXACTLY? The vast majority who go to see these films HAVE read the books already, and if they haven't they won't know the difference anyway.I think this movie is great because of the artistic license taken with it. It's not a carbon copy of the book, so it's as if you see a brand-new yet still very familiar story. I also like how it also speaks more to a older audience. I mean, all the original HP fans (like me) are a lot older now than they were when the first books came out. I'm nearly 18 now, and still big a fan.I do wish they had put in the Marauders storyline, but I understand what the director said about how with the way they're making the movies, it can fit in better later in the series. I also respect the director's decisions on the other ommisions made, we all knew that they'd have to cut the story a bit.I can understand how younger kids may start losing their innocent enjoyment of the movies at this point, but the books ARE the same way. Nobody can even TRY to convince me that The Order of the Phoenix was written for an audience the same age as the one for Sorceror's Stone. Face it, the series involves the kids growing up. Therefore, as they get older it only stands to reason that the storylines and everything will evolve and grow as well, becoming more suitable for slightly older audiences.Really, this movie is a brilliant addition to the Harry Potter series and I'm proud to have it at the top of my Christmas wish list. It is a purely magical film from beginning to end. We get to see all the old familiar cast, minus Richard Harris (may he rest in peace, he really WAS Dumbledore), as well as some great new additions. I'm sure finding someone new to play Headmaster Dumbledore was very difficult, and even though it will never be the same, I think they made a pretty good choice. All the Hogwarts students are much more mature and grown up now, and it's definitely reflected in their acting. It was fun to see.Parents should be aware that the books do evolve and mature as the series continues, and the movies should be expected to do the same. If you haven't seen it and have any doubts, then my advice would be to simply rent it or borrow it from a friend so that you can watch it before you buy and before letting your young children see it.I don't think there should be much of a problem with this one though, I don't think it's too much darker than the last one. The 4th and 5th are bound to be much darker than this one is. I think anyone who read the books knows what I mean, there's no way that they could cut the darkness out of those and leave the story intact. Therefore, if the maturity and darkness of this one is starting to concern you, I would advise you to take great caution with future HP movies as well.	5.0	Awesome Movie!!	2004-11-12	17	13	4

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3VZZVUE7T4TI1	J. Holmes	The first movies were directed by a person and were a bit wooden in their presentation.  Prisoner of Azkaban breaks out of the stiff actor mold and rigid camera settings.  The settings are more interesting and the character are truly dynamic.Michael Gamdon is admirable in his role as Dumbledore.  The late Richard Harris, who played the character in past films, seemed to fit the role better, however, Gamdon's portrayal of Hogwart's headmaster is delightful.Gary Oldman, always a joy to watch in any role, is perfectly suited to the part of the darkly mysterious Sirius Black.  His character contrasts nicely with those of the brooding Professor Snape, brilliantly played by Alan Rickman, and the tormented Professor Lupin, brought to life by David Thewlis.  These three consummate actors are well-suited for the roles of childhood friends and rivals.  The depth they add to the characters brings the pages of the book to life on the screen.Fans of the books will find this film much more dynamic and true to the spirit of the book.  Lines and scenes are not repeated strictly verbetim from the pages of the book and the characters aren't as mechanical in their actions.  Those who have not read the books may be left wondering about a few unanswered questions, but overall Prisoner of Azkaban is a delight for any family movie night.	5.0	Remains true to the spirit of the book	2005-03-09	5	2	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A6E6MT241WIVB	Jim	"This movie is definitely darker than the first two.  It didn't do as well at the box office, but I think there are two reasons for that:  (a) The people who liked the first two movies probably went away a bit disappointed.  (b) The people who might have liked this movie probably didn't go to see it, thinking it would be more of the same, which it isn't.What I liked the most about this movie was that the big three (Harry, Hermione, and Ron) are given a chance to act--and they can act!  In the first two movies Ron especially was forced to do little more than scrunch up his face to look stunned, baffled, awed, scared, etc.  What a waste.  The quality of the acting from all three of the kids was very impressive--especially when you consider they were chosen initially because they ""looked"" like the characters in the books, and they could easily have all turned out to be duds, with absolutely no acting ability.  The fact that all three can act is nothing short of a miracle.In several cases, I thought the screenplay was actually an improvement on the book.  This is heresy, I know.  But listen, in the movie, it's Hermione who realizes that they're to save Buckbeak--which makes much more sense and gives Hermione her due, while in the book it's Harry who makes the connection, something that is slightly out of character for him.  I also like the way that Hermione blows open Sirius's jail cell door near the end (girl power all the way, woohoo).  And the way that Harry overhears the conversation in the pub is much more believable in the film, as it makes use of the invisibility cloak, rather than on the fairly lame ""move a tree in front of the table"" ploy in the book.The special effects are awesome, a big improvement especially over the first movie.  The scene where Harry rides Buckbeak is worth the price of admission all by itself.  The clocktower, bogart scenes, dementors, broomstick scenes, etc., are all done quite convincingly.The scenery is spectacular and is used to good effect, with the talks between Harry and Prof. Lupin, especially, being done in places where there is very nice eye candy to look at in the background.There are also a lot of nice smaller touches, like the scene with the student choir singing ""Something wicked this way comes.""  It's cute, but also adds a real touch of atmosphere.  The womping willow is used as a nice comic relief element, as are the shrunken heads.  (I could have done without the shrunken heads in the extra features part, where I felt it detracted from the otherwise very interesting interviews with the cast and crew.)When I first watched the movie, I wasn't as impressed with it as I am now, after I've watched it half a dozen times at least.  For me, this movie has enough going on visually to give it quite a bit of replay value--and the eye candy is almost always left in the background so that it doesn't detract from the solid screenplay and the advancement of the storyline.I couldn't quite give this one five stars, but it's probably worth 4.5 when it comes right down to it.  Very solid, and certainly the best HP movie so far."	4.0	Best HP Movie So Far	2005-08-26	0	0	0

Yes, it was much darker than the first two, but that is what made it great to me.  The trio are coming into their form as great actors.  They were great.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban brings Harry back to Hogwarts for his 3rd year. There he is warned about an escape prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Sirius was once a friend of his parents who Harry believes betrayed them and turned them in to Lord Voldemort. These death like beings called Dementors are sent from Azkaban to Hogwarts to look for Sirius. The Dementors keep getting in Harry's way and even cause him to lose a quiditch match. So after that Harry decides that he needs to defend himself against them. He has Professor Lupin (David Thewis) teach him how to fend them off.I liked this one the most. It's more mature and darker just like the actual books get darker and more mature as they go on. I thought that Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n who directed the Little Princess was a bad choice at first. However he does an excellent job and it's a shame that he's not doing the next Potter film. Daniel Radcliffe also is much better as Harry this time around I think. His acting has gotten much better since it's his 3rd film playing Harry. I think he nailed the part 100% this time around. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as Ron and Hermione are much better as well. There's a lot of great new cast members. Surprisingly I think David Thewis (Dragonheart) was the best addition as Professor Lupin. While the others weren't bad adaptions I think this one was the best.  Tom Felton should probably  be replaced soon as Draco Malfroy soon though. He nailed the part in the first 2 films but now he just comes off as a pretty boy and is about as menacing as Zach Morris. Plus still don't understand why Harry, Ron and Hermione wear Muggle clothes at one point in the movie. Can see them maybe dressed like that trying to mix in with Muggles outside of Hogwarts but here it makes no sense. Some  parts of the book are missing. Harry's girl crush Cho Chang isn't in it at all but hopefully they'll add her to the next 2 movies. They also cut out one Quiditch match but I didn't really realize that until the movie was over.This film is still a fantastic ride into anotherr world though and is still one of the best fantasies you'll see. I think it's still true to the book and  J.K. Rowling isn't exactly outraged by it if you look at [...]  People are complaining saying oh it doesn't explain the history that Lupin, Sirius, Pettigrew and Snape have. However their history isn't really explained that much until book 5. So what Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n doesn't get into in this movie can easily be explained in the next 2. So people should stop complaining and just enjoy the movie.	4.0	Wonderful!, the best one!	2004-06-04	5	4	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABPKN5HVE8FNI	J. Jackson	Overall this was a good movie, if you put aside ALL of the differences it had from the book. I am glad that humor was added back to this movie since it had been missing in the first two films.  If that meant though that key information would be dropped from the film I would have chosen to forgo the humor. What I do not like or understand is the necessity to change characters or the setting.  One that really bothered me was Professor Flitwick he completely changed, he now has slicked back black hair and no beard instead of his grey hair and beard. Tom the bar keeper at the Leaky Cauldron also completely changed into a hunched back with a creepy look and attitude.  Why is a choir song more important to view than to hear how important it is that Harry's patronus is a stag and why Lupid knows how to use the Marauders Map? I also do not understand why it was ok for Harry to use magic at the beginning of the movie under his covers? Harry explains at the end of the first movie that it is not ok to use magic outside of school, he will also have a hearing on using magic outside of school grounds in his fifth year. Yes, it was funny but it wasn't accurate or needed when other important information was lacking. I also did not care for how Harry received the firebolt, It took out key parts of the film including the fact that Gryffindor finally won the Quiditch cup against Slytherin.	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-08-06	5	3	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A5YOMBZZ9RYC7	JKI	The Good: On the whole I felt that the kids that played the leads acted much better than in previous movies - the forced facial expressions that seems to be a Chris Columbus staple was thankfully absent. The fact that they are becoming teenagers was also captured. The atmosphere was more dark and forbidding. The man that replaced Dumbledore did a fairly seemless job - though he wasn't given mush screen time.The Bad: I felt as if I were watching two different movies. The cuts from one scene to the next were abrupt. There were major points in the movie which should have never been or been more explained:1) Harry is not allowed to do magic outside Hogwarts - why was he doing a spell in the very begining?2) His father's relationship with Professor Moony and why the Prof knew about the marauder's map.3) Why the spell Harry says at the end takes on a certain form of an animal.4) the characters from the the Quiditch team really should have been given some film time - if only for the fact that they play major roles in the next film.Some of the other chages were artistic liberty - I know. But most the complaints I listed above really distorted or changed the story.The look is better in this film than the previous two but the script has to be more coherent.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	APNF8LL48VSXH	"J. Michael Shepherd ""isomeraser"""	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has been heralded by many as the best of the series.  With that to live up to it would have been difficult to satisfy the many fans of the franchise.  I went in to this film hoping to love it, but expecting to be disappointed.  My expectations were met.The tone of the movie was darker, and more mature.  While this is not a problem in and of itself it lacked some of the charm and appeal of the first two films.  While the social byplay of the kids might be interesting, it was made far too prominant in the film.  It simply is not that important to the story...While any person who has a grasp of reality does not expect a movie to be as good as the book, this was disturbing.  The sequence of events of the bood were shifted constantly, often for no real reason.  Many of the more interesting events from the book were left out, while new dialogue and events were added.  I have nothing against adding new lines if it serves a purpose, but most of these did nothing to advance the plot.  Overall this was easily the worst of the three movies.Now, to the positives.  There were many humorous lines and situations that added a depth to the characters.  It made them feel more 'real'.  The special effects were absolutely first rate.  I was especially impressed with buckbeak.While Curazon has a wonderful grasp of human conditions he does not have a feel for the depth of plot that makes these books so successful.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BVZRMDUAZUIT	"Joan-Violet ""Jo"""	The joy of Harry winning the Quidditch final for Gryffindor was left out of this film a most important connection and the main reason for the spell to overcome the Dementors, so Harry could play Quidditch without falling off his broom again...and where was the Firebolt broom he used in that final that was taken from him for inspection, by Prof. McGonagall after receiving it anonymously as a Xmas present..that finaly turned out to be from Sirius... I was disappointed over that. The Firebolt thus appeared in the last scene squashed into the films last minute with a note from Sirius. The invisibility cloak's usage was also different than the book. Hermione's odd behaviour was hardly noticable and if I didn't read the book I wouldn't have known what the plot was. The scenery was an improvement I have that same picture of a Loch in Scotland the part were the Dementors killed the orchid blossoms as they sailed past.The special effects where much keener I enjoyed that,and The Marauders Map, and end credits etc. I missed Richard Harris though as Dumbledore, his replacement didn't do anything for me.Keeping true to the book will work much better. The links were not tied together well. Hermione's hair was nondiscript...The choir was a good added bonus though. Harry looked ok in his casuals and they did wear their uniforms as well...Daniel Radcliffe is a cute lad and fits the character perfectly. The stages from age 10 to fourteen springs the story from a kids film to a teens film as the books do...This is correct natural progress.I love owls and I commend JK Rowling on her portrayal of these magnificant birds. Dawn French was superb as the fat lady and Snape is a horror as usual, he gets worse in each book..Pam Ferris' short part as the formidable aunt who blew up was superb comedy...and Harry being rebellious at last against the Dursleys was much more human of him,(pity they removed the memory they deserve to remember that).The Knight bus had me in stitches..and the conducter looked oddly like Jack from the British comedy sitcom, On The Buses. The Hippogryph flight was lovely and the Dementors were just as scary as the book...yeeeuuuck!! The black dog was scary too I always get the jitters over black dogs as I was attacked by one as such..glad it turned out to be friendly. I liked the portrayal of the time slip stuff saving Sirius and the Hypogriff. I loved the spell as the stag over the lake, the were-wolf, the whomping willow was terrific effects, spinning the kids round like that.The Goblet of Fire, book 4 will be a challenge ..The Quidditch world cup was a bit far fetched I thought though with all the daft characters....I have just got through reading that at the moment....quite a dark one a bit gorey too.This DVD is good...but it could have been so much better with a little extra thought.I do like the special features especially Hogmeads and The Knight Bus also the interviews with the young cast.	4.0	Quidditch final missing and Firebolt	2004-12-05	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2FEGRJQNU51P9	Joe Sherry	"A film by Alfonso Cuaron""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the story of Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  No longer quite the timid young boy that he was when he first started at Hogwarts, Harry has grown up a bit and has more confidence.  He also has a tinge of anger inside of him that gets fanned during this movie (and which we see grow throughout the series).  Harry has no sooner left the Dursleys when he learns about a murderer named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman).  Black has escaped from the Azkaban wizard's prison.  Azkaban is where the wizarding world sends the worst of the worst, including those former followers of Voldemort.  Black, who is said to be especially dangerous to young Harry, is counted as being one of the nastier inmates at Azkaban and is remarkably dangerous if only for the fact that he is the only person ever to escape Azkaban and the Dementor guards.At school, Harry is back together with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).  The three friends go through their daily school routine, which is filled with fantastic creatures, new professors, and adventures.  The talk of the school, however, is the escaped convict Sirius Black and the Dementor guards that are being hosted at Hogwarts.  Dementors are particularly unpleasant creatures with a deservedly nasty reputation for single-minded ruthlessness.  The strength of a Dementor is the ability to literally suck the soul out of a person, leaving him a mindless shell.  A Dementor is a fearsome creature which exudes fear (it feeds on fear) and can cause a chill just by passing by.  The question is not whether or not Harry will get involved in the hunt for Sirius or have to deal with the Dementors, but when and how.Now in the hands of a new director, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a much darker story than the first two films.  This is fitting, because the third book is also a darker story.  What is remarkable here, though, is that Cuaron is able to rediscover the sense of wonder and humor that is present in the books but was lacking in the first two films that Chris Columbus directed.  The first two films were very faithful adaptations, but lacked something of the heart of the novels.  Cuaron succeeded in making ""Azkaban"" closer to the spirit of the novels, even while cutting more content than the first two films did.  ""Azkaban"" is more tightly focused on its main storyline and does not spend nearly as much time dealing with the extras which were interesting in the book but would cause the film to lose focus.  As much as I enjoyed the first two films, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was by far the best of the three films and here's hoping that Cuaron will come back to direct ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""."	5.0	darker, funnier, and the best of the series so far	2004-06-07	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQBRMBQ99ESI7	"John A Lee III ""jal3"""	I was disappointed with this film but my reasons differ somewhat from those given by other reviewers. This one still has the technical excellence of the first two in terms of effects and production values. It also does a fair job of following the book although there are elements that have to be cut in any such adaptation. It is certainly a darker episode than the first two but so was the book. My complaint is different. The new director needlessly made changes that didn't have to be made.Some of the changes involve sets. The feel of the story is different. There is no real story telling reason for the change; it seems the changes were made for their own sake.Other changes that seem to be made for their own sake do involve the story line. Nothing was accomplished by the changes. They don't seem to have added to the story and, I must admit, they don't really detract all that much. They are just different without having to be. It is almost as if the book was not good enough. That is a far cry from a book being too difficult to film.The story involves Harry's 3rd year at the Hogwarts Academy for wizards. Once again, skullduggery is afoot and Harry and his friends are intent on straightening things out. This time, a fearsome wizard has escaped from prison and it is common knowledge that the wizard wants Harry dead. His being Harry's Godfather makes the tale more convoluted and the twists and turns really start occurring when many of the characters are not who they seem to be.It's a good movie adaptation of a book but it is not in the same league as the others.	3.0	A Needless Letdown	2005-12-01	5	1	4

The first two were great, however in this one, there was so much they left out. At the end, I was expecting there to be at least another half an hour of film because of how much they missed. I am looking forward to the fourth movie but I cant help but think that it is going to be the same outcome. Since they keep changing directors, the set of the school and everywhere else is going to continue to change. I hope not, but it is inevidible.	2.0	Fairly Disappointed	2005-02-02	11	5	6

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NDIYHYV5BLD3	"John Damian O'meara ""dstntp1lgr1m"""	I just saw this film for the first time last night.  I'm not going to repeat what has been said.  Take other people's word for it, the film is awesome and does not drag at any point at all.  This one keeps moving...A lot of this has to do with the fact that many parts of the book were cut, or moved around to spots that were easier to work with in the film version.  An example is the firebolt.  In the film, Harry gets in in the end.  In the book, there's a really big deal about him getting it so soon after his Nimbus 2000 broke, and Hermione suspects that it has been cursed by Sirius Black.  (By the way, those of you who say you have no idea who gives him the Firebolt in the end...  Pay attention to what Hermione points out about it...  She picks it up and holds a certain something.... Hint Hint).Finally, as much as people point out what is missing, they fail to point out the lacking explanation of dynamics between Pettigrew (wormtail), Sirius (padfoot), Lupin (moony), and Harry's father (prongs).  THE AUTHORS OF THE MARAUDERS MAP!!!  I'm worried that people who have never read the book won't understand that the reason Harry sees a deer (like a ghost) is because his father used to be an animagus as well, and that was the animal he became (hence the nickname prongs).  They also don't explain the reasons why Snape hates them all so much (the adults that is).  Go and read the book.  (I'm leaving stuff out myself, but I don't want to ruin it for those who don't yet know.)  This is my favorite book in the series, and I was a bit disappointed that these details were left out.Finally, why all of a sudden were the kids not allowed to go into the restaurant and buy butterbeer (which I was really looking forward to seeing)?  And what's up with the talking voodoo heads?  For everything that was cut out, why were those put those in there?Who knows?  In any case, the core elements of the story are preserved.  The major plot is still set in motion.  It's just very shocking to see the first two films follow the books almost exactly, and then this one borders changing the story completely.  BIG RISK.  However, the movie is excellent and is a commendable addition to the ongoing movie series.(BTW, any word on when book 6 comes out?)	4.0	Great Movie!!!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1C3PGX379TV1B	"John from the East ""Juan"""	Readers: I underline in this brief article, that this third saga insults to the author, J.k. Rowling, becuase it aparts from the original story, by minuscle details, such as Bucrbear, which is hypograph, not a hybrid, due there is great difference between both of them.Another mayuscle mistake is that the Huflephuf's searcher is designed her as man and that's a big default in the Fourth Saga.Finally, one of the worst mistakes, was the ending, because it designs that the finish should have ended in the train when the litle lechuza Pigwiggeon and not with Harry in his fire's arrow.Good cinematography and worthable cast makes the rest but I guess definitively this entry was not the most inspired, pitifully.	3.0	The worst sequel of Harry Potter: a true dissappointment	2005-08-10	8	4	4

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1KA46P9TRPIX7	John	"I thought that this movie was great.  There were some things that really got under my skin.  My friend and I were, somewhat, dissapointed.Cons: They cut out some things completely.  There was only 1 quidditch match (the one with the dementors), and no quidditch went on (also they changed it where Harry was flying above the clouds WITH the dementors instead of the dementors just being on the ground... he also sees a grim in the sky instead of in the stands- like in the book.  Harry got his Firebolt at the end of the movie, witch (haha) really pissed me off.  Actually, pretty much, that was the end of the movie.  There wasn't much time where they were in the classes (I like when they are in the classes).  They basically cut out anything that didn't have to with the plot (Sirius Black).Pros: The beginning with Aunt Marge was GREAT.  Also the Knight Bus... good job there.  They did a good job with the time turner and kind of how they were curious of seeing themselves.  They definitely made Hogwarts look less Disney and more Midevial.  I also thought that the director made this movie funny.  Less serious, which sometimes is good... sometimes is bad.  I think that laughing through the movie made it more enjoyable.  Although, he did make it quite serious when big things were happening.  Hermione looked great.  :-).  The dementors did well too.  Actually I yelled ""WE LOVE HERMIONE"" and the whole theater erupted w/ laughter (that was irrelevent, but funny).Overall:  I think they should of stuck closer to the whole story and just made it an extra long movie.  I still think it was great and that you must see it.EXPECTO PATRONUS!!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1COW0UIB5HA9J	"John Lindsey ""John"""	Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy but trouble has started in the world of Muggles (non-magical folk) as he accidently inflated his Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) and runs away. He is reunited yet again with his two best friends in the whole wide world of magic known as Ron (Rupert Grin) and Hermonine (Emma Watson) but during his newest year at the school he gets a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher named Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) whom befriends him and of course there is talk about an escaped killer from Azkaban prison named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who is believed to be heir to Voldermort begins to trouble poor Harry. Not only that but also some dreaded Death-like Dementors who seek him and want his soul, but can Harry find out if Sirius Black is really the heir to Voldermort or it might be someone else.Brilliant and thrilling installment of the ever popular cinematic fantasy adventure franchise based on the beloved books by J.K. Rowlings. Mexican director Alfonso Cauron steps in place of Chris Columbus while Columbus is producer for this is the most complex and artsy of the franchise that also reunites stars Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Maggie Smith as Professor Macgarnagle, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, John Cleese as Nearly-headless Nick and introduces new characters like Emma Thompson as Professor Trealaway. The film replaces Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two movies with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore for i think he brilliantly plays the character more so then poor Harris whom was good. Here this movie gets dark and more richer even with character development and suprises in store including more wonders abound and a nifty ending, this is one of the best movies of the franchise.This blu-ray offers brilliant sound and picture quality in perfect HD as possible with great extras like trailers to all HP movies, deleted and extended scenes that were unused, interviews and featurettes.	5.0	A brilliant installment!	2009-08-05	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A5I8OWSLWM1MF	John Michael Kain	"While I wouldn't go as far to call this movie ""bad"", I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed with it. I saw this in the theater, and I recall leaving the building thinking I can't believe I spent 7.50 to see THAT!I was anxious to see how this movie would turn out because of the new director, Alfonso Cuaron. I have to say that I think he's the reason this came out so bad. Many of the camera shots just didn't fit the mood. Also, many things are different from the first movie and the book. For example, there's two sub-characters, Crab and Goyle. In the book and the first movie they're rather heavy and chunky. In this third movie one is as thin as stick. Minor things like that.There was also the new Headmaster Dumbledore, Michael Gambon. While I don't think he did as bad a job as the director, I was a bit disappointed with the change. It wasn't bad acting, but rather, difference (yet again). He talked to fast compared to comparisons with movie/book.I would suggest renting this if you are following the movie series, but if not, I wouldn't. I will, since I am a fan of Harry Potter, see the next movie, the fourth book, when it comes out. I simply hope that the director does a better job than this one."	3.0	compared to the other two: FAILURE	2005-04-17	9	2	7

I thought as a stand alone movie it was excellent. However as the series of books moves along the movies are forced to abbreviate the increasingly complex plots. I would advise all HP movie buffs to also read the books. The stories, films and characters are all maturing and I hope the pattern is able to continue at such a high level.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2DU061PO9VCPV	John Whaley	"A far darker and more mature film, The Prisoner of Azkaban is proof that the Harry Potter franchise is growing up.Based on the book of the same name, this third entry in the Harry Potter epic follows Harry during his third year at Hogwarts.  The twist this time around is that there has been an escape at the heavily guarded wizard prison of Azkaban, and the escapee is supposedly after Harry.Far more intense than previous entries, this movie is more appropriate for the preteen and older crowd.  ""Azkaban"" also showcases one of the growing problems with the franchise - the stories are becoming too long and involved for a 2 hour movie.  For those who have read the book, a great deal had to be cut and condensed to accommodate the timeframe. However, none of these issues keep ""Azkaban"" from being an excellent film.Recommended for 12-year and older fantasy and Harry Potter fans."	4.0	"The best ""Harry Potter"" yet"	2004-06-12	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQRTN5IGARSSV	John Wiley	As the movie series goes on and they have to fit more material into each movie, the writters are going to have to pick and choose what goes into each movie so that they don't end up with a four hour movie. I amsuming that's how my favorite Harry Potter book got turned into my least favorite Potter movie so far.I won't bore you with the plot because most everyone already knows the plot; either through the book or the trailers.The movie wasn't bad, I still enjoyed it, but while watching it I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. Some of this might have to do with the new director, who while a good director, takes this film down a more artsy path. Some of the shots are really nice, but they distract from what's actually happening. And then there's the shots that make no sense, like when we watch a leaf float down to the ground.Another thing that felt off was the school seemed to be a different school. There were scenes on a bridge, inside a giant clock, and in a court yard - none of these locations being seen in the first two films. And while I'm very sure that the school is big, yes, and of course there will be locations not seen in the first two films, that these locations felt so different from what we've seen they distracted. It was like a different school and the audience spent time trying to take in the surroundings that we didn't pay attention to the story.Another thing that felt too different is that most of the movie took place outside with a few scenes inside - pretty much the exact opposite of the fisrt two films. And in every single one of these outside scenes, even the ending of the movie, it was grey skies and looked like rain. I know the director was going for a 'darker look', but to not show the sun at all was a bit much for me.Finally, there is the last shot of the movie. Harry flying on his broom and then his face kind of smeers across the screen and it freezes. It's a weird image and a strange way to end the movie.Apart from all of the stuff mentioned above, the movie didn't suck. The story was good, even though certain scenes felt out of order. And there were parts from the book, parts that seemed important, that were left out of the movie. Like the fact that the four men who made Harry's map were Harry's dad, Sirius, the rat man, and the new teacher. And the very ending, when Sirius has to leave. They give a long explanation in the book to explain it, but in the movie they barley even hint at why he's leaving. It looks like Sirius decided he doesn't want to take Harry in and is leaving.I realize my review doesn't make the movie sound that great, but it really wasn't that bad. I still plan to buy it when it comes out on DVD, and I would suggest you see it. I'd still rate is a B and I'm eager for the 4th movie to come out (...). Hopefully they'll be able to fix what went wrong in this movie to finally make a 5-star Potter film.	3.0	It just felt...wrong	2004-06-06	18	10	8
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HVFBVT0X1IP1	Jonah Cohen	While still nowhere near as good as the books, Prisoner of Azkaban fared the best of the first 3 Potter books in its transition to the silver screen. It had some problems, but overall, it was enjoyable.First, the good stuff: David Thewlis was perfect as Professor Lupin. His down-on-his-luck, yet noble portrayal, with just the right air of mystery, worked beautifully, the equal of the always good Alan Rickman as Snape. Michael Gambon was also a big improvement over Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson clearly had fun as the daffy Professor Trelawney.The kids were generally well done in the way they were shown transitioning through adolescence here, and the gist of the plot - the hunt for escaped convict Sirius Black - held the right air of menace. The special fx were decent if not great. (The dementors, for example, were scary, but couldn't help but bring to mind, and suffer in comparison with, the ring wraiths from Lord of the Rings.)Moreover, what all too many reviewers fail to understand is that a book and a movie are different media for telling a story. I expect a film adaptation of a book to capture the spirit of the book, not necessarily to regurgitate every plot point and line of dialogue verbatim. The first two Potter movies faithfully repeated many (not all) of the stuff from the books, but it was stuff seemingly chosen at random. The result was that those movies felt disjointed, incoherant, and not at all like Harry Potter.Prisoner at least tries to be its own film, and as a result, it stays truer to the source, and ends up being a much better story.But there was some bad stuff: Draco Malfoy grew even more ludicrous, he was so pathetically whiny that it was hard to see him as threatening in any way. (In fairness, that's a problem that's growing in the books, too.) The actor who played Wormtail was just off - rather than craven, he came off as weaselly and silly. The complex plot of the book was hard to get across, and the movie only partly succeeds. There are definitely holes that will leave you scratching your head if you haven't read the books.The true HP fanatic will probably want to buy this movie, especially to tide you over until book 6 this summer.	3.0	Flawed, but the best of the HP movies so far	2005-03-06	6	5	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ASOL3MHAPH2WJ	Jonathan Rios	"The film's stlye is much more different than the first two. It is hard to explain. The shots are quicker there are a couple Lord of the rings shots where you go zooming over hogwarts. It feels like watching Jurassic Park 3. It's a sequal with all the same people but there is something about it that is different. Yes the story is much darker and so is the movie but at the same time it is not as dark I would say as Chamber of Secrets. When I saw Chamber in the theater I would admit I was starting to get a little afraid but in this movie I wasn'nt not for one second.Also the film is very past pace. This is one of my least favorite books because it is mostly talk. Even the ending is mostly talk. There are some good action scenes but not as hyped up as in the previous two. The movie I would say is way better than the book. The only things that I do remeber from the book are basically the only things that made it in the movie. The movie is almost thirty minutes shorter than the first two. There are a few weird changes in the film. Basically where things are. Hagrids Hut is on a sttep hill. The entrance to the Griffindor tower is placed in the area where all the stair cases are.But, the movie is very good. It is full with adventure and it is definately better than the first two. It's also extremly funny. And it's nice to see them wearing normal clothes. It's very interesting to watch and fan or not you'll get a kick out of it.I just pray that Goblet of fire comes out good. I had HUGE doubts about Alfonson Curon but he did a fantastic job on Prisoner. However Harry 4 will have another new director in the chair. Mike Newell ?

""Filmmaker"""	Don't pay attention to all the overgrown HP fanatic children who are too old to be devoted to a series of books that aren't targeted towards their age group.The Harry Potter books aren't my kind of reading, I read to learn, be challenged, be entertained and look smart so girls come on to me (that last part's a joke for those who can't sense sarcasm in print).  So since I don't have my own imagination invested in the books I'm able to accept the director's vision of how the film should look.Bottomline, it's a beautiful film with more character development than the previous two had combined.  Harry, Hermione and Ron have all grown to be quality actors who know their characters well and seem to become even more believeable with each addition to the franchise.  The look of the film is darker, the set design is more ambitious than the clausterphobic prequels, Harry Potter's world is blown up and for once we actually get to see him suffer some real psychological anguish.Can't wait for the next chapter, I only hope in the future Terry Gilliam decides to forget about the franchising and make what would probably be the best film in the series, that's just wishful thinking of course.	5.0	The Darkest and Most Entertaining HP film so far!	2004-10-07	13	9	4

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2STFQK67OZ9OC	Jon	I thought the book of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was very, very good. The movie was good too, but the movie left A LOT, I mean A LOT of the material that is in the book out! Plus, the material that is in the movie from the book is mixed around, it does not happen in the same order that it does in the book. Also, there is a lot of things in the movie, that they never even talked about in the book. At the beginning of the movie, it goes extermly fast. In the book it takes about 2 chapters to get to the knight bus, in the movie it takes about 10 minutes, if that! But besides that the movie was very good. I just thought it had a few problems. I would give the movie a 9 out of 10. Even though it left a lot of the material out it was still a very good movie. The special effects were absolutly outstanding, the demintors looked incridible, Buckbeak looked amazing, and the werewolf looked good. I read that Caron, had trouble with making the werewolf, he couldn't make it too scary. So he had to edit the look of the werewolf out. I really suggest to any who is a Harry Potter fan to see it, but if you love the book, or atleast read the book, you will be a little disapointed because of how much the new director cuts out!	5.0	Good Movie!!!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A5H8VLE7L7SB	Jose	When I heard that there was going to be a different director for the third Harry Potter movie I feared the worst. Fortunately, it was filmmaker Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n who stepped in.This guy may not be my favorite filmmaker of them all, but he sure does have a very nice sense of esthetic. Little Princess and Great Expectations are just a few examples of his work.Finally I saw the teaser and appreciated the change. Chris Columbus did it ok, but still lacked something. It is not to criticize his work, it is just a matter of deepness. Columbus paid to much attention to the innocent sensibility and adventure of his films, winning children in the process. He also forgot a little about the atmosphere of J. K. Rowling's books.In the other hand, Cuar&oacute;n is very passionate and always seeks for a deep meaning in the color, adding great lightening and texture to his films which I can see he did perfectly in Prisoner of Azkaban. That shot where you get a glimpse of the Demetor's hand proved that to me. I just loved it.I already can appreciate that Cuar&oacute;n did a more passionate and dark film with a little of child like sarcasm (Cuar&oacute;n is grate for printing emotions in young characters through his filming), so in resume my fears are gone an now I expect a great movie on June 4th.This film will be more serious than the last ones, The atmosphere will be darker and more magical than before. A lot of people are complaining of the muggle clothes. Please remember that J. K. Rowling never said that the kids have to wear their ropes all the year. In fact the conceptual art of the books places jeans beneath the ropes.In the first movie the kids wear muggle clothes when going after the Philosopher's Stone, so it is logical to think that they would use muggle clothes on weekends and visits to Hogsmadge. The ropes are still there in the Classes Scenes and the rest of the story. Cuar&oacute;n just established more movement trough the film with this change to emphasize more the time line.I also noticed a more focused principal cast (Radcliffe, Watson and Grint) seemed more professional in their movement and reactions for what I could see. Gary Oldman seems the perfect choice for Sirius Black (he can be very scary if he wants to but he can also look kind) and the details on the scenes in the teaser and the atmosphere of the frames looks a lot better.Lets just hope it works but anyway, this is a hopeful review. For the real one we have to wait until June 4th.	5.0	Great Expectations	2003-11-23	27	20	7

I am an extreme Harry Potter fan (i've read each of the books at least 3 or 4 times. The Goblet of fire: 7 times) and i believe that this movie was slightly disappointing. They left out the good parts of the movie such as the winning Quiddicth Cup Match with Slytherin, Sirius Black Breaking into the dormitory and frightening Ron, (part of this is shown on disc two), the part when Remus Lupin unfolds the story of his days at Hogwarts with Sirius, James, and Peter, the fact that Harry never found out about the relationship between his Patronus (a stag) and his father, the Maruader's Map wasn't finished telling off Severus Snape when he found it that day, and last, the movie didn't tell why Snape didn't like Harry's father.Also, a part in the movie was out of order (when Harry received the Firebolt), others said lines that didn't belong to them (when Sirius says ""the ones that love us never really leave us,"". That's Dumbledore's line), and Peter Pettigrew's description didn't match the book's description (ture it said in one of the earlier chapters that he was ""a little lump of a boy,"" but later it says that he looks like a man who lost a lot of weight in a short time, meaning that he should have been skinny.Personally, i believe that Chris Columbus should have directed this movie. Even though he did lend a hand, i think the missing parts would have been filled if he had directed it.The movie was still good, but, if you are expecting it to be just like the book, you may be a little disappointed."	4.0	Missing some things	2005-04-21	2	1	1

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Harry Potter who is now 13 years old, begins his journey after a hilarious encounter with his rather displeasing Aunt, Marge. Harry is on his way back to Hogwarts yet again but gets information on a mysterious escaped prisoner Sirius Black. We get a movie that once again delivers the thrills, suspense, laughs, and magical wonder for the eyes and the imagination. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson return as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They were all great in their respective roles. We have Robbie Coltrane returning as Hagrid, and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Great acting by each individual. Newcomers include Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore; his performance was exceptional. We also have David Thewlis as Remis Lupin; he did a really great job. Finally, we are given a brilliant performance by Gary Oldman who portrays Sirius Black. The acting never fails in these movies, Great Job.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is just a good film (and great story overall) by all means and as a movie, it gets a score of5 Stars	5.0	"""Happiness can be found in the darkest of times"""	2013-06-19	0	0	0

For people who havn't read the books, it was probably real comfusing. The movie didn't really explain how lupin knew harry's father or a lot of the other teachers and a lot of the parts in the story were moved around. I have read the books and thought the movie was kind of disappointing because they left out the really good parts that would have made it more understandable. Although Cuaron had a very good imagination for the movie and made it so realistic, it was kind of hard to understand it. I would still buy this movie though.	3.0	The movie needed more	2004-09-06	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13CXSD7PGXXXQ	Joyce P. Taepke	Yes, the movie did leave a lot out that would make things easier to understand.  That's why I won't let my preteen watch any of the movies until she reads the books (I'm funny that way.)  With a book the size of 'Prisoner', you simply have to expect a lot of changes and details to be omited.  Its a 2 1/2 hour movie, not a mini-series.  I, for one, think the screenwriters did a great job.Expect more of the same as the books aren't getting any smaller.I also like the new Dumbledore.  Yes, he was a bit of a shock the first time I saw it but he does, I feel, fit the role better.  The books describe Dumbledore as being old but with an impression of great power.  In the first book, Dumbledore is also described as a bit crazy.  No offence but Richard Harris always seemed to me to be to feeble (especially his voice.)	5.0	True to the essence of the book.	2005-01-09	10	7	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A32CP3SKPB971K	JPB	"Dear dear me so Azkaban while still a major success is not doing as well as the two Chis Columbus movies. Surprise!surprise! The public loved the first two movies so what does the Brothers Warner do but give them a re-imagined third movie. What is wrong with a sequel that actually looks like it belongs to the same universe as the previous movies? My thoughts on Azkaban the movie. Well the beginning was fine with Harry and the Dursleys and Aunt Marge. Unfortunately after that it went down hill. Here I was looking forward to seeing the Knight Bus and having streetlights jumping out of the way and then back again, what I got was one good scene when the bus squeezes between two London Double-deckers and a really stupid an unfunny talking shrunken head. What a missed opportunity. Then behold the Leaky Cauldron shows up with yet another Cuaron re-imagining, the ancient Inn has just now decided to get itself a new sign and Tom the Innkeeper looks like a victim of a very bad Wand backfiring accident. I kept on expecting him to say ""the bells the bells!"" Then we got to a good bit with the first appearance of a Dementor on the Hogwarts Express, this I did like. Oh dear then we get to Hogwarts, people have the nerve to criticize Chris Columbus for not being realistic, but see nothing wrong with Alfonso Cuaron turning Hogwarts into a dark colourless parody of itself, this is more like Durmstrang that Hogwarts. Why have the school grounds been rearranged, where did the bridge and clock tower come from? Why is Hagrid's Hut in a new location, who moved the Whomping Willow, why has the Whomping Willow been changed? What happened to the Gryffindor Tower entrance and the Fat Lady? Where did professor Flitwick go who is this small young looking guy? Even a magic school could not have changed so much in only a few months. The Hogwarts school uniforms have been re-imagined as have the Quidditch uniform. Cuaron must have thought that having the same uniform for three movies in a row would be too much for people's short attention span. Not only that but everyone has become sloppy and scruffy, no neat tidy students from an old-fashioned school for Cuaron but scruffy thugs from a nice modern school. Yes pupils even from posh schools will have their shirts hanging out and ties undone in their free time but not during classes. You lose any sense of history and any class, Hogwarts becomes Dumbwarts. I did like the DADA class and the actor who played Lupin, when I first heard of the casting I was against the actor but I have to admit he was superb. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Sir Michael Gambon the new Dumbledore, I know this is one change that was not Cuaron's fault but did they have to make him a hippy? I can't fault Buckbeak he was wonderful, one of the few movie highlights. Now we get to the modern clothing, take a good look at all the students going off to Hogsmeade. They all look completely normal, just regular teenagers visiting their regular town shopping centre, I almost expected to see some of them smoking or drinking alcohol secretly behind corners. the problem is they are not normal teenagers and they are not visiting a normal shopping centre. Previous movies had everyone dressed in cloaks, robes and other eccentric clothing when visiting Diagon Alley thus giving the movies their charm but Cuaron seems to have ignored this. Then we get to the big action scene when Harry produces his Patronus, what a let down, where is the glowing Stag attacking Dementors? What we get is an obscure stag shape and some sort of stupid energy field driving them away, awful. Then the final scene between Harry and Lupin, which failed to explain anything, no explanation of the Marauders or the reason why Harry's Patronus is a stag. Five more minutes added to a movie that was already shorter than the previous movies, Cuaron couldn't give us five more minutes. I watched the first movie 7 times at the cinema and the second 6 times with POA I could only manage 2 times. I really hope Newell is better."	2.0	Awful!	2004-10-23	42	17	25

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AU2V2ZKMZFNY6	"JR Corry ""Jenny"""	In this film, Harry begins his third year at Hogwarts. Things start out really well for him: after escaping from his horrid relatives, he reunites with his good friends and begins another awesome year of magic and mischief with his fellow wizards-in-training. He will soon find out, however, that dark forces are awakening and evil is haunting his footsteps. Sirius Black, a notorious follower of Voldemort, has shockingly escaped from Azkaban (the wizard prison). No one knows where he is, but everyone knows he has one target: Harry. Things start getting exciting as Harry and his friends take matters into their own hands (of course) despite warnings to the contrary, once again proving themselves courageous and loyal beyond their years.This film has everything a great movie should have: awesome acting, chilling special effects, great music, and gorgeous scenery. WHY are some people complaining that it's a huge disappointment because it wasn't true to the book?! I've read all the books (LOVE them as well as the movies), and, alright, I do admit there were a few details missing in the movie that were important:1) The fact that Harry's father and his friends used the nicknames Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs (found on the Marauder's Map) when they turned themselves into animals.2) The awesome scene in which Gryffindor wins the ultimate victory for the first time in years.I was really surprised that these were left out, but no one can deny the fact that the character's personalities and the magical feeling of the book were brilliantly done. I believe that both Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron did awesome jobs with their different styles. The actors say so, J.K. Rowling says so, and let's not forget that Rowling's approval is what really matters. If she thinks the movie's accurate enough, that should be the end of any complaints. The movie may not have all the details of the book, but it definetly has the heart and the spirit of it.	5.0	Yet Another HP Jewel	2004-09-18	6	3	3

Remington ""John Remington"""	"Any film that contains a gleeful choir of cherubic voices singing the witches' incantation from ""The Scottish Play"", certainly aspires to create an entertainment of storm-clouded gray hues.Such is the case with this, the third cinematic installment of J.K. Rowling's immensely lucrative literary saga of a young wizard searching for identity and belonging. Gone are the Beatlesque ""madcap shenanigans"" of the first two films. In its place is a heavy dose of sturm und drang in the form of shape shifters, banshee-like creatures, werewolves, rats and a giant black widow spider on roller skates.As Potter and his friends (Ronald and Hermione) have grown older, so has this narrative's tone. Concerning Harry's efforts to avoid certain death at the hands of an escaped rouge wizard, who may or may not have participated in his parents' murder, AZKABAN contains some pretty good jolts along with expert character turns by Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson.  The latter, in frizzy hair and Coke bottle glasses, wonderfully evokes fond memories of every eccentric, new-aged obsessed collegiate English professor who failed to realize the 1960's ended long ago.The acting, directing, camera work (I especially love this film's use of wide screened deep focus compositions) all works in harmony to produce entertainment that appeals to all ages.Like all the previous installments- forged by skillful craftsmanship with a pure heart AZKABAN possesses a strong moral center stressing understanding, love, friendship, self-sacrifice, intelligence and above all- imagination.

Love the books, loved movies number one and two.  I'm really disappointed in the third film though.  Rearrangements of locations in the film leave a slightly uncomfortable feel as they appear.  The excessive darkness of the sets does more to disorient than it does to create a sense of *presence* or tension.I understand the change in directors and, thus, direction but it went too far, not allowing the third film to blend seamlessly with the first and second.  This may seem a small matter now but it will inevitably lead to some failures in the series when they are watched together in order by those of us who are fans and decide to invite everyone over, including the grandkids, for a Harry Potter Fest.I've read and heard comments about the acting being more mature in this film.  Hmm, could that be because the actors themselves are more mature and the characters they are playing are just plain growing up?Again, I'm disappointed.  Not disappointed enough to make me abandon Harry and Company but disappointed enough that I didn't bother to see this one several times at the theater like I did the other two.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A19FPYCKEMAUGC	J. S. Francken	Whoever hired this director should be smacked hard. That was about the worst choice they could have possibly made for Director. He needlessly changed so much. Why change the whole look of the school? It was wonderfully magical in the first two movies. In this one it looked totally different, and to no purpose. The costumes also were terrible. Dumbledore looked more like a homeless person than a headmaster of Hogwarts. I realize you were working with a different actor, but you could at least stay true to the character from the book. And what was the deal with the kids' costumes? They were always wearing street clothes when the books made it clear they only wore clothes like that when they were in the Muggle world. Effects were okay, although I agree with a lot of other people that the werewolf stunk. It looked like he somehow stopped transforming half way through. Finally, the look, the tone of the film was all wrong. In the first two movies the muggle world was all gray and flat, reflecting Harry's view of that world. Then the wizard world at Hogwarts was colorful and vibrant because that was where Harry really came alive. This movie, though, has the wizard world all flat and gray and dingy. Why? To what purpose? I know the kids are growing up and becoming more adult, but Hogwarts shouldn't change. We could get a perfectly good picture of the kids growing up without changing the school from a vibrant magical world to a dreary awful place. I was horribly disappointed in this movie. Whoever hired this director for this movie must have been drunk to think he could pull it off. One final thing: the imdb trivia mentions that the fountain at the school has eagles eating snakes because it is the symbol on the Mexican flag where the director comes from. What rubbish! It is perfectly fine and appropriate for him to put imagery like that into a movie about Mexico. But this is a British film about a British school in Great Britain, for pity's sake! Get over yourself already and don't put pointless extra stuff in that doesn't fit in the story. Sheesh! Probably the only thing I enjoyed about the movie was seeing the next bit of storyline in the Harry Potter world. I hope the Director for Goblet of Fire goes back to Chris Columbus's vision of Harry Potter.	2.0	Disappointing	2004-08-30	13	6	7

Sharp	In the third installment of the Harry Potter movies, the new director Alfonso Curan moves the movies into suspense and darkness.  In Azkaban, Curan takes away the sugar coating and pushing limit on its PG rating.  The actors themselves have grown not only physically but also emotionally since the first movie.  Special effects were great except of course for the werewolf.  You would think that with such great resources to make the dementors they would be able to make a much more realistic werewolf.Some things did disappoint causing me only to give four stars.  For the avid Harry Potter reader, some essential subplots were completely removed from the movie.  Also the story was moved around.  Some disappointing acting scenes were Daniel Radcliff's emotional moments.  Hopefully he improves before the emotional Goblet of FireStill a good movie, recommend for people of all ages.  However parents I would suggest caution when viewing to small children, some scenes are a bit intense.	4.0	New Director Makes a Huge DIfference	2005-07-28	0	0	0

The characeters, almost never wore the normal attire of the prior movies, robes, instead they opted more often for street clothes, and that, I feel, really took a lot from the movie.  Also, there was a lot of changing in the setting.  Hagrids cabin's location changed, along with the forbidden forest, the Quiddich field, and to wrap it up the Griffindor common room entrance.  Which brings up another unpleasantry, the Quiddich.  One would think that since this is a very important year for Quiddich, that there would be a lot of it.  But, there is only ONE game!!!! The rest you have to just figure out for you're self!  The lighting also influenced a lot of things, making even the happy parts gloomy and dismal, and also adding some confusion.  Another complaint of mine was that the plot was too hurried.  I felt that the only way that one could understand it, was to read the books.  And still, my brothers were wondering how everything worked, and they had read books 1 and 2!!!!!!  Some people might argue that there are just too many overlaping plots to show them all... but they're WRONG!  The plot context in the movie was too fast and could have included more stuff to make the movie better.Again, I am extremely dissipointed in this movie, and hope that the next movie will shadow the first and second, not the third.	1.0	Absolutely Dissapointing!!!!!!!	2004-11-22	24	11	13

In my opinion, the first two are a little bit stiff compared to this one, though I still really like them and wouldn't change them.Cuaron took the world of Harry Potter and made it into something totally real. He did a great job. I couldn't get to sleep last night because I was so excited over this movie. I'm going to see it next Tuesday, again.Though a lot of things were different than the book, I feel that the changes were just fine, even better than in the book. And I never feel that way about book-to-movie conversions. The only complaint I have was that they didn't show the winning of the Quidditch Cup. I loved that scene in the book!The performance I was most impressed with was Daniel Radcliffe (P.S. - Marry me, Dan?) as Harry. I couldn't get over how increibly handsome he has become, and how he has grown so much as an actor. The scene after he sneaks into the Three Broomsticks and finds out how Sirius had 'betrayed' his parents, and then Ron and Hermione find him out in the snow, crying... I just wanted to fold Harry into my arms and comfort him. It's hard to keep remembering that he's only a fictional character.

I tolerate this movie because it is part of the Saga but in my opinion the director fouled up horribly. The movie is relate to the book but it skips and omits in an unbelievable fashion. The entire time thing just does not make sense. The complete overhaul of the castle is horrifying. The alteration of the movie so as to remove Quiditch entirely from the plot line is abhorrent. Please don't get me wrong - I enjoy the movie but as I said - only because its apart of the series. But in my opinion the director did not really care much about the storyline or the book.  He had an idea - he had never read the book - he altered, cut, mutilated and destroyed.  So. Thats all I have to say. Just dissapointed that this movie could have been so much more... and it wasn't.	2.0	Sad Installation To the Saga	2009-05-12	2	1	1

I acknowledge that it did not follow exactly to the plot of the book, but i still found it entertaining.  i was not angry that it did not follow the exact plot, because i can still see this as a harry potter movie.  however, this did not have a sufficeint(sp?) helping of one of the things i love about the Harry Potter books and movies.  It lacked the day to day hogwarts enviroment and flavor that JKR developed so masterfully.  that was one of my favorite things about these books and movies.  It was still a good movie, and i plan to add it to my collection.P.S.- the reveiwer a few down was correct, Dumbledore's fill in was not as wise looking as the old one.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2SH7OWE8QJYNC	Kaleidocherry	I just watched this movie for the first time yesterday.  I had reread the book prior to watching the movie, just to get back up to speed with the story.  Well, this movie is just SO sketchy compared to the book!  I realize that lots of things are cut out so we don't have a 5-hour movie, but this felt like a Cliff's Notes version.  To start, everyone except Harry and  Hermione seems reduced to a bit role.  Even Ron and Hagrid don't have more than 15 minutes of total screen time (it seems).  The Weasley twins, Hedwig, Professor Trelawney, Dumbledore, McGonagall - even the Dursley parts seem weeded out and that's saying something, since the Dursley parts are never really that large to begin with.  It feels like a story involving Harry and Hermione, with cameos by all the other people.  Professor Lupin is not really fleshed out, and there's TOO LITTLE SNAPE!  Come on, Snape is the guy we all love to hate, give him more screen time!I'm hoping the next one will involve more of the characters we have come to be interested in.	3.0	Disappointing in the story line, great in the set designs	2004-12-16	6	4	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33RO70J3JSZN8	Karen	This is my least favorite of all three movies so far. I take major issues with the fact that this is the shortest of the Harry Potter movies yet it was the longest of the three books that have been made into a movie so far.  While it was only a difference of 20 minutes, so much could have been done with those 20 minutes. I understand that is essential for certain parts of a book to be lost when it is made into a movie. I thought the first two films did an excellent job and in those first two movies everything that was taken out didn't affect the heart of the story line. However, this movie cut out plot lines that were the very crux if the whole story. It glazed over certain things so quickly that people who hadn't read the book might have felt confused or unimpressed by the story itself.  Furthermore, there were things added that didn't need to be there, when they could have just as easily kept things that were lost.	3.0	ho hum	2004-11-30	6	4	2

It seemed to have no plot to it, more like jumping from one thing to another and not explaining anything. Especially when talking about the Marauder's Map and The Grim that Harry sees. I have read the book multiple times and still all I could understand from this movie was that Sirius Black wanted to kill Harry. The ending did not explain the relationship between the makers of the Marauder's Map and Harry, or hardly anything else.	2.0	I Was Disapointed With This One	2006-07-30	4	2	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11QOTLD1VTLB2	Katie	Some people seem to be getting confused between the books and the films ... there is no way that anyone could make a Harry Potter film and include every detail from the books, the films would be hours long.. they have to try and capture the essence of the books and, on the whole, I think Cuaron did well. I loved the three kids (Dan, Rupert and Emma) .. they have grown up and matured as actors and I just hope and pray that they will continue to use them for all seven films ... if they change them then it will cause a lot more continuity problems than Hagrids hut. I can understand people complaining about the siting of Hagrids Hut and Hogwarts .. it's a bit like 'Return of the King' being shot in Australia all of a sudden ... if you are watching the movies back to back then it doesn't quite gel .. but it's only a small problem. I loved the Dementors and the Knight Bus even though they weren't quite as described and as well as the kids thought Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Tom Felton were excellent. The biggest problem I had with it was the infamous Quidditch final ... or lack of it - I really wanted to see Oliver Wood triumph .. also the scene where Professor Snape calls Hermione an insufferable know-it-all ... Ron doesn't say 'he's got a point you know' he actually gets a detention for sticking up for Hermione .. I just can't understand why that change was made ... Emma Thompson did a good job as Professor Trelawney but wasn't quite 'insect' enough for me and I missed Richard Harris's twinkle .. he was great.David Thewlis grew on me as Professor Lupin and Gary Oldman will probably go on to make an excellent Sirius Black .. though he was a little bit over the top .. it was bordering on comedy when he was yelling in the Shrieking Shack.  Overall though it's a great film and .. along with the others .. will go down as a classic in years to come and, as I've already said, if Jo Rowling gave it her thumbs up (and she works closely with the screen writer I believe) then none of us have the right to complain.	4.0	If it's good enough for JK - it should be good enough for us	2005-01-22	6	4	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AL4S6NSTO17CI	Katrina	The third Harry Potter is by far my favorite of the series. It is the first one to get the right feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world--everything finally *feels* magical. The paintings finally move like they are supposed to and the lighting makes the sets feel much more cozy. Prisoner was the first movie filmed on location in Scotland and you really notice the difference--the outdoor shots are beautiful and create the perfect mood. The new setting does create a disconnect--suddenly Hagrid's hut has moved from the lawn to the edge of a cliff which is disconcerting. Also, I am not a fan of the new Dumbledore. He seems flighty rather than wise.The major problem, however, is the plot. I didn't think the first two movies caught the spirit and feeling of the books very well, but they got enough of the basic plot points in so that the movies made sense on their own. In Prisoner, the major plot points just aren't there. The director wanted to focus on Harry's character development and inner turmoil, which is fine, except you can't forget that this is primarily a mystery story which requires careful plotting. Major plot points simply disappear. The big confrontation scene is short and leaves out key information. I love the books and have read them multiple times, so I knew what was going on. But my Dad has only watched the movies; he enjoyed the first two on their own, but was very confused by this one. It wouldn't have been hard to expand the climax scene to include the important information and to give Harry time to understand and react to it in a reasonable way. The third book was longer than the first two, but the third movie is considerably shorter than the first two. They could have added five minutes and made the movie able to stand on its own.All in all, a beautiful, magical, frustrating movie!In terms of the DVD, the special features are OK. There are some good interviews, but the layout is not very helpful. Nothing is labled or located logically.	4.0	The Best So Far, But Still Needs Help!	2004-12-24	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1LIOIWXOIASVY	Kauaijohn	"The screenplay was excellent.  Sure, parts were trimmed, but that's what has to be done to bring most books to the silver screen.  The thing that struck me as most irksome about the movie was... well... THE MOVIE.  It had the look of typical British television.  It didn't have the aura of magic and mystery that was so evident in the first two movies.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban looked like it was shot on video tape instead of 35mm filmstock.Another rather unsettling aspect of the film was the director's disregard for what had been established in the first two films.  The ""exterior shots"" were so completely different from those of the previous films as to be distracting.  What purpose could he possibly have had for relocating Hagrid's hut to the bottom of some big hill?  Fans of HP 1 & 2 could walk to Hagrid's blindfolded: straight through the archway, down the path across the grounds to the edge of the Dark Forrest.  And WHAT was up with that lame excuse for the Dark Forrest???  My back yard is creepier than that sad location he used.  I kept expecting to see Hobbits wandering around in there!When I saw the first Harry Potter movie, I was amazed at how much the film looked like the pictures I had formed in my head while reading the books.  This time, the director got it all wrong.  Like I said earlier, it looked like British television instead of the magical fantasyland we've come to expect.  What if George Lucas had suddenly stopped using the Millenium Falcon that we've all come to know so well, and started using the old LOST IN SPACE flying saucer ship instead?  Yuck!So, 3 stars for an excellent screenplay that was poorly handled by a new director.  Hopefully, Chris Columbus will be back for Goblet of Fire.

And as for following the book, I think it follows close enough to enjoy the movie.The only part that didn't follow the book was the the end witch belonged in the middle.

However, it is much darker and more adult/teen-themed with more scary images than the first two movies, and it seems that they're laying a lot ground work for (hopefully) many movies to come. They definitely delve deeper into the world of Harry Potter, with more areas at the school (and really the whole Harry Potter world) fleshed out with more detail and interaction. The special effects are much better than the last two but (my only real criticism) seem to be heavily influenced by the LotR movies.For those of you who feel that the other movies were too kiddie, then definitely check out this movie. For those of you bringing very young children, know that this version is much scarier with a teenage target audience.	4.0	Not a reader, but a fan none-the-less	2004-06-07	0	0	0

The director is certainly a more ""artsy"" director than the previous director (Chris Columbus) and his liberal thinking is evident in the making of this film. The scenery is beautiful and the art director did a wonderful job of creating the majestic Hogwarts that is described in the books. Because it differs from the other movies, many reviewers seem to forget the Hogwarts from the books. There are many cases of dramatic license in the film but I think it gives more visual interest to the story.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3Q2YKQZ32TI5H	"Kelly Thompson ""geek"""	For starters, TPoA is my favorite book of the series so far and I was highly looking forward to seeing its movie adaptation.  I loved the new feeling Cuaron brought to the story itself. Don't get me wrong, Columbus did a good job with the first two movies, but I like Cuaron's style much better. It's darker.  It has a little more edge to it.  We are seeing Potter grow up in front of our eyes and we know that his journey is only going to get darker before the inevitable confrontation with He Who Must Not Be Named.One of the only problems I had with this movie is the fact that I felt Cuaron could have focused a little more attention on the Marauder's Map and it's creators, plus, I felt a little more time could have been spent explaining the animagus (and the fact that Harry's dad was one too).  I might get stoned for saying this, but I'm glad quidditch wasn't a major focus area with this movie.  Plus, I loved how the characters evolved not only with the book, but also in the movie.  Was I the only one who applauded when Hermione punched Draco?  Come on, we all know he had it coming! I love Remus Lupin and Sirius Black (RIP) and thought the performances by David Thewlis and Gary Oldman did their characters justice.Overall, I'm satisfied with Cauron's vision with this movie, but the only disappointment I had was that it brought up important points which weren't explained enough for the sake of leaving the movie under three hours. I don't know about you guys, but I could have also seen a few more Fred and George Weasley scenes. Those guys always put a smile on my face.	4.0	Something Wicked This Way Comes	2004-06-22	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HG5MY4YOY7N2	Kelvin H.	"When I heard Alfonso Cuaron would supercede Chris Columbus as the next director for ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" since Columbus decided to step down in spite of putting J.K. Rowling's books into successful and luscious films, I thought it as an odd pair and a match made in cinematic heaven. This would not be Cuaron's first time in helming an adaptation of children's literature having already ""The Little Princess"" under his belt, so that wasn't the oddity of their situation. Cuaron is a serious filmmaker and nothing matters more to him than art. There is no art if there is no freedom and ""Harry Potter"" is limited in leeway considering that a world has already been blueprinted and it should not be tampered and manipulated. Plus, art is not really a necessity for this franchise because entertainment is its main result.Then my ambiguous self believes Cuaron is very suitable in telling the story of a kid coming into age. Although I deem it more appropriate that Cuaron direct ""The Goblet of Fire"" or ""The Order of the Phoenix"" instead of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" because thirteen is still an age that is a bit too immature under Cuaron's direction. Nonetheless, Cuaron is the perfect guy to tell a story of two guys and a girl growing up through something that not even powerful wizards can prevent; puberty. Having already made a movie about two other guys and a girl exploring their sexual appetites in the more explicit ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" Cuaron is the man to add growth to these characters and mature a franchise that is getting darker.I will not flat out say that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is better than the first two films. It certainly is more artistic, mature, and thought provoking but it is not as entertaining. Yet, with a prior knowledge of Harry's future from the books you being to realize that this chapter is the threshold between child's play and something foreboding. The series is heading to a grimmer reality and Cuaron was the perfect director to cross that threshold. (...)"	5.0	Not even puberty can stop them.	2004-06-18	5	3	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AKRDBHFQG8SHE	"Kevin Dreier ""KDre"""	The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed my favorite novel in the series thus far, and I was very excited about the movie. However, to my dismay, it was a poor representation of the book, in all of its glory. The scenes were choppy, many important aspects of the story were removed, like many of the quidditch matches, for example. The time and place in which Harry receives the Firebolt is a horrible misrepresentation of the sequence of events in the novel, and the movie fails to explain Harry's success in the quidditch tournament without the Firebolt. Furthermore, there are instances where this movie is not even true to the direction of the first and second movies! Unless, through some supernatural force, the landscape of Warthog's grounds can change its formation, then I see no resonable explanation for the appearance of the grounds. The Whomping Willow appeared atop a hilly cliff, whereas, in the Chamber of Secrets, it is upon a flat courtyard just outside the castle. Furthermore, the journey from the castle doors to Hagrid's cabin appears much steeper than it has before.On a final note, and with no offense to Michael Gambon, I do not feel that Gambon portrayed Dumbledore accurately and with the same calm fierceness that Richard Harris brought to the character. Gambon's Dumbledore appeared shifty, and somewhat insolent. The movie did not touch upon Dumbledore's most important interactions with Harry, the ones where it counted, and I was disappointed by this. Overall, I would have enjoyed the movie much more, if I had not read the novel first. But, since this is not the case, I cannot say that I am pleased with the movie's turnout.	3.0	Good movie, but poor adaptation of the book	2004-10-25	15	9	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2V5FC4F1O50IO	Kevin M Gibes	"If you're like me and are ignoring the reviews for this product that complain about it not containing the extended version because that doesn't bother you, please read the following. The main reason I wanted this DVD was to add to my growing collection of HP Ultimate Editions to make for a very nice, orderly, congruent display on my shelf. The first two movies were released quite nicely; the book-like DVD case was wrapped in a vertical slip cover. Simple, effective. Here's how this release screwed up:- Lenticular cover. Looks nice I guess, but it's ultimately pointless and it makes the first two releases (which don't have one) stand out. Also, it's extremely difficult to remove the lenticular picture. I admit that you'd probably wouldn't want to (there's nothing behind it! Not even a normal cover), but it's not glued in place so it almost looks like they thought you might want to. How is it held in? Read on.- Lenticular cover is held in by corner flaps that, if you're not careful, will probably be caught on other DVDs as you slide them onto the shelf next to it. Corner flaps are the ""3"" and dragon seen on the cover as well as the ""Ultimate Edition"" title on the adjacent corner. There is NO way this can stay mint unless you're EXTREMELY careful.- Horizontal slip cover. Technically a flimsy cardboard slip cover isn't ideal in any case, but if it's vertical it's a bit easier to be careful. Horizontal (which is, admittedly, how most box sets are done-- for example, if you have the 2004 Original Trilogy Star Wars DVDs box set, it's the same thing there), because of the way it needs to be folded to construct the box, leaves a tab of cardboard on the inside, pointing toward where you insert the DVD. If you're not careful it can catch, and start degrading your already very flimsy set up that you're trying to keep nice looking. I had to tape mine down which I was only okay with because it's in the inside. But I really shouldn't have to.- Security tab stuck HALFWAY UNDER one end of the aforementioned cardboard tab, jutting out one end of it making it almost guaranteed to catch the DVD and get bent. I know Amazon probably orders these from the same place any other store does, but really? Security tags? It wasn't impossible to remove but it did take some work as it was stuck on pretty good. Real pain in butt.- This box set is TALLER than the previous two! Not by much, it's certainly noticeable. It's possible it's because of the horizontal slip cover design (at least two bits of cardboard on the top and bottom that aren't there on the previous two releases), but it's still inexcusable. Part of the reason collectors like sets like these is because it makes movie collections look like one complete saga rather than a mindless cash grab. How much each of these sets look like part of one complete series will make or break them in collectors' eyes.- The flap on the book-like DVD cover is no longer magnetic like the previous two releases. Not that big of a deal, but it was kind of nice to have that.If you are like me, you'll probably want this set anyway because just having the first two years just doesn't cut it (and if you're REALLY like me, year 3 is your favorite HP movie so it'll be even harder to avoid). Just know what you're getting into. Movie studios don't have much of an incentive to make a set that will last a long time and be completely perfect because then they won't have a reason to sell you more copies of it later. Hopefully, if there's a box set that includes every movie in the future, it will be better than this and hopefully include all of the one hour documentaries that each of these releases have (another reason I'm buying these). But for now, this isn't the ""Ultimate Edition"" by any definition.One final note: This set and the Year 4 set was released last year (2010), but I bought it recently. If I recall correctly, when I saw Year 3 and Year 4 in stores they didn't have that lenticular cover, but I notice the Year 5 and Year 6 DVDs do. This might be a new thing they're doing for 2011, and if they are still making the previous releases, they might have retroactively added those covers. If so, it might be worth your time to carefully research which version you're buying (and perhaps go back and get newer versions of Year 1 and Year 2 if they exist). That is if you value a matching set more than decently constructed DVD cases, though. Just a thought."	1.0	This review is for collectors who like their collections mint and orderly	2011-07-25	4	4	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"The latest entry into the ""Potter"" saga is one with a few changes.  First of all, Chris Columbus is not onboard as the director.  Instead, we are given Alfonso Cuaron.  He seems to have given a darker edge to the series that wasn't present in the first two films.  However, I haven't read this book yet, and that might be exactly what happens to the atmosphere at Hogwarts.  The second major change is that Harry and the rest of the kids have grown into young adults.  The final major change that is noticeable is that Michael Gambon has replaced the deceased Richard Harris as Dumbledore.  He does nothing to damage the original portrayal of the character.  In fact, he puts his own twist on the role that makes the viewer accept this new Dumbledore rather easily.  Other changes include the atmosphere and look of Hogwarts, but as with Gambon, the changes are easily accepted.It's nice to see all of the original cast returning from the other films.  That is a great feat these days.  As expected, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy, and the rest of the gang have aged somewhat.  Their acting skills have gotten better as well.  David Thewlis enters the fray as Professor Lupen.  He is a fine addition to the cast.  Sirius Black is played by the always enjoyable Gary Oldman.  Emma Thompson takes a wonderful, albeit freakish, turn as the divination professor.The story is rather engaging.  Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is seeking out Harry in order to complete a deception he started against Harry's parents.  The story unfolds at a good pace, much better than the other films.  The plot gets rather confusing at one point for those of us who haven't read the book, but be patient, the payoff is well worth it.The special effects are wondrous in this film.  Harry's flying scene with Buckbeak is breathtaking, as it soaks up the countryside where the film is shot.  There are werewolves, shapeshifters, the signature floating candles in the Great Hall and, of course, those wonderful paintings throughout the school.  Dawn French is quite colorful in her brief appearance as the Fat Lady, who appears in one of the paintings and witnesses a terrible thing.The DVD is loaded with extras.  You can tour Lupen's schoolroom, tour a candy shop, test your visual skills, and chase Scabbers.  There are a number of other games and documentaries to watch, but they are too numerous to list here.  One of the best features, in my opinion, are the interviews with the cast and crew.  It was a treat watching the youngsters from the film talk about their experiences from being a part of the movies.  It was also fun to watch the older cast, including the new additions such as Gambon, Oldman, and Thewlis.Overall, this film is probably a little bit too scary for some of the younger children in the audience, but I'd say that anybody over the age of six will have no problem with the scares that appear in the movie.  There are a couple of coarse words early in the film, but the language is kept at a decent level for the rest of the film.  In fact, Ron's token saying, ""Bloody Hell,"" is about as rough as it gets once Harry makes it to Hogwarts.  The film appeals to all ages, fulfilling the fantasies of youngsters and reminding adults that the imagination is such a wonderful thing when used properly.  I highly recommend this to families who aren't put off by the whole ""magical"" aspect of Harry and to those who love great, imaginative adventure."	4.0	New Director, But Harry Doesn't Skip A Beat	2004-11-24	4	3	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AU1XXY2S6FZQ2	K	I jumped on the Harry Potter band wagon last fall, having never seen the first or second movie nor read any of the books. Within 8 months, I have read the books three times and seen the first two movies so many times I can't even count. I went to the 12:01 am showing of PoA on opening day just because I love this series so much.This movie is completely different than the first two, completely non-traditional. It doesn't follow the book as religiously as the other movies and at first I wasn't sure if I liked that. Having seen it a second time, I can say that is was a wonderful way of showing the growth of the characters by using the different directing style and taking the essence/spirit of the book versus word-for-word.I saw this movie with a friend who had never read nor seen Harry Potter and expected her to have all sorts of questions afterwards about who people were and how things work. But, even in the third film, they manage to give enough background that she was able to understand what was going on without having to be told about it. This movie is great as a standalone and fantastic as part of the series.There were only a couple of disappointments. I was extremely irritated that they didn't describe the history behind the Maurader's Map and I wasn't happy with the lack of Quidditch. I have heard rumors that they will be explaining the Map in Goblet of Fire, so maybe that's not a negative.I love how the 3 main actors have grown into their characters; I hope that they continue using the same actors for every future movie. And who says that they're aging too quickly? Anyone ever see Beverly Hills 90210 where 30 year-olds played High Schoolers for 5 years.I also loved the darkness that the director has incorporated into the movie. Instead of using the gold tones of Christopher Columbus, Alfonso Curon uses black and to great effect. It is reminiscent of Tim Burton and makes me wish that he would direct a future movie.Besides being another great Harry Potter installment, this movie is also great all by itself. I can't wait for the DVD and I think this may be my favorite one, yet. I guess I'll have to go and see it again to make sure....	5.0	Great Addition	2004-07-15	50	40	10

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3OP9DFE2R91IJ	Killinmesmalls	When I first watched PoA in the theatres, I, like so many others, was disappointed that it was not as faithful to the book as the first two. However, after watching it a dozen more times, I was able to appreciate how truly artistic Cuaron's interpretation was of Rowling's world. After viewing the interviews that came with the DVD, I realized that many of the things they were doing was with the knowledge and consent of Jo Rowling herself. Having worked in the entertainement industry myself, I know that book to script adaptation is more difficult than one would think. Additionally, production scheduling, scouting, casting, etc., is not exactly a cakewalk. PoA is a very involved story and very complicated to adapt to a script. I think Cuaron did what most directors do and created his own vision. Whether or not die-hard fans agree with his vision is a moot argument as the film is already done. Now we shall wait anxiously for the release of the next one. Of course, Cuaron did get a little happy with fader switch....	4.0	Not as disappointed as I thought I would be	2004-11-28	3	3	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A356TJCTCLDN89	Kimberley Wilson	"I just got back from seeing Prisoner of Azkaban and I have to admit one thing: I was wrong about Chris Columbus. When I heard that he was directing the first two Potter movies my thought was ""Oh no,not that hack!"" Having seen Azkaban I have say that the ""hack"" did pretty darn good by the source material.The new director Alfonso Cuaron does a number of stylistic things but they don't add anything to the movie. Hogwarts has gotten a complete and unexplained makeover. It's like the whole castle moved to an entirely different location. The dear old place looks a bit on the grimy side and not only has Hagrid's home moved to what looks about a mile from the school but the Whomping Willow seems to be able to walk because it's certainly not in the same place it used to be either.  The wizard world seems to have discovered Wal-mart because they're wearing ordinary muggle clothes now the neighboring village no longer looks like a place young wizards should be visiting alone.Oh, am I the only one who couldn't figure out what happend to Draco Malfoy? His character turned into a complete weakling. Draco is a mean little brat and a coward at heart but he's still a Malfoy and has the potential to do real harm. You completely don't get that in this movie.Now for the good parts: the Hipogriffe is the most amazing piece of CGI I've seen this year. This beast seems truly alive and looks exactly as I picture him from the book. The werewolf was extremely well done too. This creature didn't look like a guy in a wolf suit, it was a werewolf come to life in all its horror.The actors playing the professors and Hagrid are all wonderful.Michael Gambon is not quite Dumbledore--he's darn close but I could've done without the ponytail. However, he takes up where Richard Harris had to leave off and does no harm to the character.Gary Oldman doesn't look like what I pictured Sirious Black to be but he captures the suffering and terrible grief that has been Black's life for all these years.The actor who played Prof. Lupin did a terrific job.The kids were all just fine but someone had better get a drama coach for Daniel Radcliffe. He was able to slide this time but in the next movie he will be called upon to show serious emotion and that's not something he excells at right now.So, ultimately was this the best Harry Potter ever? No, I don't think so. There was a point where the movie dragged and oddly enough some of the magic and beauty of the first two movies was missing.Would I see it again? Sure, it's a Harry Potter movie and even with flaws it's almost golden."	4.0	Mostly good stuff	2004-06-17	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A194DN9Z7VYXS1	Kimberly	Well, it made me sad to see so many people dissing on poor Alfonso Cuaron, so I thought I'd try to lighten up the situation a little bit.I honestly like Prisoner of Azkaban more than the first two movies.  I know, time to dodge the tomatoes right?  But let's be serious.  When any book becomes a movie, you have to anticipate that things won't be able to translate perfectly and communicating the same story in a 2-3 hour time limit is rather difficult.  Just look at Lord of the Rings.  They failed to mention a character entirely for the sake that Arwen could rescue Frodo in the first movie, but I rarely hear anyone having fits over that.I think Alfonso took what he needed, the essence of the Harry Potter book, and made that into a fun and exciting movie for the kids that love the books.What's more, Alfonso created a whole new world for Hogwarts. The artistic qualities of the sets and cinematography are something the first two directors failed to really create.The only people I hear talking about how horrible the movie was is the older fans, and lets face it, the movies are created with a younger audience in mind, and obviously they're still happy as ever with the third installment.So if you are a Harry Potter fan or parent of said fan, while the movie is not the same as the book word for word and scene for scene, Prisoner of Azkaban is still a great choice.	4.0	Tough Crowd These Days	2004-10-11	14	8	6

It is too bad that Christopher Columbus could not do all of the movies! I know it must be hard to compress the whole book with so much vivid detail into a 2 1/2- 3 hour movie, but there was soo much missing that was important and too much nonsense (chasing his monster book under his bed, eating candy...) and he even changed the landscape of Hogwart's going to Hagrid's cabin.

The cast was great, as usual. And I loved they portrayal of Sirius and Lupin. But it was missing things.The movie skipped so many important details. The fight between Hermione and Ron, the authors of the Marauder's Map, Harry's head floating in Hogsmeade, how they discussed how Sirius was ""related"" to Harry (He was his godfather. Discussion took place in Hogsmeade), and more. I was with my cousin who never read the book and she kept asking me what was going on. Also, many things were out of place. The firebolt being received at the end of the movie? That's part of what feeds the fight between Ron and Hermione. Proffessor Trelawny's prediction? That was supposed to be somewhat near the end, along with Dumbledore's explaination of it. Also, the set was different. I was confused at first. I didn't know what was going on because it was different. I liked how the castle looked in this one, but the layout was better in the last 2.All in all, the movie was good, but needed more to it.

Talha ""Weird Gurl"""	"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third, and in my view, the best Harry Potter film yet. With a new director at the helm of the series, this is both the scariest and funniest Harry Potter film. Not content to churn out a mediocre sequel in a well-established franchise (which very easily could have happened - just ask George Lucas), we have been treated to a film which pays as much attention to the characters and plot, as it does to its awesome sound and visual effects. ""Something wicked this way comes"".As with its predecessors, The Prisoner of Azkaban is based on the Harry Potter children's fantasy book by J.K.Rowling. I personally think that both the Harry Potter books and movies have been exceptionally successful. For example, it is estimated that there are over 20 million Harry Potter books in print, in 40 languages. Furthermore, all three Harry Potter films sit comfortably in the Top 40 list of the Top Box Office films of all-time.With The Prisoner of Azkaban, Steve Kloves returns as the screenwriter, adapting Rowling's work. Kloves understandably dispenses with a few of the book's subplots and rather focusses on the action, suspense, and mystery elements of the books. Film, after all, is a visual medium, and while The Prisoner of Azkaban is the least faithful adaptation of the three, it is easily the best. Kloves has chosen to focus on the themes and characters of the book, rather than just the events of the book.With Chris Columbus' departure, and with Mexican, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n climbing into the director's chair, it would have been easy for Cuar&oacute;n to take a safer path, and churn out a mediocre sequel in a well-established franchise. Cuar&oacute;n, best known for his sexy, R-Rated, threesome road-movie, Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, steps out on his own, however, and provides a much darker and grittier film. Consider for example, Cuar&oacute;n's presentation of Hogwarts School, and its aging, creaking, and creepy buildings, compared to Columbus' vision. Cuar&oacute;n has an impressive visual style, and yet he directs with subtly when required.Interestingly, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire began filming in March this year, with Kloves returning as the screenwriter, and Mike Newell taking over the directing reigns. Newell is best known for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Mona Lisa Smile.As for the plot of The Prisoner of Azkaban: Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and the students of Hogwarts are horrified to hear that the infamous murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldham), has managed to escape from the formidable Azkaban Prison for Wizards and Witches. Guarded by the fear-inducing Dementors, no one has ever previously managed to escape from the prison. Black is implicated in the murder of Harry's parents, and he also holds Harry responsible for the death of his evil Master. Many believe that the truly awful Black is intent on killing our young Harry.While on the surface, The Prisoner of Azkaban is about the devilish Black's hunt for Harry, Kloves' well-written script, under Cuar&oacute;n's direction, allows the film to explore the book's themes of growth, maturity, and teenage angst. The film never forgets how crap it can be to be a teenager at times."	5.0	The best Harry Potter movie (so far!)	2005-01-31	1	1	0

He joins best friends and fellow third-years Ron and Hermione at Hogwarts School, but there is danger in the air:  A prisoner has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is believed to be after Harry!The three lead actors are growing up and have become quite comfortable in their roles.  They are the heart of the movie and are a pleasure to watch. Three well-known character actors join the cast:  David Thewlis is the tortured Professor Lupin, Gary Oldman is the mysterious Prisoner, and Emma Thompson is the eccentric Professor Trelawny.  Each is wonderful and adds depth to the film.The world of Hogwarts is photographed mainly in sepia tones that fit perfectly with the intense and brooding tone of the movie.  Fans of the book will find many plot details have been omitted due to time constraints, but the core story of Harry growing up is strong and rich.  There are many funny moments, some poignant ones, and some that will give you a start, although there is nothing really scary.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	The third Harry Potter movie The Prisoner of Azkaban goes darker in tone and still retains that magical touch that made Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets box office gold despite the absence of Chris Columbus. At first what would seem like an unlikely choice, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n brings a hitherto unseen depth to the third movie, and ultimately makes this more satisfying than Chamber of Secrets. Despite not really knowing everything about the back story (I only saw the first movies on a whim and read only one of the books) I really thought that Azkaban was the best of the three. Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and David Thewlis are fantastic in their respective roles, and while Daniel Radcliffe may be getting a little old for the role of Potter, he gives a more subtle, tempered performance this time round. The story provides for some great excitement, especially whenever the Dementors are on screen. Which brings us to ILM's fantastic SFX. Whereas Philosopher's Stone had some second-rate effects, all the creases have been ironed out to provide some stunning effects, particularly Harry's Hippogrif ride and the Quidditch match. John Williams outdoes himself, with a soaring, majestic score that encapsulates the spirit of the movie. For someone who will always be a LOTR fan, I really enjoyed this movie. Harry Potter is great entertainment for all ages. The DVD has great extras, including deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew, featurettes on the making of the film, trailers and DVD-ROM material. A great movie and an impressive digital package. Highly Recommended.	5.0	One of my favourite movies	2005-06-21	3	1	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1KIJ81QE9IDH0	K. Sherlach	"An engaging film, the third harry potter movie does the best job of introducing new fans to the magical world of harry potter. It has to, for time, cut out some of the better parts of the story (such as the fact that harry's father and his friends were animagi and ""moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs"" and the reason for snape's hatred of james and harry potter).  despite these omissions, the film does a better job of showing the humanity of harry and of enhancing the darker nature of this film.  As someone who did not originally read the books, this film actually interested me enough to find and read all of the harry potter books and beome a fan myself."	4.0	A good intro to Harry Potter stories	2006-02-27	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3R7OWJCW7CGCJ	"K. Siegfried ""Oddperson"""	The third book was my absolute favorite in the series, as an adult fan of the series and an English major. However the movie disappointed me on several levels. First, they should have explained the mauraders map, wihtout an explanation it seems like a large an dumb coincidence that they happen to find a werewolf and two unregistered animagi in the book. On top of that, without the exlanation, Harry's Patronus appearing as a stag is random. Second, while the casting for everyone in previous movies was perfect, I didn't like the actor chosen for Lupin, (I had reservations about Black's actor not looking right, but those were overshadowed by his amazing acting skills) I found the actor playing Lupin to be weak, and somewhat dorky (for lack of a better word) I really don't understand the tweed suit they put him in either. I really hope the cut scenes clear up some of the problems.Besides these problems, the previous cast preforms well as always, and the three teens have grown well in their roles. The graphics for Buckbeak and the dementers was very good. The movie is worth seeing, I just hoped they'd do better.	3.0	Best book, movie could be better.	2004-08-21	15	7	8
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZK9NAQHMNYNX	K.S. Puckett	I don't like the moments of super-Hermione throughout (and the way she throws Harry under Whomping Willow scene defies laws of science--one handed, without his shirt ripping off). Leaving out the Marauders doesn't bother me much, but I would have liked to have the significance of Prongs at least left in. And the CGI werewolf is an eyesore).However, I love Harry's (and Dan's) quiet maturity (and messy hair, ha). I also thought the look, pacing, and transitions of the movie were great; and unlike other people's complaints, I find the ending quite fitting. Prisoner of Azkaban is the Harry Potter DVD I've watched most often.	4.0	More Like a 4.5, But Is Still My Favorite...	2010-09-29	3	1	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUZ460FTPQRNQ	"ladycplum ""Severe Rickmaniac"""	"Maybe I feel that way because this was the first time I had read a Potter book before actually seeing the movie, but I feel it strayed a bit too far from the written material.First & foremost, WHY has the character of Ronald Weasley been reduced to comic relief?? Rupert Grint seems to be growing quite well as an actor, yet he was hardly given anything to do in this movie other than make funny faces & spout one-liners from time to time.Some of the dialogue was so outright BAD it's almost laughable. That whole ""Like trying to catch smoke"" (or whatever) line given by the quite bad child actor for instance. The scene where Harry's crying after finding out about Sirius ""betraying"" his parents was just as bad. Daniel Radcliffe should NOT fake crying again, he sounded like a squeaking mouse. Also, Draco calling Hermione a mudblood again....we know he's a bad guy, no need to rehash stuff that wasn't even in the book.I also have to express my disappointment in Emma Watson....she's just not a good actress. Ever since the first movie I felt almost everyone else stood head & shoulders above her. Her delivery can get a bit monotone at times, or she can over act to extremes (Yelling at Lupin about being a werewolf, for instance). It seems like she hasn't been able to find the right balance to her acting. One can only hope she tries a bit harder in the next film.And WHY wasn't the scene where Snape went completely bananas over Black escaping put into the movie???? Do the filmmakers realize how enjoyable it would've been to see this ice-cold, fairly non-emotional character pitch the mother of all temper tantrums?Then there's the absolute biggest mistake-leaving out the origins of the Marauder's Map and the backstory of the friendship between the Marauders while at Hogwarts. That piece of information isn't just something you can toss aside and think nobody will notice, it's critical to the storyline! For instance, Lupin obviously knew the it was the map he took from Harry when he got caught by Snape. So why didn't he ask Lupin how he knew it was a map & knew how to work it? Leaving out what was a HUGE reveal in the book took much of the heart away from the film.On the DVD there's an interview w/JK Rowling & Alfonso Cuaron in which she says she believes the book and the director were made for each other this time out. With all due respect, I have to disagree completely. POA was a huge step backwards from the first two films. One can only hope that if GOF is indeed the last movie that gets made, it'll leave a better taste behind than this mess."	2.0	Bit of a disappointment......	2005-05-04	7	2	5

Why? Because I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter book series,and I was ashamed at the mess that had been made of the first two films. Primarily my concern was that the three main childactors couldn't act, thus I was hoping for some sort of change.And I got it. Cuaron brought a new dark element to the film which hadn't been seen in the previous two films. Plus there's nodoubt that the three 'child' actors have grown up; mentally, physically and in acting talent! Add this to an already good cast(Oldman made a superb Black, and Rickman was amazing as ever), this was a film well worth seeing.My onw personal complaint was how there were some plot-holes which I noticed (perhaps because I know the books pretty damn well!)For fear of spoiling  I won't mention them, but suffice to say there were one or two major facts which took this review down froma five-star film to a four star.A good film nevertheless	4.0	Good...but no book	2004-06-07	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A29U31KK4WZXVP	"Lauren E. Bode ""Doryphorus"""	The latest edition to the Harry Potter movie series has been the most view-worthy. Alfonso Cuaron brings an elegant artistry to the third film that Chris Columbus was sadly lacking in the first two. The cinematography is interesting, the acting remarably convincing, and the score positively exhilerating. Truly, this film surpassed all my expectations. Some complain that the movie left too much out, but frankly thats ridiculous. Cuaron captured the spirit of the book with incredible dexterity, and I may point out that while Columbus remained technically faithful, the overall energy of the book was lost. I highly recommend this movie to the average muggle but especially to devoted Harry Potter fans.	4.0	From a pleasantly surprised reader-	2004-10-27	6	5	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AFJXR8WK7QZG7	Lauren Edwards	Those three words describe this movie to the T. I was amazed by the genius that went into the making this movie. The change in directors definitely made the movie more enjoyable for older audience but a bit hard to understand for the kiddies.There is a good an bad side to this new directing. The Pro: It will appeal to a large amount of teen/adult audiences, instead of kids. When I went to see the movie there were groups of adults going to see it and barely any children at all. The Con: Younger people will have a hard time appreciating the maturity of the film. And if you're someone who has either not read the book or is seeing an Harry Potter film for the first time, forget it. You will be lost.There was an artsy flare to this film, instead of the very Hollywood feel of the first too. I would like to see the reminding Harry Potter movies like this one.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A9GZMHBMH14JW	"Lauren@thesnitch.co.uk ""Lauren"""	Cuaron was following in Chris Columbus' footsteps by choosing to do the 3rd movie.  I loved the movie a bunch and can't wait to watch it again.  I would have to say my favorite part of the movie was when Hermione punched Malfoy.  That was, as Ron would say, brilliant.I think there could have been a few things changed that would have made the people who saw it in theatres to go buy it imediately when it came out.  If Cuaron had followed the book a little better all the really big Harry Potter fans, like me, would not have been upset that Harry got the firebolt at the end of the year instead of at Christmas.  I also think that if Cuaron had shown a little more quidditch people would have been happier.  The problem with adding in more quidditch, is that it makes the movie longer.  The problem with making a movie longer is that it costs more money.  That is what they are struggling with right now with the filming of Goblet of Fire.Goblet of Fire is a 700 page book.  Prisoner of Azkaban was only like 300 pages, yet the movies are goign to be right about the same length.  The new director, Mike Newell, is taking out tons of stuff that was in the Goblet of Fire book.  The movie that probably should be at least 3 hours is only going to be 2 hours and 30 min.  They just don't have the time to put some of the other stuff in.  That is the problem I think they had with Prisoner of Azkaban.  They just ran out of time filming so they went out of order.  You can never be too certain though.  I just wish that the directors of the future Harry Potter movies can find a way to include 90% of the important stuff from the books.	4.0	I think Cuaron did well.	2004-11-25	2	2	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	All I remembered about J.K. Rowling's novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; when I watched the movie was who Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was in the Harry Potter world.  Of course, it is hard not to remember that given the climax of the fifth book.  But it is actually the fourth book that comes to mind because that was the novel where Rowling warned that things start to got significantly darker for our hero and it is clear that director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has already sent the series off in that direction.  Part of the look is visual, with Michael Seresin's cinematography given the old Hogwarts a new look, but there is also the fact that this is the shortest Harry Potter movie to date although each novel has been longer than its predecessors.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves has streamlined the story so that the focus is on Harry dealing with the truth about how his parents were betrayed by a friend and sent to their deaths.There are not too many series were the main characters are children played by actors who are growing up as well (the norm is to just forget about the kids in the sequels, like they did in the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series), which also us a sense of how things look different.  On the way back to his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that Black has escaped from the infamous wizard's prison at Azkaban and that the vile Dementors, the scariest things we have seen to date, who guard the prison are now watching the gates of the school because Harry is his target.  The &quot;why&quot; is even worse for Harry than the idea that there is once again somebody out there trying to kill him.Of course there is a new teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), who appears to like Harry; but you never can trust anybody in that particular post.  The kids are also taking Divinations, which introduces them to Professor Sybil Trelawney (scene stealing Emma Thompson) and their friend Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) will actually be teaching the Care of Magical Creatures class.  Those two are in on the primary action this time around, which leaves precious little time for Profesor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) to do anything, although as always we treasure every moment with Professor Snape (Alan Rickamn slowly milking the role of a lifetime for everything it is worth).The best part of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is that in the climax (or should I say climaxes) right by Harry's side is Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), making sure there is one person who is up to speed on what is happening (at least as much as is possible given the massive plot complications in this one).  Harry might have the raw talent, but Hermione has the smarts and this time she has ample opportunity to use them.  There is no reason at this point to consider replacing any of the actors in the cast, young or old, except for the cold hard reality that has Michael Gambon now playing Albus Dumbledore.  If it is all fixed, don't break it.But above all this one comes back to Rowlings, her story, and her characters.  Learning magic is not easy and Harry still does not really understand that he is going to be a great wizard, mainly because he is too busy being angry at the world (and he will get a lot angrier in the next couple of movies).  This is a story about second chances and not just for Harry (think about it).  &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is the least interesting of the three films, and the five books for that matter, in terms of the larger story, especially since what is being set up here is rally being done so Rowling can take it away.  But if there is one thing that Cuar&oacute;n convinces us with this film, it is that this is not a kid's story anymore, even if that was how Chris Columbus played it in the first two movies.Where the franchise needs to be careful is that this film has reduced both Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) to comic relief caricatures.  Ron, who was so brave at the end of the first film, now gets to shake for fear at the drop of a hat so that we can laugh at him.  The film suggests that Ron and Hermione are fated to pair up, but if he keeps acting like this she will have nothing to do with him.  Meanwhile, Malfoy acts like a bully without doing anything particularly mean.  At this point the difference between Malfoy and his henchboys Crabbe and Goyle is that Draco speaks, but then he usually ends up whining and running away.  Yes, replacing a slap with a punch is an interesting upgrade from the book, but then the book sets it up as a small moment of satisfaction against Malfoy's war against Harry; the film treats it more as an element to be played out by the numbers.  &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; ups the ante on the Harry Potter series, and all of the characters need to put all of their chips on the table from here on in.	5.0	Things get darker for Harry Potter and his fans in this one	2004-06-08	172	135	37

Of course you can't get everything in that the book involves and I saw an interview saying that some things were left out because they fit better in the next movie as far as scripts go. Anyways, as much as I LOVED Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Michael Gambon's performance was much closer to what I thought of when I read all of the books and I think he did an excellent job for as little screen time as he got in this one.  As for saying it is a horror movie, what are you talking about??  Yes, it was darker and more serious, but the kids in the books GROW UP.  They are older and the movies are growing with them like the books do.  Maybe the first book is good for younger kids, but you have to think about the subject material in the later ones.  The movies are going to be more intense, especially Goblet of Fire since there is a death.	5.0	LOVED IT!!	2004-11-12	5	3	2

The action opens as usual in the house of the Dursley's where Harry spends his summer vacations. Harry is on the run after blowing up his uncles sister to balloon size. He finds himself on the knight bus (which cannot be seen by muggles) which drives at ridiculous speed and squeezes in between tight spots. The night bus drops him off at the Leaky Cauldron before he makes his way to Hogwarts.The Wizard news is dominated by the escape of dangerous convict Sirius Black from the Wizard prison Azkaban. In the footsteps of Sirius Black are the soul sucking Dementors, the prison guards of Azkaban who drain away all your happiness just by their presence. Harry Potter is seriously affected by the presence of the Dementors and faints more than once. He must overcome his fear of them and the new Defences against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin teaches him how to conjure up the spell Expecto Patronum.Sirius Black is accused of killing Harry Potter's parents aswell as other innocent people and now he is said to come after Harry Potter. Is this the truth or is the situation more complex than it seems.This is a fun film and even better than the first two and that's because the third book is superior to the first two books. Although a number of factors have been taken out from the film, it is still quite true to the book. I loved all the details included in the film, including the Marauder's Map and the time pendant and the splendid Buckbeak.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1IWWRZJOXOSYP	Lee Armstrong	"""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a gripping film.  The myriad of DVD extras on the bonus disc give the viewer a feel for what it was like for the actors and filmmakers.  The shrunken head comedy routine was cute on the Bonus disc.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is developing into a strong actor.  Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione give strong support.  Maggie Smith continues as a strong presence in the films, as her two Oscar wins for ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and ""California Suite"" might foreshadow.  I found the transition to Michael Gambon's Dumbledore to be seamless, although it's hard to replace an actor of Richard Harris' stature.  David Thewlis as Lupin adds a nice flare to the film as does Gary Oldman's Serius Black.  I also appreciated Julie Christie's brief appearance as Madame Rosmerta and Dawn French as the Fat Lady.  This film received two Oscar nominations for John Williams' score and for Best Visual Effects.  Director Alfonso Cuaron does an excellent job at the helm.  I found the Death Eaters to be very scary.

With the richness of the story available to him, the director did one of the worst jobs I have ever been subjected to. I am almost glad it was too short. Anything longer would have been pure torture. I took a friend whom I had been telling about Harry for ages, and was actually embarrassed for Ms. Rowling's work. My friend was totally lost, as would anyone be who hadn't read the book before attending. Was this director on drugs, or was he simply trying to design the worst possible film he could get away with - just to see if he could? Does he believe that anyone who reads Harry is totally incapable of comprehension? Or was he simply insulting his audience?For myself, I was truly disappointed that such a wonderful storyline was butchered into a disorganized, ill designed mess. I went back home and re-read the story, just to make sure that it was the movie that was such a disaster, and not my own memory! Thank goodness it was the director and not myself. Imagine my shock when Ms. Rowling actually praised this destruction of her work - is it written into her publisher's contract that she accept whatever the director designs, no matter what a terrible job he does? What a disappointment.If this is what was done to my favorite Harry Potter to date, I certainly hope that the next director is less of an incompetent than this one was, or I will totally give up on the whole series and stick with the audio versions of the books.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3S5COI3ZI1W32	"Leigh McDaniel ""LEIGH"""	Well, I was not as pleased with this movie as with movies 1 & 2 respectfully.  I liked the inclusions of the newer characters and their importance.  However, I felt cheated from the lack of important characters like Cho Chang and not nearly enough of ones like Neville who is more than key to the later plots.  It was with a disjointed feeling that the scenes seemed to move and there wasn't enough made of the Marauder's Map and the reasoning for Sirius's animagus and the stag of Harry's Patronus.  It wasn't right to me how the ending left the fact that Sirius sent the Firebolt and that he'd signed Harry's permission slip for Hogsmeade the next year.  I was entertained by the way the movie matured into a more serious, darker tale as the characters are maturing and the books are showing them doing more mature things, while keeping their characters fairly true.  I missed the funnier, more loving portrayal of the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, though Michael Gambon did a great job making the role his own.  I hope, as I do with all these movies, that by seeing these films more people will be encouraged to pick up the books and get a better look into the world of Harry Potter!	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-08-06	0	0	0

As his powers are growing and the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life still evades us, an unexpected visit disrupts Harry's peace of mind...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Alan Rickman (!), Gary Oldman (!), and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.The concept, the setting, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.

Maybe it's partly because the 3rd book is my favorite that I was so disappointed in the movie.While I realize the book is much longer and that they obviously couldn't include everything, I think they included several things that seemed to be ""fillers"" and not necessary to the plot while they left out some very vital things that should have been included.I found the characters this time to be mostly annoying, even Harry. Ron wasn't too bad. But Hermione's know-it-all attitude was even worse than usual and got on my nerves badly. They portrayed Draco as whiny and cowardly - not in his character. I don't like the new Dumbledore at all - what's with the grotesque fingernails and the scene where he was hitting Ron's injured leg in the hospital ward?I saw this movie at the movie theatre once - wasn't impressed. Was anxious to get the DVD thinking maybe I totally missed something - and it was even worse. I have 4 kids ages 5-9 and not one of them was overly impressed with this movie although they loved the others.The extras included were even more disappointing. The 5 deleted scenes were a big let down (that's usually one of my favorite extras on any DVD). No bloopers - another of my favorites on most DVDs. The interviews might have been okay if it wasn't for the presence and ludicrous comments of that extremely annoying shrunken head things - it was painful to watch.I hope the next movies are improvements over this one.

As a huge HP fan I wish more than anything that I could say this movie was good, but it's abysmal.  Some of the changes Cuaron made are absolutely inexcusable...Why are they wearing Muggle clothes?...Why couldn't Harry get the Firebolt earlier in the movie?...Why did Hogwarts look completely different?...Why was Aunt Marge outside instead of in the kitchen?...I can tell you the answer to all of these questions in one sentence: Cuaron had absolutely no passion for the story and therefore he was lazy in his approach to go from book to film!!  I've heard a rumor that Colombus may be coming back for movie five or six...I desperately hope this is true for the sake of all HP fans.  Cuaron has admitted that he knew nothing about Harry Potter when he was approached about taking on this project, and based on the movie I would say he still knows nothing about Harry Potter.  There are subtlties important to the plot of latter books that were completly left out, as well as some important characters (Cho and Cedric).  Colombus understands the underlying magic and spirit of HP, and if he comes back to direct I know he will be able to run damage control to fix Cuaron's butchering.

I liked the fact that the director brought out more emotions from the characters, Hermione had more of an attitude and they brought out a dramatic side to Harry which shows how they are when they truly take things seriouslly.  You really have to use your imagination and have the complete knowledge of the novel as well if you really want to understand the whole concept of the movie itself...If you have not read the book, you will not understand what's going on, especially when the part where Harry and friends meet up with Sirius Black in the Shrieking Shack under the Whomping Willow outside of Hogwarts.  A lot of people said they were very dissapointed by how the whole movie was in general, but I enjoyed how the movie was different from the first two.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SMYF3499XDY7	Lily	Well, I feel that seeing the Harry Potter movie was $8.00 well wasted. I saw it last night, and I became more and more disappointed as the movie progressed. First of all, Dumbledore never wears a wizard hat! He wears this beret thing with a little tassle! and his beard is in a ponytail! Also, Daniel Radcliffe seriously needs some fake crying lessons, along with acting lessons! He was like screaming at people the entire movie! Also, Professor Lupin is nothing like I imagined. He has short, brown hair and never looked as tired as he was described in the book. And another thing: DEMENTORS CAN'T FLY!!!! THEY GLIDE!!! The dementors flew around in little circular patterns and made the lake and everything freeze up, which is not in the book. The director did Buckbeak pretty well, he looked like I had imagined. Overall, the movie seemed like there was a deadline for time that they had to meet because the whole movie felt really rushed. Hogwarts must have gotten a remodel done, too, because some things are there that were not in the same places, like the Whomping Willow and Hagrid's hut. And where did that giant clock come from? And that bridge? I have to say, the highlight of the movie is when the Weasley twins gave Harry the Marauder's Map, because the twins have gotten really good-looking!	1.0	You can at least give Alfonso Cuaron credit for trying.....	2004-06-16	13	5	8

They were wrong. In fact, I only noticed one major important cut in the whole film, and that was the explanation of the Marauder's Map (i.e. who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs really are), which will supposedly be added into another film. Honestly, I adored this film. Though a bit less true to the original series than the first two films, it has something that the first two movies lacked. This movie somehow makes Hogwarts seem real and magical. Cuaron really brought the characters to life in this film. All of the acting is brilliant (Daniel Radcliffe has improved a great deal from the first movie), but Emma Thompson's portrayal of Trelawney is one of the best parts of the whole movie. I love Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, too. He is a bit livelier than Richard Harris was, and he has that twinkle that is unique to Dumbledore. He's exactly how I'd always imagined the character. There is more humor added into this movie than in the first two as well, which makes the movie enjoyable. Overall, this movie just had more of that spark that JK Rowling weaves into her writing than the first two did, and, though I never thought I'd say this, I think that that is more important than being 100% true to the books.

So I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  The first two movies were very good, but I couldn't wait to see some of the things from this book.  Unfortunately, the director/script writer decided to leave some of the best things out (like Professor Snape being enchanted and floating out of the Shrieking Shack, the friendship between Crookshanks and Sirius as a dog making you wonder who Crookshanks really is, the explanation of how the three friends (Pettigrew, Sirius and Harry's dad) became animals to keep Lupin company when he was a werewolf, the explanation of Harry's patronus being a stag and its significance).  They put in some things that I thought made the movie less factual (like having Lupin as a werewolf attack Sirius when he was a dog, when the whole reason Sirius had learned to become a dog was to keep Lupin company when he was a werewolf), and focused too much on action and not nearly enough on the characters and their relationships.  J.K. Rowling is a brilliant author who develops characters so well that you feel that they're your friends.  This movie was flat and one-dimensional and a HUGE disappointment.That being said, the scenes where Harry flew on Buckbeak over the countryside, his talks with Professor Lupin, the Patronus, and the Dementors were well done.  However, even there, this movie was different -- it looked as if the Dementors were trying to give Harry the ""kiss"" constantly -- in the book, they simply made you miserable, and didn't suck out your life unless you had a death sentence.  This will make things in later books (when a Dementor DOES try to give Harry the kiss and everyone is appalled) much less understandable.I just don't understand why, when there was such an incredibly excellent plot to work from, they felt it was necessary to leave out so many wonderful pieces.  And even if they do a great job on the next two books, I will forever be disappointed that they ruined my favorite one.To whoever made these decisions -- STOP MAKING IT ABOUT ACTION!!!  Follow the plot!  Focus on the characters and their relationships with each other.  We have plenty of action films --what makes the Harry Potter series so exceptional is the development of the characters.  The readers of these books are bright -- we don't need simplistic script writing -- it's boring and seriously underestimates what we are looking for.Linda (to view some of my paintings, go to my website at [...])"	3.0	This really let me down	2004-09-24	13	8	5

I'm not saying it was BAD, just not as good as the other two. I do like the new, darker, more mature mood the new director brought, and especially Draco's new hairdo, but I think they cut too much out. It is the longest book, and the shortest movie. I know they were worried about it being too long, but it could have been a little longer than it was. It did not include some of the important points that the books made, and if you have not read the books, you might be a bit lost.

There is almost no character development, and Hogwarts now looks as if it is a ruin.  But perhaps worst of all it is a poorly constructed movie.  My husband, who has not read the books, but thoroughly enjoyed the first two movies, was completely lost in this one.  Scenes change quickly, frequently with no explanation, and while this is not a serious problem if you have read the book, for others it makes for a choppy, disjointed mess.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"THURS 1/31/13 NOTE:  This film was originally publish June 6, 2004, but the page it was originally posted on, the theatrical release page, no longer exist, so I have moved it here.  With this in mind, you should know that this will not review the Blu Ray's itself or the features only the film.  :)I've been a HP fan for the last 5 years, read all the books loads many times, seen all the previous movies many times, and think about the HP universe all the time. I do the best I can to separate the books from the movies as a film is only a personal interpretation of the written material, hard to do at times, but often necessary to enjoy book to film adaptations.Most have heard the overall tone of this movie is a good deal darker than the previous films, which it suits the story, as ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is where the books began to darken as well. The pace of this film overall, is frantic, it went by before I even realized it, making me want to rush back and see it again. Right from the get-go, you know this is going to be a less fanciful adaptation of the Potter world, while remaining decently faithful to feel & intention of book, and that is what's important, though it is sad that some of the wonder and adventure of the novel is lost, especially the mystery of what the ""Grimm"" really is, and Harry's escapades to Hogsmead.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and the whole cast have not only grown up, but grown into fine actors. The acting is positively first-rate. After Richard Harris' spot-on Dumbledore, Michael Gambon took a bit getting used, but now that I've had time to sleep on it, I've come to appreciate his interpretation, in a way, he picks out different aspects of Dumbledore than Harris did, and he becomes less of a fatherly figure, and more of a crusty old man. Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) and Allen Rickman(Severus Snape) seemed to inhabit their characters more in this film, the script definitely has a lot to do with that. This time instead of finding myself lusting after them, I found myself hating them more, which is kind of the point of their characters in this film.What a terrific script!  Yes, there were changes from the book to movie, but Steve Cloves did a marvelous job. All the important parts are there, although my sister thought they should've explained a couple things more (this proved to be a major problem in the later films). As stated before, the script is tighter and thus makes the film move at a brisker pace. The way it portrays teen boys as actual teen boys, is nice. There are some lovely moments in the boys dormitory, just fun and silly moments of random boyness.I'd never seen any of Alfonzo Cuaron's films prior to this (THURS 1/31/13: I later realized I'd actually seem one of his previous films beforeA Little Princess, and if you've seen that film, you will know what to expect tone-wise, and script wise for the most part, the feel of the films are very very similar. That film is also the main reason Rowling wanted Cuaron as a director.) and scoffed at the idea of him directing because he seemed to talk like an egotistical idiot when I'd seen/read interviews with him, but after viewing the film, I can at least say, he is a very good director. He needs to direct the next movies after #4(Which is being done by Brittish director Mike Newell, ie. 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.), since he is not directing 4, but mentioned he may return to the series later.Instead of focus on the events and trying to make it a ""light and cheery family affair"", its focused on the characters and its much more true to the characters in the book, and all the important events are intact anyways. It doesn't tend to focus quite as much on the trivial things, although Quidditch is very important to Harry, its not the focus of the whole book series, and we only see a little bit of it in this film.I wont say anything else, because I'd like you to experience it yourself, oh and before your own review, give yourself some time to think it through.God Bless ~Amy"	4.0	A Fun Adaptation. :D	2004-06-05	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SS3KS2BSW9X1	Liv	When I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters, I was blown away. In my opinion, this movie is MUCH better than the two previous movies. Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, did an excellent job. The artistry in the movie is fantastic! It's darker and more mature, and I absolutely love the different feel of it. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Sirius Black was outstanding! He is such a versatile actor, and the way he played Sirius is exactly as I pictured the character when reading the book. I was equally impressed with Emma Thompson's portrayal of Professor Trelawny - also exactly as I pictured the character. When did Daniel Radcliff learn how to act? In the first two HP films, he is not that great. His movements were mechanical and his facial expressions seemed a bit forced. He has improved so much! Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) have also improved in their acting. They, like their characters, have grown since Chamber of Secrets. I was, however, a little disappointed with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I just loved Richard Harris in the role; he suited it perfectly. Maybe it was the writing, but Dumbledore is like a different character in this film. He is a bit two-dimensional. Sure, he is still the wise old man who guides Harry, but very little of his charm comes through. He is supposed to be a witty, almost sarcastic man with a twinkle in his eye, and the film just does not do the character justice.Fans of the book should not watch the movie expecting a word-for-word re-enactment. There are many scenes missing that, in my opinion are important to the story (coughMARAUDERSMAPcough) and some scenes added. The budding romance between Ron and Hermione is even more evident in this movie. I, personally, could do without it, but it does make for some very funny moments.Though the movie does have its faults, I stand by my rating of 5 stars. It's impossible to make the perfect Harry Potter movie without it being 6 hours long and incredibly expensive for WB. Overall, the movie captured all of the feelings and emotions that JK Rowling meant to with her book. I'm very happy with this movie, and I will buy it the second the DVD comes out. Until then, I will just have to listen to the soundtrack. It's excellent - highly recommended as well.	5.0	The Best HP Film Yet	2004-08-11	7	6	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A6JP5AQ6BRFWG	Liz	Having gone under new direction in the third movie, along with other problems such as the unfortunate death of Richard Harris, this movie is lacking in several ways.  Too many creative licenses were taken to adapt this film to highlight the action-packed parts that would capture most of the audience's attention.  The problem with this is that it caused every other aspect of the movie to be severely rushed through.  It's the type of feeling one gets when skimming a book, as opposed to sitting down and taking the time to enjoy it.  Important details are left out of the movie inorder to make enough room to dwell on a handful of scenes such as the Knight Bus and the dementor attacks.  In trying to show off the special effects capable, minor effects are disregarded like wand/spell effects for example, meaning there are no visual signs of spells being cast. While granted this is a very minor detail, it could add more to the movie than one might realize. Fight scenes with the wands would be much more visually interesting with this added.  Backstories are shortened or left out completely, there is no character development, and pretty much anything not 100% vital to the story line and out come is disregarded or shoved in as a mere hint or suggestion, where more detail would bring the story to life.Rowling worked hard to create these details and they should not be disregarded. Furthermore, the audience's intelligence should not be insulted by causing the movie to thrive soley on it's visual effects and high-action scenes.On a personal note, my friend, who did not read the book, was not able to follow the movie.  The mark of a great movie re-make of good literature is that is has the ability to be followed and enjoyed without any prior knowledge of the story. These movies should add to the books, not depend upon them even to simply understand the film.  And they certainly should not detract from the books by simply waving shiny things infront of the audiences' face.All in all, the movie was dissapointing but tolerable.  It isn't a *bad* movie, though it certainly could have done a lot better.  It's entertaining, but frustrating and you end the movie feeling slightly unfulfilled. This movie has great potential, but it was not used to the fullest. I reccomend it for Harry Potter fans simply because it is entertaining and of course it has its high points as well as its lows.  It's a love-hate situation.	3.0	"""You tell those spiders, Ron"""	2005-06-23	7	5	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3QVPHLA8EMGV2	"LLMfromWetumpka ""computerliteratemom"""	"I found the latest of the Harry Potter films to be very unsatisfying. While the acting was good, the story line was very episodic with no flow that told a coherent story. Too many things were left out such as the winning of the Quidditch cup and the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map. Nothing was said about Sirius giving Harry permission to visit Hogsmeade.  Not enough was made of Percy making Head Boy. Other unnecessary scenes were added, The chorus singing near the beginning of the movie was cute, but not pertinent to the story or even derived from the book. The Knight bus scene was too long and some characters changed. I don't remember a hunchback at the Leaky Cauldron.The film quality looked very bad. I guess the director was trying to make a statement but it looked more like something that had been videotaped. The colors were muddy and many scenes almost appeared subtly out-of-focus.Hogwarts looked like it had fallen on bad times and they had been evicted to shabbier quarters. The books talk of a sloping lawn, not an extremely steep hillside, I thought the landscape changes were largely unnecessary and not well done. The addition of the giant clock was totally out of character with the non-mechanical world of the wizarding community in the Harry Potter books. Having the giant pendulum swinging dangerously through the hall bordered on stupidity.Clearly the director was trying to put his ""mark"" on the films. He succeeded in making the film much less entertaining and less true to the author's world. The movie suffered from an attention to detail and had a very shallow feeling. There were confusing and unnecessary changes in plot and how characters acted. The shrunken heads and spinal column candlesticks should be sent back to Knockturn Alley where they belong and the director should be sent packing. If he had been responsible for the first two films I doubt they would have been nearly the success that they were."	3.0	Disappointing effort	2004-06-14	3	0	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2T7TZBOTP68C7	"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart"""	"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the continuing story of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy.  The films recreate the books by J.K. Rowling.  In this film, Harry is being pursued by murderous Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban, the terrifying prison for wizards.  He is also having premonitions of a legendary black dog called ""the Grim,"" which brings death to all who see it.  Hogwart's is being guarded by menacing creatures called Dementors, black spectres who are prison guards at Azkaban.This film has a new director, Spanish director Alonzo Cuaron, who took over from Chris Columbus.  Columbus remains involved in the Potter movies as a producer.  Cuaron's style is very different from Columbus.  For example, the trio of Ron, Hermione, and Harry are rarely seen in their Hogwart's uniforms, but mostly in street clothes.  Personally, I preferred Columbus' directing.  The film also has a new Albus Dumbledore, after the passing of Richard Harris.  The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, does an excellent job and is virtually indestinguishable from Harris' Dumbledore, which adds seamless continuity.A new teacher for the Defense of the Dark Arts is one of the best characters in this movie and indeed in the series.  Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is a kindly father figure to Harry, helping Harry overcome his paralyzing fear of the Dementors.  But Lupin has a terrible secret.There is a werewolf in this movie.  I must say I think this werewolf is the most authentic ones ever depicted on screen.  A werewolf is a wretched creature doomed to a life of violence and painful transformations.  Unlike the werewolf with the twelve-pack and glorious mane in Van Helsing, the werewolf in ""Prisoner"" is truly terrifying.The second DVD is packed with extras that take almost as long as the movie to enjoy.  There is a ""Marauder's Map"" that features different areas such as Hogsmeade, the Great Hall, Defense for the Dark Arts, etc.  There are two games, ""Catch Scabbers"" and ""Sir Cadugan's Quest.""  I could not figure out how to play the Scabber's game with just a PC keyboard.  There is a conversation between Cuaron and Rowling, which shows a lot of the making of the film.Alan Rickman continues to do a superb job as Professor Severus Snape.  Snape is one of my favorite characters, and gets a fair amount of screentime here."	4.0	Third Chapter in the Harry Potter Saga	2005-06-03	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2B663RLH19RH8	LnKnProphets	"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I was anxiously awaiting the PoA movie being as it's my second favorite book in the series (Goblet of Fire being my favorite).  When I finally saw it, I was not disappointed.  I loved the new setting (especially the lake) and the darker atmosphere, especially the dementors (they were extremely scary and chilling).  The hippogriff was exactly how I pictured it in the book, and the scene with the Care of Magical Creatures class and Harry riding the hippogriff quickly became my favorite scene.  Cuaron did a great job directing (I loved the ""time"" symbolism throughout), and the young actors are getting better and better with each movie.However, there is a reason I am giving the movie 4 stars instead of 5.  In my opinion, very important details were left out.  We are never told the significance of the Marauder's Map or Harry's patronus.  In place of these very important details are scenes which are cute but unnecessary, such as the choir singing and the boys of Gryffindor eating sweets which temporarily make them sound like animals.  Also, I thought the movie was a little too fast-paced and choppy.  It seemed that one minute it was winter, and the next it was spring.Overall, even though the movie had its faults, it is an incredible film and, in my opinion, the best Harry Potter film to date."	4.0	The best HP film to date, however...	2004-11-13	8	6	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2G9DGP3L4JGV1	L O'connor	Harry Potter thinks he may have blown his chance of returning to Hogwarts for a third year, he's in trouble for using illegal magic to inflate his uncle's nasty sister, and cause her to float away like a balloon.  He gets a ride to London on the night bus, which provides transport for stranded wizards and witches (the journey on the bus is one of the highlights of the movie, and definitey the funniest part).  In London, he learns to his relief that the unfortunate illicit magic episode has been hushed up, and he can return to Hogwarts after all.There's more troulbe in store though.  Sirius Black, the wizard who apparently betrayed Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, has escaped from the dreaded prison of Azkaban, and the terrifiying Dementors, the guardians of the prison, are at Hogwarts looking for him.  Harry's beloved broomstick gets smashed up in a Quidditch match, and Hermione has a new familiar, a cat who, Ron is convinced, wants to have his pet rat Scabbers for lunch.The third book in the series is my favourite, and on the whole a very good job has been done of transfering it to the screen.  It is deeper and darker in tone than the two earlier Harry adventures, and some of the charm of the original is invariably lost in the changeover from book to movie.  There are some spectacular special effects, notably the wonderful scene where Harry goes for a ride on the Hippogriff (who wouldn't like to do that?)  And the climax of the movie, where Hermione and Harry discover the truth about Sirius Black and have to go back in time to change the present,is absolutely gripping.The film doesn't entirely capture the charm  of the book, but it comes very close.	4.0	More trouble at Hogwarts	2004-11-28	4	3	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2977H7FPFXWAI	"Looney Lovegood ""Film Fanatic"""	This movie was a masterpiece. I'm a devoted Harry Potter fan, and believe thoroughly that Alfonso Cuaron has brought the intangible magic of Rowling's storytelling to the screen intact, not cheapened and dulled to a nub as Columbus had done. Most Potter-holics will tell you that this film ultimately is flawed because some of the book's large points aren't covered in this film, such as the backstory of the Marauder's and the creation of the map, and the lack of the paternal link with the stag form of Harry's Patronus, and the omission of Harry's talk with Dumbledore at the end of the book. Well, the movie doesn't suffer one bit. And as an admitted Potter-holic myself, knowing these things were missing didn't affect my ability to enjoy the film or my astonishment at Cuaron's remarkable accomplishment. He has created a work of art that rivals the source material's emotional impact. Rowling herself has stated that she loves this film, and was astonished at how fundamentally Cuaron understood what she was trying to communicate with this book.The acting has improved immensely in this film, thanks in large part to Cuaron's expert tutelage, such as having Radcliffe watch Truffaut's THE 400 BLOWS, to get a sense of an artist's filmic depiction of the pains of adolescence and the fear of growing, (Truffaut's famous freeze-frame ending at the conclusion of THE 400 BLOWS also informs the homage of Cuaron's ending: a freeze-frame of Harry speeding off on his new Firebolt broomstick). He worked with the young trio very closely to help develop their friendship on-screen in a more natural fashion. The children in this film act more like real kids than in almost any other film intended for children. Dumbledore finally has the sly, devious glint in his eyes that you envision from the series, instead of just the grandfatherly twinkle. Emma Thompson's hippie-Divination teacher is lovingly perfected. Lupin's paternal rapport with Harry is heartbreaking, and the sense of cruel injustice which tears him from Harry's life at the end, as well as the heartache of Sirius' departure, is delivered with an emotional honesty absent from the first 2 films.Cuaron's visual style is perfectly wedded to the source material, letting the sadness, anger, alienation, and confusion of adolescence, color the palette of the film with deep blues, greens and grays, sparkling silvers and inky, shadowy blacks. The ornately detailed interiors, with their improved dramatic lighting and vast, expansive depths, coupled with the lushness and rugged naturalism of the new outdoor locations and surroundings seen in this film, are brilliantly employed; the world of Hogwarts inside and out now matches the baroque majesty conjured by the reader's imagination when poring through Rowling's complex structures on the page. Cuaron's superior filmic vocabulary enables him to put irises, superimpositions, widescreen framing, wide-angle lensing, fluid camera movements expertly utilizing cranes and dollys, to the task of capturing Hogwarts in all it's magical, menacing, awe-inspiring glory. The conjuring of the Patronus, and Sirius flying off into the moonlit sky on the wings of Buckbeak, are two of the most goosebump inducing, heartbreaking scenes in the world of fantasy film. The greatness of Cuaron's approach, visually, emotionally, thematically, can be felt in the tenderness of Lupin telling Harry about his parents on the bridge and during his attempts to teach Harry how to conjure a Patronus, and when he and Sirius look longingly at the Hogwarts castle from the forest, together in a quiet, contemplative serenity. Cuaron has truly done magic of the most advanced kind here.	5.0	Rowling's work finally gets the treatment it deserves	2004-11-14	15	11	4

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (POA from here on out)  is my favorite book of the series.POA the Movie:  I  WAS MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.The one thing that miraculously remaine din tact was the character of Remus Lupin (my second favorite character after Sirius Black).  I don't know how he came out right.  He is the one character that manages to retain any humanity and emote the slightesr bit.  In fact, he earned ALL TWO STARS I posted.Other than that, the film was extremely lacking.Extremely!Crucial plot points are omitted,  I MAJOR PLOT POINTS, I might add.  Important scenes lose their meaning when there is no history to back them up.  Many classic Lupin scenes, The connection of the Marauders to the map, and the appearance of Sirius as ""the Grm"" at the Quidditch match are completely missing.  Hence, any meaning behind Harry's Patronus is lost.  As is Lupin's self esteem.  Read the Book to see why he says he leaves.  Then watch the movie.  See how much character development got left out.  The same goes for Sirius, who I loved in the book!  He seems to get the abbreviated version of his role in the book.Bad Points?  Lots, the most deviant ones I have already pointed out.  There are a few others that just can't be overlooked and do not deserve their own paragraphs.1.  I LOVE WEREWOLVES.  I HATE THE DESIGN OF THIS ONE.  I HATE IT.  IT IS COMICAL.  EVEN MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SISTER THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.  FUNNY! In the book, it is a giant, maniacal wolf bent on destruction!  It's scary!  Who approved this thing?2.  Why does every single established character feel like a prop?  Its like they are all cameos in a movie that never takes time to explore how they feel, or their relationships.  Gone are the complex relationships and squabble sof the book.  They are replaced with random bits of conversation that act as though you're ""in"" on everything.3.  What happened to Malfoy's hair?  For a slick, elitist Slytherin, he seems to have almost completely vanished, save for that horrible 'do.

I was dumb struck throughout this movie. The last straw was the broomstick (no pun intended) given at the end, 1/3 of the book was about the mysterious broomstick. I was horribly disappointed in the whole movie. Time was wasted panoraming around the land scape when it could have been used for dialog that was sorely needed. Even though I read the book I was lost 1/2 way through. Especially the time travel of Hermoine. The one good thing that can be stated, Professor Trelawny (Emma Thompson), brilliant. Please make the next couple of movies at least longer or into 2 movies. Another critic suggested spring for one and Fall for the other. That sounds great to me also.

Alfonso Cuarzon has wonderfully portrayed the darkness of the third book ... Harry, Ron & Hermione are growing up and the actors are doing a wonderful job of portraying that slide into adolescence from childhood. Daniel Radcliffe has really grown into this larger-than-life character ... and your heart breaks for him as he is trying to make his way through.A few thoughts- The Dementors were scary $#@*. Great job with the special effects people on making them seem so spooky and flowy and ... those clawy fingers reaching around the door at the beginning ... eeeeeek!- Draco is probably the least talented child actor in the group. He just doesn't quite portray Draco as I see him in the book?- Hermione and Ron's romantic hintings were hilarious - the look on Ron's face when Hermione grabbed his hand was priceless.- Richard Harris is greatly missed and he made a fantastic Dumbledore, but Michael Gambon has stepped into the role with no big ""hiccups"" - you just accept him as Dumbledore and move on.- I originally didn't think Gary Oldman would be a good Sirius ... but he does have that mix of seeming evil and yet good at the same time.

I believe that the script writer didn't change in any of the movies,so that means that it was the same of the previous 2 movies, why he changed to bad this one? why he decided to cut many important things like vital information about the marauders and how they used to be in high school, the reason why Snape owed his life to James, the fact that they were all animagus for Lupin, well I know its a book adaptation but why in LOTR they did a marvelous not yet perfect adaptation with a lot of extended footage and scenes making one of the best adaptation of a great book history. I know that maybe LOTR of Tolkien is far greater thatn HP of Rowling but my point is why didnt they do same treatment to a books saga like LOTR? why they believe oh its a children history so they wont complain about this, wont they?. That's not true... maybe the will pass a few things but when they grow older they will look back and said those movies never were faithfull to the book they don't portrait the feelings in the book even the time lineI dont know what to expect now about GOF.. Im scared to think about what they will do with that book, knowing that its one of the biggest...I hope Cuaron direct another one but with a better adaptation his skill of movie making were great, he get the best idea of the dementors and their effects on people (althougth to much kiss of death :) )anyway i hope to see it awain (the movie) when my anger and desapointment fade away a bit Its just a movie, ok but it was from my fav book thats why im angry &gt;:(	3.0	Dont blame Cuaron, blame the script writers!!!	2004-08-02	3	2	1

Everyone does GREAT in this film, especially the three leading actors who have previously struggled with becoming their characters believably. Alfonso did a really well job directing it, taking to places that Chris Columbus didn't seem to want to take the first two. It's alot better filmed, with alot better effects, and altogether it's alot more enjoyable to watch (despite it's length). Of course in movies one can't include everything, so there are somethings that are sadly left out, but everything that you need to know is there, so that's better than having all the fun moments and none of the pot. Oh my, I meant ""plot"".This film is great for all ages, though the younger ones might be a bit scaresome moments. Luckily in todays's society most children are desensitized to things like scary creatures and should be just fine. This one will be enjoyable for ages!"	5.0	They do magic, they save the world- and they can ACT!	2004-10-12	14	11	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3TW300RSZVMWL	machiavelli	"Watching this movie was a disappointment. The earlier HP movies had their childish and irritating moments but were saved by their fun quirkiness, beautiful sets and scenery, and an entertaining story line that if not exactly plausible could at least be followed. And because I am a fan of Gary Oldman (who always plays punks, psychos and other oddballs with such style) I decided to check this one out.First off, this movie really does have a lot of horror elements. Don't get me wrong, I love dark fantasy stories but after seeing the way this movie portrayed Hogwarts Academy there is no way I would consider sending MY child to such a school. They'd be dead within a week. Either from falling off a broom at 300 feet up or getting their faces smeared off by a pack of dementors or being crushed by a demonic Old Man Willow. Not to mention being scared to death by boggarts or mauled by werewolf professors. And this is supposed to be a kid's movie?My most important gripe with the movie is it's disjointedness and infuriating contradictions and pointless scenes.For instance - The Hippogriff must be beheaded for kicking a student (Malfoy) who provoked it, yet the head professor invites soul-sucking dementors to gather round Hogwarts to ""protect"" the children. Oh kids, don't mind the school train breaking down, it's just a Nazgul boarding the bus to check your tickets.-Gentle Hagrid feeds the Hippogriff dead ferrets over and over again. We are even treated to a scene where we see a whole rack of them hanging like deer carcasses beside his hut.  Hey kids, this beast is very dangerous and has a beak the size of your head - would you like to ride him for today's lesson?-The Whomping willow (who I swear is a knockoff of Tolkien's Old Man Willow, just like Hogwarts is a takeoff of Le Guin's School for Wizards in her book A Wizard of Earthsea) likes to eat chirpy little bluebirds and tries to kill Potter and Hermione when they try to enter a passage at its base, but ignores them when they exit on the way out.-The professors who had so much commanding dignity and personality in the previous movies are trivialized and protrayed as clueless and feeble. Other characters like Malfoy and his bullies and Potters aunt & uncle are portrayed as one-dimensionally stupid and sniveling.The head mistress tells Harry she's sorry but he can't go to the village with the other students because his permission slip isn't signed by his legal guardians - and that's her final word on the matter. A meaningless and rather ironic exchange. So Potter must stay at Hogwarts where it's nice and safe and where he can be tutored by a werewolf to learn advanced and deadly magic.Dumbledore walks thru a room full of sleeping students loudly telling secrets that the students must not know anything about.The entire time travel episode is confusing and sketchy at best.Not only that, the only thing worse than watching Potter almost die the last fifteen minutes of the film is getting to watch the whole confusing 15 minutes all over again as Hermione and Potter go back in time to meddle with the outcome again.The first time is confusing, the second time its still confusing and repetitive as well.There are a few consistencies however:-Once again the new professor we are introduced to (Lupine) turns out to be the one mixed up with the bad stuff.-Once again everybody fawns over Harry Potter. Oh, Harry Potter, you're just like your father. Oh Harry Potter, you have your mother's eyes. Oh Harry Potter, you're such a special boy. Here's a special gift for you, Potter.-The actors who play Potter and Hermione repeatedly remind us that they still can't act convincingly."	1.0	Annoying.	2004-12-23	16	7	9

I don't need a dressed up version of the same film I already own, I don't care how nice the box is.  Yes, the documentaries are good, but not enough to make me double-dip for the exact same films.  What's frustrating as a consumer is that I did get the first two Ultimate Editions, and was looking forward to completing the collection of extended cuts.  I know, I know...  The studio gave the directors a chance to re-edit their films, and both directors felt the film that exists was the best cut, ergo no extended cuts are necessary.  Nobody bothered to ask what the FANS actually want.  Crazy thought...  All I have to say is, they better not screw up the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Edition.  Everyone KNOWS that film had a full HOUR of stuff cut, footage that had been COMPLETED with effects and everything.  So, you've got no excuses, WB!

But at least I didn't coming out of this installment wanting to strangle the young stars.  If a director can make these three annoying kids--Radcliffe perhaps the most cloying among them--seem downright enjoyable and, dare I say it, heroic, then he's quite the talent.What I liked most about Prisoner of Askaban was the tone, and the use of some interesting--if dated--transition effects, like the blurry iris closing or opening, to give Prisoner the feel of something ancient and macabre.  There truly is an otherworldly effect from the way this movie was put together.Gary Oldman, sadly, is wasted in the almost throwaway role of Sirius Black; hopefully, we'll see more of him in future installments.  Thankfully, Harry Potter, as least the film incarnation, is heading in the right direction--away from silly, annoying treacle to something darker and bewitching.  Here's hoping they don't double back and add more frosting to the next one.	3.0	Better than the first two.	2004-06-12	8	4	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2TBMX78M7PD5T	"Malvolio ""scott15724"""	Synopsis: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban finds the famous boy wizard and his friends entering their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - as well as, much more ominously, their teen years. This time around, the plot focuses on one Sirius Black, an escapee from the wizard prison, Azkaban. Black was originally incarcerated for bringing about the murder of Harry's parents, and now it is feared that he is on the hunt for Harry as well. Hot on his trail are the Azkaban guards, horrific creatures called Dementors who can suck the very soul from a human. Though tasked to recapture Black, the dementors show an unfortunate tendency to harm anyone else who gets in their way; and from the get-go, Harry finds himself particularly vulnerable to their dark magic.Azkaban marks a subtle but very interesting change in the Harry Potter movie franchise. Alfonso Cuaron took over the directorial reins from Chris Columbus, the producer for the series and director of the first two films. You may know Cuaron as the director of Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). As in that film, the director infuses his Harry Potter opus with lush naturalism, embodying a rather more primitive take on Hogwarts and its environs. The jewel-like colors of the previous movies are muted into subdued earth tones; and the school seems less like an English Gothic academy and more like an Asturian monastery, a little woodier and more human-scaled.The best thing about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is that it finally manages to break free from the slavery to J. K. Rowling's written sources that suffocated the first two films. Given the increased length of the third book, it would not have been possible to take such a tack this time around and finish in less than about four hours. One suspects, though, that Cuaron, who is a more imaginative filmmaker than his predecessor, would never have been content anyway to hew slavishly to a novel. He clearly understands that films tell stories differently than books do; and much as Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings, Cuaron pays greater justice to the spirit of Harry Potter by untethering himself from the letter of it.His approach seems to have coaxed more daring from his actors, as well. This time around, the stars seem more like real kids - perhaps partly due to Cuaron's direction and partly because they've had time to grow comfortable in these roles. Their portrayals are more complex, their emotions better realized than ever. The change is most marked in Emma Watson, the performer who plays Harry's friend Hermione Granger. She has always been the best young actor on the set (and still is), but this time, instead of being a little magic princess, she's an interestingly beset, slightly scruffy teenager. Instead of mandating school robes, Cuaron by and large has the Hogwarts students clad in teenage mallrat couture, which makes a surprisingly large change in the way we perceive them. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) has also grown into his craft, and he's added a more defiant, angrier sensibility. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), as Harry's best friend and arch enemy respectively, offer reliably grown-up supporting performances.The most pleasant surprises in this film, though, are among the new adult cast members. David Thewlis turns in a lovable performance as Remis Lupin, a new instructor with a tragic secret. In a small part that should grow over the next two films, Gary Oldman does as well as one has come to expect in the role of the mercurial Sirius Black. Michael Gambon took over the part of Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore after the death of Richard Harris last year. Gambon's version is earthier, less stately and deliberate than Harris's, but no less fine. And Emma Thompson is spot-on as daffy Divination professor Sybil Trelawney. The new people round out an already accomplished cast, including most notably Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane.If you have chosen thus far to forego the Harry Potter cinematic experience, you may want to give it another thought this time around. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban represents a richer, more lyrical, and more grown-up vision of J. K. Rowling's magical world than we have seen until now. On the other hand, if you are already a fan of the films, don't hesitate on this one: you're gonna love it.	4.0	Harry Potter comes of age	2004-06-07	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	"Without a doubt the Prisoner of Azkaban installment of the Harry Potter series outdid the first two movies, and in doing so, it broadened the audience for the character. While the first one catered mostly to children and the second one started building up toward a more mature audience, this one, with its overall darker feel, was definitely geared toward a more adult viewership.I particularly liked the direction of Mexican-born Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") and the photography and effect work, which just keeps getting better by the movie. As for the cast, I must admit that Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) no longer looks much like Harry's age. The same occurs with Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), however you get over these casting ""details"" after a while into the movie. Plus, the appearance of Emma Thompson and Gary Oldman more than make up for this, and bring an additional level of acting depth to the movie, as brief as their performances may be.Overall, I am already looking forward to the next one, which we will be enjoying in 2005, directed by the veteran Mike Newell, who has ""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""Donnie Brasco"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" among the list of 70 movies he's directed so far."	5.0	Potter movies just keep getting better	2004-06-28	3	2	1

This was a fun movie to watch. But I was suprised that it was so short. This is also the darkest movie yet. As would be expected from director Cuaron. Though they do stick close to the plot of the book.The movie starts off with Harry at home with the Dursley's. And as usual they are making his life miserable...but we see that Harry is not only older, but has some power. For his uncle seems a little scared of him. But they still manage to get him to run away from home. He takes a ride on a triple decker bus for wayward wizards; and we follow for a ride of our lives. Harry soon learns that Sirus Black has escaped from prison and is coming to kill him. The guards of the wizard prison are scary dark-robed Dementors that suck out your soul until you are dead. And they are searching for Black, but for some reason they seem to feed on Harry's soul every chance they get.Once he and the gang are back in school we watch as they go on their adventures of mischief. The classes seem harder and we get to see a real nice renderaing of a hippogriff. And once again we have a new professor for the Defense Against Dark Arts class. Who has a secret of his own. Where we depart from the other movies, is that we get to see the outside of Hogwarts. The full layout of Hogwarts, the surrounding landscape and get a feel for where it is located. You can almost get a feel for what it would be like to be there. The scenery is breath taking, showing that filming on location in Scotland was the correct choice.I would have given the movie five stars, but it left too much out. I think that this movie need to be 3 hours long. They glossed over some things and are missing some important details. Making some parts of the movie seem to not flow smoothly. But the movie is good and should be in every Harry Potter fans library.	4.0	A fun movie to watch	2004-12-21	3	3	0

The previous two by Chris Columbus were very good but they were laden with his trademark close-up shooting (as evident in the 'Home Alone' series).  The pulled back camera shows our aspiring witches and wizards as part of larger world and adds the element of mystery for the viewer.There are some very good special effects in this film and it was one of only three films nominated for an Oscar in 2004.  'Prisoner' is also the only Potter movie to make AFI's top 400 films of all time list.The only failure of film is we don't have enough time to fall in love with or even have the movie 'flesh out' the characters.  That seems to be the problem with all the films.It seems that no one has made the connection that most successful Potter film was the first and co-incidently the longest. Brevity has had no effect on the success of the Potter films so I don't know why its enforced.  I sure would have liked to linger longer in Cuaron's vision of Harry Potter's world...but I guess I have to be satisfied with what I can get.  I would like another helping of Cuaron and Potter...but it doesn't seem to be in the cards.This installment requires more thought by the viewer than the others...it probably won't be as well recieved by youngsters.

It is because from this one on, the franchise takes a turn into what it is supposed to be: a dark movie with scary moments and scary characters (dementors anyone?)... Being a fan of horror movies as I am, and I'm not saying this movie is a horror flick 'cause it's not; I like this movie 'cause is the beginning of a dark ride to a darker and dangerous end; and because this turn was well treated. Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with this movie taking a step in another less ""for kids movie"" direction into a darker unexplored territory. And this is good because that's what happen in the books too.Now, the purists will want to discuss at this point about book vs. movie but let's be honest: the plot was well treated and it felt right. Except for the omitted fact about who created the patronus and why Harry's patronus is what it is. If you really want to argue about book vs. movie, let's go to the HP6 movie...Enough with the movie, let's talk about the product:Fact: There is no extended edition whatsoeverFact: The whole package is a little bit bigger than the usual size of a bluray caseFact: We all would love an extended edition but let's face it; it's not gonna happenBut that's about it. No more cons for me to tell. I'm really glad with my Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban Ultimate Edition on Bluray. It has everything they say it had (the 2 blu's, the dvd, the collectible cards, the book, etc) all wrapped up in a fancy shiny way. All inside a very strong cardboard box, which seems very resistant so the content will be safe in there.I started my HP UE collection with this movie just because I like this one.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	The third movie in the Harry Potter franchise brings us a new director in the form of Alfonso Cuaron.  While there are some obvious stylistic changes to the movie, it still expertly captures the third book in the series.This year finds Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) facing a personal threat from day one.  Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban.  His betrayal led to the deaths of Harry's parents years ago.  Everyone assumes that Black is heading to Hogwarts to kill Harry and avenge You Know Who's death.  Is he out to get Harry?  Will he catch up with our young hero?Naturally, as the books get longer in the series, the films have to cut more out.  This one does a decent job by cutting out most of the Quidditch matches and streamlining the plot.  The plot loses some of the twists and bumps, but it certainly works.  I first saw it without having read the books and really enjoyed it.  Only now that I've read the books do I know the details I was missing.  While they help, they aren't necessary to enjoy the film.Having watched the first three films in such close proximity, I really noticed the difference in the films this time.  If you are paying attention, it's obvious they've changed the setting for Hogwarts.  Even the insides of the castle look different with the Great Hall being less ornate but the halls have many more portraits.  These are minor things and didn't hamper my enjoyment of the film at all.The cast does their normal great job.  All three of our leads are growing into fine young actors.  Michael Gambon takes over the part of Headmaster Dumbledore, and he does a great job.  There is a little difference, but not much.  The special effects are once again amazing.Book purists may be disappointed by the changes made to the story.  But I think you'd hard pressed to find a better film version of this book no matter who was involved.	5.0	Different Director; Great Adaptation	2007-07-01	2	2	0

So here's what I've got to say. First off,I know, from the official site that the Sequence around theKnightBus will be down very well. Also, they didn't ""direct"" out the part when Hermoine puches Malfoy. Beyond that I don't knowmuch more.Okay, now here's other things I would like to say. First off,they may have been able to get away with only one quidditch scene in the first two movies, but they HAVE to have at least two quidditch scenes in the third movie. Now I know from the sitethat the one aganst Hufflepuff when the dementors make Harryfall off his broom is a sure thing, but I will rase formal complants if that is the only game. They have to at least have one of the other games, vs. Ravenclaw or vs. Slytherin because of Harry's new FireBolt. I can see a way they can write out the Ravenclaw game, but they have to leave in the Slytherin if they do. Mind, there is a way to get only one quidditch scene in the movie, but it would be such a slaughter of the story that I dout they would do it on risk of starting a riot.Now, as many of you have wondered, Where is Peeves? Well, the only sign of him in the movies is in the troll scene in the first movie ""How could a troll get in? probably Peeves playing a joke"" says Ron. So, To Movie MAkers Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Where is Peeves?Darnit!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A317SKV5OC4SE8	Mark Talmadge	There has always been a huge problem with filmmakers and movie studios always blowing dust when they try to make a movie which is massively popular as Harry Potter. I've never really understood understood the fascination with the books but I became a fan of the Harry Potter movies when I went to the theatres to see the first two films.While I've never read the books, the first two films were cleverly made and they were enjoyable to watch. The problem this time around? Alfonso Cuaron does not know what he's doing because I found myself confused as to the direction of the movie, very little dialogue was evident to hodl my attention and the stiff acting by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was so bad I fell asleep watching this movie.Again, the proble was ... this film was loosely based on the nove.I'm a very firm believer that there are no such terms as bad actors. Cuaron's adaption had no sense of direction, left me (as a potential future fan of this series) bored out of my mind with no inclination to watch this particular entry again in the future. The only cool part of the movie were the scenes with the Hippogriff.Also, due to the fact that this book was longer than the previous two films, this film should have been longer and the film suffered intolerably that I could not recommend this film to anyone. Waterworld and Titanic were ten times more better than this drudgery of a movie.	1.0	Worst movie in history	2004-11-24	21	5	16
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3P79SMS0HQ2BK	Mark Twain	Some movie-loving wizards must have cast a magic spell on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, because it's another grand slam for the Harry Potter franchise. Demonstrating remarkable versatility after the arthouse success of Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n proves a perfect choice to guide Harry, Hermione, and Ron into treacherous puberty as the now 13-year-old students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry face a new and daunting challenge: Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and for reasons yet unknown (unless, of course, you've read J.K. Rowling's book, considered by many to be the best in the series), he's after Harry in a bid for revenge. This dark and dangerous mystery drives the action while Harry (the fast-growing Daniel Radcliffe) and his third-year Hogwarts classmates discover the flying hippogriff Buckbeak (a marvelous CGI creature), the benevolent but enigmatic Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), horrifying black-robed Dementors, sneaky Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), and the wonderful advantage of having a Time-Turner just when you need one. The familiar Hogwarts staff returns in fine form (including the delightful Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson as the goggle-eyed Sybil Trelawney), and even Julie Christie joins this prestigious production for a brief but welcome cameo. Technically dazzling, fast-paced, and chock-full of Rowling's boundless imagination (loyally adapted by ace screenwriter Steve Kloves), The Prisoner of Azkaban is a Potter-movie classic.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -- A true film	2004-10-01	13	4	9

Smith Jr.	"I've developed quite a fondness for these movies, even before my kids decided they were cool.  But Azkaban was missing the charm and magic (no pun intended) of the first two under the direction of Chris Columbus.  This new guy injected a dark and dreary atmosphere that undid the whimsical quality that Columbus accomplished.  It isn't just a different director's vision - it's a bad one.  This could have been any movie about some magic-oriented kids (did they really have to lose the school uniforms and just hang around in jeans?).  There was nothing Harry Potter about it other than the names.  It just missed the mark.Still, it's not a total loss.  If you like the first two just be prepared for a different experience.  As a movie fan I generally find good qualities in all movies and this is no exception.  Gone is the ""discovery"" phase of Potter and Friends.  What's here now is the gang settling into their roles and ""universe"" to get down to business."	3.0	Not the best of the 3, but passable	2004-08-23	5	4	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3U02XWSCEESPP	Mary L Wagner	I very much liked Cuaron's vision of the books, particularly in POA, where the story takes a good hard look at the darker side of JK Rowling's detailed world.  It's easy to forget that Voldemort does not make an appearance in POA - the darkness comes from fear, prejudice, and allowing yourself to become evil in order to fight evil.Daniel Radcliffe simply is Harry Potter. He is an amazing young actor.  Rupert and Emma have grown into their craft, which must have something to do with exposure to fine directors and some of the greatest actors in British theater. Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and Gary Oldman are excellent additions to the cast, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in future installments.  David Thewlis is a great actor, but just did not fit my picture of Lupin.  Oh well.Although I generally didn't miss the Quidditch (there are 3 matches in the book and 1 in the film,) I did miss the scene where Harry unleashes his Patronus against what he thinks is Dementors, but is actually Draco & cronies.The Dementors were wonderful - really frightening.  The use of ice to mark their passing, and the blurring of Harry and Sirius when they are attacked by the Dementors was very effective.I wasn't very happy with the werewolf or the Grim.  The Grim looked more like a wolf, rather than my vision of a large bear-like dog (I was thinking scruffy Newfoundland), and the werewolf looked like a thing, obviously not something that would take some observation to distinguish from a real wolf.Back to Cuaron, he paces POA much more briskly, a desperately needed change from the stately (okay, slow) first two installments. Evil's menace and wizardry's potential for chaos are much more evident in this installment. Finally, the grace notes he's added are completely in keeping with Rowling's world.He would be an excellent choice to direct Order of the Phoenix.	5.0	Great Adaptation	2004-06-11	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3PLAFUP3TS6D0	Matt Bailey	Within 60 seconds of the 3rd Harry Potter film, you know that you are in for a very different experience. In what I saw as almost a hommage to the film that made him most recently famous, Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n slipped a masturbation gag into the start of a Harry Potter film.Hold onto your (pointed) hats as this, as has been much touted, is a darker outing, but it's also much funnier and the dialogue is handled much better, with rich ermotional moments allowed to be played out, rather than glossed over until the next Quiddich match. A growing attraction between characters and even (gasp) blossoming sexuality is allowed to be seen but not over explained or sugar coated.The characters are the real stars and a surprising joy is seeing how much these kids have grown, both physically and emotionally. Neville Longbottom took a couple of glances to even recognise.The CGi is generally top notch. Buckbeak, although, looked rubbery at first, but improved much on close up and the werewolf looked more pathetic than scary, repeated viewing may prove this intentional though. The Dementors are fantastic, looking like a cross between the Grim Reaper and LOTR's Nazgul.The whole feel of the film is more open and less 'studio-bound', the exterior shots of Hogwarts look less CGi constructed than the previous films and a healthy dose of Tim Burton inspired sets and camera moves lends more gravity to the story, rather than distracting from it. Even obvious studio scenes, such as in The Leaky Couldron, are expanded with little vinettes played out in the background by the supporting characters. The Whomping Willow takes a comic turn, as a sort of seasonal narrator marking the passing of time in classic 2nd bannana style.If you know the book backwards, you actually will be pleased with the liberties taken with the plot and timing to improve the cinematic storyline, whereas if you don't know the book, you won't feel left out or preached to, as the previous versions sometimes seemed to do.This is the best Harry Potter film by far and I really feel that Goblet of Fire will stuggle to match it.	4.0	A Richer Palatte Lifts 'Azcaban' Above The Rest	2004-06-14	1	1	0

But the reason I bought the first two Ultimate Editions was primarily to own extended editions of the films.  Warner Brothers is stating that they asked the directors if they wanted to make directors cuts and they both said no.  I find that just idiotic.  With all that extra footage....and I hear there is a lot....forget the directors.  Have a disc of the original and then just make and extended edition without the directors' inputs.  People love extended editions and would pay to see them on this package.  Just look at the negativity surrounding the Lord of the Rings release.  Many, many people would not buy it because it was not the extended editions.  Same thing will apply here.  I guarantee this will not sell nearly as well as the first two editions primarily because of the lack of an extended version.  When will these companys learn?

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	"What a delight ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was to me! I liked the first two movies in the series. I loved this one. Partly, this is because I am an adult, and this darker, but not necessarily more serious installment, is more compelling. It seems much more in tune with the awesome responsibilities that would come with being a wizard - if, of course, there really was such a thing! Also, I think children are much more attuned to their primordial beginnings than are adults. As we mature and become increasingly material and obsessed with security, we are perhaps more likely to be scared by `things that go bump' in the night than are children. I remember as a child being both more scared by, but ultimately more in tune with, Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" than I was by ""The Lady and the Tramp"".In this installment, Harry [Daniel Radcliffe] and his best friends, Hermoine and Ron [Emma Watson and Rupert Grint] arrive for their third year at Hogwarts School to find more turmoil than ever. An allegedly evil wizard named Sirius Black [Gary Oldman] has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is making his way to the school, which is essentially in `lock down' and being guarded by hideously threatening demons. It appears that Black is making his way to the school in order to kill Harry, heir to a very powerful family of sorcerers.Here, Harry and his friends have entered adolescence. They are more awkward than they were in the first two films. They are also more endearing. [If you watch trailers for the original movie, you will be amazed to see how much these actors have grown.] Childhood lays in tatters behind them, adulthood looms before them as a major challenge.Alas, the remarkable Richard Harris died before this episode was filmed. He is ably replaced by the great Ian McKellan as Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts. As one might expect, Gary Oldham amazes as Sirius Black. Not for the first time, I didn't know it was Oldman playing the role until the credits rolled. How does he do it?Breathing new life into the series is director Alfonso Cuaron, who replaced Chris Columbus. Cuaron directed one of my favorite children's films, """"The Little Princess"", as well as one of my favorite ADULT films, ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". He's a filmmaker to watch.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is highly recommended."	5.0	Far and away, the best in the series	2004-11-28	7	3	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AEIMAAXO4B1OH	mattynichs	A complaint I just made to WB:To who will listen:I am absolutely DISGUSTED. The way this company has swindled Harry Potter fans by releasing TRUE ultimate editions of movies 1 & 2 in 2009, only to release FAKE ultimate editions the year after, is appalling. When the marketing campaign started for these ultimate editions last year, there was ABSOLUTELY NO indication that WB would release extended editions of the movies one year only to turn around and only release theatrical versions the year after.I am not an idiot. I know exactly what the purpose was. This is another opportunity to screw fans over, plain and simple. This company should have accepted the fact that they missed their chance to release theatrical ultimate editions first, and then extended ultimate editions of the movies thereafter. This is a very very sad state of affairs when the respect of devoted fans, who have committed so much of themselves to a film franchise, are not taken into ANY consideration.I challenge anyone at this company to refute these claims as anything other than sleezy. There is no other way to describe it, and you know it. The decision makers knew full well what they were doing. They made the conscious decision that they did not care about the fan. They knew this was a dirty practice and they went on with it anyways.In the grand scheme of things am I going to lose my health or financial stability over this, of course not. However, I am being reminded that I live in a society where the opportunity to squeeze the greatest amount of profit is ALWAYS going to be considered a just act regardless of what it requires. Great job, you have also now justified why people download movies. By not being forthright with your decision process you have alienated a large number of movie goers. I can only assume that I am one of many people writing in to complain about this.So again, in closing, I challenge someone higher up at Warner Brothers to respond to this rant. Please, give me something to enjoy after being treated like this. There is nothing you can say that will justify these actions. It was done PURELY for the money at the expense of the fan. If I never hear anything from this, I will not only take it as a sign of cowardice, but also as a sign that you, executives of Warner Brothers, can not explain this.So thank you Warner Brothers executives, for placing a slight disdain in my mouth for a franchise that has been nothing but wonderful for me to grow up enjoying. How much money did you project you will earn from this move? Was it really worth it? I hope so.	1.0	fake ultimate editions	2010-10-20	9	7	2

Harry turns his aunt into a balloon?. Escapes from a dangerous murderer?. Learns even more magic, and gets too know a not too friendly werewolf?. Yes, I know that all that isn?t likely to happen neither to you nor to me, but it certainly is normal enough for Harry Potter. And why can?t we share the fun? :)You have read the books?. Well, then you will love this movie, and the previous ones. Of course, the films aren?t exactly like the books, because the directors always have to modify them due to time constraints. However, they stay faithful to the spirit that makes J. K. Rowlings books something so special, and that is not a small feat.You haven?t read the books?. Don?t panic!!. That is not necessary in order to enjoy this movie, although a piece of advice is pertinent in your case. If after watching this movie you run like a maniac to the nearest bookstore, in order to purchase all the books in the Harry Potter series, don?t worry. You are not an oddity: that has happened to many. As a matter of fact, that is exactly what happened to me after watching &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;.Now, what can I say about &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;?. To start with, I would like to highlight the fact that this film is a little bit scarier than the previous ones, but it is also more realistic, making magic seem real. In this movie, something quite difficult is accomplished: the characters are allowed to grow, and thus aren?t forced to remain boring stereotypes. Hermione is no longer the &quot;perfect student&quot; all the time (would a &quot;perfect student&quot; hit another student?), and we get to see Harry as someone quite capable of hate...If I had to choose my favorite scene, I probably wouldn?t be capable of choosing just one: the film is too good for that. However, I thought that some scenes were specially good, for example that in which Harry flying on Hagrid?s pet, or the one with Snape as Neville?s boggart.Regarding the director of this movie, Alfonso Cuaron, I can only say that he did what was expected of him, and much more. This movie is spectacular, and a lot of the merit for that goes to Cuaron. I only hope he directs another of the movies based on J. K. Rowlings? books, soon. Alfonso Cuaron has told the press that he won?t direct the next one because he needs rest, but that he would like to the direct another. He has my total support :)The cast was uniformly good. You will probably love David Thewlis, the man playing Lupin. He is great, managing to convey kindness and melancholy at the same time. Gary Olman as Sirius Black is another great choice, but probably Emma Thompson as the erratic Professor Sybil Trelawney is the more interesting discovery among the new actors. Of course, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger are wonderful. It is easy to see that they are older, and that they know they craft better now. I want them to be part of all the seven movies (they are already filming the 4th one), but that is only going to happen if those responsible for making the movies hurry up, because these kids are growing fast :)In my opinion, this was a great movie. I only wish it were much longer, because many events that were in the book were not included in this film. Despite that, I think that I can safely recommend &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; to you. On the whole, unbelievably good... But you?d better believe it, and go to watch the film, because it is real !!!Belen Alcat	5.0	Unbelievably good, but real  :)	2004-06-05	5	2	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AXEO7X634SLVR	"MB ""MB"""	As stated, this does not include the extended version. I went back and looked at the promo for the Ultimate Versions( I saved it ) and it definitely says that all the Ultimate Editions will included extended versions. Warner Bros. seems to want another opportunity to make even more off the fans when it does release the extended versions. They have a general phone number, where people that want to complain about this, can call. It is long distance and you need to tell the receptionist what you want to complain about and you will be forwarded to at least a voice mail. ( 818 954-6000 ) I think if everyone that detests these sort of practices called and voiced their objections, maybe they would get the message that people will not stand for anything less than what was advertised as to what the Ultimate Editions would contain.To those of you who opened their videos only to be disappointed and disgusted that they could not be returned once opened, I believe that is what WB washoping for. People being so excited ,thinking that they were receiving exactly the same delightful product that was contained in the Ultimate Editions 1 & 2 , that they overlooked the fine print. I for one would like to at least see WB give us an apology and offer to refund any that were opened under the mistaken impression that what they were getting was identical to the first two Ultimate Editions that were released last year.	1.0	love the movie .hate being fleeced	2010-10-22	18	14	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A31FI3OQKFWQ7O	M. Bowling	PoA has been my fav of the books and now it is my fav of teh movies also. Everyone saying the movie was to dark and had no color, you must be color blind. I saw color. A lot of it. Alfonso Cuaron should in fact direct Goblet of Fire because Harry, Ron, Hermine(coud never spell her name), and the others are growing up and so is everyone else that is watching these movies. Columbus i think made the movies so childish. Thats why i never watched the movies after teh fifth time. He just came out and told you everything. You didnt have to think and you didnt enjoy the movies. Now Cauron made you think a bit. He never told us what the dementors accually did untill near the end so the audience that didnt no was kept in suspense. If i had never the book and i had been watching the movie, i would have been dying to know what they did. And everyone complaining about the new position of hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, i did not mind because acually, when i read the books, i pictured the hut away from castle. Columbus had it near the castle. I never did like that. Now before i end this review, let me say this. I loved the movie and people reading the review that has never sean the movie and are deciding whether or not to spend the money, dont listen to anyone with a 1,2, or 3 rating star on the movie. Those are people that dont like change and wish everything in the world to be like they want it to be. Go out and buy the movie. Its only 15 dollars where i live.

All you get here is packaging and an extra disk of extras. No, thank you.I haven't spoken to a single person who didn't want these films to contain more, and we know more exist. So WB screwed up royally.As for the film, it's one of the best of the series, not because it's faithful to the book (it's not) but because it works as a film, because it's the best acting to date, because the pacing works, and because the look fits the mood. Unfortunately if you haven't read the book you will fall into sever plot-holes, though the film over-all is gratifying, if you don't know the book you might be left wondering about several things when you leave the theater.Great film, but buy the standard dvd/blu-ray, this version is just WB cash-in.	5.0	Ultimate Edition Review:	2004-09-10	19	10	9

He's so cute! Especially with all that messed up hair. What is it with guys with messed up hair, they look ultra cute? All the actors, especially the three main ones, have settled much better into their roles now, are more relaxed, and look like they're having fun.There's a lot in this film (as usual) that has been left out, in favour of making the film move quicker, which failed in my opinion. The Marauder's stuff for instance, is left behind, and is sorely missed.What's starting to get on my nerves (and did in the books too), is the whole ""are-they-aren't-they"" storylines that keep cropping up. This has been overdone everywhere, and JK doesn't do well putting it in the books. I hate guessing at stuff. I always end up wrong. Snape is also losing out, as he's not in the films as much as he is in the books, so they'd better start putting him in a LOT more. And why isn't Harry's Patronus shown as a stag? Or is that only shown later? I hated with a passion the shrunken heads (which seemed to feature quite a bit in some of the extras), JK should never have allowed them to include something which she never originally ""invented"", although she claims to like them. Why?! I love the timetravel stuff, it was very well done, and much better than the way it came across in the books. There's a pinch of Cinderella & very obviously, Back To The Future there.I didn't find the Dementors that scary, although I probably would have done if I was younger. They gave me the heebie jeebies, as did Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, oh my God, that has to be the scariest man alive! Brrrrrrrr. Emma Thompson is unrecognisable, but barely used. I loved discovering the symbolism of the ravens & crows, as they're symbols of the Dementors.What was my favourite part of this whole movie? There was a few, but definitely the bit where Hermione punched Malfoy. I was jumping up & down in my seat when that happened. It's shown much better in the trailer however - there's no hesitation, it's shown she just walks straight up to him, and punches him.During the credits on the Marauder's Map watch for:Footprints that turn into paw prints.Footprints that chase other footprints.Cat prints that chase owl printsExtra-large footprints by Robbie Coltrane's creditFootprints that take special interest in the closing credits' creatorTwo pairs of footprints in a scandalous configuration in a corner turretFootprints that scurry away when the page covering them is liftedFootprints that get stuck in an alcoveFootprints that walk into a room labeled ""The Grindylow Lagoon,"" then sink.The extras are definitely improving (apart from the shrunken heads), and we get more of an insight into the characters from the actual actors for a change. (Where the &*@ is Alan Rickman though?) I loved all the interviews (done by British guy Johnny Vaughan), but especially Daniel's, Emma's & Rupert's. The games were hopeless as ever though - they need to buck up their ideas for the games, cos if an adult (me) can't get through them, how do they expect a child to do so? Or am I just stupid?Look out for Ian Brown in Hogsmeade!!!I'm still waiting for November 18th. Goblet of Fire better be better than this, yet again with a different director.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3FEJUAGAGO4J3	Meg Cummins	I loved the book, so maybe my expectations were too high going into the theater.  To see your favorite book made live will obviously disappoint a bit, but i wasn't expecting this.  If I had never read the books I would have probably have loved the movie, so this probably isn't the fairest review ever, but oh well.  They deviated so much from the book.  The main bits were there, but things were moved around, ignored, or just tweaked to make it fit into the time allowed.  It was a shame really, becuase like I said I love this book.  But as other reviews have said, the best Harry Potter movies will be those in your head, while you read the book.  Go see the movie, but definately don't go expecting it to follow the book.	3.0	Sad	2004-06-06	2	0	2

While this is merely technical, I am not fond of the new packaging, and am highly dissapointed that it has strayed from the box-set versions presented with the last two.As for the film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderfully entertainign film, but if you are a fan of the books, you wil be too obsorbed by the text, with fair reason, to be able to enjoy the work done. JK rowling wrote a book,a dnyou must decide weather you find see it fit to change that story the way this film has. I personally am on the fence.All together, it is a must have for any hard-core potter fan, even if you find yourself at a bridge of dissapointment ont he films focus. For those ""not-so-harry"" fans, you will enjoy this film with great pleasure, but the story may be at a loss to you have you not read the books.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A6TGC7Z15GKFP	Meg	As a huge Harry Potter fan, I cannot see how anyone could have enjoyed the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie.  This book is the best one in the entire series and I never thought it could be ruined.  Before the release of the movie I thought to myself, how can it be bad since the book is so good?  Well, the movie positvely butchered the book.  The cast was fine, the acting was good, computer animation was great, but c'mon!  Was the movie even based on the book because I couldn't tell!  The movie was so unlike the book in countless ways!  They added a lot of unnecessary things, yet left out some very important information.  I don't know how they expect to make more movies because so much was left out of this one. People who only see the movies will be totally confused.  So, if you are a big fan of the Harry Potter books, I do not recommend seeing this movie, much less buying it.	1.0	Huge disappointment	2005-01-04	12	10	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3BTO6T9TDEH6N	Me	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the best book in the series, and in my opinion, is also the best film. I feel that the actors (namely Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) have improved in leaps and bounds since the Philosopher's Stone days, when i for one was not overly impressed with their acting.I agree with many of the views expressed here that it is a very good film, but i found it annoying as well. Little things in all three films have changed from the books. Harry's father (in the books) was a chaser, but in the films he was a seeker. Harry's eyes are mentioned numerous times in the books to be green, like his mother Lily's. Yet in the films they are blue. In Prisoner of Azkaban though, the factor that really annoyed me was with the Marauders' Map, where 'Moony' is written 'Mooney'. You might think I'm being nit-picky, but this was immediately obvious to me in the cinema, and i have only watched it once. Surely, J.K.Rowling would have seen the film before it was released? As would the directors, editors and actors? How come nobody picked up on this mistake? Or the previous ones mentioned? I would have thought that J.K.Rowling would have spotted it, as she is the person who knows the Potter universe the best. For such widely publicised and known books and films, i feel that these mistakes should have been rectified. Somebody had to have noticed them, and for me, they detracted from the enjoyment of watching what is, fundamentally, a brilliant story.	4.0	Needs proof-watching	2004-10-31	20	9	11

That being the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map; Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs.  In the book much more is explained about Harry's father and the relationship he had with his fellow students (the Professors with whom Harry is now interacting).  Also, the history behind why Pettigrew, James, and Sirius became animagus (to empathize with Lupin).  It would have taken only a few minutes for one of the chracters to explain to Harry about the map, perhaps in the scene with Lupin at the end when he returns the map to Harry. All the back story fits - nothing contradicts the book, they just didn't bother putting the explanation in there, and I thought it was very important to the story.  Maybe they have saved this information for the 4th movie, I haven't watched it yet - but I felt that was a serious omission on the part of this film.  Otherwise, I found it entertaining and true to the book.	3.0	Don't read this review if you haven't read the book!	2007-07-18	2	2	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TPAG6HM8EN8L	"Melanie N. Lee ""mnl_1221"""	"I became a Harry Potter fan only over the past four years.  Although some of my nieces have been into the series for years, I didn't really get ""turned on"" until I bought a VHS edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban off the street and popped it into my VCR.  Wow!What impressed me most, of course, were the psychological underpinnings of the Boggart and the Dementors.  The boggart (think ""boogeyman""), who takes the shape of what we fear most, represents Terror, our fear of the future and of what can happen.  The more dangerous Dementors, who can suck the soul out of a person, feed on high emotions and leave their victims reliving their most horrific memories.  If the Boggart represents Terror, the Dementors represent Horror--our paralysis and fear over things that have happened to us in the past.As new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin tells 13-year-old Harry Potter, ""The Dementors affect you most because you have true horrors in your past""--that is, the murder by Voldemort of Harry's parents and the attempted murder upon Harry himself.  Harry himself is already frightened by the escaped prisoner Sirius Black, jailed for betraying James and Lily Potter to Voldemort and of murdering the Potters' friend Peter Pettigrew.  When Harry eavesdrops upon some adults and hears these details, his fear of Sirius turns into a determination to kill him.Meanwhile, Remus Lupin--who has his own secrets--teaches Harry to defend himself against the Dementors by conjuring a Patronus--a silvery-white animal force that chases Dementors away.  A joyous thought and the spell ""Expecto Patronum!"" conjures up the beast that repels Dementors, showing how joy and spiritual covering can protect us from depression and from the demonic.A ""Maurader's Map"" showing secret entries and the whereabouts of everyone in Hogwarts, plus a secret involving a close associate of the Weasley family, provides Harry more clues to the truth about Sirius Black and the real reason why he escaped.  The story unfolds revealing more about James, Lily, and their schoolfriends, showing how the past, and how one's parents, impact one's life today.Another exciting aspect of this story is Hermione's experiments with an overloaded schedule, which lead her and Harry to pursue a time-travel adventure which reflects even more upon the power of the past.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban touched me for three reasons: the Dementors portrayed as bad policemen who care nothing for justice and everything for power, who in their lust for nourishment don't distinguish between the guilty and the vulnerable; the psychological truth about depression and about joy as its antidote; and the spiritual truth about protection provided by the Father figure (""Patronus"").  From this film, I eagerly pursued and viewed the other films, and then read the Harry Potter novels, which are so exciting and so deep, filled with many spiritual and psychological insights."	5.0	The most profound of Harry Potter movies	2011-12-19	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26D8Q9PMJI6B	Mel Daniels	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third movie in the Harry Potter series. The usual cast is back, along with some new additons.I thought POA was a little bit of a let down because of the way it was made. The change of director was obvious, yet it was good to see the Harry Potter world through another directors eyes.Chris Columbus, who directed the first two movies, played it very safe in the way they looked, which, at the time suited the movie. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has made them more grown up to suit the time in which they are in. He knows that the cast of characters are now teenagers and he has responed to that by dressing them differently and by what they say. The core actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) have also matured as actors and have brought their own sense of magic onto the screen, we can see this by how they choose to portray their character in certain scenes.I was a little disapointed that some bits of the book were left out of the movie, yet there was nothing their that didn't explain itself. I feel it would have been better is Harry had recieved his firebolt on Christmas (book) than he did at the end of the movie. Also, when Harry, Ron and the rest of the thrid-year Gryffindors were eating sweets in their dorm, it wasn't in the book, so (in my opinion) why put it in the movie? I feel it would hvae been better to put something else from the book into the movie in place of that 2 minute scene.This film, i felt, was very dark. Not the plot, but the lighting sceme, i don't know if this was to add effect or not, but their wern't too many bright and happy days, which is understandable because of the darkness of the plot.I feel the ending of the film should not have been a freeze-frame on Harry's face, instead she should have flown of camera and we were left with the lake in the background. The closing credits were fantastic though.Overall Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great movie. A little darker than the dirst two, but still just as good. I recomend it to anyone.	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-12-09	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KEZLJ59C1JVH	Melissa Niksic	"""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is probably my favorite book in the Harry Potter series, so I guess I'm a little biased when I say that it's the best of the three films. However, I think Alfonso Cuaron is the real reason behind that. This is a BEAUTIFUL movie. What struck me the most about it was how many gorgeous ""pictures"" of Hogwarts Cuaron created throughout the film. He's always been one of my favorite directors, and I think ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is his best film to date.The kids have grown up even more since the last film, especially Neville, who doesn't look like the same person he was in the last film. (He got really tall and lost all his baby fat!) Harry's voice is deeper now (Ron shocked us all with his mature voice in ""Chamber of Secrets""), and Emma is becoming a very pretty young woman. It was nice to see all ""my kids"" again!As always, the entire cast gives an amazing performance. The kids were fabulous, of course, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. I was very disappointed when I initially learned of that casting decision because I had always envisioned Ralph Fiennes in the role, but Thewlis was perfect. (They've yet to make any casting mistakes with these films, so I won't let myself worry about things like that ever again.) Except for his voice, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is almost identical to the way Richard Harris played the character, which is comforting (albeit a bit creepy).Emma Thompson is hilarious as Sybil Trelawney, but she was only in two scenes, which was very disappointing. My favorite new character was Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Everything Oldman does is amazing, and this role was no exception. Oldman doesn't have much screen time in ""Azkaban,"" but he was brilliant. I can't wait to watch him in the next two films.The music and special effects were amazing, for the most part. I liked the fact that John Williams threw some jazzy melodies into the mix to liven things up a bit. And the special effects were amazing! Lupin as a werewolf, Sirius as a dog, the dementors (so creepy!), the Whomping Willow, Aunt Petunia's inflating incident...everything was great. The only special effect I was actually disappointed in was Harry's patronus. I always envisioned the stag being much larger than it was portrayed in the film. It was just this regular-size stag that was on the screen for a fraction of a second. I expected a lot more than that.Obviously, some material from the book had to be cut. The only real gripe I have with this movie is that, unlike the first two films which stand pretty well on their own, I think that people who haven't read ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" will be a bit lost at several points in the movie. This film glosses over several details that are relatively minor, but which could easily lead to some confusion for those who haven't read J.K. Rowling's novel (Harry's permission slip for Hogsmeade, the tension between Ron and Hermione over Crookshanks and Scabbers, Buckbeack's trial, etc.)The biggest thing that was omitted from the film was the story behind the Animagi.  We never find out who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs really are and why they all became Animagi in the first place.  That's one of the best (and most important) parts of the book and it was completely omitted from the movie.Since most people who see this film have (hopefully!) already read the book, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. However, if you analyze the movie by itself, there are definitely a few minor holes in the plot. And since the film only ran for two hours and fifteen minutes, there's no reason at all why Cuaron couldn't have allotted himself another fifteen or twenty minutes to tie up some loose ends. (""Goblet of Fire"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"" are going to have to be at least three to three and a half hours long to cover enough material, don't you think?""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was rated PG, and I personally think that some of the scenes were pushing into PG-13 mode. However, think of what will happen in the next two films. If ""Azkaban"" had been given a PG-13 rating, then ""Goblet of Fire"" and ""Phoenix"" would probably have to be rated R, and that's just not right. These are supposed to for kids, after all."	5.0	The best of the Harry Potter films so far!	2004-06-07	0	0	0

The movie is a way too short 2 hrs 19 mins, which may be because that's about the limit of a child's attention span, but the movie really needed to be about 3 hours.  Too much material was left out in transition from the book to the screen.  I don't want to reveal too much, but true Harry Potter book fans will definitely recognize what I'm talking about.  Overall, it was still a good movie, and fans of the movies who have not read the book will undoubtedly love this movie.

My mother forbid me to watch and well what did i do? i watched it. Always the rebel. Anyways i felt that this was as faithful to the book as a movie adapted from a book could be.I liked the first two but really felt as if they were kids movies.But with the 4th, 5th, and 6th book, Rowling takes a complete u-turn from happy kiddie book and movie, to an adult level with suspense, terroe, death, and the ultimate battle between good and evil. The director of this film, apparently wanted to start that dark journey early. I dont disagree with this move at all. To me it tells parents of younger children, that it gets a lot darker and worse here on out. Fortunately i only one or two gripes about this adaptation. For one, i didnt like that the patronus was portrayed as a shield instead of a Stag that chases the dementors down. my second gripe is a minor one but it was a bit disappointing to me anyway, was when they were in the shrieking shack and Hermione told Lupin she knew he was a werewolf, he explained why the shrieking shack got it's name and told a small side story of James, Sirius and Peter. I know it's stupid to be mad about that but thats me. But other then that i loved the film and cannot wait to see the last 4 movies because they become a little darker and i am excited for the 7th and final book.	4.0	Back for year 3 at Hogwarts.	2005-10-15	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	"In 2004, J. K. Rowling's book ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was brought to the big screen under the direction of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, who is best known for his direction of the 2001 Mexican film ""Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n"".  The producer of this third film, Chris Columbus, not only produced the two previous Harry Potter films, but also directed them.  He did a superb job of not deviating that much from J. K. Rowling's first two books, but Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's interpretation of the third book deviated a lot more, in spite of the fact that the same screenplay writer, Steven Kloves, was kept from the first two films.  For those who have read the third book, the film focuses primarily upon the main plot from the book, which is the escape of the convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from the dreaded Azkaban prison, as well as those side plots that interlace directly with the main plot.  However, several side plots that were written in the book but not directly related to the main plot were either left out of the film entirely or altered significantly. As in the book, the film opens with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) at the home of his Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Penunia Dursley (Fiona Shaw) and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) towards the end of his summer break from Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft.  Unfortunately for Harry, his Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) comes to visit before school starts and she treats him worse than the Dursleys.  After making some very snide remarks about Harry and his parents, Aunt Marge gets to experience first hand some of Harry's magical powers, but it was not intentional.  Scared, Harry decided to run from the Dursley's home and somehow make his way to Diagon Alley to wait for the start of his third year of school.  As in the book, the Knight Bus arrives just as Harry sees something in the dark not far from the Dursley's home and takes him to Diagon Alley.  To his surprise, Harry is met by the Minister of Magic himself, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), when he arrives at the Leaky Cauldron and doesn't have to wait long to find the entire Weasley family and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) waiting for him as well.  The film gets a lot more interesting after they board the Hogwarts Express, and things heat up even more at Hogwarts itself with its headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) not too happy with the dementors of Azkaban lurking about.  (Sadly, the venerable actor Richard Harris, who played Albus Dumbledore in the previous two films, passed away in 2002 shortly before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"".)  The divination professor is introduced in this story, Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and Hogwarts has a new professor against the dark arts in Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) plays a more significant role in this story than the previous two.The special effects and cinematography in the third film were superbly done, but it is evident that Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's direction was considerably different as compared to Chris Columbus' direction of the first two films.  Other returning characters include Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Mr. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams), George & Fred Weasley (Oliver & James Phelps) and Mrs. Molly Weasley (Julie Walters).  The fat lady in the painting was played by the very talented British comedic actress Dawn French.  She starred in the British comedy series ""The Vicar of Dibley"" and has worked closely with Jennifer Saunders of the British comedy TV series ""Absolutely Fabulous"".Overall, I very much enjoyed the film version of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", but its increased deviation from the original book as compared to the first two films causes me to rate the film with 4 stars instead of 5.  Had the film's length been increased by another 20 to 30 minutes, it would have been possible to portray more of the significant side plots more closely to what J. K. Rowling originally wrote."	4.0	"""He's at Hogwarts... He's at Hogwarts..."""	2004-06-16	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1N0LCPR7O7OLL	"M. Hencke ""m hencke"""	"Let me start off by stating for the record that I have not read any of the books.  I am going to soon read Goblet of Fire though after seeing this film...But...Now on to my review.  This has got to be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen and I am a big fan of the genre.  I have not seen Y Tu Mama Tambien yet so I went into this film thinking it was going to be just another sequel in the series.  I thought the first films were good/entertaining but certainly not perfect and none of them were films I had any desire in buying or calling a personal favorite in any sense.  What was lacking in the first two for me was something that Chris Columbus used to do in his early screenplays (i.e. Gremlins, Young Sherlock Holmes)- Which was to give a child's fairy tale world a real sense of adult edge and dread.  All of that ""edge"" that was missing from the first two films can be found in this third installment by Cuaron.  What Cuaron does with this film is take it to a whole other level.  The effects are intense and hypnotic, the acting is above average this time out(some sincerely poignant moments in this one), the cinematography is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen, John William's score couldn't be better, and the production design/costumes/sets are overwhelmingly strong throughout.  Plus Gary Oldman was in it which is always a good thing.  This film and The Incredibles are the first movies in a long long time to make me feel like a kid again.  I am proud to give this film a HIGH ""5"" STAR recommendation.  If you saw the first two films and tuned out don't miss out on this incredible work of pop art. NOTE: Only thing bugging me now is that Cuaron is not returning to direct Goblet Of Fire which from what I understand is going to be helmed by Mike Newell who did Donnie Brasco (which is a great film to be sure)but two others he did ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" and ""Mona Lisa Smile"" are most certainly not."	5.0	Speechless	2004-11-28	8	4	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TJPMB7N776WS	MICHAEL ACUNA	"This installment of the Harry Potter franchise is absolutely magical. There is frankly no other word for it.Alfonso Cuaron has brought weight and substance along with treating young adults like they can actually think critically and more importantly reflect upon their lives with intelligence and feeling. Not that many, of course, watching this film will be able to relate personally to being a young wizard but they can relate to the personal side of Harry, Hermoine and even Professor Lupin's life. There is the fantastic and fanciful side of all these characters, as well as the more down-to-earth stuff that makes them human and thus we can all relate and empathize with their problems.On the physical production side, the special effects are superior especially after comparing them to say ""The Day After Tomorrow's"" sad, ineffectual display.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is first-rate film making appropriate for all ages and maturity levels 6-60.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0	Michael Butts	One can't say that this third entry of the Potter series isn't a good film; it's just a little disappointing with its aloofness and a time travel sequence that seems forced and contrived.  But don't blame Alfonso Cuerin; taking over for Chris Columbus, the Latin director infuses his own surrealistic and gothic style and we have some marvelous CGI effects.  The cast of youths continues to grow in their maturity and we have some fine support as always including Michael Gambon taking over for the late Richard Harris; Emma Thompson as a dotty divination teacher; a magical cameo from Julie Christie; David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith et al, do justice to their roles.  The preoccupation with Harry's parents has tended to grow a little redundant and Gary Oldman's character seems programmed and not as much fun as one might have expected.  But, it's enjoyable and I'm sure Potter purists are happier than punch.  I didn't find it quite as good as the previous two films, though.	4.0	DAZZLING BUT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING	2005-11-27	2	0	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3PPXVR5J6U2JD	"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien"""	"I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan.This is not to say that I don't appreciate Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling has brought fantasy to adults and children everywhere, and I'm extremely grateful for it. However, a lot of what she wrote is familiar to fans of fantasy - indeed, in some ways she's slyly retelling the Arthurian myth (oops, did I give that away?).As a result, I haven't read the books. So my critique of the movie is based on solely the movie standing on its own. This is important - the two women that I went to see it with missed flaws that confused me because they knew the backstory. If you're a raving Harry Potter fan, move on, there's nothing to see here. If you're an average Joe who may not be intimately familiar with the Harry Potter series, then we can commiserate.The movie starts with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finally doing what we've always wanted him to do - teach those muggle bullies a lesson. Indeed, much of this movie has wand waving and pointing in a manner that suggest harm if not death. Right away, we understand that Harry is mad and he's not going to take it anymore.Harry runs away from home, only to get picked up by a bus for homeless wizards. This wacky bus phases in and out of traffic, whips around hairpin turns, and is cheerfully narrated by a Jamaican shrunken head, all the while providing comfortable sleeping arrangements for down-on-their-luck wizards. From there it's off to the Leaky Cauldron. Fortunately, Harry doesn't get in trouble for ""blowing up his aunt"" - indeed, he is curiously free of all penalties or retribution for his unseemly magical behavior. Without repercussions or real consequences for his actions, Harry is united with his old friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Gint) and sent off to school, Monster Manual (that's an inside joke for you role-players) and all.It's there that Harry discovers none other than Sirius Black, a wizard who escaped from Azkaban, hunts him. The Dementors, a Ringwraith-like series of black shrouded floating ghosts who suck the life out of the living, in turn hunt Sirius. But who is Sirius really hunting and why?Because the Dementors are the long arm of the law, so to speak, they are tolerated at the school, but the headmaster (Michael Gambon, filling big shoes left by Richard Harris) warns that no one should ""give the Dementors a reason"" to harm a student.That introduction pretty much sums up the problem with the movie. The Prisoner of Azkaban wants to be grown up. The Dementors genuinely threaten Harry, and he deals with very real feelings of rage and frustration. He picks fights with bullies, struggles with classes, and kids whisper behind his back. But there are consequences for such actions and the movie often fails to take them into account.For example, Hermione is granted some exceedingly powerful magic that enables her to take two classes at the same time (!) and yet Harry isn't allowed on a school trip because he can't get a signed permission form from his stepparents. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), now an instructor for the exotic beasts class, exposes his students to a dangerous hippogriff and, duh, somebody gets hurt. Harry gets in trouble for using a magical map that shows the location of everyone in the school, but it's apparently okay for the kids to play quidditch in the middle of a lightning storm. You know, the game where they fly on broomsticks chasing flying METAL BALLS. Should we be surprised that someone gets hit by lightning? In comparison, Harry's encounter with Dementors seems tame.There are also some strange plot choices, such as having not one but two beings that transform into canines. Are viewers sophisticated enough to know the difference between a Grimm - a gigantic black moor hound - and a werewolf? Most unforgivable is the Massive Deus Ex Machina that is poorly explained and abruptly introduced, but manages to conveniently wraps up every loose end.That said, Prisoner of Azkaban is a beautifully visualized movie, a sort of Gormenghast version of the earlier cheery installments. Alfonso Cuaron films everything through a dark lens, but with a humorous aside. Yes, this is a darker, scarier movie, but it's all in fun.The actors are a mixed bag. Radcliffe doesn't display a lot of range in a role that demands much - weeping is not his forte. Gint isn't much better. His character is still a caricature, a bumbling scaredy cat that seems a little too attached to his pet rat Scabbers. The nature of the pets are never truly explained - are they familiars and thus important to magic or merely pets? If they're just pets, why would the school tolerate them? If they're familiars, Ron should be in big trouble for repeatedly losing Scabbers.David Thewlis is superb as Professor Lupin, alternately playing a sad and extremely intelligent professor who once knew Harry's parents. Equally engaging is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Throw in Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and you've got three excellent actors at the top of their game. Unfortunately, the new Dumbledore simply does not have the weary, measured wisdom that Harris brought to the role. Dumbledore feels like a younger guy in a wig and moustache.The true star of this movie is Watson. Like Harry, she experiences all stages of teen drama, from fright to frustration to just plain fist-fightin' mad and displays all of them with the prowess of a professional actress. Watson gets my vote for the one most likely to ""survive"" (in the way the Star Wars cast survived) this series when it ends.Ultimately, those who love the book will love this movie. But as an outsider looking in, it seemed like a lot was left out. My wife was able to fill in the blanks, but she shouldn't have to."	3.0	As an non-Potter fan, it seemed like a lot was left out	2004-07-01	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A5AUQ5R754O6E	"Michael Kavanagh ""HighburyGoon"""	"Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch.Michael Gambon does a fine job replacing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson hams it up as the spaced-out Divination teacher, Professor Trelawny.Gary Oldman is good as escaped-prisoner Sirius Black. He doesn't have much to do, but what he does works well. I look forward to seeing more of him as the series continues.Of all the adult actors, my highest praise must go to David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Thewlis was assigned the task of bringing to life one of the best-loved characters of the Rowling books, and has done so magnificently.This review wouldn't be complete without mention of the overall tone of the film. This of course is due to the amazing direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Everything about this film is in stark contrast to the first two offerings by Chris Columbus. By no means does this belittle Columbus' two Potter films. I enjoyed them very much. However, I must say that this third chapter was the most satisfying of the three. I believe it's because, as strange as this may sound, everything felt more ""real."" There wasn't this sense of wonderment that was ever-present during the first two films. In ""Azkaban,"" everything in the wizarding world is just matter-of-fact, and that in itself is magical.Also of note is the fine special effects in the film. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked absolutely amazing - like a real animal. Those horrifying guards of Azkaban, the Dementors, were just the right touch of scary. It's tough to keep them from looking like the Black Riders from Lord Of The Rings, but their mouths are all their own and are truly frightening!In all, an absolutely fantastic film, and one that I am sure to see several times over."	4.0	Absolutely Brilliant!!!!	2004-06-19	2	1	1

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an epic failure of a movie because they did such a poor job of book to movie translation. Some very critical plot points are left out,resulting in a very unfulfilling movie. This movie completely misses the boat by failing to include plot points such as why the marauders became animagi in the 1st place,the history of the map,and,most importantly,what motivated Sirius to escape from Azkaban. As Sirius escape from Azkaban sets in motion the events of the book that set in motion the rest of the series,to not explain to movie audience exactly what motivated Sirius to escape from Azkaban was an epic plot failure. Although there are some great aspects to this movie,the fact they did such a bad job with the plot makes an epic failure. Alfonso talks on the DVD extras about ""exploring emotional territories."" And that's exactly what went wrong with this movie. Alfonso was more interested in ""emotional territories"" than in plot and this movie suffers for it. This movie is 19 minutes shorter than the 5 star classic Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,so you can't say they didn't have time to explain these things. I will admit,the Knight Bus scene was fun and Buckbeak is breathtaking. And Hermione's punch was awesome. And the time turner scene was quite well done. But,when the plot fails,the movie fails.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	It is year number three at Hogwarts, and Harry Potter (Radcliffe) and his friends are faced with a new menace:  Sirius Black (Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and is supposedly looking to kill Harry.  That has Hogwarts under the guard of the dementors, beings who bear an uncanny resemblance to the Ghost of Christmas Future).  Also in the mix is a new professor of the dark arts by the name of Lupin, who also has issues of his own to deal with.HP# has a very different look and feel to it than HP1 and HP2.  A dampened color palette makes everything look gloomy and mysterious, even the once familiar Hogwarts.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has replaced Chris Columbus in the director's chair, and tightened up the story.  Where HP1 and HP2 tried to include everything from the books, HP3 is content to include only what director Cuar&oacute;n deems necessary.  Harry Potter fans should not be worried though, as some of the missing material will find its way into later movies.  The three primary child actors seem more comfortable than ever in their roles, and have grown up a bit since HP2.  Whether or not they will ride it out until the end of the series remains to be seen, but I think it would be difficult to see anyone else in their roles.HP3 is also the first, and probably only movie to not have You Know Who in it, and that gives a nice breather before things to come.  HP3 is an excellent movie that will not disappoint fans of the series.  Now, only a year and a half to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but I am sure it will seem much longer.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-06-07	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1ZITRBDHA7OC	Michelle L.	"The first time I went to see this in theatres, I was anxiously awaiting another wonderful interpretation of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, possibly even more excited for this one than the others because this book has always been one of my favorites. However, I was severely disappointed.It's almost as if the people involved in this movie hadn't ever read the book and had only been given a brief synopsis before making the film. Many plot points were either spun off in a different direction or eliminated completely and I felt cheated. I do understand that including the whole book would probably have made for a movie of unendurable (for most people) length, but so much didn't have to be sacrificed.For one thing, the characters of the trio were skewered violently. Harry himself becomes too emotional at certain points (he doesn't run off and cry in the book), and Hermione is portrayed quite differently than she is in the books. Just to clarify, I love her character in the books, but in the movie they make her extremely annoying and arrogant (""Ronald!""), not to mention giving her Ron's lines. And Ron himself? In this movie, Ron was made to be more of a joke than anything--he doesn't have any of his shining moments from the book (particularly at the end, where Hermione says ""You'll have to kill us too!"" instead of Ron, who just sits there on the bed like a coward...in the book, he forces himself to stand up on a broken leg and says it)...not to mention Dumbledore. In this movie and the following one, Michael Gambon plays the role of Hogwarts' brilliant, eccentric headmaster rather poorly. True, it would be difficult for anyone to follow the late, great Richard Harris' portrayal of Dumbledore in the first two films, but he makes the Headmaster seem out of whack and rather ignorant.Another thing that was disturbing was the atmosphere of Hogwarts. Before, it looked warm and inviting, as though you'd want to go there. In this movie, however, it was dark,  frightening, and falling into disrepair. Another disappointment was that a lot of the uniqueness of the wizarding world is lost in that the students so often wear Muggle clothing.Also, for me one of the most poignant moments of the book was Gryffindor finally winning the Quidditch cup after trying so hard for two years. I particularly loved the image of such normally dignified and upright characters such as Professor McGonagall and Percy Weasley sobbing and jumping for joy. There was only one little bit of the sport in the movie: the first match where Harry falls off and in the movie, he never gets the chance to redeem himself. And of course, the scene inside the Shrieking Shack was stunted considerably--the movie never mentions the Marauders' true identities.All in all, the time spent on the Knight Bus with that ridiculous shrunken head, the Whomping Willow (which didn't resemble a willow tree) or with the Fat Lady (portrayed by Dawn French, whose other work I love, but who's not necessary in this movie) being forced to be what I'm sure they thought was funny could have been used much more wisely in keeping true to the book."	2.0	A Poor Interpretation of a Wonderful Book	2006-07-13	6	4	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe ... The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans.The story once again follows the adventures of young Harry Potter, now a teenager, just as he is about to start his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After an incident in which Mr. Dursley's snobbish sister, Marge, is blown up like a balloon after angering Harry, the wizard in training goes on the run and catches a ride aboard a bus, on which he hears about the new danger that threatens his life. For the first time, a man has escaped from Azkaban prison, the place where the wizardry world's most notorious criminals are held and Sirius Black is no different. Word going around was that he was once a trusted friend of the Potter family but unbeknownst to them he was following the dark path of Lord Voldemort, which led him to betray the Potters and reveal to the dark lord their whereabouts. Though Voldemort's following is long since disbanded, his time in Azkaban prison has led him to go mad, swearing to return to the wizard world and finish the task that his master was unable to do ... by killing Harry Potter. With Black on the loose and young Harry attending school, dementors, evil creatures which guard Azkaban prison, have descended upon Hogwarts in an effort to capture the madman. But instead of presenting Harry with a finer sense of security, they present a darker threat to him, one in which he must find the light within himself to uncover additional clues needed to unlock his mysterious past. The story for Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban presents not only a continuation of the Harry Potter plot line but is successfully able to mature its stylization and atmosphere along the same lines as the series' continually aging audience. As with the previous two films, the Prisoner of Azkaban never once feels dragged on longer then it should or hurried up too quickly. It leaves the audience feeling at the end as it should, not longing to continue this particular storyline, but anticipating an entirely new adventure in the next adaptation.Though a considerable amount of the cast members from the previous two Potter outings have returned, the younger actors and actresses have gone through a considerable change, namely puberty. This doesn't hurt their performances in any way and actually contributes significantly to the idea of the series of films maturing along with its characters and audience. Daniel Radcliffe's performance will obviously be the one most critics will focus on out of all of the children and they should see a heightening sense of his acting abilities especially as he becomes ever more accustomed to the character he is playing. Depending on whether he will stick around or not, as well as the question of whether there will be, a seventh film, Radcliffe should be able to present one hell of a performance then and his maturing actions can be seen in this film. The most notable addition to the cast, at least to fans of the film series, would Michael Gambon taking on the role of Professor Dumbledore after the recent passing of venerable acting talent Richard Harris. Though his performance doesn't quite match up to Harris', Gambon gives it his best shot and maintains a certain level of charm about the character that had been seen in the previous features. Gary Oldman, notorious for his villainous roles in movies like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Air Force One, slips perfectly into the role of Sirius Black. The only disappointing aspect to his character is that not nearly enough of him is shown in the film as much as the advertisements imply. This isn't necessarily a bad mark against the film, it's actually quite reasonable considering the source on which the film is based on ... it's just an annoyance. And Alan Rickman, reprising the role of Professor Snape, presents another amusing performance, though not as seen as the character had been in the previous features.Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron picks up right where Columbus left off but, in the process, stylizes the third adaptation to his own specifications and presents the most mature and darkly toned Potter film yet to grace the screen, which, in the end, makes it all the more spellbinding. With that in mind, those parents whose younger children were little more then skittish through Chamber of Secrets will have greater difficulty getting them through Prisoner of Azkaban despite the shorter time length. The best option is to view the film for yourself prior to finalizing a decision as to whether your child should see it in theaters or wait for them to mature and catch when it arrives on DVD over Christmas break. The dementors alone are enough to creep out even the most confident of adult viewers ... what do you think they will do to a sensitive six year old? The rest of the film comes complete with ""jump"" moments, murky atmosphere, and ominous musical score which are more then enough to set a little child up for some sleepless nights. So for the most beneficial viewing experience for both the child and the movie-going audience around them please take proper precautions prior to venturing out to the local Cineplex this summer. This is not to say that the film is a horribly frightful experience ... in fact for teenagers and young adults it should be quite an entertaining film, with a wonderful blend of slight humor, eerie chills and whimsical fantasy. The only major flaw seen in the film is the level of confusion that is presented when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and the truth about Sirius Black is revealed. It's hard to describe without giving anything away but when it does appear in the film, relatively near the end, be sure to pay attention to details and actions of the characters or else it will leave slightly confused as to what is exactly going on. Other then that, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban fails in its attempt at being one of the bigger surprises of the summer, especially for those who enjoyed the previous two films, but succeeds at being one of the more enjoyable experiences of the season."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Potter 'Prisoner' to Success	2004-08-02	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A244RU4AUWBOD2	MidwestSellers	First off, the movie was visually stunning. Just beautiful. It felt more real. The actors were fantastic. They are really coming into their characters (not that they were bad before).My problem with the movie was the directing and editing choices of the film. They left out the explanation of the Marauder's Map/Mody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. Or the lengthy  disagreement between Ron and Hermione. And most disappointing was them leaving out the Dumbledore/Harry moment at the end.I felt the editing was choppy and did not follow very well. I had someone with me who has only seen the movies and was very confused.As a die-hard fan (yes I was one of the people in costume)I feel that the mythology and substance of the series was left out. They could have easily left out the overshowing of passage of time. I would have been willing to sit in the theatre longer for a truer story...Now onto #4	3.0	Too Much Filler Not Enough Substance	2004-06-04	4	2	2

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2A089FO8DB7Z0	Mike	"Yes, as repeated hundreds of times I'm sure, the movie is not as faithful to the book as it could have been.  Lots of things were left out, which I won't restate yet again.  But really now, how many people have actually commented on the MOVIE?If you ignore what you have memorized from the book, the movie is outstanding!  People argue that certain things weren't done correctly, like the few instances when Ron makes a reference to Hermione's sudden attendance in certain classes.  People say that there needed to be more references to these important events.  But you have to realize, it's much easier to retain information from a movie than through a book because it does take longer to read a book than it does to watch a movie (most of the time.) So if the director put each of these references into the movie, it would have become clear to those that are new to this installment that something really WAS going on and would have taken away the ""ohhhhh,"" when Hermione reveals her Time Stopper necklace thing.Also, the cinematography...sweet!  The cinematography in this movie was amazing, it truely was!  The camera's kept moving, which added a lot of awe to the movie, like in the scene with the Dementor on the train, or the scene at the lake where the Dementors converge. And even the subtle things, like when Harry fell off his broom at Quidditch and Dumbeldor stands up to save Harry with the wave of his hand...awesome!And the music!  Spectacular, John Williams!  Perfect theme for the family, although Family Portrait was clearly left out, it was nice to hear an even better theme!So let's not give bad scores JUST because it was unfaithful to the book, because as a lone movie, I personally think it was magnificant!  A ton of work clearly went into this picture, and I would hate to see it get 500 reviews that said how unfaithful it was to the book compared to the past movies when it obviously had so much more than the past movies had"	4.0	Great movie for the non-book lovers	2004-09-01	6	1	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3K8XT6I5JL94S	Mike	The complaints by the purists miss the point that the Potter books are a little too crowded and disorganized.  The first 2 movies followed the books closely and, no surprise, were too crowded and disorganized.  Cuaron edits and streamlines in a way that Rowling seems unable to do: he's a better storyteller.  I'm glad he didn't include endless boring quidditch scenes, etc. etc.  He did fail to explain a couple of small details, but overall this is an example of superior directing.	5.0	The best adaptation by far	2004-12-06	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1ENGIZZWM5G3H	Mike Miller	"Quirky, stylish, and dark are IMHO the best three words to describe the third and most eccentric entry into the Harry Potter series.  This movie is dripping with atmosphere and brimming with so many details and effects, it warrants repeated viewing.  Every time I re-watch this, I see something new that I missed the previous time.It's easy to tell right from the beginning that the director is not a mainstream kinda filmmaker, as his style is almost art-house.  Normally I'm not much of a fan of 'style-over-substance' in movies -- and I'm not saying that this movie lacks substance... but let me put it this way; The visuals are such eye-candy that if I could afford to, I'd build a picture frame around a plasma TV, mount it on my wall, and play this movie on infinite repeat 24 hours a day with the volume muted.  (Hey, who says wall art has to be static?  Just ask some of the paintings in Hogworts!) :-)Not that the movie is in any way bad with the volume up... on the contrary, the quirky fun caries over into the dialogue as well.  But in some ways this is wasted on a Harry Potter movie.  It's almost as though they've laboured to make a work of art whose target viewing audience will never appreciate it.Some of my friends thought that the quirkiness was 'inappropriate' for a Harry Potter movie, and it didn't fit with their expecations.  On one hand I can see where they're coming from, but at the same time I didn't really have to open my mind *that* much to appreciate it for what it was.  I mean, if you can ignore that it's in a completely different mold than the earlier 2 movies in the series and think of this as a brand new experience, it's easier to accept it on its own terms.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, was that I agree with the people who thought that they went a little overboard taking artistic license with the story.  There were plot elements that were changed for seemingly no reason, and parts that were removed for ""time"" when they could have easily been fit in by chopping some unnecessary added sequences which didn't serve any greater purpose in the story. (The shrunken head scene for example, went on far too long)."	4.0	Harry gone off the rails!!	2006-03-20	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1D1MIFRSG50Y3	Mike S.	The movie itself is great.  The only thing I knock it down a star for is not having an extended edition of the movie.  All the other extras that are included are great.  The documentary series that runs throughout the course of the ultimate editions gives a great behind the scenes look at the series as a whole, then there are a lot of features that are just specific to this movie.  One of the best parts of the first two UE sets was the option of seeing the extended edition (which essentially just incorporated the deleted scenes into the movie).  You do get the deleted scenes here, but they do now flow as well just seeing them one after another.  That is the only drawback.As for the movie itself, it is great.  By this time you kind of know how the movies flow as opposed to the books, and just expect that a lot is going to be cut from the books to make the movie.  While it took some getting used to in the first couple movies, I found it to be far less of an issue at this point.  The story introduces three characters that are essential to the rest of the story.  Sirius Black, Lupin, and Wormtail.  Neither of which are what they initially seem to be. Lupin gets the most screen time, and is great as the favorite teacher that takes Harry under his wing to start to prepare him for what lies ahead.  The story continues getting darker and the characters are put in more and more peril.  It is the film where the shift from introducing the world and the characters to getting to the meat of the Harry vs. Voldemort story begins.The big change in this movie is the addition of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.  Richard Harris died after making the second movie, and it does take some getting used to.  Gambon plays a far less soft spoken and more eccentric version of Dumbledore.  When I first saw the movie I did not like his version as much, but after this film you get used to him more, and his presence feels more natural by the end of the series.The lack of an extended version of the film aside, the movie is great, and the extras are very good.  If you can find this for the right price, it is worth adding to your collection.	4.0	Great movie that should have an extended edition	2013-03-24	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A300FZS4M8ZG7N	miktek	Being a fan of the books and the first two films and reading a few reviews of here i was sure that in some way , somewhere during this film i would be disappointed with something !!!But i wasn't !!! Seriously, how could someone write a bad review bout this film !The third is a much more darker, gritty and adoscelent HP than the first two sugar sweet outings. As far as i am concerned a move for the best.The kids are growing up and so should the style of film as we progress. The director has choosen to make a film full of dark overtones both in story and colour and provides some sheer entertaiment for the more mature. Though enjoying the first two films, in comprasion with the third, they are far more kiddies fare and provide some of the most stiffled dialgoue ever  (ie: like they are reading straight from the book).However, the actors are in there peak with the roles in the third and overall present far more interesting characters that actually seem endearing.There are things missing from the book, but big deal. I don't mind the bits elenminate from the book because u go into these thing with the idea that what u are about to see is a representation of the book not a re-telling. And overall, the movie runs quickly and smoothly allowing those who read the book and those that haven't to be able to follow the story structure.From the opening shot to the final scene i was in awe with the movie and happly advocate for anyone to see it that like these types of films and even those that hated the first two. I mean this film makes me want to see more of the characters not just the story and i really hope they are able to keep the main 3 roles intact. I mean i don't mind watching Harry grow up and get into some more mature mishef....do u ???There are alot of changes from the first two films , mainly the castle, castle grounds and of course, the new Professor Dumbledoff. The changes in the castle didn't bother me has i have a big enough imagine without having to be spoon fed and it would be ok to state that a magical castle could change its appearance from year to year. Furthermore, one could state that as the kids go into thier 3rd year they encounter different parts of the castle. Overall, nuthin there to gripe about. The weather changes added to the overall atmosphere to. I mean in part one and two the weather mostly was fine whereas in the 3rd there is rain aplenty and for the first time Harry and the other students arrive to Hogwarts in a down pour. Also the Quiddich match is a wash out. No bright sun, green lawns and colour here. And for me, its adds to the darker elements as the movie goes on. Once again the weather changes could be explained with the arrival of the Dementors (who spend the film on the outer walls of the castle looking for Sirus Black) who dark and forboding could literally change the environment to a darker and wetter atmosphere - sucking the colour and sun from view.. I mean use yah imagination people if you spot in-consistencises and be thankful for a different re-presentation because it will keep the movies alive and give us something new each time .I sure as hell dont want to go back to the mood of the first movie now i have seen the 3rd.The new and defitely not improved Professor Dumdolfee took me a bit of getting use too. He's voice is not so calming and masterful as Richard Harris's portrail but after a while u adjust and i mean what could u do , the man died , he had to be replace and the new guy does a good job though does lack some of the overall sense of power that the other had. But a very small gripe. I guess if anything it shows us that Richard Harris WAS Dumbledof.Overall, a brillant film that really nails the progression of the series in film well and makes me look forward to the next interpertation.And to all the book nazi's who go on and on about changes get over it, the author loves this film and as a book fan myself even i know that they can't get every thing up thier and the bits they cut out (including the designers of The Map) didn't need to be there. Infact , i think the producers did a great edit and developed a good story with they limitation they have (ie: audience patience for overlong movies and kids attention span). You can't make these thing please everyone but id say this movie will please most. Don't over anaylisis and enjoy the magic.' I solemly swear, i'm up to no good!!!'	5.0	Excellent	2004-06-27	5	0	5

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"This 3rd installment of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series finds 13-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) once again stuck with his Aunt and Uncle, the most dreadfully unimaginative Muggles in the world, and looking forward to the start of the new school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The wizard world is abuzz with talk of notorious murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from the previously impenetrable wizard prison Azkaban. Ostensibly the cohort of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, it is believed that Sirius' intent is to kill Harry Potter. Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) start the school year under a cloud of gloom, as Dementors, the life-sucking guardians of Azkaban prison, are stationed around Hogwarts to protect the school. A new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), befriends Harry and helps him fight his fear of the Dementors, who seem to affect Harry more than they do others.""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" takes a distinctly dark turn that I didn't detect in the books until Book 5. Brooding cinematography, increasingly neurotic characters, and ubiquitous blue tones make Hogwarts seem a menacing place, not the safe haven it has been in the previous films. In truth, danger has always lurked around every corner at Hogwarts, but security and fun were never far away. Director Alfonso Cuaron's vision is not so reassuring. The film doesn't hesitate to jump right into an already progressing story and assumes that the audience knows the main characters. Nevertheless, the first hour or so of the movie is disjointed. It is a little difficult to make sense of the action during this segment, because it skips around abruptly, adding to the film's sense of unease. The central narrative is captivating, but doesn't begin until halfway through. Harry is, as usual, imperiled by what he doesn't know about his past, because no one bothers to explain it to him. The dialogue is inferior to the first two Harry Potter movies, and, indeed, there is less of it. John Williams' score seems cheap, as he unabashedly recycles Darth Vader's Theme from ""Star Wars"" for all of the ""evil"" scenes. Michael Gambon has replaced the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and doesn't seem possessed of his weight or his playfulness. But Dumbledore's role is small in this movie, so we have yet to see what Gambon will do with the part.Alfonso Cuaron may not have been the best choice to direct ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"". His interpretation is too dark for this segment of the Harry Potter saga, while Harry still views Hogwarts as pleasant refuge from life's harsh realities, full of enchantment and possibilities. The first half of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" suffers from poor editing and should have been more coherent. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining adventure once it gets going. It's probably too scary for children under 6 and perhaps for older children who are easily frightened."	4.0	A Darker Vision of the Magical Life.	2004-12-11	4	3	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2GDE82ILCNYGT	Miss Abbey Road	The box for the Ultimate Edition of Prisoner of Azkaban is not as sturdy as the boxes for the Ultimate Editions of Years 1 & 2. Year 3's box is flimsier, and there's an added shell with a holographic image of the poster on the front. The movie is not an extended version, which I have heard that many other people are not happy about. I don't really care, I liked the extended editions of Years 1 & 2, but I didn't buy this for the extended edition. I'll watch the deleted scenes, that will be fine for me. I bought this for all of the extra, behind-the-scenes footage and documentaries.So if you really care about seeing the extended movie, this isn't for you.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3VS3TZOCSWLZC	"""mistersocko2000"""	It seemed like I had been waiting forever for the release of this movie, so I was very excited when I finally got the chance to go see it yesterday.  However, I would be lying if i said I wasn't disappointed.  Simply too much has changed.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of dark, artsy movies, and I did appreciate the more sombre tone and toned-down colours of POA.  However, if you want to compare it to the previous two movies in the series, it seems as if all continuity has been severed.  I'm not going to go into all the changes and differences between the book and the movie, because I've come to the conclusion that you have to treat this film as an adaptation of the book, and there is only so much time that the director has to work with.  I went to see POA with a friend who hasn't read any of the books, and she seemed to understand the plot just fine.But for those of us who have repeatedly read and loved the books, it is futile to try and complain about the differences in the movie.  The main ones that bothered me: the marauder's map and its creators (Padfoot, Moony, Wormtail, and Prongs) in relation to James Potter's and Sirius Black's own school days being omitted, and the Firebolt broom coming at the end of the movie instead of in the middle.  I also thought some of the sexual tension between Ron and Hermione was inappriopriate, seeing as how Rowling only has Ron realize Hermione's femininity halfway through book four.  Quiddith also played a huge part in the third book, with the Gryffindor team winning the cup with their captain Oliver Wood in his last year at Hogwarts.  In the movie one single Quidditch game was played, the one where Harry falls off his broom and Gryffindor loses the game.The Dementors were realized quite beautifully, fully showing their horrible presence on the train ride to the school.  I liked the effect of everything freezing when a Dementor is near.  David Thewlis was nearly perfect as Professor Lupin, a kind caring Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who shows Harry how to protect himself from Dementors, and the Boggart-in-the-wardrobe scene was nearly perfect, except for the fact that in the book Ron doesn't conquer his spider-boggart in the same way he does in the movie.  I didn't like Michael Gambon nearly as much as Richard Harris in the role of Dumbledore - I thought Richard Harris brought a lot more of Dumbledore's characteristic wit and whimsy to life in the first two movies.  The grim was great, and I appreciated that the grim-in-the-sky and grim-in-the-tea leaves scenes were included.  But what was up with Lupin's werewolf?  This CGI creature in no way resembled any sort of wolf - I was very disappointed with that particular interpretation.  But Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black were great - right up there with David Thewlis.But again, it's definitely best to think of this movie as just that, a movie, and try not to dislike it because it's so different from the book.  It's a good adaptation, I was definitely entertained, but I have to compare it to the previous two films in order to judge for continuity, and there the film falls short.  The darker tone is fine - the book wouldn't work without it - but the physical differences of the castle, the school grounds, and even the fat lady are too much.I am honestly more than a bit concerned for the making of the fourth movie, because the fourth book is over twice as long as the POA book, and even if another hour is added to the running time of the movie, how will all the important details, even subplots, come through?	3.0	Different, but good	2004-06-13	4	3	1

Azkaban really lost a lot of suspensful elements toward the end, too, not to mention some dark humor. For ex, Snape just ""shows up"" in the Shack bedroom, but how? It wouldn't have hurt the writer/director to show maybe 1 minutes' worth of Snape discovering the cloak, map, etc. I gave this a rating of 3 instead of a 1 for it's cinemetography.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AGMWV48U3HTV4	Mitchell Randall	"This weekend I watched all three Harry Potter films back-to-back.  Each was excellent in its own right, but the third film is noticably different and better.  While ""The Chamber of Secrets"" greatly improved on the first, the new direction of The Prisoner of Azkaban made it much more whole.While I greatly missed the Quidditch matches (they were supposed to win the Quidditch cup this year) and the absence of Oliver Wood, the film was excellent.  The actors have grown into their roles and their abilities shine on the screen.  Gambdon's replacing Richard Harris as Dumbledore was brilliant casting.Unlike the first two films, which seemed to drag at points, this one glides through the story, never missing a beat.  There's great humor in the dialogue, and the relationships between the characters really comes through.  Cuaron focused more on the students rather than the faculty this time around, letting them take center stage.The CGI is brilliant---gone are the too-fast moving CGI characters and the monsters that are supposed to look real but are too polished.  Buckbeak is animated beautifully and was a character all its own.  The Quidditch sequence, while short, was well-produced as well.  Not using it as much and shooting on location shoots worked great because it didn't look like they were standing in front of a green screen.Overall, it's the best Harry Potter yet, and I can't wait for the next installment."	5.0	The best of the series so far!	2004-11-27	9	5	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2SKSJAOJR5J5N	Mithral	I have seen all the movies and read all the books. First of all, I would like to point out that having a new actor playing Dumbledore is regrettable (May Richard Harris's soul rest in peace), but changing the soul of the character (not as dignified as Dumbledore has been in the books and previous movies) is not a good idea especially in the middle of the series. Changing characters I believe is a very foolish gamble because that person brought the character's soul to the screen and it is very hard for viewers to take that. Secondly, the movie does not reflect the emotional and magical content of the book. It was wonderful to see the moving pictures, the womping willow, and all but it seems like the characters are even in a hurry themselves to express delicate emotions. Thirdly, where is the sweeping and flat Hogwart's grounds that was shown in the &quot;Chambers of Secrets&quot;, which by the way gives a more panoramic view and more room for imagination. Talking about panoramic, the scenes makes the movie feel crowded and it feels like everything was shot from a 12x12 room because the producers can't afford a wider one. The &quot;WOW&quot; is gone because all the scenes seems to have been shot up close. Not to compare or anything of the sort, the scenic/panoramic scenes from the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series added the illusion of having the viewer in the same world to feel and be a part of the scene not just watching 2Dimensional pictures on the wall. Fourthly, it seems like it is a different story from what the book is, because the plot does not flow. If a movie is compared to a sentence, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban&quot; is PHRASE; not complete and has been chopped up into smaller pieces and were glued hapzardly. Lastly but never the least because there are so many more that I can point out is the fact that the creator of the movie LACKED THE REQUIRED IMAGINATION FOR THE STORY. It's like the person who made it never had a childhood. I hope that JKRowling would think twice on what is, how is, and who is will be involved in the next series because the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is the best of the series yet. With the right imagination and maybe a little talent, the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; will be the best HP movie ever yet. A few advices for her is &quot;PLEASE DON'T GO COMMERCIAL&quot; and &quot;PLEASE PROTECT YOUR WORK&quot;.	2.0	LACK OF IMAGINATION..........DESTROYED THE STORY	2004-08-02	8	3	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3FR1IIQNQOWJK	M. Kelderhouse	While the amount of detail and adventure in these books is far too much to fit into a movie (even one that approaches 3 hours in length), the third film in the series (based on my favorite book in the series, so far) improves in almost every way upon its predecessors.  While the first film was magical, and the most faithful to the book (it could be, since the first book was the shortest), there was far too much bad child acting going on.  Cuaron has turned the three leads into real actors, and the performances in this movie outshine those in the previous two.  This is especially true for Hermione, who was emoting up a storm in Sorceror's Stone.  She is now more natural and believable.  Also, the cinematography adds a sense of darkness and urgency to the film.  Add to that a more unique and haunting John Williams score than we've heard for a while, and much better special effects than the first two films, and you get what will probably stand as the best movie in the series even when all 7 films have been completed.	4.0	Not as good as the book, but far better than Columbus' films	2004-11-21	10	5	5

I guess I don't like it as much because there was so much change. It seemed like it had a taste of lord of the rings in it. I have nothing against lord of the rings but its just not the same. I liked it but it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the series. I  probably set my expectation too high since the third book is my favorite.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2UL0A8GJB4318	mljkb	"Jetisoning director Chris Columbus for Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuaron, the money hungry minds behind the Potter films have shown a stroke of genius.  Cuaron, best known for the sexually charged ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and the quiet children's fantasy ""A Little Princess,"" proves he is up to the Potter challenge.  By focusing more on the charcters we came to know and love from J.K. Rowling's luminous novels instead of just creating aesthetics and extraneous plot details, Cuaron brings Harry's world to vigourous life inways the first two films could never do.  Golden light has been replaced by darker shades of black and blue, stiff cinemaography supplanted by assured motion and top-heavy storytelling be damned.  Cuaron knows how to tell a tale with nuance and emotion.""Azkaban"" picks up the summer after the events of ""The Chamber of Secrets,"" with Harry heading back to school with chums Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) all amid dread that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a former follower of Lord Voledmort has escaped from Azkaban prison.  Seeking shelter under the benevolent gaze of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), Harry hopes atleast one year will go by without a fuss.  But soon wicked Dementors occupy Hogwartz, thinking Black will try to kill Harry for thwarting his former master.  The Dementors are black wonders of CGI, sort of floating Ringwraiths with a putrid, soul-sucking breath.  Dread creeps into Hogwartz, but everyone tries to get along, but of course evil events are sure to come, and they do in a whirlwind of astonishing visual effects and equally astonishing story-telling.  The cast has never seemed more at home in their roles, and the young cast leads the charge by blossoming into full-blown adolescence.  Daniel Radcliffe is quickly making Harry his own, Emma Watson is becoming a babe and Rupert Grint gets the best lines.  But the real star is Cuaron, who makes the Potter universe feel alive and vigorous.  It will be hard for Mike Newell to top with ""The Goblet of Fire."""	5.0	Wondrous, The Best Adaption Yet	2004-11-24	6	5	1

Hermoine says ""Professor Lupin didn't take his potion tonight!!"" or something along those lines.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1UECTU9TJTHJK	Mme Juniper Bean	The essence of the series lives in this movie.  The director set out of a mission to bring some of the more natural and realistic growing pains of being a teenager into our little Harry Potter universe.  Though, as with all movie adaptions of books some things are left out and some things are added, you've gotta admit it's a pretty good ride.  Michael Gambon is exactly how I imagined Dumbledore.  As a funny seemingly slightly irrevelent figure.  In the books he is always making jokes and winking and pretending not to be aware of things.  I think it was fabulous that Harry, Hermione, and Ron were starting to act like teenage kids.  In the books, Harry becomes very angry over time. Also, the caliber of the acting from the youngest actors have become  tenfolds over the first two movies.  I for one couldn't imagine anybody else playing any of roles.  The movie really steps up and brings the intensity of the emotions and relationships that are formed into the spotlight.  And has been said before, the Knight bus was awesome, Professor Lupin and Professor Trelawney were stunning, the dementors are scary, the hippogriff beautiful and I did like all the 'artsy' license taken with the film.  And as someone who was previously unfamiliar with the Harry Potter universe, after immediately watching the movie I plunged headfirst into reading the books.  I wasn't confused by the movie or found myself not understanding what was happening.  I think there were some slightly jerky transitions, but, I felt deeply immersed in the world onscreen.  All must remember, that the movie versions are being written to follow the series' flow.  And not to stand alone as it's individual book adaptation.  And with two books left in the series, one currently being written and the other with only the very last chapter completed---I think the screenwiter and directors are making brillant choices as to what they illuminate on screen.  I say generally a good time for all.Now pass the butterbeer, please.	4.0	A good time for all	2004-11-12	2	0	2

David doesn't miss a beat as the mysterious, but kind hearted Professor Lupin. There was so much in the books that didn't make it to the screen, but as a whole the movie flows quite well. The kids are growing up, and it shows in their acting abilities. Harry is beginning to show his darker side in this movie, and it pulls this movie away from the others in drama.

I think the makeup department on this one relied on soot and mud. The plot , what little was actually in the movie was an afterthought. Very disjointed and boring. I couldn't wait to leave the theater. My sons thought it was awful. I hope the next director goes back to the old format and makes it a magical experience that all J.K. Rowling books present. Some say the themes was darker, I say all it was was dingy in this movie. The casting of Michael Gambeon was terrible, he reminded me of someones Daft uncle and not the character of Albus Dumbledore. No strength or genuine warmth at all, in fact the most likable character, and the cleanest was, Snape and he's supposed to be the heavy! Unless the next one is better this franchise is on its way out.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y	Monkdude	"The first two Potter films were well made and above average, but I think ""The Prisonerof Azkaban"" is the one that will be remembered and respected in the coming years. Director Chris Columbus is out after the first two films and in steps Alfonso Cuaron who does a wonderful job on the look of this film. This is the Harry Potter world I imagined; full of darkness, mood, and above all else mystery. Virtually everything is improved this time around from the acting (Emma Watson as Hermione really shines here), music (best score of the three), to the visual effects which are mountains above the SFX in the first two movies. This film may be darker in nature, but the humor is still fresh and had most of the adults in the theater cracking up more often than the kids. I consider myself a Lord of the Rings Trilogy fan, but I have to say this third Potter film got the best of me and I will be first in line for the next one. Too bad Cuaron won't be in the director's chair for that one!"	5.0	Easily the best of the three films!	2004-06-04	1	0	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2UQIIJ2CD8REE	Monty Moonlight	"*ahem* That was my Sesame Street Count impression. Anyways... my point is, here is a series that totally proves sequel haters wrong. Movie number 3, and still going strong! Let's hope the filmmakers can keep it up and don't change the cast along the way. After all, at this point it really would be silly. Fox and the WB use 30 year olds to play teens all the time. But I digress, on with the synopsis!In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" we rejoin Harry Potter, boy-wizard prodigy, in his 13th year of miserable life with the Dursleys, his less than loving relatives. Harry's situation has improved somewhat. He no longer lives in that cupboard under the stairs for example, though he still is expected to wait, hand and foot, on his wretched family. A little fear has made them manageable however, but that's not the case with Aunt Marge, who stops in one day for dinner. Unaware of Harry's magical powers, Marge mouths off one time too many about his parents during dinner, and Harry's magic gets the better of him. Starting with a forefinger in mid-wag, the already bloated old Marge begins to inflate. Soon, she is filled with so much magic gas that she begins to float out of the house and clear out of sight! Of course, Harry can't stick around after that. Sitting on a curb wondering what to do next, and puzzled by something watching him from the bushes across the street, the mysterious Knight Bus arrives just in time. ""Transportation for the stranded witch or wizard,"" as it is described, and a welcome sight it is. After one wild ride through London, Harry finds himself at ""The Leaky Cauldron"" and face to face with the Minister of Magic, who welcomes him with a friendly greeting, a room for the night, a reunion with Hedwig the owl, and new school books for the coming year. Harry also receives an accidental warning about an escaped murderer; a sinister looking man named Sirius Black.After a good night's sleep, Harry is thrilled to see his best friends again, noble misfit Ron Weasley and family, and increasingly lovely know-it-all Hermione Granger. The extended family is in good spirits for the new school year, though Mr. Weasley's mind is not completely at ease. Ever the great father figure for orphaned Harry, Mr. Weasley takes the boy aside to give him a much more informative warning about the Azkaban prison escapee, Sirius Black, and why Harry should be particularly wary of him. It seems that Black is believed to have been Lord Voldemort's right-hand man and was imprisoned for the murder of one Peter Pettigrew, a close friend of Harry's parents. Now that Black is out of prison, everyone suspects that Harry Potter is the first one he will come for, since it was he who thwarted Lord Voldemort's plans time and time again. With that bit of information weighing on his mind, Harry and his schoolmates board the train to Hogwarts, selecting a compartment already occupied by a sleeping Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. There are mysterious doings on the Hogwarts Express, however, as we discover when Harry has his first encounter with the dark cloaked, faceless, floating figure of a Dementor. As the creature attempts to suck out Harry's soul in a most unpleasant display, the seemingly dead to the world Professor Lupin springs into action! With wand extended, Lupin casts a spell to blast the creature from sight. From Lupin, we learn that the Dementors, the guards of Azkaban prison, are on a nonstop search for their escaped prisoner. We also come to find that the creatures are overrunning the grounds of Hogwarts as well. Upon their first night back at school, all the students are given warning from Headmaster Dumbledore of the looming danger. Dumbledore also introduces Professor Lupin, and the announcement is made that Rubeus Hagrid has been added to the faculty as teacher of a class on the care of magical beasts.As the days and weeks pass, the customary Hogwarts balance of fascinating classes and strange and mysterious incidents takes place. Professor Trelawney teaches about crystal balls, tea leaf reading, and other forms of divination. The class frustrates Hermione, as she can't get the knack, and holds bad omens for Harry when an unlucky black dog called ""the Grim"" is spotted in his tea. Hagrid's class seems to be going well as he introduces the students to a half eagle, half horse creature called a hippogriff, but when Draco Malfoy becomes jealous of Harry's high-flying ride on the creature's back, he fakes an injury and gets the gentle beast marked for death. The most interesting and mysterious class, however, must be Professor Lupin's ""Defense Against the Dark Arts."" The Professor begins by introducing the students to a mysterious, fear personifying creature called a boggart. He teaches them to alter the creature to a less frightening form with a ""ridiculous"" spell, which works quite well for a while, but when Harry's turn comes up, Lupin jumps in to defend the boy wizard. Before Lupin's eyes, the Boggart changes shape from that of a Dementor, to an image of the full moon! In the days that follow, there are field trips, holidays, Quidditch games, budding romance, run-ins with Snape and Malfoy, heart to hearts between Harry Potter and the endearing Professor Lupin, and secrets revealed about Peter Pettigrew and the looming Sirius Black, the latter due in no small part to a Marauder's Map and an invisibility cloak. But, as the plot thickens, dangers increase, and it's bound to only get more complicated before the reality of the circumstances is finally revealed!Well, that's the basic story, without revealing too much. Don't be too surprised to also see a werewolf here and there, and an amazing little gadget called a time turner. Another fantastic Harry Potter movie, in my humble opinion. Though, I admit to only being a Harry Potter MOVIE fanatic. I have no experience with the books. I realize the fans of the books had mixed feelings about this one, but as a fan of the movies, I think this MIGHT be my favorite. It's a tough thing to say. The first film had a great, innocent quality, and definitely a much simpler plot. Everything was new and surprising, as is always the way with the first film in a series. The second was a bit more advanced, a bit creepier, a bit more complicated and mysterious. This third film followed that same course: darker, more grown-up than the first two, much more complicated and much more mysterious. The characters are growing up, and the films display this well without overdoing it. Relationships are growing beautifully, not just between the three main heroes, but between everyone. I get a really warm feeling from seeing the love Ron's family shows Harry, and the compassion with which Lupin trains and comforts the young wizard. The questions of this film were very intriguing, and it was amazing to see everything unfold. While I hope not every future Potter film will be this dark, I still say Director Alfonso Cuaron took the helm masterfully. The darkness is balanced with moments of humor and beauty, the effects are stunning, and the scenery is breathtaking. John Williams' music is always incomparable, and the casting of the entire Harry Potter series continues to be flawless. Fans of the books might have different opinions, but I can't imagine how any of the roles could be played better. Michael Gambon also did an excellent job of filling the late, great Richard Harris's shoes in the role of Albus Dumbledore.On an added note(and beware of spoilers here), I have a huge personal interest in werewolves in general, and the werewolves of the Harry Potter world are something I've eagerly anticipated seeing since they were mentioned in the first film. Even though they were suggested as being very dangerous creatures, my hope was that they would not necessarily be evil or mindless killers. At the very least, I hoped that some would be good and some would be evil. Well, it didn't work out that way. They took the old route of a tormented werewolf character who is kind and remorseful by day, and a bloodthirsty monster during a full moon. I can live with that. I thought David Thewlis was excellent as the sympathetic Professor Remus Lupin. All in all, I loved the character. He was thoughtful, powerful, caring, and wise. What I didn't love was the creature he became, the werewolf. It was a tall, skinny, gray-skinned, short-haired, disgusting looking, computer-generated thing. One of the most disappointing werewolf designs I've ever seen. There was not a wolf quality about it. Frankly, I much preferred the look of Sirius Black's black dog form, and it looked much more like a proper werewolf than the transformed Lupin. Don't get me wrong, the creature looked scary and dangerous, but not at all werewolf-like. Ah, well, sickly Asthma-hound Chihuahuas aside, this film is excellent. One serious flaw in an otherwise AWESOME movie. For the human side alone, it's even a great werewolf film. Watch it. Enjoy it. I'm going to cherish this film for years to come, because it's an awesome ride! And, I'm going to eagerly await more installments in the Harry Potter series! And...I'm going to TRY to get around to reading the books too!""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" and the original film, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" are all available on DVD and VHS. The DVD extras are numerous, if not outstanding, and the films themselves all make wonderful additions to any home video collection. For more fantastic fantasy in the same line as Harry Potter, check out Return to Oz (Fairuza Balk), The Worst Witch (Fairuza Balk/Tim Curry), The Wizard of Oz (Judy Garland), A Series of Unfortunate Events (Jim Carrey), Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins, The Witches (Angelica Huston), The NeverEnding Story, Labyrinth, Dragonslayer, Willow, the Ewok Adventures, Legend, the Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Peter Pan (Jason Isaacs), and Hocus Pocus (Bette Midler).

This movie was definitely the best yet in the Harry Potter series! This is still my favorite book in the Harry Potter series. This surrounds Harry Potter, who is a wizard and goes to Hogwarts, which is a school for witches and wizards. This year Harry finds out that Sirius Black, who supposedly helped kill Harry Potter's parents, has escaped from Azkaban Prison, which is a jail for wizards. Everyone thinks that Sirius is coming after Harry to kill him. This story definitely shows that Harry is growing up and has to be able to defend himself. This is the third movie in it's series. I was very impressed at this movie! It was more suspenseful than the other two movies before it. There was not one moment in the whole movie that was very slow and boring. This movie, for me, is absolutely a classic. This movie isn't too scary; it actually is funnier than the other to movies! Alfonso did a great job taking over the job as director! This is a great family film that children and adults will enjoy and love. This movie is definitely one of the best movies. It goes on my list with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King!!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	Ok, so if you haven't guessed by now I've been having myself a little mini marathon of Harry Potter's the past week.  In fact, it's been the perfect way to de-stress after a long day at work.  The Prisoner of Azkaban as the third movie in the series (and books) and if you haven't seen the other two, you need to go back and start at the beginning.  It just isn't the same if you don't.Harry is back at Hogwarts again after running away from his aunt and uncle's home (yet again, why do they keep letting him come back?).  Having blown up his aunt like a balloon with a spell, he fears the worst when the Ministry of Magic finds him.  But instead, they just want to keep him safe without an explanation.  He later learns that Sirius Black, a deranged prisoner from the wizard prison of Azkaban has escaped and is known to want to kill him.  To make matters worse, he finds out more secrets about Black that make him feel more wretched than before.  Even school isn't the same with Dementors (Azkaban guards) flying about and wreaking havoc.  It would seem a normal school year is not in the cards for Harry.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe: Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ronald WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus HagridMichael Gambon: Albus DumbledoreGary Oldman: Sirius BlackAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeDavid Thewlis: Remus LupinAs usual, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all work together extremely well on the set.  And it's so nice to see them grow up together just as they did in the books.  They have the right balance of comedy and adventure and complement each other well.  I thought Gambon as Dumbledore did an ok job.  He was neither better nor worse than his predecessor who regrettably died before the rest of the films could be made.  I think I'm more eager to see how he does when Dumbledore gets a larger role in the movies and more screen time.  I didn't really like Oldman as Sirius Black, maybe I just didn't see enough of him, but he seemed more manic than he was in the books.  Rickman as Snape was delightfully wicked as normal and there's just something about him that makes me root for him to appear more.  Thewlis, who I'm used to seeing in the bad guy role, was a nice change for Lupin where I finally got to see him as a character I could cheer on.The plot followed the books moderately well.  I do think that there were a lot more deviations in this one than the other two movies, but still, the important stuff was there.  But it also felt a little rushed.  Compared to the other two movies it didn't seem like there were any deep and poignant scenes in this one, or if there were they weren't given enough time to develop properly.  The detail was a bit less in this one too.  We barely get a look at Honeydukes or some of the other places in town and it could have really expounded on that and some other wizarding details that I love to see.  It would have made the whole story come alive.The special effects were a bit less in this one too.  Don't get me wrong, they were still good, but some of them definitely looked a little fake, especially in scenes towards the end.  I guess I'm just used to better quality for the Harry Potter movies.  Thankfully, the music was still terrific, mostly instrumental, but there was one song in the beginning sung by a choir that I really enjoyed.  And it was clever in its use of lyrics.Not a bad movie, but not the best of the Harry Potter lot.  I will eagerly move on to the next.Review by M.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQ81HZS5XRNPL	"MrsJenBardall ""Jen"""	The third book is still my favorite.  Therefore I was more than looking forward to the movie version.  This movie has stunning special effects.  The adult actors are wonderful, especially Gary Oldman, who rarely disappoints in any film.  I could even (almost) adjust to the new Dumbledore.That being said, I was greatly disappointed by this movie.  Granted, there is a huge amount of material to be covered, but there were just too many plotholes in this film.  Anyone who didn't read the book will miss a lot of the charm of the story.  A few open loops: Who really wrote the Marauder's Map? Why does Prof Lupin know how to use it? Why does Harry's Patronus take the form it does? There are many more, but these were my biggest concerns.The younger actors can't get away with just being cute anymore, and that's a problem.  Daniel Radcliffe is developing nicely, but the others are not at that level.  Emma Watson's laughter is almost always painfully forced and it simply makes me cringe.On top of all this, a lot of the expositional dialogue feels totally rushed and unnatural.  Oops, here's some more backstory real quick, let's shove it in there.  Maybe because so many arbitrary incidents are far too fleshed-out for the sake of a bigger message (Harry's growing feeling of manhood and freedom while riding the hippogriff) or for special effects sake (same example), thus leaving little time for plot development.I absolutely hated a lot of the director's choices.  It is important to leave one's own mark on their work, but I think he forgot that this is still Harry Potter, and that he should have been more faithful to the text and to the characters, not to mention the overall feel of the series.  I enjoyed the first two movies much more...they captured the magic, and the second film managed to be darker but still hold the charm that the third film almost totally lacked.If this is the way the fourth film is going to be...I might not be too eager to see it.  Goodness knows the fourth book is much longer than the third.  I shudder to think what might result.	2.0	SO disappointing!	2005-01-10	14	9	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1BBFPRPSRCYI1	"Ms. Maxine ""Mario 64 Fan"""	Sorcerer's Stone was good. Chamber of Secrets was better. But Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the by far the best in the Harry Potter movie series!One of the things that I felt was an improvement was the change of directors. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is, without doubt, a better director than Chris Columbus. The Prisoner of Azkaban book was a lot darker than the first two books, and Cuar&oacute;n did a wonderful job on incorporating this feature into the movie. Columbus, in my opinion, was a little too loyal to the books, which can get a little bit boring because you know what to expect. Cuar&oacute;n, however, used his imagination and created a film that was loyal to the book, but also was very original. Cuar&oacute;n put events into the movie that forshadow future events, such as the scene in which Ron and Hermione are standing together looking at the Shrieking Shack, and Malfoy and his gang are teasing them by saying that they are out looking for their dream home. This scene suggests that Ron and Hermione may become a couple in the future. Cuar&oacute;n moved the crew to Scotland, improving the realism of the outdoor scenery. The lake in front of the castle is now a river. Hagrid's cabin now sits on a hill farther away from the castle. The Whomping Willow has been moved to a new location and looks more realistic. Cuar&oacute;n added a rickety, wooden bridge crossing a gap and leading into a courtyard in front of the castle. A giant clock tower stands in front of the courtyard, and in some of the scenes you can see the giant pendulum swinging back and forth. Cuar&oacute;n also changed the way the school uniforms look, and the cast members spend more time in their everyday clothes. This movie is shorter than the other two movies, as there are not as many Quiddich scenes. There are no slow scenes in this film, which is good because they can get a little boring. I didn't like the book all that much, but this film is really great! I hope that the upcoming fourth movie is just as good as this one.This movie introduces several new characters. We meet a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, played by David Thewlis. We see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) for the first time. And of course, you can't forget about Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) or Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall). Sir Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. They have a new Fat Lady (Dawn French). And we see smaller characters such as Parvati Patil and Pansy Parkinson. Plus, wait until you see Buckbeak. He looks so realistic it is almost impossible to belive that he is computer-generated. The dementors look more decayed than I imagined them to be, which is good, and the werewolf is so scary it will make you jump out of your seat!The one thing that was left out of the film was the the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. But they still have four films left to explain that little detail, so I'm not too worried. I would recommend this film to any Harry Potter fan, and if you enjoy this movie, try out the video game, which is just as enjoyable.	5.0	The Best in the Series So Far!	2005-07-03	6	5	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8DVYY08JI5ZX	"Mundungus Fletcher ""Dung"""	I have previously just read several reviews from several other reviewers. Most of them, I strongly disagree with. Alfonso did an awesome job, let me just get that out of the way. I also love the new landscape, which is much more true to the book, at least how I recall it being described. Dumbledore is more playful and youthful, more like the character in the book. Harris seemed too mushy and weak, esspescially in COS. Don't get me wrong, I love his Dumbledore, but I think I perfer Gambon's. As for the wardrobe for Dumbledore, I did think that went a bit off, maybe too quickly. If they would make it a bit shabbier every time, that might be good.All in all, I love the film! It was so much better than the first two! But don't take my opinion for it. Anyway, I also noticed that some of you are sadly uninformed. They finished filming of the fourth film already, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. And shooting for the fifth starts later this year I believe. The sixth film is also in the works. Those of you who don't know this, I suggest either [...] for movies and [...] for Harry Potter specifics. Do find yourselves some good sites.	5.0	Visually stunning... Emotionally more intense...

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AD2ELU7QN8E0L	Musemom	Before I go any further, you may want to know where this is coming from.  I am 15, Catholic, home-schooled, and look upon the use of contractions in formal writing as the first sign that a book is bad.  Rowling uses a lot of contractions.I cannot compare the movie to the book, because I have never had the time necessary to waste on it - though it only took me 2 hrs to finish the first two.The movie was just stupid - any lover of plot or logic will do well to keep away.Item #1: under-age wizards are not alowed to use magic away from the school.This is a sensible enough rule, but it seems as though a) it is never enforced; or b) an exception can be made for 'the one who lived' (or whatever he is called)Item #2: Harry is disturbed that his god-father is after him, and holds him in contempt for being a murder.Come on!! I mean, his life is always in danger because of Valdemort anyway, so lighten up!! As for not liking his god-father's being a murder, what about Harry's blowing-up his aunt?!? That's attempted murder!Item #3: Harry's god-father was one of his parents' best friends.Witches and wizards obviously cannot believe in God. How can these atheistic/agnostic witches have god-parents?  Why would they even baptize their kids?  This brings up a similar point: why do they celebrate Christmas?  Wouldn't they more then likely celebrate Winter Solstice or the Feast of Thor or something?Item #4: a wizard has to learn spells.Wouldn't simple mathematics help with this process? How about chemistry? Algebra? If all these spells are in Latin anyway, shouldn't they have been taught the language? What about english/compostion? How can one expect these students to write 5-'scroll' essays if they cannot even formulate a cohessive paragraph?Item #5: the time traveling.Any good writer knows to keep away from it; such stuff can (and does) burn. My family and I were waiting for the movie to end, when Harry and Hermione traveled back in time - and then they ended up replaying almost a third of the movie.  Please! The dialoge was almost too thriling the first time!! (Did you feel the sarcasim? because that's how I ment it.)Item #6: Harry Potter is a good role model.Listen, Parents: if you're wondering why your kids are being so disrespectful latly, maybe you should peek into one of the Potter books, or actually pay attention to the lessons being taught in the movies.  Harry Potter is selfish, mean, and a witch...excuse me, wizard. He lies, steals, looks up only to those teachers who believe he should get special attention, and (as I pointed out earlier) has attempted murder just because he was upset.  Harry: if you were just humble, patient, obedient and studious, then you might just be a more likable character!Then again, the Culture of Death would probably reject you completly on the basis that you are not reallistically up to date.Item #7: Prof. Snape is hated by all Harry's friends because he is mean.Excuse me? The guy saves Harry's life all the time, and they have the nerve to say that 'he just doesn't like' them?!?  The guy is broken up because he was jelous of Harry's dad (or loved Harry's mom, however you want to read into it); I have to admit that it's pitiful, but gains sympathies. Then Harry comes sturting in like a god (yes on both accounts: he can get away with practically anything at Hogwarts, and he does strut) and expects him to like it. That's another black mark on Harry's ever-growing record.Besides the above, the rest are usual issues: bad effects, non-sensical plot, and poor acting(a lot of the acting was OK, just not up to par with some of the actors' records)The only thing enjoyable about the film (I'll give it this presumtuous title only once) is the score and the cool credit sequence.  Here's a tip: if you want to see this movie, and enjoy it, then switch off the half of your brain you use.PS - I gave this one star only because 'negative 5' stars was not an available option.	1.0	Est Malus! *for those who use Latin in incantations*	2005-01-23	19	2	17

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1PELYJ9NQKG5D	Nadine	"I am another real fan of the Harry Potter series that felt the Charm of the books has been tainted by movie imagery shrouded in the dismal and the dank.  This is a colorless, depressing interpretation, with very little of the warmth and humor so captivating in the books.  While Cuaron may be an interesting and skilled director, he has missed the mark with this movie.  It is too caught up in the trendy, and preoccupied with the way it looks. It's trying way too hard to be cutting-edge cool.....too cool for uniforms, tool cool for English traditions, too cool to keep any of the first to films sets, too cool for any light-hearted humor,  too cool for any of the character interaction that makes the story fun.  If he wanted to make another horror genre film, he should have done so somewhere else and not hoisted these morose surroundings around this Harry Potter film.  Granted, Rowling's storyline becomes gradually more foreboding, but this level of darkness is premature and does not evolve until the 5th or 6th book/installment.  This is such a drastically different approach than the previous 2 films, that they don't even seem connected at all.And Cuaron misses so much of the lush details of the Prisoner of Azkaban book!  There are so many things left unexplained, so many untapped actors left on the sidelines, so much charm that could have been imbued into this story!  His rush to get through this film is a missed opportunity and has left the Harry Potter fans unfulfilled.  This is not the kind of movie you could watch over and over.  There is just not enough content or detail.I WILL say that the casting and acting is undeniably superb!  The music is just marvelous! The sets are extremely well crafted, and special effects are also quite good.  But it's ""too much show, and not enough go"", as they say.  For Harry Potter fans, it will not hold up to the test of time."	3.0	A Disillusionment Charm is Cast	2004-10-24	15	11	4

However, I do take offense to the suggestion by many reviewers that I'm a mindless sheep just because I really enjoyed Prisoner of Azkaban.Yes, I'd seen the trailers, as well as 'the making of' specials, and I've read the actual book at least half a dozen times. It is most certainly my favourite of all five books so far. But unlike so many others, I was not disappointed with the handling of the film, probably for a number of reasons.Firstly, I went in with as few expectations as possible, knowing full well that everything that was in the book could not possibly be included in the movie. There is simply too much, and if Alfonso had done what so many fans seemed to expect of him, we would have ended up with a movie about five hours long. All those who were disappointed by the movie in this respect should forget about going to see Goblet of Fire right now. How do you think they are going to fit everything from that book into two and a half hours?Prisoner of Azkaban was a very well developed film. There were a couple of things that were left out that I was disappointed over, but I'd anticipated it, and it did not detract from my overall enjoyment. The last half hour or so of the film was especially dramatic and exciting, and who could not love the scene in which Harry saves both Black and his alternate self from the Dementors with a powerful patronus spell? I thought it was a nice touch to include the image of the stag, even though the significanceof this was not explained.Those who feel the need to nitpick at every detail are only being detrimental to themselves. I loved being able to sit back once more and immerse myself in a new Harry Potter film, and there was so much about it to enjoy.Our three young heroes are really starting to grow up now - Harry expressed an appropriate and natural anger when he was led to believe that Sirius Black had betrayed his parents to Voldemort despite being their best friend. Hermione is maturing, and showing a wonderful incliment to bending the rules. It might not have been in the book, but I loved the scene where she punched out Draco, then looked back to Ron and Harry and said 'That felt good'.And Ron... well, Ron is just Ron. He tends to be relegated to comic relief but the trio just wouldn't be complete without him. And the hint of a budding relationship betwenen Hermione and himself was encouraging.Overall, there is far more in this movie to be excited about and pleased with, than to complain about. It is unrealistic to expect the director to stick exactly to the book, and not take any liberties - particularly when there is too much in the book to fit into the confines of two hours.Just enjoy the movie, and if you aren't capable of that, then fine. That's your problem. Don't insult others because they do enjoy it.	5.0	Best so far	2004-08-09	20	18	2

The Acting is pretty well done2.It has beautiful camera shots3.It is well directed despite not following the book.4.It is growing up with the generation who first read the book.It is much more dark and I think that that was a good idea on the part of the director because when the series started the kids that were reading were about 8 and on.

There were many non-canon moments, and many moments that could have been cut in favor of some more important deleted scenes.  The Knight Bus, while funny, was very different from the usual, and the  Marauders were practically non-existent.If I had only seen the movie and not read the book, then I would've come out confused:Who are the Marauders?  Maybe that'll be answered in a later movie...But the question is answered in book 3, so why not in movie 3?I did not like the Patronus, as this idea of rolling waves of light is not going to work, especially in the future movie adaptions (DA in movie 5, anyone?).There were some non-canon moments that, again, could have been cut in favor of some of the more important canon deleted scenes.The scene where Harry finds out about Sirius being his Godfather... the book did this about a million times better.  And Dan:  You are a good actor, but you need to learn how to fake cry.  You suck at it.  That whole scene was cheesey and badly invisioned.So, why does this movie earn one star?  As a movie alone, it was the best.  So it would, actually, have five stars if HP was not a book series.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1C7BWPATO40VA	Nathan T.	I'll just go straight to the problem:1)Professor Dumbledore, the new actor that is, doesn't look as wise nor talk as wise. He talks way too fast compared to the one we got use to, is probably shorter and smaller. The old Dumbledore, when he talks, its like something worth listening to, like a rare chat from someone really wise. The new guy isn't anything like it.2)During the movie Ron and Harry notice their other friend popping in without notice. From what I think, they made this subject too minor. What I mean is, they shoulda put in more scenes that would really have the viewers asking, wow whats going on here? Such as: Seeing her in two different places a few moments ago. The professor that gave it to her accidently spoke of it but told them not to ask it again. Etc, make the movie more mysterious. Even though this isn't in the book, shrug.3)It seems like the book contained so many details etc, that the movie couldn't contain it successfully and miss out on a lot of important details that coulda made this movie a lot better.4)The part where Harry was waiting for Peter, the guy that backstabbed his parents to Voldemort, out in the hallway at night, looking at his magical map. Coulda made it more dramatic.There are a bunch of these flaws in the movie, these are just some, maybe they should take a break from making the movies, like the directors etc, are tired out. Thats all I gotta say I'm tired.	3.0	A Decent Movie, But Lost It's Magic. Too many Flaws.	2004-12-05	5	3	2

Both the directors of the 3rd and 4th movies were given opportunites to make extended editions for the sets, but unlike Chris Columbus, they said that the films they originally made were their directors cuts and they did not want to add anymore scenes to their films.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	APNGIX324YTBE	Neene	"I'm looking forward to the release of Azkaban on DVD.  I'm very excited to see that it looks as though about 20 minutes have been added to the running time of the movie and hope they have added many other extras.  I agree with the many people who said that some important aspects of the book were omitted from the movie, such as Hermione's reason for having the time turner and why she gives it up in the end, the growing antagonism between Ron and Hermione over Scabbers/Crookshanks which was a major part of the story, Crookshanks' association with Sirius, the shape of Harry's patronus, Padfoot, Prongs, Mooney and Wormtail, etc.  Inclusion of these elements would have made this movie much more fluid and understandable.  However, I did like some of Alfonso Curion's additons.  I really enjoyed the scene of Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville eating the ""animal"" beans, Buckbeak's intervention when Harry and Hermione are attacked by Lupin, Ron's ""playing up"" his injury with Hermione, etc.  The design of Buckbeak, Lupin (as the werewolf) and the Monster Book of Monsters were phenominal.  J.K. Rowling even infered that unbeknownst to Curion, some of the elements he had added into the movie were elements she had thought to use in future books (I'm thinking something to do with crows??).  I'm really looking forward to this DVD release and to next year's Goblet of Fire (my favorite Harry Potter book!)"	4.0	Review of Azkaban	2004-09-13	5	2	3

Incidentally, people who thought there was less magic in PoA than the previous two weren't paying attention.  It would never occur to Columbus to put a special effects shot anywhere but center frame.  Cuaron gilds his world with magic; Columbus beats you over the head with it.What I really don't understand, though, is this outcry for more Quidditch.  I am a huge fan of the books, but I will gladly admit that Quidditch is simply the stupidest sport ever conceived.  Capturing the Snitch is worth so many points that everything that goes on beforehand is meaningless.  In five books and countless Quidditch matches, only once has the pre-Snitch score mattered, and all I took away from that was that the Romanian Qudditch team is really, really bad.I'd say it's like playing a game of soccer where, at the end of two hours of intense competition, the referree flips a coin to decide the winner, but it's WORSE than that.  It's more like a soccer game where one team is being BLOWN AWAY 14-0, but then some guy from the losing team's backfield who hasn't been paying much attention to the rest of the game notices a shiny quarter sticking out of the mud at his feet, and scores 15 goals for picking it up.  Oh, and is carried off the field on everyone's shoulders and declared a HERO for his excellent... um... eyesight.Less Qudditch is a good thing if you're not logically challenged."	5.0	Excellent film	2004-08-16	6	3	3

The overarching story again is Harry's family, specifically the return of his uncle, Sirius Black.  Background stories are also abound, such as Hermione's excellence in school, Hagrid's new pet, and several new professors at Hogwarts, one of which was close to Harry's parents, Remus Lupin.  The series has a new director, Alfonso Cuaron, who has a long history of adapting books into movies, such as Great Expectations and A Little Princess.  Cuaron here turns the Potter films towards a darker, more sinister mood.  How this movie got a PG rating is still a wonder to me.  Again the special effects are wonderful, as is the dialog, action scenes, cinematography and manifestations of magic.  All in all, a great movie.Just one question; if there is so much magical powers between Harry and the various wizards at Hogwarts, why can they not cure his eyes so he does not have to wear glasses?	4.0	Great movie; one of the best of 2004	2007-07-20	4	4	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11TN8HB78MC20	N	The H.P. books are awesome and the movies are good too but they haven't really remained faithful adaptions of the books like they cut out whole scenes.  In the second movie they left out nearly-headless Nick's deathday party.  The movies however were still really good though.  H.P. #3 is going to be a fantastic movie!!!! The trailer is awesome and I haven't seen  the poster yet so I have to get it. What's puzzling me is Snape's behavior in a part of the trailer when he is protecting Harry, Ron and Hermione.  Of course we know that would never happen but it still looks realllllllllly  cool.  I can't wait.  I don't really mind that part because as I said it looks cool and I want to see the dementors  for him to do that.  Absolutely fab lookin movie.  Can't wait!!!! The new director seems to be doing a greatjob.  I'm going to see the movie 100 times in the theater and I'll go the first day it comes out.  Of course we won't be able to tell what it will really look like until it comes out but from my point of view  it looks to be the best one yet, as book #3 is my fave to.  I can't express how much I am waiting for the movie and I have the trailer on my desk top.  If it's anything to the director,  you look like you're doing an excellent job so far.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-01-01	6	0	6

After 2002's Chamber of Secrets I vowed that I was through with Harry Potter for good.  Jump ahead to late 2003/early 2004 and I happened to watch the trailer for third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and my interest in the franchise was rekindled.Harry's third year at Hogwarts is again filled with danger and mystery.  After running away from his aunt and uncle's house Harry finds out that he's once again a marked man.  Mass murderer, Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge Voldemort.  To make matters worse the school is now home to the Dementors of Azkaban who are searching for Sirius Black and have a terrible affect on Harry.  In addition to all of that, Harry must try and win the Quiddich Cup, meet his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and find out how Sirius Black has ties to Voldemort, his parents, and even himself.This is the film that turned around the whole franchise for me but it wasn't just one or two improvements that made me change my mind on Harry Potter.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban improves on the original two films in almost every conceivable way; tone, effects, direction, pacing, and the quality of the acting and the new cast additions are just a few of the ways that this film improves over previous installments.  Is there still humor in the film?  Yes.  Is it cringe worthy?  No, its natural character humor and it's not all sight gags either.  The kids begin to ""own"" their characters more by injecting more of their own personalities into their roles.  The CGI continues to improve the further you move into the series, a lot of the effects are so subtle you'll hardly notice they're effects at all.  The use of puppetry is more apparent in Prisoner of Azkaban than any of the previous films.  At times it doesn't always match up perfectly with the CGI but I let most of those imperfections slide because of my love of practical effects.  Gone is director Chris Columbus, who was good working with children but his films lacked visual flare and any sense of foreboding.  Columbus does stick around as a producer for this film but his influence seems minimal at best.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Great Expectations, Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, Children of Men) steps into the director's chair and makes an immediate difference in the tone and look of the film.  Cuar&oacute;n's use of wide angle lenses allows for more of the film's frame to appear sharp and allows both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same.  Prisoner of Azkaban is dark and moody but is also an extremely handsome looking film that makes portions of Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets look like a high budgeted TV movie.  The farther into the series you go the more complicated the books become but beginning with this film the story is streamlined to focus more on Harry's story and less on the surrounding characters secondary plot lines.  Potter book fanatics dislike this because beloved sections of the novels are cut from the films.  It's necessary however to keep the story moving towards it's goal and the pacing of Azkaban is helped by this.  While shorter than Sorcerer's Stone or Chamber of Secrets, Azkaban flies by hardly feeling like a 2 hour, 21 minute film.  One of my few complaints about Azkaban is that I wish it was a little longer so I could enjoy it just a little more.All the Potter films have had incredible casts filled with some of the best English actors working today but Azkaban might be my favorite.  After Chamber of Secrets had finished shooting, Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) became ill.  He persuaded producers not to recast his role (they agreed) but shortly before the film was released Harris died.  The producers then had the difficult task of recasting the Dumbledore role.  Ian McKellen was offered the role but he turned it down since he had recently played Gandolf in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and because he thought it would be inappropriate since Richard Harris had once referred to him as a ""dreadful"" actor.  The estate of Richard Harris wanted the role to go to Richard's close friend Peter O'Toole but he also turned it down.  Christopher Lee and Richard Attenborough expressed interest in taking over the role but ultimately it went to Michael Gambon (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Open Range).  The casting of Gambon isn't universally loved by all Potter fans but I think his portrayal of Dumbledore is more energetic and lively than what Richard Harris was capable of in his later years.David Thewlis (Kingdom of Heaven, The Big Lebowski) is this years Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, a poor but kind man with a terrible secret.  Lupin is one of my favorite characters from the books and I can't imagine anyone but Thewlis playing him.  Before seeing him in this I had only seen Thewlis in a few films but since he's become one of my favorite actors and I make a point to see whatever he's in.  Timothy Spall and Emma Thompson also join the cast and while their screen time is limited they make the most of it.  The biggest contribution to the cast comes in the form of Gary Oldman (Batman Begins, The Fifth Element, Sid & Nancy) playing the escaped killer Sirius Black.  Knowing he was in this movie helped re-interest me in the franchise and I wasn't disappointed.  Gary Oldman is like a chameleon, he's always able to reinvent himself and put in an amazing performance even in a small role.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite film so far in the franchise.  Some Potter purest's have had an issue with the streamlining of the plot but I think it makes Azkaban a more accessible film to non-hardcore fans.  I love the great additions to the cast, the new director and his stylistic choices, and how the maturing subject matter is handled.  This is where the Potter films really hit their stride and show the great potential of the future films.The Blu-ray""If it's not broke, don't fix it"" should be a term that the folks at Warner Brothers Home Video should learn.  Packaging is a big deal to me especially when the set is expensive, large, and is just one part of a larger set.  Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were released in December 2009 and Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire (review coming next week) were released in October 2010.  Within that ten month period the powers at be decided to change the packaging.  The first two Blu-ray sets feature a cardboard slipcover with raised lettering that slides vertically over the rest of the package  This set (and Goblet of Fire) is slightly taller and instead of raised lettering have a lenticular card inserted on the front cover.  They also slide horizontally over the rest of the package.  The new design doesn't work as well as the first sets for a couple of reasons.-The lenticular card can come out but that causes the flaps holding it in to stick out slightly.-The slipcover folds together but the seam isn't flush and pushes the sets apart when they're on the shelf.  The slipcover on the first two sets are glued instead of folded so they sit next to each other much better.None of these issues are a deal breaker for they're still handsome looking sets.  I just don't understand why you would change the design to the point that they don't match each other when they're lined up especially when the sets cost $30 or more each.  Once inside the sturdy cardboard slipcover you'll find just the theatrical cut of the film.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n was given the opportunity to assemble an extended cut but declined saying that the theatrical cut was his preferred version of the film.  There's of course a second Blu-ray loaded with special features, a standard-def (SD) DVD of special features, a digital copy code (no separate disc), the collectible book, and two character cards (Hermione Granger, Sirius Black).If you were disappointed with the packaging you're not going to be disappointed with the video or audio quality however.  With each progressive film they continue to impress in terms of picture quality.  This is the same transfer used on the previously released Blu-ray and HD-DVD and it still looks great even four years later.  Detail is excellent, there's no obvious edge enhancement, artifacting, or DNR which considering how much of the film is cloaked in fog, shadow, and darkness is quite a feat.  There's a little bit of black crushing during the darkest of scenes but it's quickly gone and I hardly noticed it.The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track sounds fantastic.  Dialogue is always clear and never gets lost even when the action picks up.  The surround channels are very active, from mysterious creaking noises to brooms zooming by there are plenty of directional effects.  The LFE channel gets a good workout as well, especially during the thunderstorm filled Quidditch match and scenes in the Forbidden Forest.  John Williams final Harry Potter score sounds wonderful, always sounding clear and at the right level not overpowering of what's happening on screen.Prisoner of Azkaban DOES NOT feature a PiP track like the two previous Ultimate Edition Blu-rays have.  No explanation has been given on why a PiP track wasn't made for this film but I'm disappointed that it's missing.  Since Azkaban is my favorite Potter film I would have loved to have seen more of a behind the scenes look at the film.  Packaging this as an Ultimate Edition without an Extended Cut of the film and no PiP track is seems a little disingenuous to me.  Thankfully not all is lost, there is still the third part of the Creating the World of Harry Potter documentary.  Part III Creatures focuses on just that, all the different creatures featured in the Harry Potter world. Hippogriffs to Goblins to Voldemort himself are covered here in this 63 minute doc.  You get a very interesting look at the creature effects shop, models, make-up, how the CGI is done and how the process has changed in the last 10+ years.  Easily the best feature of the set considering the exclusion of the aforementioned PiP commentary.  Also included are a collection of deleted scenes (presented in HD), some SD vintage TV docs, a SD interview with Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, a short featurette about the how people are transformed in the make-up chair (also in HD), and three trailers (all in HD). A third disc, a standard definition DVD, is included that has some other special features from past DVD releases but I don't even bother putting that garbage in my players anymore.ConclusionHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't just a wonderful Harry Potter film, it's wonderful film period.  Unfortunately it's harder to recommend this Ultimate Edition since you don't get as much bang for you buck as you did with the first two Ultimate Editions.  For a cheaper option you can pick up the single disc Blu-ray for around $10."	4.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ultimate Blu-ray Edition	2012-02-17	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A20ZFWGBY4REFX	"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan"""	"I finally managed to see ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" at the theater a couple of weeks ago, and I thought that this highly anticipated third installment of the ""Harry Potter"" cinematic franchise largely based on J.K. Rowling's bestselling ""Harry Potter"" books was, by far, the most thrilling and spellbinding ""Potter"" film that I've seen since 2001's ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and 2002's ""The Chamber of Secrets""! The direction of Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", ""A Little Princess""), who took over for Chris Columbus (who directed the first two blockbusters), was extraordinary! The performance of young Daniel Radcliffe (""The Tailor of Panama"") just couldn't be better! In fact, this is a Harry Potter like you've never seen him before, and Radcliffe's performance in ""Azkaban"" was just as powerful and intense as his ""Chamber of Secrets"" performance! The performances of Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) were funny and flawless! Especially the performance of Watson, who managed to surprise me with her role in this third film. Well done, Emma! Joining the young stars are Gary Oldman (""Leon: The Professional""), Michael Gambon (""Gosford Park""), David Thewlis (""The Island of Dr. Moreau""), Emma Thompson (""Love Actually""), Robbie Coltrane (007: ""The World is Not Enough""), Alan Rickman (""Die Hard""), Maggie Smith (""Gosford Park""), Julie Walters (""Calendar Girls""), Julie Christie (""Troy""), Timothy Spall (""Nicholas Nickleby""), Richard Griffiths (""Blame It On the Bellboy""), and Fiona Shaw (""Super Mario Bros.), in which they gave excellent performances as well.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" focuses once again on Harry Potter (Radcliffe) deciding to return for his third year to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after not only having a miserable summer with Uncle Vernon (Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Shaw), but also blowing up, like a balloon, a tyrannical Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris, ""Matilda"") for badmouthing Harry's parents. On his way back to Hogwarts, Harry boards a triple-decker bus for a ride so speedy it's nutzoid, as a shrunken head chatters like a refugee from ""Beetlejuice"". After meeting up with best friends Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry makes the annual train ride back to Hogwarts. But the train ride is interrupted by the Dementors, the Azkaban Prison's forbidding guards, who are on the lookout for escaped convict Sirius Black (Oldman). During the film, we get to see a couple of new faces at Hogwarts, including Remus Lupin (Thewlis), Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Prof. Sybil Trelawney (Thompson), a divination teacher who guides her students into exploring their sixth senses. But the worst is yet to come, though. Year three is jeopardized by Sirius Black, who has mysteriously made his way into Hogwarts, presumably to kill Harry. Yet only the professors at Hogwarts know the link between their prize pupil and Black. It's up to Harry, Hermione, and Ron to solve the mystery in a race against (and with) time. Not only that, but Harry also prepares himself to confront the man whom Harry believes has betrayed his parents.There has been a lot of change going on throughout the making of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"", especially for the young actors (Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint) to show some age and maturity. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are getting older. Fifteenish, in fact. Yet, nevertheless, it's a unique pleasure to watch these children grow up on screen, and they are doing so into fine actors along the way. On that note, actor Michael Gambon (as Prof. Albus Dumbledore) takes over for the late Richard Harris, who portrayed Prof. Dumbledore in the first two ""Potter"" films. While Harris was regal in a way that Gambon cannot replace, the life is back in Dumbledore's cheeks and we gain a greater sense of playfulness at that. At 2 hours and 21 minutes (141 mins.), ""Azkaban"" is the shortest ""Harry Potter"" flick yet, despite springing from the first longest book of the three. But I really didn't care how long ""Azkaban"" was, as long as I was expecting a great ""Harry Potter"" film, I'll be just fine.In conclusion, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" has exactly what a ""Harry Potter"" film should have: great characters, riveting storytelling, laugh-out-loud humor, a splendid cast, and astonishing special effects! Like ""The Chamber of Secrets"", ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" will leave me with a feeling of going back and watching the first two films all over again! Bottom line, I cannot wait for the next ""Harry Potter"" film, ""The Goblet of Fire"", to be released next year, nor can I wait for the inevitable DVD release of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban""!"	5.0	Harry Potter's back, better, and stronger than ever!!	2004-06-30	3	1	2

Being my favourite book in the series, I have no doubt that this movie will be amazing - especially seeing the trailer which DEFINATELY outdoes the first two movies. Cuaron seemed a bit dodgy at first, especially seeing the other movies he's done ;). But looking at the trailer (for the 27th time) I LOVE the new look that he has for the characters, the movie seems a lot more true of the book and the general feeling is a LOT more exciting than the first two which I must admit dissapointed me in their 'slowness'.

I cant imagine what a person who hasnt read the book would think.  The movie makes no sense, I dont understand why the screenwriter and director left out so many plot points, but found time to put in pointless sceenes with shrunken heads, harry deep in thought or harry walking through the woods talking to lupin(that especially makes no sense for lupin to spend so much time with harry. I know he did in the book, but I dont recall them having deep heart to heart talks. Most people arent that close with their teachers.)All in all I just dont like this movie, it will go on my list of the worst movies Ive seen.

I absolutely loved the books and the first two movies, I feel, really did the books justice, but this one lacked in detail. I know that that condensing plays a large part in making books into movies but come on! The movie missed out on a lot of important features that were in the book.I have really never been keen on the idea of the book set becoming a movie set mainly for the reason of important features. The books let you create your own images from your imagination. The movies really take the fun out of your thoughts.	4.0	Not what I thought it should be	2004-10-11	11	5	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1P2BGXS8BUXQJ	N. Kested	I'm perhaps one of the biggest Harry Potter fans ever, but that's not the only reason why i absolutely loved this movie.  Along with the incredibly witty plot and humor, the viewer also gets a chance to escape reality, and bury themselves in the world of wizardry and magic in Hogwarts.  This movie if full of suspense, it's also geared not only to younger viewers, but for more mature viewers as well.  I am 14 years old and am in the 8th grade and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  If your worried about the new Dumbledore, don't be.  He is an amazing actor.  He is a bit more energetic but still maintains the intellect and encouragement that Richard Harris did in the first 2 movies.  I can't say enough good things about this movie and I urge everyone to see it as soon as possible.	5.0	Incredible	2004-06-05	0	0	0

I am Potter book fan and one of many who detest the producers for the Harry Potter movies. If anything, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" now stands as the worst of the three currently out.The screenwriters massacred the timeline. Unless you've read the books, the myriad of plotholes will leave you confused. Nor is the acting the best. Although the souless dementors were portrayed nicely in term of their freezing a person to their very hearts, their flying made it lose the dark, subtle fear that represented the dementors. My criticism does not end here but I won't bore you with my outrage.One can only enjoy the music of this movie and the setting if one can stand watching the movie without moaning in agony. And the new Dumbledore is better than the original but I'm biased because my initial mental representation of Dumbldore looked more like thie new actor.Of the first three books, Prisoner of Azkaban was the longest by approximately 100 pages yet the fourth novel exceeds the others by 300-400 pages. After watching the first three movies, the destruction of the fourth movie will cause death of fans due to horrified disbelief. The producers butchered Harry Potter and if you are a fan of the books, save yourself the heartache."	1.0	Plot-hole Fest	2005-03-02	8	5	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1VOXN0B6EYY8C	nonstopreader	Definitely a little more mature than the previous 2 Harry movies.  All 3 lead characters and actors are beginning to look like teens (there's even a brief scene of hand-holding -- VERY BRIEF!).  The plot is a bit darker than before and the images a bit darker - I would think this film might disturb the younger Harry fans, but might very much please the slightly older ones because it's more mature.  The scenes are a bit more violent than previously.  ALl in all, though, it's a fun film and I, as an adult, enjoyed it, too!	4.0	Harry is growing up!	2005-02-21	3	3	0

Soon after the beginning, there is an odd bus ride that I did not enjoy as much as I did in reading about it in the book.  Also, the movie overdoes the warnings of potential dangers from Sirius Black.  Finally, there are some serious changes from the book that appear in the movie.  And, there is a bunch of things in the book that do not make it to the movie.However, once we are past the first quarter of the movie, it really got much better in my estimation.  The movie is less confusing than is the book for the last three quarters of the story.  There is a serious exception.  We get to the Shreeking Shack and, just when we need clarity, the movie is confusing.  Nevertheless, at the end, I appreciated the story that J. K. Rowling had created more than I had at the end of the book.  On the other hand, I think I would have been totally lost if I had not read the book first.I recommend this movie but read the book before going."	4.0	A very good movie.	2008-11-29	0	0	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A32MU8D0SGRB4K	"Oddities ""Ode"""	"The following views are told by the views of a dissapointed child who had their hopes and imaginations crushed by the terrible ideas in the recent movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; but the DVD features had also contributed to the strenuous amounts of dissapointment to the true, literal fans of Harry Potter and this movie had caused confusion to the non-fans as well, I hope that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will not sink as low as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, These are a few things that caused PoA to be terrible.1. Harry used a lumos spell in his bedroom at the Dursleys house in Privet Drive, you are not supposed to use magic unless it was an emergency in front of muggles (it was not even in the book).2. Aunt Marge floated out the door, when in the books, Aunt Marge was supposed to float towards the ceiling (talk about over acting).3. The Knight Bus contained a shrunken head which was quite annoying, even in the DVD. Dobby was annoying too, but it was needed for the story to continue. Ernie Prang looks like someone's blind grandfatther and Stan Shunpike looked like a hobo or a bum living on the streets, the new hunchback Tom, the innkeeper looks like someone from the Addams' family.4. Harry was supposed to receive The Monsters Book of Monsters from Hagrid at the Dursleys, but instead he got it in The Leaky Cauldron.5. Lupin looks like an old man from the 1940's with a very aggrivating mustache.6. The Sneakeoscope was not even shown in the movie, not even Pigwidgeon, or the owls that came to the Dursleys.7. Dementors are not supposed to fly, they are suppossed to glide and water is not supposed to freeze when they come near. They are not supposed to chase Harry in the air during the Quidditch game.8. The new Dumbledore and Trelawney looks like drugged-up hippies from the 1960's and Flitwick looks like a monk from the Dark Ages, what happened to our dear old Flitwick. Cornelius Fudge's new look reminds me of a character from the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.9. New characters that do not even appear in the book suddenly appear in the movie with a much bigger role.10. Buckbeak looks like a fake chicken and too much time was spent on Buckbeak's Flight, when Harry screamed out with his hands out, it reminded me of Titanic, ""I'm King of the World."".11. Things are pronounced incorrectly, like Expecto Patronum! and Boggart and Sir Cadogan.12. The new Fat Lady was more obnoxious and so out of character, she was not supposed to sing. I miss the old Fat Lady from the 1st film, Sir Cadogan barely even had a role in this movie.13. Students barely wore their robes, the robes made it feel more magical. Instead they wear crappy clothes, this is not a Gap commercial.14. Draco was not supposed to give Harry an origami bird and neither should there be anyone struck by lightning. Students do not paint there face for a Quidditch game.15. In the Marauder's showed rooms that did not even exist in the books and it was not supposed to show footsteps, it was only supposed to reveal a dot, and Peter Pettigrew was not supposed to show up on the map when Harry saw it.16. The Firebolt scene was jumbled-up, looked even more beaten-up than the Nimbus 2000, and did not even show up until the final scene which made me want to vomit.17. Trelawney's prediction was all wrong and looked fake as if she were going through a seizure.18. Many parts of the story did not show up in the movie at all, like the argument about Crookshanks and Scabbers, Scabber's true identity, Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, Hermione purchasing Crookshanks and the books for the courses she was taking through her birthday money that her parents gave her, Sirius Black giving up his position as secret-keeper to Peter Pettigrew, Hermione leaving Muggle Studies class, Lavender Brown losing her baby bunny, Binky to a fox, Hermione's turn with a boggart, Lupin drinking the wolfsbane potion, Sirius Black breaking into the dormitory, Snape's version of Sirius, Lupin, James, and Peter and how he was almost killed by the whomping willow when it was set by sirius during the transformation, but James saved him, the marauders were unregistered animagus, and othere parts of the book that did not make it into the movie.19. Honeydukes looks like a place where people smoke, sell, and buy drugs. Harry was not supposed to take the blood-flavored lollipop from Neville. The Shrieking Shack and other scenes were too rushed in this film. Harry's crying made me want to throw up. Harry was supposed to throw mud at Draco and his gang, but instead he threw snowballs at them.20. Lupin looked like a hairless mexican dog when he transformed into a werewolf.21. The sets (the whomping willow, too much time was spent when the birds kept hitting into the tree), scenery (Hagrid's hut was moved into a steep hill instead of the by the castle like it was supposed to.), locations, actors, and camera techniques changed.22. The acting went from bad to worse, The dialogue went from terrible to horrible. There were too many instances with shrunken heads, mirror (reflections), time (growing up), giant pumpkins (Pumpkins cannot grow in Hagrid's Hut in June, it would have rotted there), and hideous dark crows. This movie tried to be funny, dark, creative, and different from the other Harry Potter films which ended up to be the worst Harry Potter film so far. This movie was too short, not literal, not accurate, and the director did not even read the Harry Potter books.23. Hermione was not supposed to grab Ron's wrists, it is so wrong. There was not supposed to be anything between the 2. I felt as the director had decided to add fanfiction ideas and string up rumors that are not true. There are only 5 deleted scenes. Everything in the 1st 2 films were much longer.24. Alfonso Cuaron should not be able to the direct any more Harry Potter films, Mike Newell is already wrecking Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire from what I have seen and heard of so far. I am hoping the director for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will do much better because so far, Harry Potter has been inking lower with each movie, I am afraid that the next Harry Potter film might bomb. My hope is quickly fading as I hear more about the next Harry Potter movie.I heard that this Harry Potter movie foreshadows events in the last 2 Harry Potter books, if that is true, then the 6th and 7th Harry Potter books will be ruined, Only time can only tell when I know what happens.P.S. Snape looks like he's constipated."	1.0	Horrible	2005-01-12	26	12	14

The protagonists are portrayed as credible teenagers, gently blossoming into adolescents; beginning to succumb to the nascent teenage urge to rebel, and (in Ron and Harry's case) noticing for the first time that there may be more fun things to do with Hermione than copying her Defence of Dark Arts homework.Cuar&oacute;n deftly reinforces this inevitable revelation of forbidden fruit with his visual imagery: we open to Harry frantically manipulating with his wand (fnarr fnarr) beneath the bedclothes in Privet Drive. A huge pendulum swings menacingly over the children at Hogwarts. The children are confronted with secret maps and the repeated unlocking and relocking of various devices, mostly containing monsters. In doing this Cuar&oacute;n isn't taking too much licence: these themes are all (somewhat buried) in Rowling's text; Cuar&oacute;n has only really extracted an essence which was already there. I'm grateful to him for doing so; I didn't really notice it when I read the book.One other standout visual is the climatic scene at the lakeside where, eerily, Cuar&oacute;n seems to capture the mood of William Blake's engravings from Dante's Inferno.It isn't a perfect picture: as both of Columbus' attempts did, it hurls along at a breakneck pace (largely because it has to in order to get everything in), but this haste obscures the supposed timescale - what is meant to take place over a year seems (despite the seasons coming and going) to occur in the space of an evening - and certain significant exchanges seem to be rushed, and therefore lose their resonance.A couple of other observations: Gary Oldman is surprisingly understated as the ""villain"" Sirius Black, almost to the point of being disappointing, and Rupert Grint (no doubt at Cuar&oacute;n's insistence) resists the urge to pull even a single Ron Weasley gurn. Matthew Lewis, who plays class runt Neville Longbottom, has (I'm sure to the production designers' horror) managed to hit puberty six months earlier than anyone else, and now towers over the rest of his classmates, but manages to gangle in a way which preserves his affectionate goofiness. Finally, star turns to Emma Thompson, an acutely nearsighted clairvoyant (!) and Timothy Spall, who, rather as he did in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, hilariously plays a man who's been a rat for 12 years. The screenplay writers have done well in retaining JK Rowling's playful characterisations, and Thompson and Spall in particular have brought this to vivid life.On this evidence and in Cuar&oacute;n's hands the Goblet of Fire, which was a great improvement as a novel over the Prisoner of Azkaban, should be an absolute cracker.Good show.Olly Buxton"	4.0	This time, a grown-ups' film the kids will enjoy	2004-06-03	8	5	3

"The third part of the Harry Potter series is better than its predecessors, but still lacks the emotional resonance of other literary adaptations (e.g. ""Lord of the Rings"").  Moments of awe abound, but the plot and sub-plots seem disjointed and superficial.  The problem is still the source book.  Rowling books contain a series of peaks to be digested in several sitting sessions, each chapter or group of chapters being sometimes radically different adventures that together conform a plot.  Those books don't have the scope of Tolkien work, or the movie-minded shallowness of, say, Dan Brown's ""The DaVinci Code"".

I have read all the books and I felt that there was a lot of important background left out of this movie.  The first two movies were longer even though the books were shorter than Prisoner of Azkaban.  I think they could have tacked on another 30 min and stayed true to the book.  My six and eight year old had no problem sitting through the first two, I know it wouldn't have bothered them to sit through a little more in this one.  I also didn't like that he changed the appearance of hogwarts.  I know each director has his own style, but I think he could have left the appearance the same and still left his own imprint on the movie.  I did think, however, that he did a better job at accurately portraying Snape's attitude toward Harry, but he didn't give him enough screen time.  The same holds true with Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  All-in-all, the movie wasn't bad, but that is an adult's perspective.  My children enjoyed it just as much as the first two.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3SD6DJYZ00ACJ	Pam  Williams	"My suggestion is - read the book first!!!  The movie was quite a bit different from the book, so at least then you will know what is going on and why. Particularly confusing are the relationships between Sirius Black, Prof. Lupine, Peter Pettigrew, James Potter and Prof. Snape. And the roles between ""Scabbers"" the rat and ""Crookshanks"" the cat were greatly diminished when compared to the book.  My husband, who likes Harry Potter but had not read the book, was really confused.  If you have read the book, you just shake your head and say ""...but there was soooo much more to it than that"" or ""...that's not really how it happened"". There was a surprising lack of Quidditch, which was very disappointing as I had really looked forward to the matches. The Dementors were not near as scary as the book made them out to be, and the Werewolf did not look convincing at all (too smooth and stretched out, he looked like a drawing). The two obvious bright spots were Buckbeak the Hippogriff, they did an awesome job on him, and the Bogart, which was done really well.  Also the Marauders Map was quite good. I did not care too much for the new Dumbledore. Not that he did a bad job, it is just that Michael Gambon does not have the presence/power (the believable magic) that Richard Harris brought to the role. The kids did a great job of acting, as usual, but I really missed them wearing their Hogwarts robes.  I dare say we are all used to muggle clothing so by removing the robes and putting them in muggle clothing they removed some of the Hogwarts magic making it more mundane. I actually believe they waited a little too long in-between movies, the kids look so much more grown-up and act much older than when they were in ""Chamber of Secrets"". Director Alfonso Cuaron seemed to depend far too much on scenery (which was breathtaking no doubt) and not enough on following the book. Plus, the movie seems to be shot with the contrast up too high and the colors dark filtered.  Overall I was not overly impressed with it, but it's Harry Potter so I will buy it when it comes out for home sales.  I can only hope that Mike Newell will do a better job in directing book number 4 ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"".Pam W - San Jose, CA"	4.0	I saw the Advanced Screening in San Jose, CA	2004-05-24	10	9	1

Rowling is responsible for a lot of it, but the director Cuar&oacute;n has used symbolism as a visual tool to alert the audience to impending danger and to keep tensions high. Traditionally, black-feathered birds such as ravens, crows, and vultures all have negative images associated with them; they are usually used to represent carnage, bloodshed and battle; they are thought of in terms of scavengers, messengers of the dead, and evil. Crows abound in this film, but Cuar&oacute;n has extended their traditional roles, turning them into symbols of the Dementors, which fly around menacingly in black garments with feather-like hems. Even when the Dementors are out of sight (they are not allowed on the grounds of Hogwart's School) you can feel their presence in the crows.Rowling's most obvious use of symbolism is in the name she gives the escaped prisoner Sirius Black. Sirius is a star in the constellation Canis Majoris (in mythology, Canis Majoris is one of Orion's hunting dogs), the brightest star in the sky. So, Sirius is also called the Dog Star, and everyone knows that the dog is distinguished above all other inferior animals for intelligence, docility, and attachment to man. Would she give such a name, with all its implications, to a villainous character? Not likely. But she would give it to a wizard who could change into a dog.It is late in the summer, Harry preparing for his third year at Hogwart's, when an obnoxious relative demeans his father's memory, causing Harry to lose his temper. As a result, Harry violates the rules of student witches and wizards, causing the offending aunt to inflate as a dirigible and float away into the night sky on a stream of invectives. It is a delightful opening to a film with far more serious issues to explore and frightening obstacles to overcome. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), imprisoned at Azkaban for complicity in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped, and is looking for Harry. The soul-stealing prison guards called 'Dementors' (Latin for mind-removers) are searching for Black everywhere, but when he and Harry meet, there are revelations which change everything.Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has taken the images conjured by J.K. Rowling's magical words and created from her book, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' a film rife with visual symbolism and alive with inventive images beyond those established by the first two films in the series. The selection has resulted in a film darker and more mature than its predecessors, just as was the book, but it is also approachable for young people.Among the new visual images are animal ghosts who wander the halls of Hogwart's Castle and the film's realization of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, like Sirius, falsely accused and condemned. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and all of the established characters return. Led by Harry, all the students have matured considerably, as you would expect of 13-year-olds; they are more independent and self assured, more emotionally developed and far less childlike in their reactions and bearing. Michael Gambon is new and effective as Aldus Dumbledore, following the death of Richard Harris. Emma Thompson is wonderfully wacky as Divination Professor Sybil Treelawney; who leaps from the pages of the book and onto the screen as if Rowling had written the character specifically for Thompson. Also new is Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewles), who comes to Harry's aid in ways that might befit his Latin name. Remus was the brother of the founder of Rome. In mythology, he was nursed by a she-wolf; Lupin means wolf-like (wolf is Canis Lupis).The unheralded thread of creative continuity in this marvelous series, as it moves from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n to incoming director Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, now in production) is Screenwriter Steve Kloves. He and the producers have been true to Rowling's works and to Harry's fans, in ways that have always enhanced, not diminished, the author's incredible achievement.In a nutshell, this movie is fabulous and highly recommend to everyone!	5.0	What can I say??

Yes, movies books, and everything included. From the three movies so far, I agree that The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best of all in cinematographical merits, but the quality of the DVD is inferior to its predecessors. The first two came in a nice flip cardboard boxes, while this one comes in the standard DVD-case. Honestly when you place your three DVD's the last one doesn't look good compared with the previous ones.Now commenting on the contents of the DVD, I have to say I was very disappointed too. The extra scenes were only 3 and basically none provided anything else to what we had seen. The extra scenes from both The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets were certainly more and added a little bit of info to the movie that had to be cut for length matters.Anyway, as a fan this DVD is a must, but certainly it could have been better, considering all the months we had to wait to get it. Definitely I expected more, I hope for The Goblet of Fire DVD the WB guys will do better.	4.0	It was the best movie and the worst DVD	2004-12-02	3	3	0

I know Richard Harris is a hard act to follow, but they really needed someone with "" presence"".But hey, they have done so well with casting so far, I guess they can be forgiven!Overall the movie was executed well, particuarly the marauders map and the Hogsmead village.However the warmth, spark and magic from the earlier movies seemed to missing- all these reveiwers who mentioned this can't be wrong!!Good points: Alan Rickman continues his superb role as Professor Snape, and Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as the new Divination Professor.Robbie Coltrane is brilliant as always as Hagrid.I look forward to the next one with interest.Worth a good look or two!"	4.0	Not as good as the first two- but still entertaining!	2004-12-22	6	2	4

First, the price of these movies are among the cheapest I have seen and the quality is excellent. Most people are probably aware by now the premise of the movie and that it is the first of the darker Harry Potter films since Chris Columbus gave up the reins as director and it can be pretty scary in places for the kids (especially the Werewolf transformation). The transfer to Blu-Ray is excellent and to me is probably the best of the earlier series thus far.

I'll just say that I wasn't expecting to be incredibly impressed, I had already read the book several times and I thought the scenes which they chose to transfer to film were fairly well acted and the spirit of the book was fairly well captured. I think the overarching difficulty with these HP movies is that they're rushing them into production to ride the initial hype.Let's face it - there weren't any studios back in the 40's that were breaking down doors to sign deals to film Tolkien's work which was being written at the time. Then feeble attempts were made by animators to capture the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in one regular-length animated feature. Not until Peter Jackson recently spent years producing 9.5 or so hours worth of screen time had justice been done to the popular fantasy.But they are rushing these movies into production, producing them virtually simultaneously with the writing of the books. The Harry Potter series has arguably more character development and dialogue than Lord of the Rings and thus requires more meticulous attention to scene selection to fit in to an average length movie. In a story like POA the film-makers are necessarily going to leave out huge gaps either in the class time, the Quidditch scenes or the long amounts of dialogue at the climax when they discover the true identity of Pettigrew and Black. This last part is the one I feel suffers the most although I think the time-turner experience is very well done.They simply have too much material to translate with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and it's only going to get harder with the next 2 films. Personally I would have enjoyed POA broken into 2 films much better or even a 3 hour movie, but that would be a harder sell for sure, especially for a ""kid's movie""."	3.0	They are rushing these movies into production	2005-05-23	3	2	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AG4PCIIQ58755	PenneyL	Alfonso Cuaron has made a drab and disappointing film. Here is a classic example of a director mucking up a perfectly fine story. While of course it isn't possible to put every nuance of these books onscreen, Chris Columbus did a fine job with the first two. In this one, Cuaron reshuffled the Hogwarts grounds layout for no reason, ignored most of the secondary storylines even when they were extremely important to the story as a whole, failed to develop the new characters, and apparently told the actors to walk through their parts. After the first two wonderful Harry Potter movies, this was a big let-down.	2.0	Flat, Drab, Disappointing	2004-12-27	15	11	4

This director sucks, not because he changed things about the film, but because he can't tell a good story. I had high hopes that this director would build on the good story told by Chris Columbus (the 1st director).

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A39L6FG6O2IZ75	person	"I was very pleased with the first Harry Potter film. The school was just as I had imagined it in the book, most of the actors did a very good job representing their character (particularly Hagrid, Snape, and Dumbledore), the music was positively wonderful and fit perfectly, and it had a kind of charm to it that was simply fantastic. The second movie (despite being my least favorite book) was even better.Characters:However, this new movie takes everything the first two did and throws it away. To start with, the actor that replaced the old Dumbledore is dreadful. He turns the wise old wizard, the only man ""He-who-must-not-be-named"" ever feared and turns him into a character of the dopey school principal. I also hated the way Lupin was portrayed. He was nothing like he was in the book. In the book, he was one of my favorite characters but the movie turned him into a bland, uninteresting teacher. It was also completely ridicules how the wizards (even at school) were wearing normal clothes. In the books, wizards don't even know how to where normal clothes when it is necessary. I'm not even sure how they managed to turn Malfoy into a sissy baby.Plot:The plot is manipulated in ways that are completely unnecessary (things like changing the time when Harry got his new broomstick). It also lingered on unimportant parts, and cut down or left out entirely important and interesting parts. The scene in the shrieking shack (one of my favorite parts in the book) was cut down terribly. The only part that was done well was the part with the time-turner.MoodI also hated the new mood of the movie. The director tries to give it a darker feel, but it ends up drastically overdone, to the point of being extremely pretentious. However, some parts of the movie are simply silly for silly's sake and are not pulled off successfully. One such scene is the night bus. The same thing is done with he portrayal of Professor Trelawny. She is made into a whimsical character, rather than a realistic one with funny qualities. Throughout the whole movie, the director completely looses the entire feel of harry Potter. He could have made it darker without completely discarding the first two.Music:I also hated John William's new score. The new music composed is significantly less lyrical than the first and takes out the sense of ""wonder"" the first two had. Even the main theme is only played for several seconds at the beginning. To me, the old music had a much greater emotional effect and fit much better with the feel of the books.ContinuityHowever, the worst thing in this new movie was how the new director completely changed the orientation of Hogwarts, the students' school. The school now looks completely different. Nothing is in the same place it was before. There is now a giant clock tower at the entrance, and Hagrid's cabin has been moved from a flat pasture within sight of the school to a rocky hillside hidden in a small valley. The Wamping Willow was not in the same place, there was a bridge that didn't appear in the first two,I really hated this movie. It's as if the new director wanted to completely disregard everything done before him and pretend as though, not only that no previous movies had been made, but that it was his own story as well. The only reason this movie was worth watching is because it stuck loosely to the magnificent plot J.K Rowling crafted in the book."	1.0	Not Harry Potter	2007-08-01	6	5	1

The books are incredible, but this is the only movie so far that has come close to being as good as the book.  (All you people who have just seen the movies -- READ THE BOOKS!)  While it is true that Cuar&oacute;n did make a few minor changes to the story, it must be understood that movies and books work differently.What works well for a book does not necessarily work well as a movie!  You have to take into account things like a different sense of pacing!  So, small changes to the story are GOOD if they are decided on by an able director who knows the medium he's working with.I think Cuar&oacute;n did a magnificent job directing this movie, in terms of mood, and also the artistic aspects; the first two movies were nothing special, but the cinematography of ""Azkaban"" is stunning.  The composition of the shots and the colors are all extremely well thought out and aesthetically beautiful.I do wish that they hadn't left out the explanation about who exactly the Marauders were--that's pretty important information.

"Who would have ever thought that I would be so entranced by such things as the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and escapes from the Azkaban Prison? To all who are reading this encouraging personal review, I know that you'll enjoy all of the incredible imagery and fantasy that this GREAT movie delivers. In every sense of the word, you're likely to find this to be a true Harry Potter Movie Classic. Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban was enjoyable and captivating- so much that I became so focused on the movie that I lost every sense of current time and place. As an example, the roast that we had in the crock pot was left on it's own for the entire length of the film-plenty long for our roast to become well done instead of medium. Usually, while watching a film, my mind takes awhile to focus and forget the ""chatter"" of everyday life. However, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n captured my every attention as he guided Harry, Ron, and Hermione through their new and challenging challenge. In the film, Gary Oldmans incredible character, Sirius Black , has escaped from the Azkaban prison and is in a bid to get revenge on Harry. This great mystery film is fast-paced and full of many of the wonderful characters you are already familiar with.If you've never seen a Harry Potter film, you're in for a true surprise and a ciematic experience that is second to none. So don't think you have to read all of the books or know everything there is to know. I had a friend who didn't feel he'd enjoy the movie as he was brand new to Harry Potter and his now third-year Hogwarts classmates. I pleaded for him to watch the movie and afterwards he told me it was the best movie that his entire family has every enjoyed as a group. That, in itself, was another testament to the power of magic and wizardy and how its mysterious nature can entertain anyone.Harry and his interesting classmates discover the Flying Hippogriff Buckbeak and the fabulous David Thewlis Character, Professor Lupin, along with Peter Pettigrew and some other amazing participants, including the very scarey and horrifying black robed Dementors! And if you watch closely, you'll also find Julie Christie in an all-important cameo appearance. What more could a Potter fan ask for? And, yes, all of the Hogwarts staff return in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkarban.I hope that this review was helpful, at least in part.

The new director has destroyed the magic.  Hogwarts School is not a muggle inner city school with its sloppiness and lack of respect.  Hogwarts is the best wizard school in the world and should have the airs that go with that title.  I understand that the original castle was sold and a new castle was needed, but did they have to select a castle whose lands were so rocky and hilly?  It looked more like Scotland than England.  There was very little magic and no depth.  This could have been the best movie yet, but the new director blew it royally.  This is the most ""Hollywood"" type movie, which I don't think it needed to be.  Unless you've read the book, the movie won't make sense.  Harry Potter books and movies are meant for children, not adults.

It is the addition of elements not in the book that bothers me most. I wont bother to list all the problems with the movie but I just have to mention, ""Where did the shrunken heads come from?"" The slapstick scenes of steam out the ears and animal noise candies have no business being in the film either.

(I say money because its not all Dollars It is world wide).. back on all the extra stuff.I only hope and wish they release a DVD with all the scenes they left out granted it would be about a 4-5 hour movie but look at LOTR-ROTK they did it why cant POA do it!If they do, I also hope they add it in like they did in other movies and just accept the viewers will understand the mixed cuts. Rather then making it a game at the end of the movie to find these scenes like in HP 1 & 2. They just need to add in all the extra footage strait into the film.I am not buying this movie In hopes they will release an extended version which adds the loss of love the loss of the 50% which made book 3 so good! There is to much for me to tell you on here on what was cut and what was added. All I can say is go read POA ! book 3 and you will understand why everyone feels this way. and you may want to watch the movie first if you havent read book 3 POA because you will have the same dis-taste in your mouth for this production of the movie as those of us who have read all the books and know them chapter by chapter.Most of the people who give this a good review are people who have not sat and read the books 1-5 in order and know them chapter by chapter. So they don't know what they are missing which is a shame because people listen to this and think its ok when if they would just open the book they would understand So much love and so much lost! 50% gone and never to be seen except in the mind !	3.0	So much love and so much lost!

And I haven't even read any of the books - so my dissapointment on the movie (and the somewhat ""pale"" story supposed to be ever so dark) does not lie there.Well, I enjoyed the previous two - Harry Potter like Lord Of The Rings had become almost like a Christmas-tradition over here in Norway - adventure based on a bit ""childish"" imagination, lots of laughs and fun. And great effects, good actors and superb locations.And speaking of locations: Isn't Galtvort looking very different, including the surroundings and Hygrids' little house. Where did that hill come from? Not important, but the place seemed so unfamiliar in the third movie - or is it just me? I just didn't recognize myself there, that's all...Other than that I find the movie a little boring, and though it is a childrens' movie (adult too of course) it could have been a little more scary, and more entertaining that way. The previous two were a lot better, in my opinion - and a lot more ""flowing"", if you get my meaning, when it comes to the story.Lokking forward to the next!"	3.0	No expert...	2005-01-05	8	6	2

The ""screensaver"" is not an animated screensaver of the marauders map as you might think, which actually would have been quite nice if it had been done in the style of the map in the movie.  You will be instructed to download a seperate application which will take over your windows screensaver functionality.  The application is not very intuitive to use and I've since deactivated it.  The ""Marauders Map Screensaver"" itself is nothing more then 3 random images of indistinct parts of the in-movie Marauder's Map with giant ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" logos that splashed everywhere.  Its not very visually appealing as a screensaver and the images in opinion aren't very well done.Just want to make sure that other people are aware of what exactly this bonus content is, and aren't buying the dvd here purely because of this.  There is no marauders map style animation occuring here, and all that will be displayed are static images.

I was looking very foward to seeing this movie. After seeing it, I was very disappointed. Cuaron, the new director, butchered the original story. There was many mistakes and there were too many things left out of the movie.Cuaron changed the entire setting of Hogwarts. The grounds were completely changed. He added a stupid bridge to get into the school and changed the location of the Gryffindor common room.Many scenes from the book were also left out. Cuaron did not put in the back story of the Marauder's Map, how Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were Harry's father and his friends. There were very little scenes of Harry and his friends in class. The movie ended without closure like the first two. It ended, instead of them leaving on the train of the End of the Year Feast, ended with a freeze-frame of Harry flying on his Firebolt. There is much more that was changed or left out, but there isn't enough time to mention it all.On a whole the movie was ok, but for fans of the book the movie did not live up to the story.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1P2Q8YW1U1QBM	"PrairieRose ""Christie"""	The DVD has a much better picture quality than the theaters did.  With the whole movie being dark and a large portion of it cast in little light it was hard to really see things like you can when watching it on the DVD in your own home.  The extras that are on the second disk are rather disappointing to say the least, I had expected much better.  There are better games and interaction on their official website than on the 'extra' DVD.  If you love Harry Potter you have to get it, even if you saw it in theaters...As for the movie it's self I was disappointed.  There are many important plot points that were changed or totally left out of the movie.  I understand you have to cut here and there, but truth be known they could have cut some of the scenery shots a bit and added a little more fact to the story.  They wasted a good 20 minutes throughout the movie with things that were either not even in the book, or with over-doing certain ideas.  The night bus experience was excessive, the only quidditch match that they saw fit to put into the movie was drawn out for 'effect' I assume and really did not need to be as long.  Seconds could have been shed in so many areas that would have made more than enough time for a few important plot points to be left in.  Then during the directors changes he made many errors regarding the Harry Potter world in general.  The movie starts off with Harry using magic at home under the covers with his wand, then they are going to say after he blows up his aunt out of anger that he is scared because he was using magic outside of school???  Then they changed the fact that Harry got his Firebolt during the school year and make it to were he gets it at the very end, not a major problem with that really, it is just that in the time they used to show it at the end they could have put it in the right place and added to the danger of Sirius Black entering the castle.  But I guess since they left out Christmas all together that they felt it was better to do it this way.  In fact they left out a lot of the 'good' moments.  They left out Harry's Birthday were he finally gets wonderful presents from his friends (including the sneek-o-scope) they left out Christmas where again he feels loved and receives the Firebolt (but at least they added that to the end so he could have it for next year I guess) they left out the good feelings he had during his time at the Leaky Cauldron, which instead they made him arrive there the day before school starts which isn't even practical to begin with since he still had to get his books.  Of course they covered that by having the minister of magic provide him with books.  Then they had Lupin use 'immobulus'to freeze the whomping willow when you know from the books that it will not work you have to touch the nott at the base of the tree.  Lupin could have used a stick to touch the knot just like he did in the book and it would not have taken any more time then they already used, also as Harry and Hermione tried to get into the hole at the bottom of the whomping willow crookshanks hit the knott for them where in the movie it showed them being swung in the air and then finally falling into the hole. Again a spot of wasted time that did not follow the book.  Probably worst of all they left out the details of the marauders map.  Seriously it would have only taken a minute or two, to have that conversation with Lupin.All in all the movie on it's own was a great movie.  Perhaps too dark and too realistic for children under 10 years old or so.  I do hope the director from the first two movies comes back because he made it more child like and more magical.  It isn't suppose to be real and the director did such a great job making this film 'real' that it barely was able to stay at a PG rating.  In some countries they had to fight over the rating because it wasn't deemed suitable for children.  Considering each book gets darker and darker they will have to 'tone-down' the authenticity a bit if they still want it to be considered a family movie or a children's movie.  They pushed the envelope in this area during this film, and it was brilliant, however it will not work in the future films if they wish to keep a PG rating and not alienate half their audience.All in all this IS a WONDERFUL movie, just disappointing and did not flow well at all.  If you had not read the book there is a very good chance you would be at a loss, but then again maybe if I had not read the book I would not have been disappointed...	4.0	Possibly better to see at home...	2004-11-18	71	50	21

I think that the third book was my favorite and, personally, this movie seemed to slaughter it.First off, why did the cast the actor who is the definitely of sleasy and villanous as Lupin? I think that was maybe the most horribly cast character in the history of film.Sirius is cast alright, a little fatter than I expected but still better than Lupin.The computer graphics are good, except for that final scene by the lake with sirius, which I won't discuss much further.The scene where Hermoine punches Draco is cool but it kinda came off as a desperate attempt to save a crippled film.Harry feints almost every other scene. I'm not sure where that came from.The were-wolf is a shameful animation, he looks far too gangly and slim to by a horrifying monster.Overall, the plot line is skewered as well and I would never dream of suggesting this movie for harry potter fans.	2.0	Not worthy of it's name	2005-07-12	16	2	14
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1I07M1PUVBRNO	P. Steiding	This is the 3rd in the series of movies and it definately won't be the last.  Originally saw this in the movie theater and I must say the small tv screen doesn't do it justice.  However, it is still a good movie.  It is nice to see how these 3 main young actors have grown since the first movie(physically as well as their acting abilities).The movie is like most movies that are made from novels, it doesn't following the original novel but you still get the jist of what is going on.  If every movie followed the books they were made from letter for letter it would make for some dull and very long movies.This movie is much darker then the first two, but it was done very tastefully and very well!  I believe that most people who view this movie will enjoy it!  But I would highly recommend seeing the first two movies before seeing this one.	5.0	Outstanding cinematography	2004-11-23	4	3	1

In fact, my daughter had requested that I rent it so many times that I decided we should own it. The scenery is stunning, the filming is inventive and draws us into the scenes, and the plot retains the best elements of the really excellent book. Cuaron's direction inspires these great actors to be authentic to the beloved characters of the book. Some of the DVD games are a little squirrelly, but that is no surprise, and there are plenty more features to entice us, including a warm interview with the author, JK Rowling, and the director, Alphonso Cuaron(who also directed Y Tu Mama Tambien). Clearly everyone on the set is enamored of Ms. Rowling. Lots of detailed looks at set and scene construction are included...we were truly impressed with the effort and talent that went into this film. Plus it is funny, has a super interesting plot, and the acting/directing is marvelous. Of all of the (5) HP movies out as of this writing, this one is the one I will be happy to watch repeatedly, simply for its cinematic genius.	5.0	#3 is a great movie as well as a great book!	2008-01-07	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3B1XRW9HIGYQB	P. Woods	I highly enjoyed this movie on my viewing. Since I had never read the book I wouldn't really care if it was nothing like it. I thought this was better than the first movie, but I still find the second movie to still be the best one. This film seemed to rush itself at the start. Harry was basically at the Hogworts school within the first 10 minutes. Also, quite a lot of sets were changed - Bad idea I thought. At least the actors have grown into themselves now. They are basically teenagers and they seem more convident in their roles. Michael Gambon plays Dumbledor now and replaces Richard Harris. Michael was good as him, but he didn't shine as much as Richard did. Also Dumbledor was not in the film that much. This one has the worst ending in the series so far. It isn't really as dark as the other two and not as scary. Not much quiddich in the film too. Also, most of the scenes in the film were not set in the Hogworts building. But, one of the main highlights of the film was when we see the animal Buckbeak (however you spell it) and Harry when he rides him.So, I do think this one is better than the first, since the characters aren't young kids anymore, but I really think Chamber of secrets is the best one so far, as it carries itself at a slow pace. It's not that I didn't like this film, I just thought it could have been longer, some scenes tried to rush and it wasn't as scary. Potter fans should still see it though.	4.0	Better than the 1st, not as good as the 2nd.	2004-07-31	0	0	0

Not many of the fights between Ron and Hermione were in the movie and that is important to future story lines.  Also, there was no introduction of Cedric Diggory who is one of the more important characters in the fourth book.Probably the most redeeming quality is the graphics.  The Bus and the CGA Buckbeak were worth the price of addmission, but I still wonder how they're going to handle the 4th movie when there is even more to it.	3.0	People who love the books may be disappointed	2004-08-29	2	1	1

Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black, the eponymous prisoner whose escape is thought to pose a great threat to Harry Potter; Michael Gambon plays the role of Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' venerable headmaster; Timothy Spall portrays Peter Pettigrew, an old friend of Harry's father, James Potter, from their days at Hogwarts; David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor who harbors a mysterious secret; Pam Ferris plays Harry's overbearing Aunt Marge; and Paul Whitehouse portrays Sir Caddogan, a Knight who becomes the temporary guardian of Gryffindor Tower.For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard ""accidentally"" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig.As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.In my opinion one of the best movies i've ever seen"	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Coolest Movie Ever	2004-06-14	1	0	1

And yes, I am a complete Harry Potter book addict, and I still enjoyed this movie immensely. Some reviewers have complained that it's too ""real"", but that's what I really liked about it. Parts of it that were more realistic just made the magical parts seem even truer and intense. The drama was great and I loved a lot of the cinematography. I realize that there are some logical inconsistencies (the one that bothers me the most is the part where Harry uses magic at the very beginning of the movie, at Privet Drive--what the heck?!?), and that much of the book was left out and that bothers some hardcore HP fans, but I am about as hardcore as they get and I really didn't mind. I thought that despite these inaccuracies the movie was really well done. Though some key plot points were left out, the movie does a fantastic job of getting across the general message and tone of the book, and I think that's definitely more important. Of course you can still read the books to get all the details--that's what they're for. But as far as a movie adaptation of The Prisoner of Azkaban, I really thought this was great.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	APN7XAK3LSNKB	Rain	I was very sad to see how much was changed or left out from the book. JK Rowling got it right, so why change it needlessly ... if it isn't broken don't fix it. Now the next directors will have a hard time getting the character developement of many minor and some major characters back where it should be for the next movies. So many great scenes were left out of this movie or altered for no apparent reason. It is still excellent as a stand alone movie, but not as a part of a series. However, it is in no way as good as the book. I also didn't like the new locations as much.On the bright side, the lead child actors have matured and become really wonderful actors. The casting has to be the single best thing about the movie. The performances of all the actors from the leads to the cameos are great !I hope they don't leave as much out of the 4th movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33O46QK0YM92	"R. Chiu ""girlin617"""	I've read many reviews here on Amazon, and I have to say first of all that most of the people I know who loved this version of the adventures of Harry Potter were those who either never read the book, or those who had read it a long time ago.Many who were impressed by Cauron's version of the movie focus more on his putting a darker feel to the movie and quickening the plot.  But do those people not know the essential elements that were left out of the plot and replaced by silly, not-in-the-book elements?Case #1:  The main point of the BOOK was about Sirius's tie to Harry past; how Harry's father, Lupin, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all best friends and became Prongs, Moony, Padfoot, and Wormtail; how they created the Marauder's Map; WHY they chose to become Animagi; that Sirius was the secret keeper until he passed the right to Pettigrew.  The movie almost entirely skips these important plot points!  Many of these things could have been easily explained during the already available dialogue but were left out.  Instead, we are regaled with the addition of a talking head, a way-too-long scene with Hagrid's chomping book, etc.  Could not one of these scenes have been cut short in favor of Dumbledore, Lupin, or Sirius explaining some important points to Harry (and to us?)Case #2:  The character of Dumbledore, especially in the later books, is meant to be a quietly imposing figure with a touch of humor.  Harris played this part to perfection.  He commanded a quiet respect while at the same time applying a subtle touch of humor to his speech.  The new guy, on the other hand (what is UP with that stupid hat?), seems to talk too fast, talks TOO MUCH, and does stupid things that are supposed to be funny but are not (putting his hand on Ron's cast).  In addition, ALL of the books wrap up with an all-important one-on-one between Dumbledore and Harry, in which Dumbledore explains to Harry the things that he had not understood before, like WHY harry's patronus showed up as a stag, and revealing a little more about his past.  That part was entirely skipped.In addition, I understand that maybe some wanted the movie to have a not-so-childish feel, but this is a CHILDREN'S BOOK!  What was up with cloudy, rainy days during the ENTIRE MOVIE?  Is Hogwarts now supposed to be Gotham City or something?  One could understand this ploy in Book 5, perhaps, when the story is dark and gloomy the entire way, but in Book 3?  In the books, the Prisoner of Azkaban may have been slightly darker than the first two, but in no way was there a sense of fear and forboding the entire story.  All of the feel-good scenes were cut out in favor of drawing out scary images and abstract, artistic renderings of important plot developments that non-readers wouldn't fully understand.I especially hated how Cauron implied all of these budding relationships between Hermione and Ron, even Hermione and Harry!  They are 13, yes, but in the books there is not so much of a hint of developing feelings until Book 4.I felt the character developmnt of the characters was also badly done, or done prematurely.  Harry is not supposed to be an angry, bitter teenager until Book 5.  A true reader of the books would have noticed an immediate difference in the way Harry thought and spoke in Book 5 - he became more resentful, distrustful, and angry as a result of the things he now knew.  In Book 3, he barely knows any of his past - what is there to become as angry as he is in this movie?  Draco Malfoy is another example - some of his exaggerated histrionics of fear are laughable when one compares his character to the one in the book.  Yes, Malfoy does seem a simpering wimp at times, but most of it is calculated to get Harry or Ron or Hermione or Hagrid in trouble - the movie shows none of this.I understand that a movie cannot possibly contain every single plot element in the original book, but this one went too far in creating its own little touches and leaving out some signature J.K. Rowling touches in most of her books.  The pace of the movie was rushed - there was never a moment when you saw them just being students at Hogwarts.  Maybe some feel that this slows the plot, as it did in Parts 1 and 2, but I feel this is essential to portraying the true feel when one reads the books.I was supremely disappointed with this latest movie and can only hope for better for Book 4, the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite in the series so far.	2.0	A Betrayal of The Prisoner of Azkaban	2004-11-29	16	12	4

The first one was great, but it dragged a bit. The second one was pretty sub-par acting (a lot of repetitious face expressions). This one, the third, was a pleasant surprise. The visual effects were magnificent, the setting for different parts of the movie were absolutely outstanding, the story line kept up with the book's (to a point). I left the theater glad because it was surprising how interesting and visually appealing this movie was. Let us remember that no matter how good a movie is, it will never be as good as the book. So the latter should not be a criterion to gainsay or to vituperate this, or any other, film.

This film marks the turning point from being a children's series to a young adult one by becoming a little darker. It was a good transitional film aimed to a little more mature audience. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, director, gave the series a new perspective and tone, which was refreshing, intriguing and amusing. Who does not like a plot in a magical world with dementors (""soulless creatures""), murderers, werewolves, animaguses (wizards that can turn into an animal or magical creature), griffins (magical creatures with the front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle, and the body and hind legs, and tail of a lion), betrayals, and wizards of course? Great movie!!! I recommend watching the movie first, and reading the book after; that way you can still get pleasantly surprised. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SPANISH: Esta pel&iacute;cula cinematogr&aacute;fica es mi favorita en la serie, aunque me encantan todas.

Although Im not an avid reader of the books, I humbly beg the pardon of true fans of Harry. The first movie was excellent, the second kind of weakened, dont know if it was the acting or the choices of editing or not redoing of a scene. But the third, got back to excellence. Sure it was dark, but it didnt lack cheerful moods that the first two films had. I didnt notice until the second time I watched the movie, Harry keeps on waking up on the next cut scene, like there were a lot of those where he passes out and he wakes up in the next scene, perhaps it couldve been done in a different way. And Malfoy and his crew are less evil now, and are becoming just ""jerks"", which is good I think, but it still isnt quite believable yet. The third annoyance that I can think of right now is that when Dumbledore says ""let them sleep and dream..etc. bla bla""...how does that work I ask you? I dont think Dumbledore would say that whole speech to Schnape out of all people, he shouldnt be saying any of that at all for that matter. Just a ""let them dream for now.."" and let the score handle the rest and the audience would get the purpose of that I believe. BUT ALL IN ALL, these minor annoyances didnt debase the movie.

For many of us, this isn't necessarily a problem - 'adaptation' being the key word - but in the case of 'Azkaban', the screenplay writers have sacrificed much atmosphere and coherence at the end of the movie in favour of keeping it to 2 hours 19 minutes.First, the good stuff - Alfonso Cuaron should be awarded a Nobel Prize for Greatness (if such a thing exists!) becuase of the visual motif he has created with this movie. Darker and more menacing, with noir-esque shadows and some genuinely scary moments (the Dementors are magnificent, absolutely perfect renditions of Rowling's original creatures, ditto Buckbeak the Hippogriff), the mood of the film suits the escaped Murderer plotline perfectly well.Excellent, too, are Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Eatson in their respective roles as Harry and Hermione - the kids ar ematuring into actors capable of depth and sensitivity, and now we see for the first time that they weren't just chosen for looks alone. Rupert Grint as Ron, hwoever, is rubber-faced as ever, and is allowed too much 'comedy' time. Michael Gambon makes for a very interesting Dumbledore, and, now that I see him in the role, I have to say he's perhaps better as Dumbledore, retaining more of the jocular wisdom and essential vitality than his predecessor.Other cast nods go to David Thewlis as Prof. Remus Lupin and Dawn French as the Fat Lady. Emma Thompson makes an excellent Professor Trelawney, though we can't help but wish there was more of her.For all this, though, even when I try to forget that the book ever existed and judge the mvie in its own right, there's a rushed, unfinished feel to the end of the picture that just doesn't tally with the excellent beginning. Not enough is made of Hermione's use of the Time-Turner, with a rather wishy-washy attempt at seeing her in multiple places. The Buckbeak trial, too, is very unwisely underdeveloped, and the whole sub-plot with Scabbers and Crookshanks is just silly, when you take into account that, unlike the book, it does not exist to further the Peter Pettigrew plot.While the look of the movie, the new cvast members and the performances by the leads are indeed worth the price of admission, for us Potter Purists, the third Harry Potter Experience as anticlimactic as the disjointed end of the movie.One to rent.	3.0	Best and Worst of the Trilogy so far	2004-06-08	7	6	1

Figueroa Jr. ""Buffyverse Mourner"""	I'm sorry, but i think this is the worst in the series (Movie Wise)Where did the color go? Why would they choose Gary Oldman to play Sirius Black? Why did they never tell you how Moony knew how to use and close the map from prying eyes? Why oh why didnt they give harry the firebolt in the proper place instead of at the end?Why oh why did they make this movie, which as a book is longer than the previous 2, shorter as a movie than the one before.I hate when Directors take liberties that ruin the integrity of the books ideas. I know J.K Rowling said she liked the way he did it, but I honestly think that its a craptastic version of PoA. I dont know why people are afraid of long movies. When they are entertaining, no one really notices. Besides..Braveheart - Long and highly praisedTitanic - Long and highly praisedLord Of The Rings - Long and highly praised AND properly adapted.Harry Potter books 3 & 4 - Ruined in heart and soul.People who only see the movies will be missing so much information. I think the only reason why either of the 2 newer films were even remotely palatable was since I HAD read the books, I had some information that the movie just expected you to know.However, since I know a lot of people who wait for the movie to come out, and havent picked up a book since they graduated... they are lost and generally consider the last 2 films to be just as much rubbish as I do..Take a hint from Peter Jackson.. make the film for the fans.. not the Movie Execs.	1.0	What did you say this movie was???	2006-03-25	6	3	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3E5VBWKO1LWZH	R. Fletcher	"I looked forward with great enthusiasm toward this movie.  I was bitterly disappointed by the director Cuaron's work.  His almost complete disregard toward the first two movies and the look and layout of Hogwarts was terrible.  His stylistic sense, which everyone else says ""totally fit's"" the darker tone of this book, was boorishly overdone.  Chris Columbus would have been much better in this sense, keeping a dark tone while maintaining the spirit of the series.Luckily, Cuaron will not be back to direct any more of  the HP movies.  The worst though has to be how he totally uprooted every physical aspect of Hogwarts.  Nothing was were it was before.  Dark vision I can understand, but things like moving Hagrid's cabin from a flat pasture within sight of the school to a rocky hillside hidden in a small valley serves no purpose other that to put Cuaron's own stamp on the series. I think he had the thought of ""I'll show these people how to make a REAL movie, not fluff like the others.""Also, the person they replaced Dumbledore with was ludicrous.  Bearing no physical resemblance to him is understandable, but Dumbledore is an ancient wizard, wise in many things and keeper of many secrets, the only person Voldemort is afraid of.  The actor who played Dumbledore's character in this movie was allowed to ""dumb"" the character down, and make him into a caricature of a  clueless school principal, AKA Mr Skinner of Homer Simpson fame.  To me that ruined the movie, because it is the interaction of the wise Dumbledore and the impetuous Harry that makes the books work.Anyway, this is just my two cents.  I think it's obvious that this movie wasn't as well made or as faithful to the book, the series, and it's fans as the first two, because it made about 20% less in profits so far, than the second one."	1.0	Absolutely Appalling	2004-12-22	24	17	7

Guest	How on earth anyone could think this was even half as good as the first two movies,let alone the best of the three is beyond me!  Other reviewers have had their say about how different all the sets are, but for me the worst thing about this movie was that the director had this wealth of wonderful and experienced acting talent but apparently felt it  necessary to rely on cheesy special effects! From the opening, long-drawn out sequence with the inflatable aunt to the corny stop action ending by way of the cartoony bus-ride with the silly, shrunken head and later,the skinny werewolf, what was this guy thinking? Thankfully, Harry Potter 4 has a different director, who will, we can only hope, remain true to the books the way Chris Columbus did with the first two. Either way it can only be an improvement on this.  The only reason I gave this two stars is because of the presence of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and the rest of the cast - the movie itself only merits one star!	2.0	What a sad waste of serious acting talent!	2004-11-13	35	9	26

I was also disappointed in how they didn't stay with the same castle grounds as in the first and second movies. It's very obvious. I also thought that lupin didn't look like he was suposed to and sirius looked too old.

I own all the books, I've watched all the movies, and I watch anything that just mentions Harry Potter. I know almost everything there is to know about the series that has been released thus far, and I can say in all honesty, do not under any circumstance read the book and then watch the movie. I've read dozens of fanfictions that butcher the story line and not one of those do it to the extent that this movie does. The details are followed closely, but still don't hold up to the original story line. It just doesn't hold a candle to the book.Now, don't get me wrong. The movie is excellent on it's own. I highly recommend watching it, just not if you've read the book and are incapable of not making comparisons between what's happening on-screen and what happened in the book. The actors are all getting much better as they grow up, the new characters are brilliant, the chemistry is perfect, the characters are portrayed wonderfully, and the new Dumbledore is just as good as the old, (though I'll forever see Dumbledore as Richard Harris. Sorry Sir Micheal.) The movie is a little too fast paced at times. It jumps from one thing to the next so fast at times that the audience is left wondering what just happened.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1FZI1F22GRO4C	Richard Veysey	I probably will never appreciate the Harry Potter movies as much as I do the books.  There is just something, I think, that seperates the two mediums of art to the point where one will always be not quite to the level of the other, and usually it is the movie that dissapoints fans of the book.  While the opening of this new adventure was promising, the story rapidly falls away into a series of scenes which seemed disconnected in some ways, finally coming together again for the excelent conclusion.I have enjoyed watching the movies so far, don't get me wrong, they aren't at all bad, it just seemed more disjointed then the past two entries.  The entire middle section consists mostly of Harry and the gang going from class to class, with maybe a revelation here, or the aquisition of some important artifact there, without a lot of attempts at tying things together.  The first half hour and last half hour were, to me, the only parts of the movie worth watching.Maybe to someone who hasn't read the books, the enchantment of this movie will sweep them away, but to a loyal fan of the Rowling's writing, I can say that I would much rather pull out the book and read for a few hours than pull out the movie and watch for two.	3.0	Good, but not what I had hoped for	2005-07-15	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2H9UO8RYFX5MB	"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich"""	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is easily my favorite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter.In the movie, we see things that were not in the book, but could have been. From a simple and quick scene of the boys in Gryffindor trying candies that make them sound like different animals, to the very vocal shrunken heads that show up on the Knight Bus and in the town of Hogsmeade, and to the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes made to Hogwarts itself, we get little glimpses into this world that we haven't seen before, even if we've read all of the books cover to cover and back again.With that in mind, ""Azkaban"" is remarkably faithful to the book. The core of the story is there, and the characters really come to life. Some of the details are glossed over, and one of our family's favorite minor characters, Sir Cadogan, is given short shrift (take heart, he does show up in the deleted scenes). Nevertheless, the humor of the book and the essential nature of the characters and the story are captured in this film almost perfectly.Running heavily throughout this film is the theme of time. Anyone who's read the book already knows why this is, but from the moment the students get to Hogwarts one can't help but notice the gigantic pendulum swinging back and forth in the entrance hall, or the massive gears of a clock, always moving, in the big window at the front of the school. The change of seasons is also handled in a very clever visual motif. In the last 20 minutes or so of the film time is an even stronger presence, as even the music takes on a steady rhythm, like the ticking of the clock. Time, its passage and its usage, is a very important theme to this story, and the film makes good use of it.In terms of the technical aspects, ""Azkaban"" also makes a standout impression. The visual effects really do the story justice, and are seamless rather than a distraction. Even more than that, the design of the film really captures both the wonders and the horrors of Harry Potter's world. The changes made to the look of Hogwarts work to its benefit, and the design of Trelawney's classroom fits her personality perfectly. The design of the Dementors, on the other hand, is absolutely blood-chilling -- even more frightening than I had imagined them. The acting, particularly that of the kids, has undergone vast improvements, and the addition of talents like Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black certainly didn't hurt. Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise was David Thewlis, who portrayed Professor Lupin perfectly.I've been pretty harshly critical about John Williams' music for the previous two Potter films, as I felt that his work for them was bland and unremarkable, and the series deserved better. Finally, for the third film, we got it. Williams' music for ""Azkaban"" is rich and adds depth to the story. At times he adopts a classical, almost baroque style in the music, while at others he allows it to be more whimsically modern. The music for the last twenty minutes or so, with the aforementioned theme of time worked into it, is one of the best pieces I've heard from Williams in a long time. My hat is off to John Williams for finally giving Harry Potter the music he deserves.Alfonso Cuaron, who takes the directing helm for ""Azkaban,"" has really done something amazing. Throughout the film he walks the fine line between the scary aspects of the story (very scary indeed) and the humorous ones (very funny indeed), so that neither seems out of place, even when they're happening in the same scene. His attention to detail is outstanding, and the result is that we see in ""Azkaban"" many complex scenes with multiple events happening at once. The main characters may be having a discussion, while in the same room we see ghosts chasing one another in the Headless Hunt, or chairs putting themselves on a table, and remarkably it never gets confusing or overwhelming. These things add to the effect I mentioned earlier, of exploring the world of Harry Potter more fully while still telling the story. For the first time in this film one really gets a feeling for the richness and breadth of that world, as we have already seen in the books.The DVD presentation is on a par with the other two. Though there is no puzzle aspect to this one as the first one had (I kind of liked that), there are plenty of extras to be found on the second disc, including five deleted scenes, games, and lots of interviews. The film itself is reproduced gorgeously, and the audio plays crystal-clear.My family and I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter films immensely, but for me, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the first movie in the series that I felt truly lived up to the book, not only because it stayed true to the essentials of the story, but also because it felt free to explore new aspects of the world of Harry Potter.

Kyle	For the most part, the casting is spot on with what I've seen in my head when I've read Rowlings' novels.  I miss Richard Harris, but his replacement is able and I believe will eventually take the role as his own.I particulary enjoy seeing Alan Rickman as Snape.  He's exactly the actor I would have placed in that role.The special effects are entertaining and emphasize the points of the story without becoming too distracting.  That's sometimes hard to do in a sci fi or fantasy film.  Particularly amusing as the Rasta-man shrunken head who is the co-pilot for the night bus.  Bugbeak is beautifully realized with enough fantasy and animal characteristics to make him stand out in my memory as an outstanding creation.I also think the team of kid actors are growing nicely into the part.  What I like about Harry, Ron, and Hermione is how well they work as a team.  They learn from each other and grow as friends, which I think is one of the best points of the story.	5.0	Well done---casting, effects, and acting	2005-01-03	4	3	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A4FX5YCJA630V	"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya"""	"Harry Potter returns for his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the trend in growing darkness and suspense continues as Harry, Ron and Hermione face their most complex and dangerous adventure yet. It seems almost redundant to recap what almost everyone must know, but here goes: Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, said to be the most loyal of all Voldemort's supporters and is now after Harry's life. Now thirteen years old, the hormones and temperament of adolescence are becoming apparant as Harry looses his temper, Hermione punches Malfoy, and Ron begins to notice that Hermione is in fact of the female gender.It is this angle that new director Alfonso Cuaron is mostly interested in, rather than the magical elements of J. K. Rowling's story, but in doing this the director creates and depth and meaning that was missing from Chris Colombus's cut-and-paste versions. Where Colombus's main goal was to take as much of Rowling's books as possible and visually transpose them onto the big screen, Cuaron carefully picks the details and plot elements that are important to the telling of the story and leaves out the rest.The results have both positive and negative consequences to them. The positives are that this Harry Potter feels more like an actual movie, with a beginning, middle and end, rather than a sequence of events directly pasted from the book. By taking only the important portions, &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is the shortest movie so far (ironic since out of the three adapted books, &quot;Prisoner&quot; is the longest), and Cuaron can concentrate more on making Harry's world a beautiful, realistic, three-dimensional world. The detail in this movie is stunning, and takes more than one viewing to appreciate it all: for instance - in the Leaky Cauldron, whilst Mr Weasley is warning Harry about Sirius, you can see in the background a young Indian boy being taught by his father to raise up a coil of rope through flute-playing, while a waiter delicately balances a stack of shaking dishes and a levitating kettle floats around various members of the table. This is but one example of the detail Cuaron invests in the movie: he makes excellent use of the talking portraits hanging on the Hogwarts walls, and the theme of &quot;time&quot; is hinted at throughout the movie with the steady ticking of Hogwart's pendulum.The negatives of this technique though may irritate or confuse some viewers, depending on whether or not they've read the book. It cutting back the movie's length as much as possible, there are several questions and plot points that remain unanswered. Most of the fascinating backstory concerning Harry's father's school days are exorcised, which can lead to many questions concerning how Sirius escaped from prison, why Harry's Patronus charm took the form of a stag, how the Shrieking Shack got its name, and who the manufacturers of the &quot;Marauder's Map&quot; were. Hopefully, the DVD will include deleted scenes that will shed light on these untold tales.Continuity also suffers a little - obviously Dumbledore had to be replaced due to Richard Harris's death, but Michael Gambon fills his shoes well. However, why has Dawn French taken over as a new Fat Lady? And why are Hagrid's hut and the Whomping Willow now on completely different parts of the school grounds?As far as the cast goes, everything is pretty top-notch. Regulars Alan Rickman as the slimy Snape, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid return, the last actually looking like a real giant this time around rather than just a guy in a fat-suit. Emma Thompson follows in the footsteps of her ex-husband Kenneth Branaugh by joining the cast, as Divination teacher Sybil Trelawney, and David Thewlis is wonderful as the kindly but mysterious new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Our three child - oops, *teen* actors are getting more and more comfortable in their roles, and show a lovely, natural chemistry with each other: take for example when Hermione places the Time-Turner around her and Harry's neck and automatically slaps away Harry's hand as he investigates the device.The best performance however goes to a completely CGI creation, and the best one yet to grace the Harry Potter universe: Buckbeak the hippogriff who appears as totally natural and realistic creature. He also creates perhaps the most memorable scene of the movie, when he treats Harry to an impromptu and exhilarating flight across the lake, in direct comparison to the dark and haunting Dementors who have been called forth to capture the escaped Sirius, and hold up surprisingly well so soon after Peter Jackson's Ringwraiths.The whole thing accumulates in an exciting (and quite literal!) race against time, which teams up a solo Harry-and-Hermione team for the first time in a welcome change from her usual hiding-under-the-bathroom-sink or lying-petrified-in-bed scenarios of the previous movies. Despite its faults, this latest Harry Potter is a faithful retelling of the beloved book, with beautiful visual detail and creative interpretation that keeps the franchise going strong - stay tuned for ""The Goblet of Fire!"""	4.0	&quot;Welcome, Welcome, to Another Year at Hogwarts!&quot;	2004-07-31	3	2	1

MCLEAR IV ""RobbieMac"""	This movie, while I admit the actual theatrical performance was good, did not resemble the book as most people have said.  I think that if you make a movie about a book, it should be more like the book.  The director for the movie added too many different aspects that did not fit the Harry Potter storyline.  I loved the books, but the movie needs some definite help.  People have said that the Lord of the Rings movies are too long, but they follow the story which is why they are so loved.  This edition of Harry Potter could have been much more loved by the public if it followed the book a bit more closely.

Chapdelaine ""Beeker"""	From an avid fan of the books and absolutely love the first two movies along with my daughter, the third movie has it good parts as far as characters, keeping some of the same relationships but I don't think I've ever felt more rushed. The movie should have developed scenes more. The setting and darkness stunk. I like the old hogwarts setting and old Hagrids home. I also agree that Dumbledore needs his supreme posture back not a foolish old man type decorum. I try to convince myself that I like it but miss much of the old scenery etc.I sure hope the next movie is double length or made into two movies. I just has to do it justice. I know like most fans, I can't get enough of the first two movies and will probably watch the third almost as much. We watch the first two almost every other weekend and love them. We ask each other trivia questions about them in the car while traveling. We're hooked, but please get back to the original castle and scnenes. I don't like Cuaron's interpretation.

What is missing from the film was not necessary to depict where this story is going.. sure more could have been put into it, fluff, story arcs, cute moments.. but the essense, and the important parts are all there, and this movie shines on it's own merits as both a story and a piece of art.	5.0	Fantastic	2004-08-30	4	2	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1RY4CN0SQKEE1	Robert Meador	Like many, I can't express enough my disappointment that they decided to create the rest of these ultimate editions without the extended versions of the movies.  The Prisoner one is probably not that big a loss-- there was very little to add to an extended version whey they did them for TV.  However Goblet of Fire had quite a bit of good stuff in the extended version they showed on TV, and not doing an extended version for it here is really a loss.  I bought the first two and I bought Prisoner (it's my favorite), but I won't be buying any more.That said, if you're willing to pay $30 for several hours of documentaries, it's not a bad buy.  The Prisoner one featured part 3 of their ongoing, cross-movies feature, this one on the creatures of Harry Potter.  It was pretty interesting and informative, particularly how much animatronics they use versus CGI.  The robot Fawkes is amazing, as is the hippogriff.  Also, it was pretty priceless to see that they actually considered (and did some work toward)having a troll ballet in the Half Blood Prince!  The other documentaries were done at the time of the movie release, and are fine, although nothing spectacularly new.  And there is a visit to the creature shop which was fun.  Otherwise there are a couple of trailers for the movie and a lot of ads for related product coming out. If that's worth the price, then there you go.  Otherwise, save your money.	2.0	Prisoner Ultimate Edition Review-- Spoilers	2010-10-25	10	9	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"There are two reasons that HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the best of all the films in the series. First and foremost, the movie was headed by one of the finest directors working in the world today, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, directed of one of the greatest films of the 21st century, THE CHILDREN OF MEN, as well as the celebrated Mexican film Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N. The first two films frequently suffer from pacing and rhythm problems. Things just frequently feel ""off."" Too many scenes don't work or are too abbreviated. But the worst thing about the first two movies is that they focus on the most lamentable parts of the relevant books and then drag them out. Cuar&oacute;n is, unlike Chris Columbus, a genius. Second, THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the last book in the series that can be moderately summed up in a film. THE GOBLET OF FIRE was the first of the Harry Potter books that could be considered a very long book. So THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN contained most of the highlights of the novel without seriously abbreviating the story.  But I don't want to exaggerate things.  THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN works as a movie less because it summarizes the events of the book than because it gets at the heart of the story and repackages it into a new medium.  Ultimately THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN works not because it is a good adaptation of a movie, but because it is a great movie on its own merits.That really does sum up why this is the best of the Harry Potter movies:  it is the only one of the films that stands on its own.  All of the other of the movies play as if the director/writer has an eye on the movie from which they are derived.  Too their credit, subsequent movies try to follow in the path of AZKABAN and several of them are entertaining.  But what is lacking is the great script of this film and the impeccable talent of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n.One of the most impressive things about the series of films as a whole is the extraordinary array of acting talent.  The main three improved tremendously after the first two movies and they were constantly surrounded by an amazing group of actors.  In this film such excellent actors as Robert Hardy, Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, Julie Christie, and David Thewlis join the cast.  It is amazing that actors of this quality join and already impressive group of performers.  Sadly, another great actor, Michael Gambon, joined the cast under sad circumstances.  After the death of Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the first two movies, Gambon took over as head of Hogwarts.  I loved Harris and I regretted his loss, but Gambon stepped into the role and didn't miss a beat.While I've loved the subsequent Harry Potter movies, none of them have come up to the level of this one.  In fact, in an objective list of the great fantasy movies ever made, this is the one entry from the series that could make such a list.  By any standard, this is a great movie.  Sadly Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n declined offers to direct subsequent films in the series.  Well, kinda sadly.  How can you regret that the movie he made instead of THE GOBLET OF FIRE was THE CHILDREN OF MEN, which is quite possibly the greatest dystopian movie ever made?  As I said, that movie would feature in any discussion of the very greatest movies made in the last decade.  Still, while I love that movie dearly (if you haven't seen it, you should make a point of doing so immediately), I'm sorry that he couldn't have continued with the Harry Potter series.  Heck, I wish he could have made all of them.  Frankly, I am shocked that they were able to get an actor of his stature involved with this series to begin with.  Even though he did not continue with the series, he at least elevated the tone from the first two films.  Thanks to him the rest of the series aspired to be more, even if later directors did not always succeed."	5.0	Easily the finest of all the Harry Potter films	2009-10-30	3	2	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HSRPZYSEVN4X	Robert Norfor	I am a real fan of the books and, up until this one, the movies.  The Good points...the acting from the main three still seem to impress, as well as the darker feel the the whole Potter world.  The main problem with this film is how Cuaron failed to tell a complete story.  When you watch a movie you want to be able to watch it and understand everything thats going on in the film, this is where the movie lacks.  The viewer is required to have read the book in order to understand many of the plot points, many people gloss over this fact due to their love of the boy wizard.  This was made clear to me as i watched the DVD with some non book reading Potter fans and was forced to pause and explain what had happened leading up to (pick a point in the film).  This didn't happen once but approx 10-12 times making it feel like much of the film was only fan service.  While this problem alone in many fans eyes is ok because many of them HAVE read the book, one should not be forced to have the book present in order to understand the film....sorry Potter Fans there is just no way this movie stacks up to the previous films	2.0	Harry Potter and the not so great movie	2005-07-20	5	4	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2WSI8HOWHFDOT	Rocco Dormarunno	"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the darkest and yet the best of first three movies in the series. Death, or the threat of it, hovers over everyone like a Dementor, threatening everyone. Innocent blood is going to be spilled, and then is spilled, and then is not spilled, after all. Oddly, the movie begins with good old fashioned magic fun. Aunt Marge becoming a human blimp and the ensuing bus ride are hilarious and kids love them. It doesn't take long, though, before the lighting dims and things grow dark.After that, I don't know if this is a kid's movie anymore. Some events are truly frightening (to this adult, at least) and tragic--for a while. Also the plot twists at several points, and the whole time travel issue is complex. Don't misunderstand this: the movie remains powerful and delightful. The cast is rock solid and the effects are a marvel--I particularly enjoyed the portrait gallery and the map. Director Alfonso Cuaron's work is incredible. Like ""Moulin Rouge"" the camera never stops moving, dollying in, panning out, zooming in, etc. Unlike ""Moulin Rouge"" however, I didn't experience motion sickness and an epileptic seizure.One last note, the extras on this set are well-worth the price.

As much as I love the twisted story lines and excited events of the Harry Potter books, Chris just didn't cut it. Harry Potter 2 had an unstructured series of events that at the end of the movie left me thinking ""I watched 161 minutes of a movie, but what the hell did it include?"". Such a difficult plot line for children- the target audience- to understand.It must be difficult to create a movie from a book which has so much detail and which had people around the world anticipating the movie release but hey, directing should be left to capable candidates. Also adding to my disappointment, Columbus allowed  the young actors in HP2 much more time on screen, leaving  the engaging and experienced actors (such as Julie Walters, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith) little time to shine in the seconds of meaningless scenes they participated in.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2I1V41C8J4G7R	Rod Uyeda	Perhaps I expected too much, being a 48 year old man who loves the Harry Potter books!  I've read all 5 at least 3 times each and my favorite was book 3, the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Even the author, Ms. Rowling, said it was her best writing experience.  Why then, did they cut so much out of the book?  The Lord of the Rings films were close to three hours long and a smashing success.  They were assured of this film being just as successful, if not more.  The opening scene at the Dursley's was cut to about 10%, which doesn't allow the novice to realize that Harry tried very hard not to lose his temper with Aunt Marge, ony to give in when her comments got especially cruel.  Then, when he first sees Sirius in the park (don't read further unless you know how the film ends...), there is no reason for the dog to growl at him!  And this dog looked terrible compared to the description in the book!  Someone chose to cut out the scene where Harry gets his first Birthday cards ever and the gifts he receives from his friends at the Dursleys.  I thought Lupin and Sirius were marvelously casted, but into the film, they cut more.  They didn't think it important to include Snape making a werewolf serum of sorts for Lupin, nor did they include the conversation between Fudge, McGonogal, and Hagrid, where Harry learns to hate Sirius more because of what those people think happened, including Harry being Sirius' godson.  They chose not to tell you that Lupin (Moony)was one of the writers of the Marauder's Map, along with Siris (Padfoot), Pettigrew(Wormtail), and Harry's dad (Prongs), and how they all learned to turn into animals to help out their friend Lupin.  They leave out the true delivery of the mysterious firebolt halfway through the film that eventually leads to Griffindor winning the Quidditch cup, after Malfoy has been especially bad to Hagrid!  The director did do a very good job with Dementors.  All in all, a very disappointing experience, despite an interesting change in direction.  I will not buy the DVD for this film.  Once was more than enough.	1.0	True Harry Potter Readers Will be Disappointed!	2004-06-19	3	0	3

Rowling.This latest film finds a more grownup Harry being pursued by the evil Sirius Black, who has just performed the unprecedented feat of escaping from a prison for wayward warlocks.  As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents.""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes).  The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination.  One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.Although many people have noted a ""darker"" element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think ""Prisoner"" is less intense than the second - and best - installment, ""Chamber of Secrets.""  Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more ""Potter"" movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"A murderous psychotic on the loose, packs of horrifically vindictive wraiths, omens of a horrible future and yet another new ""Defense against the Dark Arts"" professor - it must be the latest ""Harry Potter"" movie.  Though they've been churning out movies at quick speed (""Goblet of Fire"", the fourth movie, is scheduled for a late 2005 release, about four years after ""Sorceror's Stone""), this movie seems fresher than some stand-alone movies - knowing when to follow the grooves, and when to beat its own path.The flick opens with Harry on his way to Hogwarts amid a crisis in the world of wizardry - rogue wizard Sirius Black - has become the first to escape the dreaded Azkaban prison, the Alcatraz of the magical world.  A reputed psychotic, Black had been consigned to the inescapable Azkaban for his role in the murder of Harry's parents (a fact not told to Harry immediately, even though we've seen it in trailers).  With Black at large, the magical authorities unleash ""Dementors"" to recover him.  Like a pack of grim reapers, the Dementors make little distinction between good and evil, concerning themselves only with those they seek, and those who would stand in their way.  Sure that Black will hunt Harry down at Hogwarts, the Dementors besiege the school.  Though professors try to keep life at the school as normal as could be (considering what we've seen of Quiditch and professors like Snape) a showdown is inevitable.This is my fave of the three movies - it's still not as big enough leap over ""Chamber"" and ""Stone"", it doesn't really make the most of the characters, and the script relies on using dialog rather than nifty plot twists or deductive reasoning to explain the questions it raises, but it's still more original than the other two.  Hermione and Ron get less to do, but they've become a more cohesive group than before.  Michael Gambon, a great actor, takes over for the late Richard Harris, but the script doesn't give him much to do.  Rickman is back as the great Snape, but again, the script conserves the gleeful malice of his character.  There are some signs of brilliance cut short (a great yet abbreviated scene in which students are taught to confront a shape-shifting menace that mirrors their fears) but on the whole, it's satisfying.FOR PARENTS: This movie is darker than the other two.  Yet my 5 and 7 year olders were able to enjoy it from credits to credits.  Oh, and unless you're watching on a screen smaller than 21"", this is not a movie you should be watching in ""full screen""."	4.0	best of three	2005-01-30	4	1	3

""Prisoner"" is the turning point of Ms. Rowling's series.  This book is when the world she created becomes darker and she begins to explore more serious themes. The problem is that it is impossible to cover the immense span of this book in a two-hour film (and this book is shorter than the next 2).  Cuaron does a lovely job on the visual aspects of the film, but, at times, the visual seems to take precedent over the storytelling-that is where the film falls short. We see a nice choir scene, beautiful shots of the changing seasons, the demise of hapless birds at the limbs of the womping willow-all of them visually stunning but they come at the expense of important exposition (such as explanation of the names Mooney, Wormtail...etc). Overall, I do like the film.  There are some good performances (like Rickman, the 2 Emmas, Oldman, and Radcliffe to name a few), but I saw it with someone who hadn't read the books and found myself explaining much of the movie to her.In short- worth seeing, noble effort on the part of the director, but it falls just a bit short."	3.0	I Hate to Say It...	2004-12-31	5	4	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38M3X1AAS7O0N	Ryan Faulk	"Anyone who says this film was not good because it strayed from the book needs to go post their opinion on a Harry Potter website, because that is not an idea that matters when it comes to whether or not a film was good. This movie got MUCH better reviews from critics as it was a movie of much better quality. The previous movies attempted to retell the story in less time than it needed, so things got jumbled and the movie turned into a children's movie. Cuaron is a much more imaginative director, which is needed for a Harry Potter movie.Oh, and read the end of that last sentence - ""a Harry Potter MOVIE.""HP fans need to realize that the movies are not supposed to be carbon copies of the books in live action. It just wouldn't work. It'd be boring and corny... And as much as I liked the first two films because they were telling a great story - they were boring and corny. I've shown all three films to people who have never read the books, and gotten by far the best responses to the Prisoner of Azkaban.So if anyone wants to know if this is a good movie, worth buying... Yes, it definitely is. No, it doesn't follow the story perfectly, but it tells what is needed to make a movie with the same spirit as a wonderful book. Both dark, amusing, and brilliant. This movie is the best of the three, and as a fan of movies, I truly hope Cuaron will come back for another movie down the line. His work is amazing.And anyone who says the books need to be followed as well as the Lord of the Rings movies followed their books obviously hasn't read the books. Great movies, but they didn't follow the book at all.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3VMIEIWHAYK0U	Ryan	Few movie franchises can undergo a change of directors and end up with a sequel as successful as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Star Wars is the first to come to mind, but there are few others. Never-the-less, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, who experianced art-hose fame with 2001's Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, brought a dark and exciting vision to the ever-changing world of Harry Potter.Nearing his thirteenth birthday, Harry finds himself storming his way out of the dreadful home of The Dursleys after mistakingly blowing up his aunt. When he finally makes it back to his home at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he finds out that his life is once again in danger. The notorious murder Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison, a feat that has never before been sucessfully completed, and has only one thing on his mind: finding Harry and his friends. It will take the support of friends old and new for Harry to solve this mystery and discover the true identity of Black and understand his connection to Harry's parents.Newcomers David Thewlis (The Island of Dr. Moreau, Divorcing Jack), provides the role of the kind yet mysterious Professor R.J. Lupin, and Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula,The Fifth Element), bringing his trademark villinay to the role of the dark Sirius Black, both perform excellently and seem to fit perfectly in the world of Harry Potter. While once again the filmakers remain true to the original book by author J.K. Rawling, and yet still add a few suprises of their own.The two-disc widescreen edition features exclusive never-before-seen footage, revealing interviews with the cast and filmakers, as well as a rare interview with J.K. Rawling herself, 3 on-screen games, self-guided tours of Honeydukes and Profesor Lupin's classroom, designing the special effects featurettes, theatrical traliers for all three Harry Potter movies, video game previews, and more!	5.0	Harry Potter Does It Again!	2004-11-25	2	0	2

""Ryan Lattanzio"""	Scratch out Mean Girls--NOW the Most Surprisingly Good Movie of the Year is...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. So far it's one of the best ten film's of the year. No joke.Alfonso Cuaron (did I spell that right?) has masterfully created the best Potter film so far. It's a film for adults and kids that manages to please--it blends rich, superb dark atmosphere with magical and whimsical scenes. The photography is ingenious and the best so far this year (the handheld camera in the beginning is GREAT!)--the scene with the Boggart is particularly good (many of the shots are set in the mirror-it's amazing). This film is amazing to look at, with the Dementors looking better than ever (the scene where one of them freezes a flower is chilling and amazing). Everything about it is amazing--except for some loose seams in the story. A lot of the detail from J.K. Rowling's novel was taken out of it, which I did not appreciate. Several of the scenes felt too fast. Still, it's a breathtaking spectacular feat that is the best of the trilogy and leaves The Lord of the Rings in the dust (feel free to scream at me)!Each of the young stars is funny and each delivers a surprisingly good performance. Don't miss this dark gem...a true masterpiece despite minor neglect of the novel and previous films(i.e. the scenery change). 'Prisoner of Azkaban' leaves the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the dust!

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1GMUYKX6T7GUD	Sally Jones	I don't usually write reviews, however after my 8 year old daughter and I sat thought three quarters of this un-inspidered insult to the first two movies, I just had to say something.Director Chris Columbus rose to the challenge and succeeded in creating visually original and entertaining magical fantasy world that had pace and mixed an essential plot balance of mystique, adventure, surpise, horror, drama and comedic relief. The character performances where strong with notable performances by the late great Richard Harris. Appart from the a little too graphically scary element of the first movie, both movies are all-in-all good family entertainment.Harry Potter III has none of the qualities of the first two movies. The first noticed was this movie was more like Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow', very dark with no sense of fun. Warner Bros have a new Director on III which shows!. The new Director seems to lack basic schooling in movie-making as he shoots lengthy scenes mainly in long-shot, evidently either too lazy or just lacks grounding in how to make a paced movie. This movie as a result is slow bordering boring. There are no endearing qualities. The movie lacks humor, the actors look as though they are not having fun making this one. The screenplay is confusing, I still don't know what the plot is. There are too many horror elements in this movie, Warner Bros should remember this franchise is supposed to entertain elementary school girls too. My 8 year old daughter hid her eyes most of the time and asked me to turn it off after and hour. We certainly won't be filling our Christmas stockings with Potter merchandise this year.Evidently this movie was thown together quickly to fill a gap and line purses before the next three. Unless Director Chris Columbus or even Joe Johnston came on board for the next movie, I for one won't be bothering.. I would like to have my money back on this poor excuse for filmmaking.	1.0	What was Warner Bros thinking?	2004-11-26	19	9	10
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2NCFU3EL7J1TP	"Sally ""starscape"""	As an obsessive Potter fan, I must admit I was entirely disappointed with the third film in the series. The book was fantastic, the best in my opinion, full of mystery, adventure, thrill, and humor. While the movie was all of the above, it left out the one thing that makes Potter Potter: charm. We love Harry in all of the novels, and not to get all Black Eyed Peas on you, but where is the love?Cuaron obviously felt the need to not reiterate the personality of Harry, but the movie began too abruptly without it and only shakily got back on track. While all the young actors have improved tremendously, I question some of the picks for the adult actors. David Thewlis did not match my thoughts of Lupin at all (he too lacked charm) and Michael Gambon replacing Dumbledore was not a top-10 idea for the casting directors. Gary Oldman was an interesting choice for Sirius, but he doesn't strike me as the murderer/Harry's godfather type. (If there could be one.)The plot had quite a few holes in it, and my favorite scene out of all the books yet was cut short: the one inside the Whomping Willow, where we learn much of the history of Sirius and Harry's parents, as well as some of Snape's. The explanation of the Marauder's Map is absent, which angered me, as it is going to play a key role in later movies, and many other scenes were left out. Quidditch became less important, with barely three minutes worth in the entire film. While I agree Columbus' Quidditch scenes were too long, this actually left out the final game, which wins the cup for Gryffindor. It added new scenes, like the interaction between Lupin and Harry on the bridge (where did that even come from?), but that scene seemed almost worthless to me, other than the need for the filmmakers to somewhere add that Lupin knew Harry's parents.Overall, it was not worth the anxious wait I endured. If you're a fan of the books at all, this film will seriously disappoint.	3.0	fan of the books? then this isn't for you	2004-12-18	9	6	3

I'd forgive leaving out the Quidditch Cup if there was other things going on. There were not. How is is possible to make a film of Prisoner of Azkaban and not explain about James Potters' friends as animagi? If you didn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on in the movie.Also, while the film was dark, I didn't get that the sense of fear regarding Sirius Black was a big enough issue. If that aspect was palyed up, then the film would have been that much more intense.If you want to understand the story of Prisoner of Azkaban, read the book. If you want to be left confused by a film with chunks of story left out of it, by all means...see the film.	3.0	Details? What details?	2004-10-25	0	0	0

Chris Colombus did such a fantastic job with them, though, that maybe expecting the same thing from anybody else is setting yourself up for a letdown.  Nonetheless, I think Cuaron could have done a lot better with the material available.I'm sure I'm not the first person to bring this up, but there are the gaping plot holes.  He does nothing to mention the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, which is pretty important.  He doesn't explain why Harry's patronus looks like a stag, which will have some people confused.  They didn't have hardly anything about Quidditch in it, and they don't do much to explain the whole Sirius vs. Peter mixup.Not only that, but the format of the movie itself was not as good as the first two.  The whole thing rushed along so quickly.  In the first two there were ample pauses between sentences, but in this one everyone talks so quickly it doesn't seem real.  The characters as well as the movie itself don't display as much emotion.  When Harry is attacked by dementors while playing Quidditch, for example, we don't hear a strain of dark, foreboding music, nor do we see a terrified look on Harry's face, nor do we get even a glimpse of heart-pounding foreshadowing that the dementors are about to appear.  They're just suddenly there, as if that whole thing was supposed to happen.As I'm sure there are enough die-hard HP fanatics in the world, there will probably be that many people who aren't bothered at all by everything I mentioned.  But I personally think this one had room for improvement.  Prisoner of Azkaban is so far my favorite book in the series, and if ONLY I could have seen Chris Colombus' interpretation of it, I'd be very happy.	3.0	Alfonso Cuaron, you IDIOT	2004-06-27	14	7	7
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AQM2ADBR0TYSO	Sarah Schenkkan	"Under the new direction of Alfonso Cuaron (known for his work on the steamy sensation ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), and peppered with new additions to the all-star cast, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is certainly an entertaining and fufilling addition to the Harry Potter series. Although it does outshine the previous two films in many ways, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" does have its shortcomings.For those who aren't up to speed with the books, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" follows the adventures of Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione throughout their third year at Hogwarts. This time, Sirius Black, the man who betrayed Harry's parents, has escaped from Azkaban prison, and is now in hiding, hunting for Harry. Hagrid, the oafish but lovable gamekeeper, now has a teaching position, and two new professors are introduced; Trelawney (Emma Thompson), the nearsighted and stuttering clairvoyant, and Lupin (David Thewlis) the Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher with an equally dark secret. Harry also begins to learn more about his parents and his past, and uncovers troubling details about the event that altered his life those many years ago.Considering the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a darker story and filled with more mature content than the previous two, I felt that Cuaron was a brilliant choice for a director. In his other films, Cuaron has explored themes of sexuality and angst as teenagers begin to mature; some of which are understated in this Harry Potter film. All of the characters are entering the realm of young adults, and therefore, the script, personalities and direction are needed to be changed to accurate capture it. And judging from the film, Cuaron does a fine job in doing so.As other reviewers have commented, the film starts without any introduction, proceeds to speed through rather important events, and ends just as abruptly as it began. It leaves the audience rather shaken, but the film flows near seamlessly, and even though I remember the book quite clearly, I only had a few problems with the editing of the original story. Some important plotlines are skimmed over but never really established (like the creators and story behind the Maurader's Map), and details which make the story more rich and complete were briefly mentioned or left out completely. I know it is extremely difficult to cut down a story into a film, but I felt if some of the changes were made it would have enriched the film without any major inconveinence. Another thing I noticed that was different in this film was the setting. The locations of the Whomping Willow and Hagrid's Hut have been dramatically changed, and new pieces of scenery have been added that did not exist before. It's slightly bothersome, but easy to ignore as you become swept up in the story.As for acting, the cast is as usual, solid. The young actors have matured since the last film, and it shows. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) does a fine job, but he seems to be missing something in his performance that makes it less than satisfying. Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are delightful and sassy in their roles, and the new additions to the cast (Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, and others) also bring an extra spark to the screen. Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, gives one of the best performances in the film. Although his part a bit minimal, he fits perfectly. Alan Rickman, is as always, fantastic as the deliciously evil Snape.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a much better film than the previous two. It is very different; skims over some important scenes or plots, and changes the presence of some characters. But this movie is more humorous, scary, and entertaining than the others in the Harry Potter series thus far. It features a fine cast, script, and direction and is a mature and entertaining film."	4.0	The Power Of Potter Captured By Cuaron  (4.5 STARS OUT OF 5)	2004-06-04	4	2	2

This movie has everything that a big blockbuster movie has... great acting and phenomenal special effects.  However its attempt to follow the book are very lacking.  There is one scene that was not in the book and I am still wondering why it was added to the movie because it does nothing for the story.

When I first heard that they were cutting a lot of the story I was nervous, but watching it I could almost forgive them for it.  Most of the time I understood why they chose to cut or change things.  The only thing I didn't like was they cut all of the explanation at the end and at the begining.  I had people asking me why they knew that Black was after Harry and I had to say ""They cut it"" and tell them the begining of the book.  I know they cut the explanation at the end because they wanted to have action and to not slow down the pace, but they cut stuff that I thought might be important later in the series.  I presume Rowling previewed the movie and would have told them if they cut anything that would be important, so maybe I'm wrong (they said she did that for the second movie)."	4.0	It Was Good But Lacking	2004-06-06	1	0	1

This is finally true with the movies as well.  Yes, this is a much darker film than the first 2...so is the book.  Yes, Harry, Ron and Hermione act more like real teenagers and less like 1950's television children.  There were choices made in this film that were risky, but in my opinion the risk paid off!

What most people miss is the fact that the style of the books change and mature as the characters grow up (and therefore, so should the films). This is part of the sheer genuis behind Ms. Rowling's work.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A30R1Z1N1RDSG3	Scotland	I'm a huge Harry Potter fan even though I was disappointed in Prizoner of Azkaban. Like many have said, Alfonso Curon should not have directed this movie. He did not make a Harry Potter movie, he made a jumbled Cliff's Notes movie. Not only missing important parts, changing the story to his liking but didn't listen to the fans. Even during filming, fan boards were concerned about the new director's vision. Had the film been more true to the book it would have broken box office records.So I'd like to tell Mr. Mike Newell the director of HP and The Goblet of Fire don't mess with the HP books. These are favorite stories of milions of people, children and adults. I hope you are faithful to the book and I would even hope that like Peter Jackson of The Lord of the Rings. Be proud of your work, stand by the book and make The Goblet of Fire into two movies. There is too much story for just one 2 1/2 to 3 hr movie. Do this right, release part 1 in June and then part 2 in November. The first two Harry Potter movies are very faithful, Prizoner of Azkaban is passable but if Goblet of Fire is not done correctly it may hurt the Harry Potter franchise.If Warner Brothers sticks to the books and doesn't give creative license to people, the Harry Potter franchise will be everlasting and strong as Star Wars, James Bond and The Lord of The Rings.As I hear that Prisoner of Azkaban will be released with additional footage, hopefully you can make it more enjoyable than the theatre version. People may be upset that JK Rowling takes so long in writing the books. But once they're released we know they're worth it because she is such a wonderful storyteller and it's well worth the wait.So please take pride in the filming of the Harry Potter films, stay true to the books and everyone will be happy.So now I have to place my order for the DVD release of Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban.	3.0	Should have been treated better.	2004-07-27	362	202	160

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2I7ZAB04Q0DML	Scott Kolecki	"Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron(Rupert Grint) are back in this third installment of the popular J.K. Rowling novel-turned-film series, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.""  The story, paced much faster than the first two films, seems to gloss over any possible backstory and delves right into Harry and his friends third year at Hogwarts.Things are amiss as always, and this year Harry is in peril of being murdered by Sirius Black, a criminal believed to be one of the henchmen of the ""Wizard who is not to be named (Voldemort)"". Of course, the third year begins with the uncertainty of the safety of the school, and it is up to the trio of talented wizards/witches to unearth the secrets behind the escape of Black along with the truth behind his relationship to Harry.For anyone unfamiliar with the Harry Potter films (does such a person exist?), this movie is a departure for original director Chris Columbus (who still shares a producing credit).  Instead Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is behind the camera.  His style of film-making, though beautiful, is notably different from the veteran skills of Columbus, and may leave fans of the original films disappointed.  The style of storytelling is fast-paced, and leaves the audience with the sense of lack of depth found in the earlier films.  Still the imagery is lush, the darkness scary, and the characters charming.J.K. Rowling's story is abridged in this film.  Many details found in the book have been left out, or so I was informed by several of the avid fans that have shared their personal opinions about the film with me.  For myself, having not read the books, I find the films a great and satisfying introduction into the world of Harry Potter.The performances in this movie are stronger, and it is appearant that our troupe of young heroes are growing up.  Some speculation has circled as to whether or not they would be able to continue forward making these films, but this reviewer certainly hopes so...the entire cast of young actors have been growing up before our eyes with each installment of these films, and it is immensely satisfying to see their familiar faces throughout each film.  Even the obnoxious Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) puts in a great performance and is so much fun to hate.For younger audiences, there are moments in this film that might be a little frightening.  The guards of the prisoners-the Dementors-are mildly terrifying to children (my son kept looking away during the scenes when they appeared), and there are other moments throughout the film where parents might want to watch with a cautious eye to guard younger children who are more sensitive to frightening images (SPOILER AHEAD-the scene with the werewolf at the end is a little disturbing, especially during his transformation).John Williams (STAR WARS, SCHINDLERS LIST) is back to score the soundtrack, as he did in the first two.  The soundtrack contains familiar themes with new scoring that is more subtle than his efforts in the earlier films, but equally effective.As a whole this is a fun film, and a worthy successor to the Harry Potter film empire.  For those looking for a film of the caliber of the first one, this one may disappoint, but it is still a fun film on its own with an engaging story and beautiful special effects.

As this book series goes along, they get quite long. The next two books are even longer.  There is no way the film makers will be able to include all the plot/scenes that are in the books. If they made The Prisoner of Azkaban, ""by the book"", it would have been a 4 hour + plus movie.  The movie studios will not permit that.  Expect the next film, ""The Goblet of Fire"" to be chopped even more than this one.  Movies are seldom as good as the books, so be prepared.If you watch ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and not compare it to the book, it really is a good film.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3J24SJCYYRUIX	scrappy	"I've read some of the other reviews -- some are thrilled by this film, others think it failed badly.  My votes falls on the ""failed badly"" side.  First, the character development is poor.  Granted, and as noted, Warners chose to compress a long book into a watchable movie.  However, the HP books transport readers and there multiple levels of detail in the simplest things (and shows why JK Rowling is a fantastic writer).  Here, a lot of character elements are simply not brought out.  For example, the growing tension between Ron & Hermione does not exist (this will become important in later books, so it creative license CANNOT take it out).  Ron & Hermione are simply non-entities; they fill the scenes, but they have no depth at all.  Unlike some reviewers, I thought the new Dumbledore was very disappointing.  Richard Harris offered a twinkle in his eye and he served as a warm, understanding mentor.  If you've read the books, Dumbledore is irreverant, all powerful, but very protective and understanding mentor to Harry.  I felt that Richard Harris captured the spirit of Dumbledore very well.  Here, the new Dumbledore doesn't offer that sort of character at all.  He is in scenes, but he doesn't seem to convey any emotion.  His glances and gestures do not suggest ""warm, irreverant, powerful""... they suggest nothing beyond that he fills scenes (much like Ron & Hermione).  I must admit, however, that Lupin's relationship to Harry is very strong.  On that mark, the director got it right, and the actors pulled off the scenes well.  I can go on and on...Visually, this film has taken a VERY different approach than the previous films.  For example, the color scheme (muted, dull grey), the ""darkness"" of the film, the wardrobe, Hogwarts locations, etc., have all changed dramatically.  It's not subtle.  There is NO warmth in the film.  In the first 2 films, there are a lot of scenes that convey warmth.  There is NO warmth in this film at all.  The books are going to get darker, colder, and more serious.  This film leaves very little room for further ""coldness"" because it is so dramatically different, both in tone, palette, and style.  I also do not like the fact that the kids do not wear robes, Dumbledore wears simple robes, etc.  Part of being ""transported"" into the world of Harry Potter (the world JK Rowling has created) is their DIFFERENCES, not their similarities.  They wear robes while at school, not Levi's.  This is one little quibble, but if you add up all of the subtle changes, they add up to a very DIFFERENT film than the prior films and, perhaps more importantly, the books.  The film simply does not seem true to JK Rowling's vision.Anyway, for what it is worth, I will likely buy the DVD for my collection because I like the books a lot, but it really does the Harry Potter world, and fans such as myself, a disservice.  I give 3 stars because I am a fan.  If I were not a fan, I would give it 2 stars.Word to Warner Bros: extend each of the future films into two segments like the Lord of the Rings.  Business-wise, this makes sense because you now have a GUARANTEED audience for TWO films, not just one.  It will do service to the books, to JK Rowling's vision, and to the fans."	3.0	Disappointing	2004-10-12	19	10	9

Harry got his firebolt at the very end instead of in the middle, and Harry wasn't caught by Snape as he was returning from hogsemade. On the other hand, the computer graphics were excllent!

What's up with the clock tower?  What's up with the shrunken head?The most dissapointing part of the movie was the Quidditch.  The one Quidditch game that they showed was completely unrealistic.  The players chase the Snitch into the clouds and outside the stadium... just stupid.  The Firebolt was at the end of the movie and had no point.That's my main problem with this movie... it had no point.  The books are excellent and have meaning behind them, but the movies are choppy.Time management is poor.  The film is the right length, but time is wasted in scenes like when Harry flies the hippogriff.Besides the Quidditch, the next worst part was the lack of explanation for Moony (sorry I meant Mooney) Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.  There is no reference at all to how they were friends at school or even who they are.If you have never read the books (even if you have seen the first two movies) this movie will be hard to follow and likely will be too confusing to enjoy.  If you have read the books, like I have, the special effects are good enough that is still an enjoyable movie.  Still, it could have been done so much better."	3.0	Not very good	2004-12-28	6	3	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RDR5G65D9H84	Sebastian Fernandez	When I set out to watch this film, there were two questions in my mind: How am I going to react to the change of director? and Will Michael Gambon be able to replace Richard Harris in the role of Dumbledore? In terms of the director, I noticed that Alfonso Cuaron was able to capture the essence of the direction in which the series is moving. As the story progressed in the novels, we found ourselves reading about darker events and experiencing an ambiance that is filled with danger and dread. In the movie Cuaron starts incorporating elements that suggest this, including the illumination used when shooting the different scenes. As to the second question, Gambon does a good job as Hogwarts' headmaster, but we are going to have to understand that Harris cannot be replaced, and that we settle for the alternative.It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and things start out bad when he leaves the house of his uncle after an argument, in a furious state, and ends up in a very special bus in which he learns about the existence of Sirius Black. Sirius is a dangerous criminal that was jailed in Azkaban for aiding Voldemort - excuse me, You-Know-Who - and who has recently escaped. When Harry arrives at the Weasley's house, he finds out that things are even worse than they look, because Sirius is expected to come after Harry in order to kill him, and in that way eliminate the bigger obstacle in Voldemort's path back to power and glory.As a result of these events, Hogwarts is surrounded by Dementors, which are abominable creatures that act as guards of Azkaban, and whose power resides in the fact that they feed on fear and drive people mad. Some things in the school have not changed though, Hagrid is still there, and he is now teaching one of the classes; Malfoy and his friends are still in the prowl for trouble, and Hermione keeps studying like crazy. There are some new characters though, for example Emma Thompson plays to perfection the role of Professor Sybil Trelawney, the divination instructor, and Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, is the chosen one to play Sirius.The kids playing the roles of Harry and his friends continue to show improvement as the series of movies progresses, delivering more convincing and relaxed performances. The special effects are praiseworthy once again, and I particularly liked the way in which they created Buckbeak, the hippogriff. One of the few aspects that I did not like was the costumes, since the students wore jeans most of the movie, instead of the traditional cloaks in which we are used to seeing them in. Regarding the extras, the DVDs include a myriad of these, from deleted scenes to interviews with the protagonists. I especially liked the fact that the extras include the trailers for all three movies, since it was nice to remember the highlights of the previous ones. In my opinion, Potter fans will not be disappointed with this film, and will certainly be looking forward to the fourth one.	4.0	"""Don't tell me you have never heard of Sirius Black"""	2005-03-23	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUL366LU66P4N	Sergio M. Bustamante (amazonfan@finnerss.com)...	"So many things were out of character, and definitely out of pace with the previous movies. I understand that it strays from the book, the whole movie series has a life of its own and it has been great so far, leaving enough surprises to be found in the books for those who didn't get to read them first.Every character lacked identity for the first time in the series, which points NOT to bad acting, but to LOUSY direction. Dumbledore became the kind of school principal that everyone gets to hate too much instead of the wise old man he used to be, from his appearance, his lines, but most than anything his whole screen attitude. Same goes for professor McGonagall, and even Snape seemed less sinister and more fake than any other time.And off to the main characters, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n once again managed to try and ""Imprint"" His personal style thinking he is larger than Harry Potter and all of the magic that surrounds it, he added that grim quality which turns every single one of his movies into a ""want to make art even if it spoils the movies"", he gave Harry, Hermione, and Ron a ""bitter"" teenager quality that simply didn't fit. It was amazingly overdone and obviously he tried to hard, there are moments of brilliance among so many lousy embittered moments. Hermione lost her charm, Harry lost his cool and the feel he has in the books, and Ron came out as a completely ""gray"" character and Cuar&oacute;n relied way too much in his ""pouty"" kind of performance, which in the previous films Columbus managed to make feel natural.Malfoy became just a cartoon in this movie, no opposition whatsoever and even his annoying nature came off out of character and fake.The story is really good even when Cuar&oacute;n managed to make it a story with very little explanation which made it hard to follow at the start in his attempt to be ""faster"" in building suspense than Columbus did. Columbus is an artist and a magician in this sense, you don't need such hectic scenes to make a movie get off to a good start, Cuaron instead tried to give it a caotic and frantic kind of beginning which fell so very out of place.I'll buy the movie as well, since it's magically saved by the storyline, but it was a huge mistake to select this ""wanna-be artist"" director who is all the time trying to glofify himself at the cost of a very expensive, very awaited and very good movie.All in all it gets a 7 out of 10."	3.0	Please don't let him direct again	2004-11-27	15	8	7
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A8NQZ1E3IX7GM	SeriJoke	This was a  good movie. However, it would be a little difficult to understand for those that don't know much about Harry Potter. Mr. Cuaron did an excellent job in this movie and he really captured the dark feeling of the movie. Many scenes had a scary touch to it, but the best scenes like this where when the dementors come in. You can tell that happiness is being taken out of the scene. Unfortunately for big Harry Potter fans there may be some disappointing parts in this movie. Some rather important scenes are omitted and Quidditch is pretty much ignored. It seems that they have forgotten that it was in this book that Gryffindor finally won the Quidditch Cup. The finals are not in the movie at all, and the fateful Hufflepuff match is just a scene where Harry falls off his broom. The result is also ignored. Also, Harry receives the Firebolt at the end of the movie rather than for Christmas. There were also some other minor things like these missing as well. The movie start off good but it gets to Professor Trewlaney's prediction is just an hour and twenty minutes. From there you have to watch another hour of the last few chapters of the book. The conclusion was far too streched. Overall, it was a good movie, but it may be a bit disappointing for huge fans or people looking to learn more about the Harry Potter world.3.5 stars but Amazon doesn't have halves. :(	3.0	Harry needs some more magic lessons	2005-07-11	2	2	0

While I rejoiced Chris Columbus' departure, I was a bit hesitant if Cuaron could take Harry in the direction he so desperately needed to go. However, choosing Cuaron as director of ""Azkaban"" wasn't necessarily a complete shot in the dark. In 1995, Cuaron directed the very under-appreciated but very enchanting, ""A Little Princess,"" an adaptation of the classic children's story. It's interesting that in nearly ten years, Cuaron had not attached himself to another children's story. That was until 2004's ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the very best Potter film to date (though they are all quite consistently good). Something amazing happens in ""Azkaban."" Yes, the film is ""darker"" and obviously more intelligent than its two previous companions, but most importantly, ""Azkaban"" feels like a valid piece of filmmaking! The bar has been raised with this particular entry. It's hard to imagine what kind of films the current three successors would be had Cuaron not directed ""Azkaban."""	5.0	Best Potter.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1IMNNBC4ME0NB	ShamayimBlue	Finally, a Harry Potter movie that feels like a movie.I didn't think the first two movies were bad, but just stilted in terms of how they were filmed.  This one flows beautifully, with lush cinematography and scenes that uplift you (I'm thinking especially of the scene where Harry flies on the back of the hippogriff, with John Williams' brilliant music in the background).  The acting of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson has also improved from the prior films, and the supporting cast of eccentric adults is just as delicious.Don't expect the movie to be so faithful to the book, though, especially in some of the final action sequences and in the interactions between Harry and his friends.  Hermione especially has little of the vulnerability that she displays in the book; also, in the Time-Turner sequence with Harry, she dominates nearly everything, though in the book it's the two of them running against time in more of a partnership, drawing from each other's strengths.  The movie also introduces two important elements from the book - the Marauders' Map and Harry's patronus - without truly delving into their signficance or explaining it, something it should have done for the sake of plot integrity.Still, I loved it, as a wondrous movie, a great flight of the imagination.	4.0	entertaining and mature	2005-08-12	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11XIRP55VMQY	"""shamile"""	I liked the film, but if you are a die-hard book fan, you may have a few problems with it.  I actually rate it about 3 1/2 stars.Although they kept the basic plot of the book, they cut out all of the explanations and reasoning behind WHY everything is happening to harry.  They also cut out all the whys of who are prongs, moony, wormtail, and padfoot.  Plus alot of other fun little answers.  (Patronus, Prof. Trewlawny, etc)I know they did that in the 1st 2 movies too, but they did it even more this time.That isn't all thought.  They actually change the storyline/ charaters a bit too.  1st, the dementors.  I think they did a wonderful job of making them scary, but in the book they can't fly - movie they can.  Ron & Hermonie Love vs. Hate: Book they are at war almost all of it and only forgive each other at the end.  Movie, they do everything together and the cat/rat thing is a little 1 minute side note.  Plus they add in a lot of relationship questions that don't actually start popping up until book 4/5.  The whole leaky cauldron/Ministry of Magic thing was changed so Harry couldn't leave at all, and Mr. Weasly is the one who explains everything to Harry.  And when he finds out the rest that he found in the book by accidetnt at the 3 broomsticks, he sneaks in with him invisibility cloak to overhear it and leave Ron and Hermione outside.  I did like the addition of showing Hermione popping into class a lot more. And all the little whomping willow scenes added a bit of humor.  THey changed the whole buckbeak gettaway/whomping whillow scenes so they they occured differently, adding more time twists of saving themselves.  Harry still saves himself, but Hermione is with him.  Plus Hermione saves harry a few times and sees herself once.All in all, it kind of dragged.  It didn't seem to have a lot of driving force.  Many of the things I though were Harry's driving reasons to do things in the book were left out of the movie.  This time, his actions reminded me more of his behavior in Book 5 than in book 3, so maybe they were trying to start that a little early to save it from being a great shock later on.  I liked it, but it was different from the 1st 2 movies.  And very different from the book.	4.0	Creative License	2004-06-06	6	1	5

It just look a little faith and oodles of running around.Puritans can crib as much as they want about the director's liberties with the plot's chronology, but the screenplay is very stylish and has the right touch of dramatic involvement with the plot. It's not a CGI fest anymore.The final cut does well to pace itself just enough to overshadow a few grating bits, like Ron's silly antics with Hermiane (a seed being sown for a future romance?), the predictable arrogance of Malfoy, etc.To top it all there's a twist in the finale that involves time warps.

The first time I watched it was dissapointed because I expected it to be like the first two movies.  The second time I watched it I enjoyed it more.  The major events in the movie follow what happens in the book but some minor things are changed.  The whole fight between Ron and Hermione is gone....Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie not at Christmas....the scene at the Whomping Willow is slightly different.....little stuff like that is changed or missing.  The actors that played Peter, Sirius and Remus are not like the people I have envisioned in my mind but they do a great job as far as acting.  Daniel, Emma and Rupert do an excellent job and their acting continues to improve with each movie.Once the die hard Harry Potter fan gets over the intial shock then I am sure they will find it to be an enjoyable movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AU42O5V7VFHT8	Shea W. Peacock	"This film, because it's a fantasy and features children, has been underrated and overlooked by most critics.  What Alfonso Cuaron has achieved here has not, in fact, been recognized by any critic.  His true subject is not Harry Potter, but rather the magic of cinema itself.  The clues are too be found in the literally magical camera moves, such as through windows, and the use of transitions from scene to scene which have not been generally used since silent cinema.  This movie is the most perfect film fantasy yet made, which is an enormous achievement because fantasy movies are the hardest to bring to a state of perfection.  The proof is to ask yourself:  what perfect fantasy movie do I remember watching?  Probably you will answer with ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which is an immortal achievement, but probably the only real competition to Cuaron's Azkaban."	5.0	Underrated Masterpiece	2007-04-06	3	3	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2B7BUH8834Y6M	"Shelley Gammon ""Geek"""	Michael Gambon takes over as Albus Dumbledore, after the death of actor Richard Harris.  The focus of the film is on Harry, his friends and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), not on Dumbledore, so while Harris is surely missed as an actor, the transition is not as distracting as I thought it might be.Harry is back at Hogwarts for another term, studying up on the wizardly arts, with his friends Ron and Hermione. They are made aware of the accused murder, Sirius Black, and his recent escape from Azkaban Prison, but everyone is hush-hush on the danger that Harry is in. He does his own sleuthing to find out that Black is in prison for murdering the Potters and is now enroute to Hogwarts to finish the job by axing Harry.New creatures are presented in this film, including the magnificently rendered Hippogriff (half griffin, half horse). The CGI is flawless in the rendering of werewolves, frogs, bats, dementors and the Hippogriff.The movie is more about the story than the special effects, however, and the viewer is more drawn to the fate of Harry and Sirius Black than being distracted by CGI. The special effects characters have  a life of their own - so they feel like characters, not just window-dressing.My mother is a Harry Potter fan, so I treated my parents to a viewing yesterday. My parents really enjoyed it and by the audible resonses by the children in the audience, it was very well received by everyone who attended.Magic, monsters, a murder mystery and time travel - what else can you ask for?	5.0	great acting, great special effects	2004-06-07	4	3	1

Every thing about the movie was wonderful, Michael Gambon(Dumbledore) did an excellent job, David Thewlis(Lupin) was also excellent, as were the child stars! This time around the movie has taken on a more artsy look, with beautiful sweeping shots of Harry flying Buckbeak, and tranquil walks(and runs) through the gorgeuous woods we never saw in the old ones! The Whomping Willow looked like something out of a Tim Burton film(great job guys), and did I mention the acting was SUPERB(not to mention Gary Oldman(Sirius Black, wonderful)! The Dementors where absolutely haunting, every time they were on screen a chill ran up my spine, the designers did an EXCELLENT job!!! Alfonso Cauron also added much humor, which was welcome with a dark story!I won't tell you the plot(i don't want to spoil it for those who didn't see it), but I must say, I enjoyed every minute of the movie!!

Hoffmann ""Grandma Sheila"""	As a grandmother, and Harry Potter fan, I didn't think this movie met the high standard set by the first two. While the cast is, as ever, excellent, and Gary Oldman was great as always, the alterations made to the book diminished the tale, I thought. And was I the only one to notice the altered geography around the castle? The movie was ok, but would have been better had they filmed the book as it is. Leaving out the second Quiddich match was, I think, a mistake. On the other hand, Buckbeak was wonderful, the werewolf effects were good, and Gary Oldman gibbering to Lupin &quot;Let's kill him now!&quot; was priceless. Emma Thompson was hilarious, too. But nobody can replace the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'm sad to say.Overall, not bad, but not as good as I had hoped.

""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favourite book in the series, mainly because it heavily features many characters I like, and the explanation in the Shrieking Shack is my favourite scene out of all seven books (the Department of Mysteries in ""Order of the Phoenix"" and the Resurrection Stone scene in ""Deathly Hallows"" being runner-ups). However, I have to admit that the movie is not an improvement.I don't think this is a bad movie, by any means. I do enjoy it, and there are some good things, such as the clues to Ron and Hermione possibly ending up together, and the wonderful performances by several new cast members, as well as the returning cast. Emma Watson's performance as Hermione is especially good here. However, there are still problems.There will be spoilers from here on in:The biggest problem is the lack of explanations. There is a complicated explanation in the book, about how Harry's parents were betrayed and how everyone had the wrong person. Also, there is a lot of background provided to explain the amazing ""Marauder's Map"" as to who the Marauders were. In the movie, we only get the barest amount of background, and NO explanation of the Marauders.Overall, this movie isn't bad, but you'd be better off reading the book for this one.

The beggining rushed from harry in bed then to Aunt Marge. Honestly I thought that if I hadn't read the books I probably would have been so utterly lost. I felt the begging was going much to fast for my liking.I was ok as soon as the film started to really get going. I thought that the knight bus scene was somewhat funny. Not side splitting but still funny.I loved the more modern feel of the movie and I loved how the camera was flowing and not as choppy as in the first two movies. Most people will disagree with the modernization and less robe wearing but I think that it gave the movie a much more relaxed feeling. The actors didn't seem so ""robotic"" which also has to do with how much there acting has improved.I noticed that even though Daniel Radcliffe is Harry, Hermione seemed to be more of the star of the film. Personally I think that Emma has most improved in acting. This could also have to do with the more outspoken and vivacious lines hermione was given.I feel that she gave the most believeable performance of the trio. I also loved Ron (Rupert's) quick wit and eagerness to crack a joke which was extremely refreshing in a movie that has such a strong meaning in the series.I also found myself laughing silently at the awkwardness between Ron and Hermione. It was so funny to watch them bicker and then give eachother a shoulder to lean on. One of my faveorite lines is when Hermione says ""Do you want to move closer?"" When hermione and ron are standing in front of the shrieking shack and ron stares at her as if taken aback. Then hermione realizing the nature of what she has said adds ""To the shrieking shack."" The awkwardness was so thick you could have cut it with a knife.This movie is the one that I see as the turning point in the series. The actors are no longer small starry-eyed kids but teenagers that have real experince and a better idea of what they want and how they want to provey there characters.This movie is also where Professor Trelawney makes one of her most important predictions. This is where Voldemort gets the true power to come back and that is why I feel that so much was weighing ont his film. It is the passageway that will take Harry Potter farther away from the kiddie actions and into more mature darker films. I think that this film does the book enough justice. There was a lot of pressure put on Alfonso's shoulders and I think he dealt well."	4.0	What I expected...	2004-08-18	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	In the third installment of the Harry Potter saga, a dangerous murderer has escaped from Azkaban Prison, and Hogwarts has been put on full alert. Harry discovers startling revelations about the man's connection to himself and his parents, and sets out to learn the truth.This installment seems to be viewed as the weakest of the series, and I can't understand why. A large part of it may be that the film omitted several plot points from the novel, stuff fans were hoping to see. At this point, I'm trusting Rowling (who has creative control) knows what will and will not matter in the long run, and that the cuts are unfortunate but justifiable. A good adaptation is not one that is three hours long and squeezes in every detail, but one that stays true to the spirit of the source material. I think Alfonso Cuaron did a great job with that.I also like that he gave the film a distinct visual edge, something the first two films lacked. This was the first film where the trio of child actors looked noticibly older, and the film's darker look fit that. The only part of the film I didn't like was all the talking at the end, where characters start spewing story points and motivations when everything is revealed. It works in novel form, but so much condensed talking doesn't work for the movie screen. Maybe there was a better way to convey that.WB switched packaging styles with this release. Maybe they should've kept everything the same, but whatever. Film presentation is solid, and the extras are again a mix of interviews and production footage with mini-games. I'm starting to really wish these films had commentary tracks. In all though, another fine installment in the Harry Potter franchise.	5.0	Harry Potter matures	2006-08-09	1	1	0

Kopp ""shannow"""	Having read the book, I was able to follow the [mangled] plot perfectly fine.However, I feel terrible for people who missed key points in the story because of missing scenes. Such as: the makers of the Marauder's Map. When Lupin reveals that he does know it is a map, Harry never asks how he knows. Moony, Prongs, Padfoot, and Wormtail are never revealed as Remus, James, Sirius, and Peter. Also, Harry's patronus. Instead of a stag, it's a ball of light. You miss the point that Harry's patronus is in fact the animal form that his father could take on.  I'm again upset at the fact that quidditch was entirely erased from the movie except for that one game. You miss that Gryffindor finally won the cup and Oliver Wood's reaction! (But of course that would have meant putting the Firebolt scene in the CORRECT spot!)Did anyone else also notice the mistake in the FIRST scene of the movie? Harry is not allowed to do magic outside of school, and yet we see the underage wizard performing a spell under the covers to read a book. What gets to me even more is the fact that later in the book, they repeat the fact that he's not allowed to do magic outside of school! Be consistent!And what happened to the characters? Hermione... bushy haired! It was the one thing I loved about the first movie, her hair. Why is everyone wearing Muggle clothes? I miss the Wizards robes that in a school for Witches and Wizards are supposed to be, you know, mandatory. Why are they now wearing Muggle clothing, when in the last two movies (and all the books) they never wore Muggle clothing? I feel betrayed to see anyone at that school in jeans and a rainbow belt (Hermione wore a rainbow belt). And Malfoy... oh, I won't even get into that.But I have to say, even with the omitted scenes, mangled plot, and changed characters, the ending was the absolute worst part of the entire film. No Quidditch Cup, no House Cup, and the scene with the Firebolt was absolutely terrible. Harry doesn't get the Hogsmeade permission form from Sirius in the movie, and Ron doesn't get Pig, his owl, from Sirius either. And does anyone else think that the last image (Harry's motion blurred up close face) is competely... well, ugly?The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I happened to love the dementors and Sirius Black.	2.0	Book Lover	2005-09-05	7	4	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2K0Y55A5KQSU7	Sloopydrew	Chris Columbus handed the directing reigns over to Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n for Prisoner of Azkaban.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's vision of the Potter universe is darker, faster paced and more intense than the world Columbus provided.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has figured out how to successfully bring a Harry Potter book to the silver screen without losing the magic that made the series an international phenomenon.  Rather than creating a Cliff Notes version of the novel, Cuar&oacute;n provides a distinctly cinematic take on the series.  The only time his rapid-fire approach to directing takes away from the book is in his all too brief look at Hogsmeade.  In the novel, this is a magical place with the gooiest, tastiest candies available to the young witches and wizards (who have obviously never heard of the muggles' Atkins' Diet).  The movie never properly shows how much it hurts Harry not to be able to go with his friends to the mystical village of Hogsmeade.Cuar&oacute;n makes up for this deficiency with his excellent realization of the werewolf, which goes above and beyond the beast described in the book.  He also makes the Dementors as scary as they ever were in the books.  The scene of Harry's flight into the sky during a Quidditch match, only to meet up with a wicked Dementor, is chilling.  The triple-decker bus is as fast and frantic as you imagined it would be when reading the book.  And not many directors could pull off the complex scenes involving Hermione's Time-Turner.The directing isn't the only thing that's improved.  The effects in this film prove that three times really is a charm!  I wondered if they'd ever be able to get Buckbeak the Hippogriff or the Dementors right.  Surprisingly, they exceeded my expectations.  The Dementors give Lord of the Rings' Ring Wraiths a run for their money in the creepy department.  The darkly cloaked figures casually floating around Hogwarts, supposedly guarding the premises from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) -- the only prisoner to ever escape the confines of Azkaban -- is as frightening imagery as you're bound to see in a PG rated film.The adolescent actors have improved along with the special effects.  You can feel the hurt and betrayal in Daniel Radcliffe's Harry. Emma Watson, still the best of the three actors, does an excellent job transforming from the bookish type to a girl able to hold her own against the bullying Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Rupert Grint, while not reinventing the wheel (or even Ron, for that matter) is doing better than ever at portraying Ron as the ultimate Hogwarts' slacker.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban closes on just the right note.  Cuar&oacute;n leaves the audience wanting more, not wanting to leave the theater. I pray future directors in the series have the talent and nerve to make Harry Potter their own, in the same way Cuar&oacute;n dared to reinvent the series with The Prisoner of Azkaban.	4.0	A distinctly cinematic take on the series ...	2004-09-01	3	0	3
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A336MW3XGB0V9Z	"S.L. Radcliffe ""Stephanie"""	Coming from a 16-year-old HP book fan, I have to say the movie really added up to my expectations.I waited months to see the first midnight showing and I, as well as everyone else in the theatre, could not contain my excitement. This movie was most definately the best so far and not just because the lead actor is pretty attractive.The special effects in this production were worth the $9 alone. Emma Watson, Dan Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint have really grown into their acting talents very well. All of the actors in this movie did such a great job and the different camera angles and settings were well thought-out and tied in with the amazing script.Children and adults will both agree this movie is a great one to share with the family, whether they enjoy the book or not. Although many people say the movie cut out too much compared to the book, think about putting a 435 page book into a 2 and a half hour movie. All movies leave out parts of the books but this ties in all the important ideas and plots very well.Even from an amature movie critic, I think this movie was one of the best ever. It has to be, otherwise people wouldn't rave about it so much, now would they? ;-)	5.0	Best in the Series	2004-07-30	1	1	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A305RVL6YTJM3L	smalltown juggalo	the reason why they made the movies was because the books were so popular. the thing about the books is when you read them you remember everything. that is what I love about the books. this movie, while it was good, you could clearly tell that it was made by a different director. they left out a lot of the things that I loved about this book. the relationship of harry and sirius was cut short in the movie. in the book it was more believable. in the movie he asks him if he would like to come live with him but this is shortly after harry thought the guy killed his parents. it made it a little unbelievable to me. the second film was better than the first and exceeded my expectations so i expected big things from this and in the end was let down. no offense to the director, he makes good films, but he shouldn't have been given this film to direct, he almost ruined a franchise. hopefully chris columbus will come back and do the fourth. he left to spend more time with his family and that is understandable but I like his vision and would like him to see it through.	3.0	I liked it but it could have been better	2004-11-26	7	5	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AJE23BLND4KMY	smartx	From the very beginning to end, the movie is filled with excitement, chills, and mystery. But most important of all, it doesn't lose focus on the main storyline - that is the search of and the fear for Syrius Black. It's totally unlike the first two that often lost focus showing too much of &quot;life-at-Hogwarts&quot;. The 3rd. one is really a &quot;movie&quot; (in fact it's also complemented with a touch of delicacy and art ie. the Whomping Willow scenes, and of course its overall beautiful picture/cinematography). I agree if someone says that the first two were more like &quot;books&quot; and understandably if the fans wanted it more like the first two.	4.0	Excellent....	2004-08-01	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1AKKYXG0Y0ULL	S. Michael	Well the movie had both good and bad points, the visuals were stunning, the trio of main characters were more mature (as they should be by this time.) The story was treated in a darker manner again, as it should be.  The books progress in that direction.The bad part to me was what some are claiming was so good.  There are, in my opinion, too many departures from the story in the book.  I understand the need to modify certain parts that would be difficult or clumsy to portray on film, but the director seems to want to show us his, not the authors vision of the book	3.0	Pretty good...but	2004-08-22	8	5	3

This movie, as has been said, varies way too much from the main plot of the book.  The art directing and cinematography are fantastic.  I think it is a better and more real world version of the magic world, even if it is different from Chris Columbus.  The plot of the story in the movie is beyond weak. Dialog is pathetic. Way too many of the important parts of the story line have been left out.  The flow of the movie does not make sense.  The movie should not only stand on its own, but should also relate to the personal growth of Harry and the gang. It doesn't, and that is why it is not a good ""Harry Potter"" movie.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A223UJ9MON2Y8N	"Snape42 ""Toad, esq."""	"I confess I too was horribly disappointed to learn that the latest installations of the ""Ultimate Editions"" of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire would not be released in extended cuts.  I had placed both of these films on my ""wishlist"" for Christmas.  I immediately contacted my family members and told them to scratch them off of that list.  I would not have people I care about wasting nearly $80 of their hard earned money on movies that I already own.  It is sad too, those movies had great additional scenes - one of my favorites being Snape busting students at the Yule Ball (in the Goblet of Fire) for snogging outside.  I couldn't wait to see that added back into the movie.I have read the statements where Warner's claimed that the directors from films 3 and 4 declined to add these scenes back in.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  The extended versions of these movies exist on ABC Family, which means that someone somewhere HAS re-edited the films to include these scenes.  Why didn't Warner's use those versions for an extended version disc?  The ABC Fam versions are obviously ""legal"" since they show them regularly.Personally, I am no great fan of all the ""extras"".  The only thing that tempts me into buying a movie i already own is if the film is going to be extended, and they interview the actors that I like to discuss some aspect of their character.  In the case with these films, neither occurred.  They didn't have extended versions of the movie nor interviews with Alan Rickman (or many of the other older actors).  One thing needs to be noted by the studio here...not all Harry Potter fans are children.  Some of us are adults who enjoy watching the trained thespians in the films that we have enjoyed for decades.  Sometimes I feel like we are slighted when it comes to these boxed sets.  ALL the materials seem to be geared toward children.  I don't mind some interviews with the younger actors, but they need to also accommodate the older viewers.  As with the UK versions of the books, they should have Child and Adult versions of the films.  ""Adult"" meaning that the extras would contain information that viewers beyond their teenage years would enjoy."	1.0	A complaint + a few suggestions....	2011-01-04	4	4	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13DTU03MT0R5P	"SomethingRealCool ""SomethingRealCool"""	"The film was visually stunning, but very different then the first two films. Is that a bad thing? I guess it all depends on how you personally feel about the look of the first two. Hogwarts looks and feel completely different, but for me it fit in closer to my own personal imagination of Hogwarts. It was real, not a movie set.The acting was 100 times better from all the kids, and even the new comers were all really great. After I read OOTP, I was wondering if Daniel Radcliffe could pull off Harry in OOTP. After seeing his performance in POA he really reassured me. I think he will be perfect!! Emma was great and so was Rupert (Rupert didn't seem as much of a wussy in this film, and he acted more like book Ron in my opinion.) I never doubted Gary Oldman, David Thewlis or Emma Thompson, so it was a relief to see that I had no reason to.As for the telling of the story and plot, My first viewing of the film I was not sure how to feel about it. I needed time for it to sink in, and I needed to see it again. Like many people, POA is my favorite of the Potter books, so I wanted it to be perfect, but I can also understand that the film version will most likely never live up to the book, unless of course, I or a fan directed it, and it was 5 hours long!!!My first viewing the film felt very fast and almost choppy. Almost like it was more of the editors fault then Alfonso's. Things were missing. Things that seem far too important to be left out of the story. Like many others have already said, the explanation of the map, the marauders, animagus, and many other things could have been explained.But after my second viewing it felt different. This time It was fun, exciting, and I loved that the books humor was finally brought to the screen; it made everything flow so much better. As for the things that were missing...... well,  I went my second time to see the film with a non book reader, and she got it and loved it. Of course she had no idea about the things that were never told in the film, so I filled her in and it really didn't make that much of a difference in her enjoyment of the film. I, personally know the whole story, so it's not like I missed out really!! Plus, finally my friend who has seen all 3 of the Potter films,  has given in and is going to read the books!It's the small details in the film that were some of the best things about it. Lupin's music during class, the ice when the Dementors arrive, the boy's eating candy in the dormitory, Ron's dream, and many other things. Some of the changes didn't bother me, where some of them did. The new Womping Willow didn't bother me, I actually liked it better then the one in COS, but the ending with the firebolt did. The new Fat Lady didn't bother me, but where she was placed, and the entrance to the Gryffindor Tower did, but I got over these changes.This movie, unlike the first two felt real and ""lived in"". I felt that all of the characters had a past together now, and that they really do all know each other and live together in Hogwarts. For example; the scene with Harry and the boys in their dormitory eating candy. It was not in the book, but it felt like it could have been. The fact that we are seeing Harry being laid back, laugh with his buddies, just as he does in the book, even though this scene isn't in the book, made Harry and his universe feel so much more real to me. This happened a lot during POA: hearing Harry and Seamus bad-mouth the fat lady as they enter their dormitories, Harry giving Ron a high five after Ron makes a success of conquering the boggart, all of the great things happening in the background. - all are things that makes this version of Rowling's universe seem so much more physical and real, instead of ... aesthetic."	5.0	At first I was unsure, but now I love it!	2004-06-10	7	7	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3VO445C7FUJ7I	Sonomi	I love the Harry Potter series, books and movie alike - but this third installment of the Harry Potter movie series was very confusing and poorly made - especially if you haven't read the book.Potter fans should not be angry at this comment, especially as my feelings are that the third BOOK of the series to had the most depth of all six books written thus far. It is simply a shame that the most poignant moments of the book, much of which concerns Harry not only discovering of his own strengths, but of his father's past in a very charming way, are completely left out of the movie.Instead there is a greater emphasis on special effects - good and bad. The hippogryph was beautifully done, for example, but they could have taken even 2 minutes worth of scenes of showing off special effects to give some explanation to viewers that Harry's patronus was something exceptionally significant to the novel. The viewer is unfortunately given no explanation and simply sits there wondering why the heck there is a bright stag standing there in one of the most dramatic moments of the movie.Also the explanation of Peter Pettigrew's evil deeds is babbled out so quickly between Sirius and Lupin, it took me three viewings (yes, on DVD) just to figure out what the heck they said.All in all, I suppose if you really need a visual compliment to the book, its not a complete waste of time, but don't expect to be moved by the movie as you may be by the book. I blame the director and editors. The actors, young, and old are splendid, nothing bad there.	3.0	The best book turned into the worst movie.. BUT worth seeing..	2005-08-04	8	5	3

I have read them all at least three times and listened to Jim Dale's audio version.  I own all the DVD's.  I do think this is the best movie yet, but that is what I thought of each book when it came out.  All three movies are good, but this one is the darkest yet.  This one also had great touches:  The Shrunken Head, the dorm room candy eating scene, very scary dementors, and muggle-like attributes of the school in general.  The shrunken head is a great character and not all annoying like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars.  The candy eating scene makes Harry and the other kids seem just like that, KIDS.  The scary dementors are really very scary.  The fact that the kids wear muggle clothes when out of class makes Hogwarts even more interesting.  The quiditch uniforms make it seem like Harry is playing football but on a broom.  I like the touches added here.As far as the DVD is concerned, there were some good extras.  The interviews were actually entertaining, not at all ""Entertainment Tonight"" type of garbage.  Of course I wish there were more interviews and more behind the scenes stuff, but it was enough to keep my interest.  I didn't like the DVD games, but that is because I never can play video games.Overall, this DVD gives you a great movie and some worthwhile extras.

As a loyal fan, I've seen documentaries, read bios, looked at stills, seen the films repeatedly, read the books, read reviews, and so when the Ultimate Editions were announced I thought I would probably get them but what new information could it provide to me?  I was plesantly surprised with Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets as they added deleted scenes to the film that allowed for viewing of an extended versions, which in some cases made the film flow better like the book.  However, something went amiss in the release of Azkaban as there is no extended version on this Ultimate Edition.  Very disappointed.  I will still acquire these collections but I will not pay for them.  At least I have something for gift lists when I'm asked what I may like to have given to me.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2XCBF3DTCWXQ3	"S. Rems ""lonelyzephyr83"""	"I am pleased to say that I loved the new Harry Potter movie, even though I have been hearing the worst from some people.  For anyone who has not seen this movie yet, I recommend it, but that you do so with an open mind.  Film adaptations from a novel are not about literal regurgitations of what is already on paper.  They're about the director's vision melding with the author.  As JK Rowling WORKS with the film (and has spoken outward that she loved Cuaron as the new director) she spoke for what changes she liked and against what she did not.  I for one, would have hated to see yet another literal adaptation in the hands of Chris Columbus (whom I loved dearly in the first two, but agreed with his statement that he was not right for this movie) as the feel of the first two books are totally different from this one.  The next one, ""Goblet of Fire"", should be totally different from ""Azkaban"" as well, partially owing to the fact that there will be a new director.Cuaron is superb as director in this film, as he has an artistic vision of the story that Columbus did not have, he being more of a storyteller.  The film is grittier,  the colors are less saturated, scenes were added when needed (the scene in which the boys are all eating the candies in the dorm shows them acting as teenage boys do, an important thing to point out before all hell breaks lose for Harry once more) and things were moved around or cut out to allow for an easier flow in the film; while JKR's wonderful novel contains many storylines at once, this film tackles a few but not all of these, to allow for less confusion and jumping around due to needs in continuity and time constraints.The acting has once again gotten better, Daniel, Rupert and Emma have proven that they will continue to grow in their craft and will hopefully stick around.  Daniel seems to have a sixth sense about Harry, and plays him extremely well.  Emma seems to have shown the most growth and promise of the young, inexperienced actors, and will hopefully be a bright star in the future.  Rupert shows a different side of himself on screen than off, where he is shy and seems to prefer not to speak, but shines onscreen, creating most of the comedy in the film, if not all.  Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfy, also appears different in this film than the last two, seeming to have a stronger hold on his character now, with more complexity added in, than in the first two films.  I look forward to seeing them continue to grow.  Michael Gambon, who filled the shoes of the late, great Richard Harris, does well in this difficult task.  He seems to display more of the eccentric nature of Dumbledore than Harris did, with less of the quiet kindness that Harris mastered.  I believe this to be an important thing, that Gambon did not simply emulate Harris in his portrayal of Dumbledore, but took on his own, and has done a wonderful job doing so.  David Thewlis was a grand choice for Professor Remus Lupin.  He does a wonderful job coming in as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the first that the school has seen that gained any popularity, and his performance shows the reasons behind it.  Thewlis plays Lupin as a kindly if not tired wizard, with a highly scarred face, but kind smile.  While he eventually shows himself to be very powerful, he plays it down throughout the whole movie until it is needed to be used making one of the films great shocks even more surprising.Gary Oldman was another wonderful choice for this movie, playing the part of Sirius Black magnificently.  A part of yet another of the movie's great shocks, his perfomance allows for this surprise to be all the more shocking.  He plays the 12-year-prisoner well, portraying the strain the imprisonment was bound to cause him perfectly.  However, when freedom is at his fingertips, he is quick to become the ""marauding"" Sirius that all Potter fans have grown to love.All in all, I loved the film, have seen it twice, and will buy it when it comes out.  Anyone who knows anything about film will know that this film is a work of art, not simply a churnned out product to appease the masses.  Those simply looking for a visual representation of what they saw in their minds while reading the magnificent work of JK Rowling will undoubtedly be disappointed, but should be reminded that both film and novel are their own works of art, and should be treated separately.I for one, am now highly looking forward now to the release of Goblet of Fire as I am now excited to see what the new director, Mike Newell, will bring to this enchanted series."	5.0	Wonderful, but Highly Missunderstood	2004-06-09	2	2	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1WYPF1DKC1G9S	Stanislav Sokolov	I kept putting off purchasing Years 3 & 4 of the Ultimate edition after having read multiple reviews, reporting that WB did not include the extended versions of the films, which existed in Years 1 & 2. I too still have the WB's commercial, where they promise that each Ultimate edition set will contain extended versions. I have therefore felt cheated.I have since decided to buy these two sets, but only for the following reasons: I've been patiently waiting for the Ultimate editions ever since Year 1 was filmed way back then (2001). I never bought neither the DVDs, HD-DVDs nor BluRays of the films so as to avoid double- or even tripple-paying once the maxed out box sets become available (as many people knew they would). Thus these Ultimate editions will be my first purchase of every HP film. I'd also like to keep the continuity in the boxes, collectables and the excellent extra materials from Years 1 & 2 box-stes. Finally, if the WB later audaciously decides to produce the extended versions of Years 3 & 4 and put them on sale without a swap-in option for the existing Ultimate edition box-set owners, I would feel forced to download them from some file-sharing service as I am already paying for them with this Ultimate box-set, as advertised, but not delivered by WB.My only hope is that WB will not botch the final three Years and that Years 3 & 4 will be the only dark spots in they reputation.	3.0	Great extra content, but only with the cinematic version of the movie	2011-02-28	1	1	0

This is the first Harry Potter movie since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but he is back. And over the summer, in addition to openning in regular movie theatres, it also opened up in IMAX theatres, and I caught on the IMAX theatre at Navy Pier in Chicago. As the movie opens, Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris) has come to the home of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). And when and Marge can't get along, he runs away, and takes a bus ride to Leaky Cauldron Inn, and the Minister of Magic (Robert Hardy) gaves him a warning that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from jail and his looking from him. And then Harry Potter is reunited with his 2 friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Herimone Granger (Emma Watson) who also is staying at the inn. And back at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledoor (Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris) annouces that until Sirius Black is captured, that Hogwarts will be playing host to ghastly soul-sucking wraiths called Dementors. And once again this year, there is a new denfese the dark arts teacher named Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). If you love the Harry Potter books, or movies, then you might want to watch this, and if you don't like Harry Potter, or can be scared easlity by stuff like this, then don't bother watching this movie.	4.0	Harry Potter is back after a 2 year absence	2004-10-28	5	0	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANSDL6M2XUU1Y	Steve Bierly	Today I saw 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I liked the new director's more fluid, visceral style. The soundtrack was great, and I'll be singing 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' for years LOL.But as far as the plot went, it really fell short. This book, more than any of Rawling's other books, is first and foremost a perfectly crafted mystery story. In order to have a good mystery, all the clues need to be in place. Several lines of dialogue and several key scenes that were vital to the plot were removed from the film version. My sister (who has read the book) had to explain the plot to my mom (who has not read the book).For instance, although a big deal is made out of the Marauder's map, the film never tells us who Padfoot, Prongs etc. are! The significance of Harry's patronus' form is therefore missing from the film.Also, in all storytelling, if a deux ex machina is to be used, in this case Hermione's time turner, it's existance must be firmly established long before it intervenes to save the day. The book did a far better job of this, but the film only briefly mentioned Hermione's strange behavior. In the novel, she becomes ragged and run down. She is constantly missing. In fact, Hermione appears less in Azkaban than in any of the other books. In the movie, they gave her less problems, and more screentime. It was an o.k. decision, I guess, but not at all like the book.The story felt rushed and incomplete, with gaping plot holes left unfilled. The best thing about this movie is that it made me appreciate the origional, masterful book more.And I want Chris Columbus back.	3.0	It's O.K., but falls short of greatness	2004-06-14	7	5	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11UVTJV33RD5O	Steven Butterfield	"First things first, and it must be said: do not, do not, DO NOT go in expecting a word-by-word lifting of the book, verbatim, from page to screen. Director Alfonso Cuaron was not afraid to slice and dice parts from the book in order to deliver this film. And you know what? Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is better for it.One of the delights, for me, in going back and re-reading the Harry Potter series now that the movies have come out is that the action in the book plays itself out in my head with the actors, sets and scenes from the movies. And what you come to realize in the course of this memory-movie is that some things simply cannot be as effective on celluloid as they are in print. Entire pages of the book are worthless to a film director, for various reasons. Cuaron understands this. J.K. Rowling herself has admitted this.Chris Columbus, who directed the first two, tried to simply transpose every scene from the book. And instead of good MOVIES, all we ended up with were cartoonish, choppy monstrosities consisting only of scene after scene interposed pretty randomly with each other. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie so much as a series of short sketches and vignettes about life at Hogwarts.What made Azkaban so phenomenal, in my mind, was Cuaron's deft directing as a result of his willingness to sacrifice some book in the name of a great movie. J.K. Rowling wrote novels, not screenplays, and to try and make apple pie from oranges would just be (as ""Sorceror's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" proved) clunky and disastrous.Now, as for the film itself, this is a fine piece of CINEMA from a gifted and exceptional director. He works with these kids in a way that Chris Columbus never did. He draws nuanced, subtle performances from all of them, making me believe these kids might have a future as actors AFTER this series. The range of emotion that Daniel Radcliffe explores in his role as Harry in this film is raw and powerful. For the first time in the cinematic version, we can believe that he truly feels pain over the loss of his parents, pain at the relatively lonely world he moves in. We can see it in his bond with Professor Lupin (played by a delightful Daniel Thewlis), a fatherly male role model who knew Harry's parents. The scene where Lupin and Harry are strolling on a bridge talking, and Thewlis starts to reminisce about Harry's parents, is astonishing. Look at the way Radcliffe plays the scene - the taut, tight storm of emotions flickering across his face. He cannot bear the pain of hearing about his parents, people he will never know...and yet he cannot stop his professor, because this is the only way he ever WILL know them. It is breathtaking acting on Radcliffe's part, and I applaud him for it.The film looks simply gorgeous. I thought the first two movies were trying to be live-action cartoons: too bright, too garish, too Technicolor and candy-coated. In this film, things are much more realistic: it isn't afraid to go dark, and it's the better for it. The camera in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron is practically an actor in its own right. Shots pan and swoop, drawing back to take in a scene while the production design leaves a single element to glowby virtue of its solitude: the scene where the train stops and the camera pulls in on Ron's hand, the only light in an otherwise dark frame, is a fine example.The use of time in this film as a thematic element is clever and marginally subtle. Shots pan and dive through the workings of a giant clock, a massive pendulum swings dangerously and incessantly in the background. It's Cuaron's way of showing not only that these kids are rapidly becoming adults, but also overshadows the element of death that this movie deals much more closely with than the first two did.All in all, I could not be more pleased with this film. I can't understand the critics who say, leave the books be! If they are that much a fan of the novels (as I am), but can't understand that good books do not good movies make, then they shouldn't bother watching the films anyway. My hat's off to Cuaron and Co.: may he come back and direct another Potter movie in the future!"	5.0	Practically a perfect Harry Potter movie	2004-10-14	27	20	7

The books are getting children to read, and that is good. I asked to be forgiven for this fault. So now for my review of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.""It is an exciting and beautifully-crafted fantasy adventure that features great special effects, fine storytelling, and fascinating characters brought to life by an exceptional cast.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A17M1HL6U2GS7M	Storylover	"I have been reading with amazement some of the half baked reviews of this movie, and I can't help but wonder who actually watched it?  As has been often mentioned, this is the most deftly plotted of the novels--no fat, all momentous story.  Cuaron faced a difficult challenge in bringing it to life...but he faced up to it and did a brillian job.  I very much enjoyed the first two movies, but ultimately, they seemed to be simply a little too ""crammed"".  In trying to capture all of Rowling's Wizarding World, Columbus was too slavishly faithful to things which were better enjoyed in the books.  Cuaron trimmed some of the pieces of the story that wouldn't make for good visuals, and then told a great story using a marvelous visual language.  His color palette was subdued but beautiful.  The acting from Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe was, as was to be expected, fine.  Each did a nice job, and in certain moments managed to shine above their probable abilities--a certain testament to this director.  Emma Watson (?forgive me if I got her name wrong) (Hermione) was marvelous, and she is likely to have lasting merit as an actress.  The special effects were just that--very special.  THey were not used wantonly, but rather placed where they needed to be.  Pacing was marvelous, exciting and rapid.  The symbolism of the clocks was somewhat heavy handed, but also quite visually striking.  Music was great.  This is easily the best movie in the series.  To folks who say that it scared their five year old, I reply, what in heavens name were you doing bringing a five year old to this movie?  It is PG for pete's sake.  It is meant to be enjoyed by people over the age of 10, and probably over the age of 12 to be completely safe.  Younger ones will cry, because the effects are truly scary.The other stars were excellent as always.  Casting Emma Thompson was a stroke of genius.  Alan Rickman was chilling as Snape, and the replacement for Dumbledore (Michael Gambon?) was seamless and turned in a very nuanced performance.Do you love harry potter?  Then this is the film you hoped they would make.  Not for the little ones, please.  Definitely for those with an eye to a great story and impressive visual communication."	5.0	Brilliant, Fast Paced, Dark and Magical	2004-10-04	12	8	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZZZ159U3Q5OO	Strat Cat	I don't like Harry Potter - movies, books, lunchpails... you name it. I mean, I'm a guy. I like beer, sports, action movies with sex, violence and car chases... So, well, er... it's kinda difficult admitting I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have awarded it 4 stars! But it deserves it.I only agreed to watch it because my partner wanted to. Despite her age, she loves the books, so the movies were a must-see. The books are way too childish for me. As were the first movies. But with this one, the franchise seems to have come of age. It's much darker, the atmosphere, the themes, the plot. The actors are more accomplished - I no longer yearn to slap that Hermione, as I did in her earlier incarnations, but can now watch her in relative comfort. The whole movie seems so much grander in scale.So for any 'real men' out there who don't want to suffer the stigma of watching Harry Potter, I say, swallow your pride, sit down, shut up, and prepare to be as surprised as I was. This really is a good flick. So much so, I'm almost, that's 'almost', looking forward to the next installment.Give it a go, it might just surprise you!	4.0	A real surprise.	2006-11-01	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1GFNTDUHA6RTF	Stt	"When Warner Bros. introduced this ultimate edition set last year my wife was thrilled. Naturally I ordered them for her as she is a huge Harry Potter fan, and I enjoy the movies as well. When we received the first 2 Ultimate Edition movies we were blow away by both the packaging and the amount of extra content included. For the first time in a long time we felt like we were really getting our money's worth and eagerly awaited the next two movies. Well the day the movies became available for pre-sale I slapped our order in and we anxiously awaited the release. Now a few weeks ago I did a little browsing online and realized that neither of the two Ultimate edition movies releasing this year contained extended editions of the movie, which was one of the main reasons we purchased the set last year. We've owned both the HD-DVD years 1-5 special box set, and then upgraded to the Blu-Ray version(still own these). After discussing it with my wife, she decided she still wanted the Ultimate Edition's this year (3 and 4) so I kept our preorder. Well today we received the products in the mail, and before I get into anything else I have to rant a little bit.First thing I noticed with this years Ultimate Editions, the boxes are MUCH lower quality than last years. My wife unwrapped year 3 and the way they have it packaged is very flimsy and easy to tear, which she did. They added a holographic cover to both movies this year which looks great, but the way they have it packaged its going to rip and tear if you plan on watching your movies.Gone is the magnetic snap that clasped the case shut in years 1 and 2.Both of these ""Ultimate"" Edition movies seem to be cheapened and lesser in quality not to mention the lack of extended editions of hte movie which is why MOST people purchased them in the first place.Warner Bros. knew that people were going to buy these, especially those that had already slapped down the money for Years 1 and 2. Late last week I wrote a letter to Warner Bros. asking them why they decided to not include the extra content from the movies that we know exists (it runs on the family channel).I do NOT suggest picking up Years 3 and 4, even if you already own years 1 and 2. 1 and 2 are totally worth the money, and are great sets even if you own the first two movies because they add to them. These sets add nothing worth the cost, and ruin what could have been an excellent set to own..:("	1.0	Ugh What have they done to this great Set	2010-10-19	173	152	21

The book was my favorite of the series to date, but the movie deviated too far from the book.  Dumbledore's personality was completely different, which doesn't make sense in the continuity of the series.  I don't know why the new director thought it necessary to change the grounds  of Hogwarts.  And they all but left Maggie Smith out, playing Professor McGonagill. So much was eliminated concerning the history of Harry's father and his three closest friends which was supposed to have set the stage for the sequels.  I heard J.K. Rowling say in an interview that she really liked this movie and the changes the director made.

However, this third movie was not impressive.  It lacks spirit and luster.  It did not stay true to the book, left out some very important parts, and went as far as changing parts of the story.  The cinematoghrapy was dull and the magic of the first two films was non-existent.  If you never read the books and saw this movie, you would be lost.

To date, this remains my  favorite HP movie (and yes, I have seen all five released movies).And I must salute Michael Gambon. To have to step into the robes of Albus Dumbledore, after Richard Harris- wow. He is NOT the same, and I do not believe that he ever planned to play Dumbledore as Harris did- thank goodness.

It led me to sign an official petition to make the fourth movie very long or split it up into different parts or something along those lines. But the characters played their roles out very well, I believe.

In this much tighter film, however, things are greatly changed - as Alfonso Cuaron has, by some miracle, extracted actual performances from the formerly wooden child stars.The improved Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are now so natural in their roles that one is finally able to forget that these are child actors and let oneself fall into the story.Special note to be given to David Thewlis who is terrific as kind-hearted Lupin.  Gary Oldman is terrific in everything he is in and this film is no exception.  Michael Gambon is a welcome replacement for Richard Harris (may he rest in peace) - the latter was too old and tired for the role of Dumbledore.I found Cuaron's repeat-ending to be particularly well done.All-in-all, this is a terrifc stand-alone film.

I loved the backdrop and getting to know more of hogwarts from the outside (DVD extras helped me appreciate that more)My really only complaint is that they left too much out from the book IMO...  I can MAYBE understand cutting the length for theatre purposes, but with a strong committed fan based such as HP has I dont think it would a huge risk to make it longer.  I do understand as stated in some of the DVD extras, that it would have to be ""16 hours"" LOL to be REALLY true to the book.I can help but WISH at some point they WILL release these movies in a DVD version that is longer, quite a bit longer and contains more of what they had to leave onthe cutting room floor.Dont read beyond if you dont want to read a spoiler....I was probably MOST disappointed in cutting out the history of James, Sirius, Peter and Lupine...How Sirius and lupine were Jame's Hermione and Ron...  They left out the whole history of how they created the Marauders map. THey NEVER told Harry, that I can right now recall, that Harry's Patronus was the same as his fathers animagnus. (sorry If i butcher spellings). so much intamate history just left out :(.I also didnt like how they left out the whole secret ""knot"" of the womping willow and crrokshanks helping Sirius.When looking at the DVD extras I ran across deleted scenes that I think SHOULD have been in the movie... Sir Cadogan has some pretty funny parts!WELL enough of my little whine, It is a great movie, even though it feels like it is missing some important parts.The creation of Buckbeak was absolutley amazing!!The DVD games? get 1 star... they were lame.I did enjoy all the other extras though."	4.0	Awesome movie, wish it was longer...	2006-01-02	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2R9SRMLGOV1WH	T. Downey	HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN may be the most controversial and contested film in the series (barring the still unfathomable conservative Christian opposition to the inital release of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE). New director Alfonso Cuaron, taking over from Chris Columbus, makes a beautiful film seeped in cold blue and silver hues,  plays contrast with light and shadow, and explores a recurring symbol of reflections. The cast, under his direction, give their best performances yet. The film is, overall, a tight, tense roller coaster.So why are so many people decrying this as the weakest entry? Surely, the first film moved too slowly in places, and the second suffered from too many characters. Film three improves over all this. The problem lies in how much of the book was excised in order to trim the film down. The fans say that it's just too different from the book. And they do have a point. A film is different from a book. Even when the book's author writes, directs, and edits a film version, it will never be an exact replica of the novel someone experienced while reading it. A director's first priority is to the film, not the book. He has to make the best film he can (and in this case, he assuredly did).HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, is not the same as HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, written by J.K. Rowling. If you cannot be happy with an adaptation unless it is exactly the same as the novel, I'm afraid all you can do is never watch an adaptation ever again.Either that or stop reading.	5.0	For fans who get the difference between book and film	2004-08-25	11	6	5

The departures from the original story plots are just too great for me to enjoy them completely, and this third installment has shown more changes in the storyline than the others. So, why do I go? The only reason these movies are worth watching is for the excellent characterizations of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. These three actors have the parts down pat, and I applaud their efforts. Richard Harris was a wonderful Dumbledore, and it would have been hard to replace him in any case, but their choice of actors was wrong, at least to me. The image I have of Dumbledore does not fit this new actor.Bottom line: See the movie for the three main characters and try to ignore the gaping absence of the original story.	3.0	Better if you don't know the book	2005-01-18	2	2	0

They totally line up their feeling with books they read from the first 2 volumes. I would like to say this, the first 2 movies have no particlar incredibly remarkable moments that stands in the history of films. One need to notice this, books and movies are 2 very different mediums, movies are motion driven and books are, however, pretty much dialqoue driven through out the story. What this vol 3 of the series have done and the first 2 didnt is creating remarkable scenes that while you are watching it, the scene would burn into your memory that you won't forget at least for a long while. I would just liek to point out that the riding happogrift scene and big ""expelto pratronum"" at the pond scene are simply breath taken, and unforgetable. And the bg musics are absolutely scored better than the first 2. I hate to say it, but when I first watched the first movie, I cant tell why the fuss is so high that people make it sound like its a movie u shouldnt be skipped in your life, while the whole movie is relatively long, and 70% of it were about wizard school talking, which is cute and nice, but it never make any sense to me where exactly the magically stunnig part is in these 2 movies, I plead the director fail to really see where teh strong points are from the book.  Also in vol 2 the last serpent fight part, it's loose. There is no real tension between Harry and the serpent while they fighting, and the way it unfold the true identity of Tom Ridle is very dull plus confusing for new audience. By comparision vol 3 creates better chemistry between the characters and things around them. If you are at younger age then dun listen to those old school geeks whom measure movies inch by inch, its just dreadful. These type of movies are there for serving fun, feeding your emotion need, school book explanations are tools for referencing purpose to make a fun movie, but absolutely not the priority of it. I just hate people using professional terms to contain movies, to put them into boundaries like there is a standard of what's a good movie, while they are not supposed to be, and they forgot the heartily fun should be what we are looking for.

It held your attention, and packed in the suspence and action with Hermione's time-turner. A few things were different from the book, but I think that this movie lived up to its name, all the way to the credits at the end. There were more encounters with Snape, a more dramatic Dumbledore (and he did need some drama there), and many other great things. The new director did an excellent job with it, and where I must confess to some doubts beforehand, the end result is that I would like to see him in the director's chair again....He did a GREAT job!

That is more the province of Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix.  Prisoner of Azkaban is the book in which we get the ""backstory"" on James Potter ... without that backstory, the character of Sirius is never revealed as trustworthy, honorable, and wrongly accused of murder.  There is no explanation at the climax of the movie as to why Harry all of sudden buys Sirius' innocence and turns on Pettigrew and Snape.Cinematography on this movie, while interesting, makes Hogwarts look most forbidding and like no place I'd like to visit.  Hogwarts from the books and from the first two movies is presented as a magical place ... Cuaron's Hogwarts looks like Azkaban.  Wait, maybe that's what he thought he was designing ... perhaps he thought ""Harry"" was the prisoner of Azkaban.  It's understandable considering that I doubt poor Cuaron even read the book, so much is missing.I simply could not get past the omissions and Dan Radcliffe's embarrassing performance.Don't waste your money on this one.

With most movies, I can't wait to get out of the theatre. This movie could have been two hours longer.First, I have never read a Potter book so I am not biased that way. I consider Potter to be like literary Crack but they make GREAT movies. Some parts probably could have been left out but overall, it flowed really well. The movie did a good job of keeping you interested in the film and not the kid behind you with the squeaky seat. I realize they were trying to pack in a lot of material but I really didn't notice it. There were no boring parts of the movie. There was lots of suspense and everything fit together in the end. It's a very interesting ride. It was difficult to get used to new actors playing characters but you can get by that after a while.I hope the DVD is longer.

Now the movie itself also has many flaws. Besides a terrible artistic style, and omitting many important scenes it also suffers from terrible dialogue pacing. Too many conversations happen at a Gilmoresque pace that shouldn't. Harry Potter is not a quick thinking character outside of physical conflict. If he is being told important, complex information he needs to stand there and absorb the information for a moment before responding. This same issue happens on a much lesser scale to most characters in the movie. The only characters who benefit from this pace are the Weasley Twins. The silver tongued quick witted bamboozlers work very well with the pacing of this movie.	1.0	Intellect	2010-09-21	9	7	2

His lack of camera work had me driven up the wall by the end of the film. This movie on the other hand was brilliantly shot. Beautiful scenery and many scenes where the camera goes straight through windows *shudders at the beautiful thought*. The script on the other hand was differant...The first two had both the same major plot line and I was definately hoping for something more in this film and I didnt get like many suggested. I was told that it got much more dark. I do not agree. Camera work is everything which is what makes me give the first two a 4 star (would have given it five if they had THIS directore).

Rowling's book of the same name, ""Azkaban"" has Harry Potter, with his friends, Ron Weasley & Hermoine Granger returning to school for year three at Hogwarts School & discover that a mysterious man by the name of Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison, setting the school on high alert. Harry learns thru his new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, that Black, supposedly, had a major role in the tragic demise of Harry's parents, by betraying both of them to Lord Voldemort. With the evil, joy sucking, grim reaper like Dementors guarding every entrance to the school, and with the help of his friends as well as Professor Lupin, Harry Potter is ready to face Sirius Black. But, does Black want to kill Harry, or is there something more sinister lying in wait.I read ""Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban"" three years ago just before the release of ""Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone"" hit theaters (it was my introduction to everything Potter). As I was reading the book, I tried to imagine who would play these new characters (Black, Lupin, Trelawney) from ""Azkaban"". I hit the nail on the head when I imagined Gary Oldman taking on the role as Sirius Black (I imagined him in the role but never thought he would actually accept it). David Thewlis is perfect as Lupin & Emma Thompson brings Professor Trelawney eerily to geeky, goofy life. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, & Emma Watson are more enjoyable to watch in this film, now that they have some decent acting chops (or either that, I'm just getting used to them).The effects are decent. Buckbeak is an awesome sight. Harry's ride with the Hippogriff is one of the highlights in the film. However, The Dementors are cool to watch, but, there too reminiscent of the Black Riders from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The Grim should have been more wolf like than dog and Lupin's werewolf should have been more in the style of ""American Werewolf in London"" than the final effect used in the film (he looks dangerous but also gangly and goofy. I knew Buckbeak would kick his butt). I loved The time turner sequence & it was more of an ode to ""Back to the Future"", than anything else (the scenes that show the Harry and Hermoine's coming and going in the same frame was so very ""Back to the Future"").The small speed bump with the film is that some of the material in the book was left out or shuffled around. I believe this has to do with the run time to the film. ""Azkaban"" is the shortest of the three films clocking in at 2 hrs. & 10 min.""Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a film that enchants its viewers with all of its charms.

The special effects are wonderful (especially Buckbeak!) and the three main actors -- those who play Harry, Hermione, and Ron -- really seem to be settling into their characters.Gary Oldman, who plays Sirius Black, is marvalous!  Encompassing everything from the way Oldman wears Black's frumpled clothes to the desperation in his voice at being locked up for 12 years, Oldman truly brings Sirius Black to life.  Also, even though I'm not a big fan of the character, Emma Thompson's portrayl of the loony Trelawney is worth noting.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is that there were some plot elements in the book relating to Black's relationship with Lupin and James Potter that were omitted in the movie.  The omitted elements in no way ruined the movie, but they REALLY should have been there!...and as such the movie was not quite as satisfying as it could have been.Overall, this movie really was quite good and is certainly recommended to fans of the books as well as anyone else interested in seeing it.	4.0	A Good Movie...Sirius-ly	2004-06-08	3	3	0

Starring Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Robert Hardy, David Thewlis, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson, Julie Christie and Alan Rickman.The first film in the series without Chris Columbus at the helm and with Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore shows a decided drop in quality and diminished dramatic returns. Basically Harry Potter meets the werewolves, the film reveals more about the murder of Potter's parents at the hands of Voldemort that, as is, would barely justify a 90 minute running length but here bloated out to over two hours finally just pops leaving the film and the viewer deflated. The film makes a deadly mistake in doing a lengthy STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION style time loop sequence that tried ones patience in a 50 minute TV episode and is fidget inducing here being the most blatant example of padding this viewer has ever encountered in a feature film. In serials, this was called the economy chapter. The cast is mostly good though Christie is utterly unremarkable and Gambon does not come anywhere near to making one forget Harris. Not a bad film but save for the continuity bits utterly disposable and unneccesary.	2.0	HARRY POTTER AND THE ATTACK OF THE EXTENSIVE PADDING	2013-12-18	0	0	0

Not everything was given the amount of time that it so desperately needed to get the magical atmosphere the first two movies had. The first two books were great, and not that I am complaining about the amount of pages the last two books had, but the movies are going to have to be a two part movie if they want everything in it.The good things about this movie is of course the special effects and scenery. The castle is still its good old self of magic and mystery, lots of hall scenes and moving staircases are shown in this one. And even Hagrids hut is shown, but have you seen its new location? Theres all these rocks in front of it and the hill looks like it will kill you if you took a wrong step.The acting is good and Hermoine is a lot better than what she was in the last two movies. [The entire crowd exploded in applause when whe punched Malfoy.]Ron and Harry are good, but Professor Lupin was the real big surprise in this one. His face wasn't what I saw when I read the books, but I got over it after several minutes.The bad things are that there is no scenes with professor McGonnagal. Oh sure we see her for about two minutes, but that is not enough if you ask me. You can agree or disagree. And what has happened with all these scene changings? Half of the most important scenes are all twisted and shaped into these confusing and sort of dumb new ideas.And what really ticked me off was there was no Quidditch matches AT ALL. There is about thirty seconds of scene when Harry fell off his broom, but other than that nothing. Come on! I also didn't like the rushed scene at the shrieking shack when Harry learns the truth about Sirius. And the fact that the big scene with the Patronus is just a big flash of light sucked also. Not nearly as good as it could have been.All in all, the director should be given his dues, this is a really hard movie to direct and I enjoyed most of what he did.

Some may disagree, pointing out the missing information on the Marauder's Map and its creators, but I felt even with the small tid-bits of info missing (they aren't important in the main scheme, only for fans who want to know why some things are so) the movie was tremendous.Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is probably the best director for this movie. His darker designs (especially for the Dementors) along with the usage of clocks (with some fantastic cinematography) makes this more of an artistic film with an adventure than an adventure with some artsy camera work. Don't expect ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""North by Northwest"" but still, this is by far my favorite of the three.The extras are hard to navigate, but once you find them, it's quite enjoyable.Storywise, while he may add a little minor detail that wasn't in the book, he still sticks to the central plot without deviating (meaning he DOESN'T kill Harry or have Ron and Hermione start passionately making love, reminicent of his widely known ""Y tu Mama Tambien"").The only thing which may deviate parents from letting kids watch this is the Dementors (immensely creepy in my opinion) and a horror-like fight scene between a large dog and a werewolf which some reviewers found quite unnecissary (I felt it acceptable but not for younger kids).Depending on whether you're a purist or a fan, you might hate this or love it.

I understand darker, a bit older and musty just because it's POA in which the book is but it's like this year clases were in somekind of acient ruin's not a school where magical studies are commited,and the Hogwarts grounds look very chaotic not like the first parts which seem to be a well organized, i think weather and outdoor efect were really good in acordance to the book, the fog, the rain, etc. Well aside from hogwarts looking like a graveyard i think it was well done.Just hope that for GOF we dont get too Bright and Happy (HP 1,2) or the Dark Graveyard (3)... and lupin tranformation sucked big time worst werewolf i've ever since ok i get the werewolves isn't synonymous with fur but that blue-grayish hairless Mexican dog craked me up.	4.0	I agree with most good reviews	2005-11-03	1	0	1

"I must say before I begin that I am a fan of Rowling's novels and a fan of the first two films in the Harry Potter series. The film ""Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the only thing to come out of the Harry Potter craze that I was even slightly disappointed in.While I must admit I enjoyed this film, I left the theater feeling a little mixed up. There were many details in the book that were either not present, changed, altered, or just simply f_(ked around with! Harry recieves his firebolt at the end of the film instead of in the middle, Professor Trelewany's classroom was just up a flight of swirly stairs instead of up a latter and into a hole in the ceiling like in the book, and what is up with Harry and his classmates wearing normal Muggle clothes throughout 70% of the film? Don't they have witch and wizard robes as their uniforms? The school grounds/castle is majorly changed. There are many hillsides and paths that did not appear in the previous two movies and it just made no sense.There wasn't enough Quidditch and the entire movie just seemed too short, like they shortened it for the critics. The real viewers of this film are the fans who learned to love the novels and the previous two movies (because they were true to the movie). The makers of this movie should have kept the fans in mind. Fans aren't going to care if the movie is 4 hours long, as long as its true to the book.Now, this was an entertaining movie and Cuaron is a talented director. I just think Chris Columbus is a better choice for the Harry Potter movies. Like one previous reviewer said, If you forget the book, this is a pretty good movie.

Only instead of a bright happy cheery wow, it's a shocked, disgusted, amazed (in a bad sort of way) wow. There are about three perks to this movie. 1. You get to make fun of Daniel Radcliffe's continuously declining (can they decline anymore?) acting skills. 2. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, and Rupert Grint remain funny/cool. Come on, you can't say Alan Rickman's bad (think Dogma). 3. There was an Indiana Jones reference. You can't deny that utter coolness right there (Check the quotes and trivia. You'll see what I'm talking about). Now, for the bad. It was unrealistic- when do go to a shopping area (Hogsmeade) and walk down a completely empty road? And invisibly holding a lollipop, even more! And why did we not find out the nicknames of his Harry's father and friends? That could come in handy when Harry writes letters to Sirius (Addressing them to Padfoot) at the beginning of the next book! Or what about the werewolf? Since when do werewolves look like THAT? Yeah, that poor thing looked kind of like Gumby on crack. And the sexual tension was too much. It was fogging up the screen. Put it in subtly please? Weren't Ron and Hermione supposed to be mad at each other pretty much the whole time? There was about one argument. That was it. Yeah. All in all, if you're watching this, I hope it's for humorous intentions only. Or you're taking clips for a movie titled ""How Not to Make a Movie"". Hey, they have to listen to me. I'm their money.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2JP0URFHXP6DO	Tim Janson	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has a decidedly different feel to it than the first two Potter movies.  No doubt this is due in part to new director Alfonso Cuaron, taking over for Chris Columbus.  The movie has a darker, more serious tone to it with Harry as well as his friends showing tinges of anger that we didn't see in the first two films.As the film opens, Harry, in a fit on anger at his Uncle Vernon, packs up and runs away from home.  He is quickly picked up by a spectral double-decker bus that speeds him along on his way to the pickup point for Hogwart's.  Harry soon learns that a dangerous and murderous wizard named Sirius Black has escaped Azkaban prison, and that he was a servant of Voldemort's that betrayed Harry's parents and now wants to kill Harry.  Thus begins a tangled plot of deception, mis-conceptions, in what ends up as almost a who-done-it kind of plot.With Sirius Black on the Castle Grounds and the Ghostly Dementors (Azkabans ruthless guards) searching for him, the castle is locked down for the safety of the students.  The movie introduces us to Professor Lupin as the new instructor of Defense agains the Black Arts.  He has a particular interest in Harry and it's quickly apparent that Lupin is a red herring.  Once Black is found, though, all is not what it seems....As mentioned, this movie is very different than the first two.  We see very little of Harry, Ron, and Hermione attending classes and learning their studies.  That all takes a backseat to the main plot.  Also, the characters of Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall are reduced to VERY minor roles although Professor Snape and Hagrid still get a fair amount of screen time.  In addition,  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)is reduced from an arrogant bully, to an arrogant bully who spends most of the movie as a sniveling coward and gets punched out by Hermione.  Gary Oldman plays the role of Sirius Black and although his role is relatively small, he's effective as the murderous Black in his typical over-the-top style.Another departure from the previous films is that much of the action takes place out-of-doors rather than in the mysterious walls of Hogwarts.  Some may be put off by that since the magic and mystery of Hogwart's castle is a strong drawing point but I found it quite refreshing to get the fish out of water a little bit.Having never read the book I can't comment on how closely the film followed the story but I for one enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  I think it allowed the main characters of Harry and Hermione to branch out a bit more and show a broader range of emotions and abilities.  Harry even comes off a bit frightening when his anger causes him to put a rather horrible spell on Aunt Marge and then refuse to reverse it.A Good effort by new director Cuaron.	5.0	A DIFFERENT FILM THAN THE FIRST TWO	2005-01-03	4	3	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3I2GBE2KGQV1U	"Timothy Linsley ""Tim Linsley"""	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the third book in the Harry Potter series was the book that renewed my interest in where it was going.  After two with nearly the same plot, it was time for something new, and if book three didn't deliver that, I was done.Fortunately for all involved, it did.The same could easily be said about this, the third movie in the series.  After two films of director Chris Columbus' thorough, yet style-less adaptations, it was time to see something with a new energy to it.  Not that the writing itself wouldn't make the movie worthwhile no matter what, but to see the same dull, listless camera work for another four films would have been a serious drain on the fun of the series.  Not to mention that the stories get much darker, and Columbus doesn't seem to have a dark bone in his body.Thank goodness for Alfonso Cuaron!  The brilliant director of The Little Princess, Great Expectations, and that Mexican sex film Y tu Mama Tambien brings so much wild energy to the film, now-producer Columbus would have had a heart attack setting it all up.  Within the first five minutes, we're treated to a camera rubber-banding in and out of Harry's bedroom window and some gloriously jittery hand-held work.  This is more energy than in the first two films combined.  It's much darker, as well.  Shadows seem to consume the actors at times, and the colors are now far more muted.  And we must not forget the Dementors.  Their first appearance is a scene of true suspense, as lights flicker out, and a frost covers everything in sight.Cuaron also brings out much better performances from the three leads.  Daniel Radcliffe as not-so-young Harry shows amazing signs of growth as an actor, here proving that he is more than simply a wide-eyed observer in his magical world.  We are allowed, finally to see him angry, truly scared, and even shed a few tears.  Emma Watson, as Hermione, also gets to show some new shades, as she crushes on pal Ron, and at last gets to throw a little revenge back on long-time antagonist Draco Malfoy.  In fact, the only one who doesn't seem to get anything new to do is Ron Weasly, played by Rupert Grint, who must be a good sport to spend so much screen time either befuddled or scared.And, as always, there are new performers, as teachers - and one cast member - are replaced, and/or added to the class schedule.  The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, sort of a revolving door of a role, is Professor R. J. Lupin (David Thewlis), a quiet, yet wise man who holds a fearsome secret.  Professor Sybil Trelawney (the always wonderful Emma Thompson) is a daffy doom-speaker who may or may not know at all what she's doing.  And Michael Gambon, replacing esteemed Richard Harris, doesn't miss much of a beat as Headmaster Dumbledore, though after seeing frail Harris in the role, he seems a bit overly chipper.The super-long text of Rowling's novel has been neatly trimmed by screenwriter David Kloves, and zooms nicely along at a breakneck pace, leaving only a few tiny details un-addressed by the end.  Considering how much had to be left out, though, it's really no problem.  It may actually be a good thing, in that it could encourage more people to read the book and see if any of their questions are answered.By the end of the film, audiences are left grinning, and with a new hope in the fate of the franchise.  Let's all pray that rumors of the youngsters leaving are just that.Seeing Harry with any other face would just be wrong.	4.0	New Life for Potter Franchise	2004-06-04	3	1	2

Jones ""TJ"""	I enjoyed this film very much and I think that the Harry Potter community needed a dose of fresh directing from the very talented Alfonso Cuaron. He really tried to capture the teenage angst and add his own flare to the Potterverse.  But, as with all fims, there are always going to be some disappointments;problem number one was that the film  was too short (shorter than the first two films when the 3rd book is longer than the previous 2) and too much story was left out.  What made the book great was all of Rowling's little details and the film just lacked those details.  Also, the scenes at Hogwarts were way too rushed to try to get the viewers to the final climax.  On the plus side, the children actors gave their best performance to date, although I seriously think that WB should recast Harry.  Daniel Radcliffe just doesn't bring the character to life and I honestly thought his crying scene was plainly horrible acting.  But, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, and Gary Oldman all gave a brilliant perfomances!  The special effects were amazing, and Buckbeak was a real achievement.  Overall, this film has it's flaws, but is was still very enjoyable and I look forward to the next installment.	4.0	Hmm ... Too rushed	2004-11-23	6	6	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABLBRUT8DALNN	Todd Smith	In year three, our cast of unique and magical characthers have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban.	5.0	The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078	2013-05-11	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2YKADCJME4FSW	Tom Birkenstock	"Perhaps one of the most astonishing aspects of the Harry Potter series (other than the fact that they will make their way through all seven novels) is that, if the critics are to be trusted, the films have managed to maintain a certain level of quality even as several directors have passed the baton to the next man in line.  If you think about other film series that made it out to seven entries or more, like Star Trek or Bond, then you'll notice that they are marred by wild inconsistencies in quality.  As the first film not directed by Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban represented something of a test for the franchise.  Despite his shortcomings as a director, Chris Columbus's background in adventuresome family films at least presented him as an obvious choice as the director of the Harry Potter films.  With The Prisoner of Azkaban there is a real question as to whether the franchise could continue with a new director at the helm.And what a director!  When Alfonso Cuaron, the first director to take over from Columbus, was tapped to make the next Harry Potter film he had just come off of his critically acclaimed Mexican film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, a story about teenage sexual exploration.  I wonder how Harry Potter fans reacted to this news.  My guess is that half of them thought Cuaron would make a film where Harry and Ron go on a road trip together only to discover sexual awakening while under the tutelage of an older witch.  It turns out Cuaron did not implant an indie sensibility into the Potter franchise, but I am happy to say he did manage to inject new life into the series.The Prisoner of Azkaban begins with Harry, once again, living with his aunt and uncle over the summer months.  His Uncle Vernon has invited over his sister Marge for dinner while forcing Harry to play butler for the family.  Marge is apparently not a fan of the Potters because not only does she insult Harry, but she also insults his mother and father.  Ignoring the prohibition against using magic among the muggles, Harry lets his anger get the best of him and proceeds to inflate Marge like a large party balloon.  He then quickly storms out of the Vernon household, suitcase in tow.This opening scene is the first clue that the audience is in for some changes.  The Prisoner of Azkaban is a darker film, both in its color palate and in its themes.  After Marge is blown up into a balloon, we see her floating across the night sky like some low flying aircraft.  Later we discover that she has been returned to her original state, but Cuaron momentarily allows audience to think she might live out the rest of her days bouncing from one skyline to another.  The initial lingering question of Marge's fate recalls other dark children's films.  In the original Willy Wonka, for example, the condition of each of the bad kids was left frighteningly ambiguous.  This newfound darkness is reflected in the aesthetics of the film as well.  Not only are there deeper shadows throughout the movie, but even Hogwarts's uniforms are darker in shade.This time around the villain is also suitably menacing.  Each installment in the series has taken an opportunity to utilize some of Britain's most prestigious actors, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is no exception.  Not only do we get Emma Thompson as a teacher of divinations, Prof. Trelawney, but we also get Gary Oldman who plays Sirius Black, an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban.  (The name Sirius Black seems only one step removed from Oldman's first major role as the punk legend Sid Vicious).  Oldman has been fashioning his American accent for so long that I had actually forgotten that he was born a Brit.  Black's face is plastered on numerous wanted posters and newspaper pages.  But because this is a realm of magic, Black's image moves, like some sort of magical .gif, showing him screaming at his jailers (I like to think he's saying ""Eve-ry-one!"").  In addition to an escaped convict, the Hogwarts gang must also worry about the likelihood of a roaming werewolf, making this the most Halloween themed Potter film yet.While the film still stretches past the two-hour mark, The Prisoner of Azkaban feels much more streamlined than its predecessors.  Strangely enough, it took an indie director to make the Potter films feel like a big budget action adventure.  That's not to say that the modest charms of Hogwarts and the camaraderie between the schoolchildren are missing.  In one of the better scenes in the film we see Harry, Ron and other boys bond over magic candy that has the strange effect of causing one to growl like different kinds of animals.  The scene barely lasts half a minute, but it is a wonderful reminder of what its like for boys to form friendships in their early teen years, attempting to impress and one up their mates.  Alongside these smaller character moments (including Harry's tutelage from a new Hogwart's professor) Cuaron creates the longest and best executed action climax yet filmed for a Harry Potter movie.  In the tradition of other great extended action sequences, like Return of the Jedi and The Seven Samurai, nearly the last hour of the film is a tense series of events that, while action packed, are also incredibly smart.  I am loath to spoil the end of the film, but let me merely state that the climax of the film is as carefully constructed as the intricate gears of a pocket watch.The previous Harry Potter films attempted to capture the wonder and magic of growing up and discovering what kind of world lies outside the bounds of your house, family and hometown.  In this manner, the films are about more than just wizards and warriors.  They also tried to capture the world through the eyes of a child.  The Prisoner of Azkaban, however, is the first Harry Potter film that seems to be looking back at adolescence from the vantage point of adulthood.  The darker tone of the film not only suggests the hard trials Harry must face as a wizard, but also the difficult times he must face as a teenager."	5.0	Harry Potter: The Teenage Years	2010-10-23	6	3	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A15O4NZ08DVVWC	Toni	By far this movie is better than the other 2, but it still has it's faults.SPOILERSSome good points are that most of the book remained unchanged, but I do think that they focused on some of the wrong things.  More emphasis should have been placed on what was going on, and less emphasis on the character's little oddities.The Dementors were great, very well done and imagined.  The patronus was slightly off in explanation, but was overall okay.  There was much good acting to be accounted for, such as the malice of Snape, the strength and curiosities of Dumbledore, and the comically fearful Ronald Weasley.  There was also some overly portrayed acting, but I will not name names.And now for some of my serious complaints.  Viewers that have been reading all of the books beforehand should be very disapointed right now.  Though it did not change things as much as the other 2, it did still change things.  The ending of the book was completly chopped off.  I believe that it would have been much better for harry to have gotten the letter from Sirius that he can go to Hogsmead, and the giving of Pigwidgeon to Ron, than to have Harry flying around on a broom that he was supposed to have gotten long before and had confiscated because it could have possibly been from (and was from in the book) Sirius Black.A lot of explantation was cut out of the book.  Viewers who have not read the books were probably very confused about why Harry's patronus was a stag, and how Lupin knew how to use the Marauder's Map.  Fred and George did not explain to Harry why they did not reccomend 6 of the 7 secret passages out of Hogwarts, or about the one guarded by the Whomping Willow.  Hagrid's lesson on Hippogrifs was supposed to have more than just Buckbeak, though that was an amusing scene.If you are a fan of Harry Potter, it is only right that you see this movie.  It is overall a well-done movie, but if you are one who hates anything that deviates from the book I reccomend taking a stress ball with you to see it.	4.0	better than the rest	2004-06-05	0	0	0

The Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie but it was very different from the book. They had many alterations which included not haviing enough Quidditch, Harry not getting his books and the scene when they rescued Sirius lasted literally for 20 seconds. I was also dissapointed with the ending, I mean it stops when Harry gets the Firebolt and even that is a mistake because in the movie fred and george open it but in the book ron, Hermione and harry open it and then hermione takes it off Harry. I do have to say i miss the old director Chris Columbus who put everything from the books in. I mean what is the use of making the movie if you are not going to finish it right? If you are looking for a good night out go see the movie but if you want an adventure read the book. Great acting performances by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione). The actors have all grown up and the movie grows up with them, a bit more mature than the first two movies.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3CG6YLYZJXQG4	"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos"""	Finally, a film that doesn't slavishly follow the letter of the book, but rather gives the viewer the spirit of it.  To be sure, the story is still there, and though I had a few quibbles with things that weren't explained as well as I thought they should be, on the whole, I think they did a fantastic job of paring the story down to cinematic essentials.What a lot of people do not, and perhaps will not understand is that books are not films and vice versa.  They're very different mediums and require very different approaches.  If you try to translate a book literally to the screen you get a tedious film (HP and the Chamber of Secrets, for example.)  But if the adaptation is done intelligently, and preserves the feel of the universe as well as the essential storylines, then you're likely to have a film worth watching over and over.  PoA is one of the latter.  More than either of the first two, it is rich with a sense of magic.  There's a darkness about it which hints at what's coming, and it builds deftly on already established relationships.  While you can watch this without reference to the books or the first two films, your appreciation of it will be the greater for being familiar with either or both.I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to accept Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.  Richard Harris had made the role so much his own that I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping in.  But I was wrong to worry; Gambon does a superb job here, as do all the others.  Particularly good are David Thewlis as Lupin and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.As I've said before, of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, fanboys and girls need not apply if they're going to be anal-retentive about what's been excised or changed.  Relax.  Enjoy some excellent cinema.	5.0	Easily the best of the HP films so far	2004-08-22	7	5	2

I always like the book better than the movie EXCEPT on this occasion.  I think this movie was the best movie of the three (the book was the best of the first three books, too) and I think the movie truly added some spice to the already wonderful story.  The author of the books is so great, but in certain areas, the movie version of this book was better.  The way things played out in certain areas of the movie were just awesome.  Especially the confrontation at the Shrieking Shack.  I loved it.  This is truly a great movie, a great adaptation, and a wonderful story.

Yes, I think a lot of things were cut, but JKR approves of it, so obviously what was cut was not essential to the overarching storyline for the seven books.That said, I do think that some explanation of the map and Harry's Patronus should have been in there. It felt disjointed that Lupin would ask Harry if Harry realized the map would be a device to lead Sirius straight to him. I mean, having read the books we know that Lupin and Sirius know the passwords because they helped create the damn thing, but for the movie there is nothing that explains why Lupin knows the passwords to the map.And Mooney. They misspelled his name. Parvati Patil's last name is misspelled in the credits as Patel so I watched in the IMAX viewing and saw that Seamus Finnigan's last name is misspelled as well as Finnegan -- which is a mistake I almost always make.Ships... I am a diehard Trioshipper I now realize. Though I believe that Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny will be in the books, I believe in Menage and pumpkins. That said, there were some quite amusing Ron/Hermione moments as well as Harry/Hermione moments. I also enjoyed the contrast of Draco being a drama queen to Pansy with Ron overdramatizing his leg to Hermione. But I don't think the Ron/Hermione moments overshadowed the Harry/Hermione moments or vice versa. The two relationships are very different. Ron/Hermione is conflict for the most part (at least at 13) and Harry/Hermione is emotional, especially when Harry talks about Sirius while they're waiting for themselves to exit the Whomping Willow.But the trio hug goes without saying as a great testament to their friendship. They're 13 here, I'm not giving them a m&eacute;nage a trois... yet.Scenes I loved...&lt;ul>&lt;li>it tore my heart to hear Harry speak so longingly about leaving the Dursleys and living with Sirius ""in the country"" because he's been trapped inside Azkaban for 12 years and know that it's never going to happen because Sirius is dead&lt;/li>&lt;li>I noted the playground in the background when Harry ran away and all I could think about was him sitting on those swings in OotP. Getting ahead of myself, aren't I?&lt;/li>&lt;li>the scene in which Harry is standing behind the clock watching everyone leave for the second Hogsmeade weekend made my dark!Harry radar perk up. Man, the plot bunnies just that shot could generate&lt;/li>&lt;li>Harry riding Buckbeak.

""Yes."" Sorry, anticipating OotP again&lt;/li>&lt;li>on the Knight Bus when Stan asks if Harry has heard of You-Know-Who and Harry spits back, ""Yeah, him I've heard of."" Oh man that gave me chills. Someone said to me that Dan Radcliffe could have either made that line or botched it. He slamdunked that line&lt;/li>&lt;li>the scenes with Harry and Lupin. Not so much the bridge (though that did seem to imply to me there was Remus/Lily in the past), but the post-Boggart on the steps when Harry talks about his happy memory. He doesn't have that many happy memories and for him to not know if the one that generates at least a partial Patronus is real or not is just heart-wrenching as well&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Continuity...&lt;ul>&lt;li>when did the Whomping Willow move between CoS and PoA? In CoS it was in the middle of a grassy courtyard&lt;/li>&lt;li>in Divination, when Trelawney sets Neville's teacup down she puts it in the saucer, yet when Neville reaches for it, it's in the middle of the table&lt;/li>&lt;li>when Hagrid is skipping stones, just before they cut back to Hagrid, Harry stands up and moves toward the lake's edge, yet when they cut back to Hagrid to confess Buckbeak's death sentence, Harry is sitting.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1SISMJHMTQH70	T. Sheppard	This movie takes the Harry Potter series to new heights with a fresh interpretation. The Prisoner of Azkaban Hits the mark entirely.Alfonso Cuaron has helped the Harry Potter series mature just as J.K. Rowling's characters have in the book series. He also made Prisoner slightly different from the book. It was mildly disappointing to see that the first two films followed the books in every detail. It is unfortunate that Curaon will not return for Goblet of Fire. Perhaps they can lure him back for Order of the Phoenix, which would benefit from his darker, more gothic interpretation of Hogwarts.	5.0	Simply the Best Harry Potter Movie Yet	2004-11-27	9	4	5
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T	Tsuyoshi	I hear complaints everywhere; 'the plot changed' 'My faborite scenes missing' and so on.  As I have not read the book, and probably won't read in the future, I just don't know whether these dissatisfied voices can be justified, or not.  I just want to fill in my commentary as someone who loves films, and I say, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' far exceeded my expectations.  It shows more sinister aspect of magics, darker side of it, and moreover, the three centeral characters are no longer kids, who act and speak on the same level as the adults.  That last thing never happened in the previous ones.As many reviewers have already made good points about the story, I only write this -- Gary Oldman (who hadn't made a good film these days) is the titular 'Prisoner' Sirius Black who is said to be very dangerous; so dangerous that the Ministry of Magic says no one should try to catch him.  But of course, he comes to Hogworth, where Harry studies with Ron and Hermioni.Some of the best actors from UK joined the cast -- besides Oldman, you see David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Julie Christie, and Timothy Spall.  But the last two don't have much to do -- perhaps, we should wait for the next time.The greatest asset of the thrid film of 'Harry' is the production designs by Stuart Craig (who also did the job for the other Harry Potter films).  The school is no longer a British public school made in a big castle with a slight Gothic touch.  Now it is Gothic itself.  The film shows the buildings with the more elaborate interiors.  The sense of space is emphasised with extensive descriptions about the lake and woods surrounded by the mountains, and in this way the school gives another aspect of it -- very isolated place where anything evil and dark can happen.  This new vision is due to Alfonso Cuaron's imagination, which could have never been found in Chris Columbus.Some characters are given too short time (especially Ron), and the story gets confused a little at the end.  But the characters themselves show the definite sign of growth -- mentally, and physically.  Look at Emma Watson as Hermioni who now wears jeans.Small fries might find it too scary, and the story hard to follow, but for adults this 'Azkaban' is a welcome change of pace for 'Harry Potter' series, especially if, like me, love the darker side of the characters and story.	5.0	With Characters Grown Up, The Film Gets Darker Than Ever	2004-09-21	17	10	7
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3DJ9JSWZG030G	T. Thornton	"'Prisoner of Azkaban' is, in some ways, a vast improvement over the Chris Columbus-led Potter adventures. For one thing, it feels like a real FILM, as opposed to a book report! But that brings me to my complaints. The movie is just too dark. Some people think ""dark"" equals ""good"" by default, but it doesn't. That tone isn't appropriate for Harry's third year. A lot of groundwork for future novels/films is laid in this outing, but really nothing terribly ""dark"" happens in the book. This tone would perfectly fit a film version of 'Order of the Phoenix' -- number five in the series -- but here it seems forced and out of place. Moreover (and as someone else mentioned) fairly crucial plot details are dropped in the adaptation from book to screen. Consequently the Marauder's Map and the Patronus Charm feels like contrivances to resolve the A and B-plots rather than crucial links to Harry's family and heritage. I live for the day when Warner Bros. hires a competent screenwriter to adapt the Potter franchise. As it stands, the damage is done and the sad fact is that it would've taken just fifteen seconds of screen time to clear up these details.But hey, at least it's ""dark""!!!!! :("	2.0	Could've been a contender	2005-05-15	7	3	4
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	I wasn't sure what to expect from HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. As the novels progressively become darker, I had assumed that the movie would be darker, too. I also figured that unlike the first two movies, there would be a great deal of detail left out. Other than that I didn't know.My presumptions proved accurate. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a much darker movie that its predecessors and there is a great deal from the novel that is left out. However, neither of these two elements really make the movie any less enjoyable. A movie and a novel are two completely different types of storytelling and with a book that's well over 300 pages, there's no way to film the book scene by scene, unless you make a mini-series. Overall, the movie version of PRISONER OF AZKABAN stays faithful to the spirit of the novel. It condenses a few events to speed up the pace of storytelling and it leaves many happenings completely out, but the meat of the story is left intact.In AZKABAN, we find the Harry is just slightly more respected by his Aunt and Uncle. However, in a fit of rage, Harry lets loose a little magic and turns his aunt into an overflated human balloon. Harry knows he's messed up big time and takes his belongings and leaves. He's picked up by a magical bus and eventually finds himself back at Hogwarts. Along the way he learns that one of the most notorious criminals in the magical world, Sirius Black, has escaped from the unescapable prison of Azkaban. That's news itself, but what's even bigger news and something that Harry doesn't learn until later, is that Sirius Black is coming for Harry. Add in some horrifying indifferent magic guards, a few fights with Harry's school enemies, a little time travel, and a few werecreatures and you've got the set up for the best part of the Harry Potter series so far.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN will probably be the movie that fans of the books will enjoy the least, especially since it leaves out so much detail. However, as a movie, it's probably the best of the bunch. The actors get actually get a chance to act this time around. Unfortunately, that's also the only major flaw of the film. There is so much stuff going on and certain events that have to unfold to keep the continuity of the story going that we don't get to see much character development at all--we're presented with a wonderful cast of characters with a hugely talented cast, but we really don't get to know any of the characters better. Perhaps that will happen as the movies progress. Anyway, though this might be the film that Harry Potter fans will probably enjoy the least, this is also the film that as a movie works the best.	4.0	Great Film Adaptation	2004-08-18	1	1	0

As an avid fan of the book series I was more than a little disappointed at Chris Columbus' attempts at adapting them into film. The first movie had its charms--Daniel Radcliff was a wonderful actor for his age and evoked a great deal of empathy; the sets were colorful and the characters appealing. Dumbledore was spot-on. But it was nothing compared to the book. Just a cookie-cutter imitation.'Chamber of Secrets' was appalling. Slow, stilted...too much time spent on dialogue to explain things rather than letting the audience draw its own conclusion. Too much added for the sake of a cheap Hollywood thrill. The scene where the Basilisk is blinded but ""hears"" Harry is ludicrous. Snakes sense heat and vibration--throwing a rock in the opposite direction would not have saved Harry from a serpent that was only inches from his face. This scene was NOT in the book and should have been left out of the film. The only good points in this film were the young actors--especially Rupert Grint who shone as comedic relief.'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a far superior film not because it records every small plot detail that is in the books (something Columbus strove to do). That is impossible at worst...unnecessary at best. No, what Cuaron did was to capture the essence of the book; the spirit; the struggle of growing up and discovering that your world isn't what you once thought. This film cut out all of the unneeded parts (yes, yes, Pigwidgeon was charming, but did we really NEED him in this film?) and it kept to the point: Harry returns to school to discover that a murderer has vowed revenge on him--and that the murderer is his godfather who helped to murder his parents 12 years before. All that protects Harry are his wits, the skills taught to him by his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...and a series of hideous new school guards who may well do more to harm than to help Hogwarts students.I've noticed that many of the negative reviews are coming from younger viewers--that the main complaint is that ""important parts"" are being left out of the film. Perhaps the problem is that some people don't realize that the real focus of the book was not Quiddich or magic spells--or even a murderer in disguise--but instead the minefield that is adolescence. For those who haven't experienced being a teenager I can see that it might be more difficult to understand the changes made. But for an older Potter fan--or anyone who just enjoys a slightly darker fantasy story--this film is a winner. No wonder J.K. Rowling has said it is her favorite film--and the most faithful to her vision."	5.0	Finally, a director who understands the series...	2005-02-11	7	5	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2OCJNB6B46OKP	"Underground Reborn ""gnome"""	Things are getting darker in the world of wizarding world. 12 years after the dark lord Voldemort disappeared, his loyal followers were tracked down and locked away in Azkaban, the most secure of wizard prisons...or so it was. Now the most feared and dangerous of these prisoners, Sirius Black as escaped and is after none other than 13 year old Harry Potter. While all those who are true to Harry stay close to make sure he is safe Harry can only wonder who this dark soul is and why he is not only out kill him, but the painful fact that links him to the death of Harrys parents.This book is still the fan favorite of the Harry Potter saga, but it surley is the worst of the movies thus far. Don't get me wrong there are some great moments in the movie as well as some great new actors that joined the cast. Gary Oldman was chosen to play Sirius Black and eventhough he is only on screen for the last half hour of the movie he never ceases to amaze with an absolutaly stellar performance. That and the acting of Emma Thompson and comic releif of Rupert Grint is why this movie actully got two stars.What ruined the movie was surley the adaptation of the book to film because it was all out of order the only part that was perfect was the time travel which takes up almost 45 minutes of the movie. The new director Alfonso Curion really focused on Harry and barley any of the other characters. It was as if all the bonds of all the supporting cast memebers were stripped away only so Harry and the new memebers of the cast could have their day in the sun. This is also the shortest of all the movies. I am sure the fans would not have minded an extra 20-30 minutes of movie to watch, especially if it was a scene with the Hogwarts Quiddith Cup finals.Now with the 4th instalment on its way I am hoping that Columbus and the crew learn from their mistakes and if they want to cut out a few things for the sake of cinema and potty breaks they better learn from the disaster that 'Prisoner of Azkaban turned out to be.	2.0	Give This Prisoner The Death Penalty!

Personally, I saw it three times in theaters and would gladly see it again. It is so astoundingly well-made, it outshines even the previous two Harry Potter films, both of which translated the novels to the screen in a nearly flawless manner; save that the Chamber of Secrets did not have half enough Snape screentime. Alfonso Cauron did an absolutely amazing job making this movie.Daniel, Emma, and Rupert are noticably improving in their acting skills with age. All the kids look dramatically different in this film, not surprisingly, particularly Draco and Neville Longbottom.The story flows from one part to the next so seamlessly that one doesn't even notice it is over two and a half hours in length. It is far more moving than the first two, with the Buckbeak execution scene and the Shrieking Shack scene standing out as poignant, suspenseful, and/or sad.Our new Dumbledore is someone I feel we'll get used to. After all, the cast change couldn't exactly be helped! He struck me as looking very much like the old Albus, but was perhaps a bit too gruff.Lupin, Sirius, Peter Pettigrew, and other new characters like Madame Rosemarta and Professor Trelawney (ESPECIALLY Professor Trelawney) were very well-cast. As always, Alan Rickman was the greatest aspect of the movie; his daunting, shadowy, compelling portrayal of the irresistible Severus Snape once again steals the entire show. One can only wait for the next time he enters the scene. His amazing voice during the Shreiking Shack scene, hallway scene with the Marauder's Map, and the delicious ""How disappointing"" and ""page 394"" really incite shivers and, if you're like me, melting.But on the whole, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a sure sign that the Potter movies are, like the books, only going to get better from here on out.

Miller	If you want your Harry Potter movies to be all about Quidditch and cute children, then this movie is not for you.  If you were disappointed with the first two movies, and felt that they were watered down, family friendly nods to mediocrity, then this will be your favorite Potter movie to date.The beauty of the Potter series lies in it's ability to work on two levels-one that is simple enough to engage smaller children and another that is complicated and layered enough in theme and content to absorb adults.  The first director neglected this concept-the second does not.  It may be said that this is partly due to the content of the first books, and the immaturity of the children themselves.  But in this movie the children are growing and realizing that evil is not always obvious and the good guys can be smelly and dirty and unpleasant. Dementors are created with true evil and fright in mind and Harry is allowed to be somewhat frustrated and cranky and very much like a real human boy trying to handle impending maturity and the fate of the world on his shoulders.  Hermione and Ron emerge as real people, not just plot devices and foils planted to enhance Harry's star quality.  The new director, and sadly not the next director, focused on the inherent darkness in the series and therefore made the light in them all the more tangible and true.  Kudos.  I just hope the next director, handling the teen years of Harry and the gang, will remember that heroes without a dark side are not heroes at all.	5.0	Naysayers Be Silenced!	2004-09-03	8	4	4

The castle couldn't have looked nicer for the setting of the story. The creature effects look terrific. When you see Harry riding Buckbeak over the lake, you can see the CG creature's reflection as clearly as the creation itself. Wonderful cinematography. A much darker tone that begins to illustrate what the audience should expect for movies 4 and 5. Thewlis and Oldman are perfect for there roles as Lupin and Black.You also have Williams' last hoorah in Harry Potter with a wonderfully medieval score. The story never really wavers despite some of the parts of the book that never took place. Fortunately, Cuaron's pace isn't as rushed as The Goblet of Fire, but is workable and gives the fans of the books something to enjoy still.The only three negative things I have to say is that there were two parts that should not have been taken away. First was the discusion of Moony, Padfoot, Tonks and Wormtail and their relationship. Second, the whole purpose of the Patronus was taken away because Harry's real reason for learning the charm was to stop dementors while playing Quidditch. I would have liked to see the match where Harry scares Malfoy away with the Patronus. I am very personally against Gambon as Dumbledore because he lacks the charm that Dumbledore in the books has and what Sir Richard Harris brough to his performances. I would have preferred Sir Ian McKellen or someone else though I can't think who.	4.0	I Guess I'm a  Prisoner of the Book	2007-08-08	3	3	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2A17RPMI8FO34	"Vegas Girl ""524"""	I wasn't at all a fan of the HARRY POTTER franchise because I was lead to believe that these stories were strictly for children.  On a lark I went to see HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and thought it was brilliant!  I even got the director's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN in joke(naughty boy).  But what made it more appealing was that there was more depth in the characters, it seemed to me that more was at stake, emotionally.  The dementors in particular were frightening.  I still can't believe I was under the impression that these books are for children.  I think they are more about children rather than for children. I have since read the third book and still say the director and the screenwriter (the same for the past two movies) were spot on with their adaptation.  What really impressed me were the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, very much improved since the last two films and I hope they are around for the conclusion of the series of films.  I hope that these two actors continue with their careers after this franchise is over.  I have read books four and five and am chomping at the bit for book six to come out.  If it weren't for how good this third movie was, I wouldn't even have bothered trying to know more about the Harry Potter universe.  I'm converted and am trying to get as many of my adult friends converted too!  Great film and books for children and adults!I just recently rewatched the movie on the big screen and I stick to my original thoughts that is was a FANTASTIC movie.  The pacing was faster, the stakes were higher for the characters, and the adventure more sweeping.  I have read the third book and the main two things that are missing are the references to the Marauder's, which I've heard would be covered in a different film, the extended arguments between Ron and Hermione, and the significance of Crookshanks (which I feel works in the book better, if presented in a movie, it would have seemed too contrived).I hope that this film in the series gets some recognition *hem hem* Best Adapted Screenplay *hem hem*.  For a movie about 2 1/2 hours long is flows pretty quickly with an intriguing plot and characters.  This is a MUST SEE in the series.	5.0	This is the one that made me want to know more!	2004-09-05	7	4	3

Hey, I know, let's get rid of Christopher Columbus and hire the director of some Mexican soft porn movie to direct The Prisoner of Azkaban. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?There are so many things I didn't like about this movie but most of them have been mentioned several times already so I will try and get to my point as best I can.I didn't hate it because it was ""darker"".I didn't hate it because they left out so much of the book.I can forgive the drastic and unneccessary changes in scenery... actually no I can't, I take that back.In the end, it was the absence of magic that left me cold and on the outside looking in on a story that could have been so much more.

The kids worked perfectly and their acting was far more better than in the first two movies.  The plot of the movie includes all the main elements of the book and that is great.  The only thing I didn't like is the visual aspect of the movie. Cuar&oacute;n's Hogwarts is not the same from the previous movies.  Sets may be the same, but they are not in the same places as in the other 2 movies.  Costumes are poor and lost their elegance.  Nice touch having Harry's hair all messed up, now it is like in the books.  All this doesn't make the movie a bad one.

I have seen this film three times now and each time I watch it I amazed at how much Alfonso Cuaron has done with the material Chris Columbus left him.  Cuaron guided his more mature child actors to truly lead the film.  Everyone, for the most part, seems to know and understand their parts and the layers of complexity that are within its source material.  Cuaron knew it at least and brought out the best installment of the series.I just wish someone had thought of including some of the key factors involving the Marauder's Map and it's link to James Potter's group of mischeivous troublemakers.Otherwise the special effects and tone of the movie is pitch perfect.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2KU5PG32H7QBN	"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic"""	"All that really needs to be said is that Cuaron has turned what could have been just another literal adaptation of the novel into an intelligent, artistic meditation on adolescence in the Wizarding world while still maintaining a true sense of fun and magic.Age is a huge factor in this installation to the Harry Potter series. The main characters Harry, Ron and Hermione are all 13, and Cuaron fills the film with references to how real teenagers act. For instance, at the beginning of the movie, we see Harry under his covers playing with his wand hoping with every fiber of his being that he doesn't get caught. And as Newsweek clearly pointed out, this is a subtle reference to masturbation, a private practice common among young teenagers (don't let that ward you away from taking your children, they won't know). Another example would be Hermione and Ron's attraction to eachother mentioned slightly in two or three scenes. It's quite touching. And, yes, as teenagers reach the age of 13, that's when the hormones are raging, and that's what Cuaron needed to explore. But the most obvious of the references is Harry himself, longing for a father figure; acting troublesome.  I was truly captivated by the film's realism.Walking into the theater, I hoped Cuaron would say with this film, ""Yes, they're Wizards. But according to the story, they live in the same world as we do. So it's only logical to assume they have the same feelings, emotions and tendencies that 'muggles' have.""  And that messege, to my delight, was perfectly conveyed.I applaud Cuaron for injecting the film with an honesty that would have been absent under former director Chris Columbus' watch.If you are not a fan of fantasy, you may want to stray away.  And the movie may be a bit scarier than the other two installments to the Harry Potter series.  But overall, I think it is a great family Friday-night flick."	4.0	I recommend this to everyone.

Couch ""zombie fan of doom"""	Now I already know this will likely be one of the top 3 grossing movies this year if not the first however that doesn't mean it's going to be one of the best three.I just saw it yesterday and it left me... wanting.  I have very mixed feelings about this film as did the people with me.  I started reading the books after the first film came out and this book is tied with the 5th one for my fave.  It's darker, it shows a new element in the story and more importantly a new mystery that at least for one year side steps Vol... er... you know who... I have been afraid of seeing this movie since I heard it was comming out due to the increase in length.  2 hours and 19 minutes just doesn't give the viewer enough time to see the whole story.  The book added about 100 pages over the last and the movie didn't get particularly longer.  Basically... there are big holes and no explanations given for things like the book was able to deliver.  I didn't feel the closure one should feel at the end of the movie.  I'm hopeing the DVD will have enough bonus stuff to show that they did film it just had to cut it or something.  The movie never explained Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prong... um... ok... lets just let lupin walk out the door.  Some of the most clever writing in the book was omited for time in the film.The good side of the film in my oppinion was that the director did well at giving us a fresh and dark image to look apon and that was nessisary for this darker story line... There's also the obvious fact that when you have a great story to begin with half the work of a great movie is done for you.  I loved the movie, just wish they had made it longer so we the audience wouldn't get slighted in subplot.  (I advise anyone who has never read the book to do so, you'll understand things a little better in the end)	4.0	Mixed feelings	2004-06-09	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AFYDMJ541G4K4	Wella Bean	After watching the movie and reading all the reviews I felt I had to write a review.  The movie was not made for the children that are the loyal fans of the Harry Potter books.  Infact most young children would be frightened by this movie.  It was more of a horror flick instead of a Harry Potter movie.  The movie was not true to the book.  As other reviewers have noted the castle and Hagrid's hut have changed.  When you are watching the movie you feel like you are some how in the wrong movie because it does not look familiar.  It was a disappoint for anyone who loves the books and wanted to see them put onto the screen as they were written.  The first 2 movies felt right because they were true to the books.  They, as one reviewer put it, matched the images the books created in your head as you read the books.  The 3rd movie was a jumble of unfamiliar scenes and familiar characters who were not put together correctly.  The underlying story was not the same as the book because major bits of information were left out or moved to different times in the book.  The head master was played by a new actor who lacked the aged wisdom and seriousness that the character showed in the books and in the previous actor.  The new actor seems more comic than wise.  It felt really wrong.  I really hope they fix this problem in the next movie. As the reviews showed older viewer seemed to enjoy the movie more because of its faster pace and more horror flick feel but the true Harry Potter fans were not happy with the new look and feel of this movie.  Harry, Ron and Hermoine need to be dressed in school robes not blue jeans.  That was weird.  I think I was so caught up in the fact that the sets changed and the clothes were wrong that I could not enjoy the film.If you want to see Harry Potter's world as written in JK Rowlings books don't buy this movie but if you are into more of a Horror flick Harry Potter than this movie is for you.	1.0	Where was JK Rowlings when this movie was made?	2004-11-11	36	13	23
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1X0YGLECBQ4H7	Wharton	"Cuaron definitely has added a new touch to the film series, but in a good way. This can easily be seen with the new music, the new camera shots, and the beautiful transitions from one scene to another. So far as the story goes Cuaron has elliminated much of the book keeping only the most vital and dramatic parts in the screenplay. In bringing such a leignthy book to the screen this would be quite neccisary. However I think that he could have given himself a little bit more running time so as not to leave out vital septology clues and information and so as not to make the film feel so rushed -- even moreso than either of the first two.The special effects are quite advanced for the most part. I think I was most disappointed in what I would have though would have been an extremely easy ""special effect"" to bring to the screen: Peter Petegrew. While the actor gives quite an extraordinay performance it is slightly over done and not how I really envisioned it reading the book. Gollum's acting ""The Lord of the Rings"" was much more believable. The other special effect that, while rendered nicely, just wasn't how I imagined it was the werewolf. (Like many imaginary creatures, I guess it is impossible to please everyone.)The rest of the acting is quite satisfactory allong with the other aspects of the film. (The cinematography was particularly stunning though.)OVERALL I would highly recommend the film to anyone, even if they are not a huge Harry Potter fan. Unlike the first two, the director has made this film a film in and of itself that can be enjoyed alone without the reading of the book and without the knowing of the story."	4.0	Excellent, but a little rushed	2004-06-08	0	0	0

This movie succeeded at completely ruining my hope that the HP series could effectively be laid out on screen.The books themselves are good, I don't care what anyone says. They have something, something that just makes you enjoy reading and uncovering all you can about the characters. When hearing that they would be made into movies, I kind of raised an eyebrow. Books like this couldn't be recreated on film, I thought.The first movie ended up silencing some of my complaints. It wasn't great or anything, but upon leaving the theater you could feel that the show at least tapped into the so-called magic the book creates. Things were portrayed quite nice, and fell about as in tune to the book as I could expect.Never saw all the second movie but it seemed okay. It was when I popped in the third installment that I hung my head.Its laughable. There is no doubt that directors changed, as the golden glow of Columbus and the childlike joy and wonder he brings out through the actors is gone. Its like when the third Home Alone came out - new director copying old ideas, and the show tanked. Replacing rich colors and magic atmospheres is cold blacks and absolutely worthless scene transitions that I guess are supposed to be ""artistic"". Gone is the feeling of aged wisdom in the adults at Hogwarts (perhaps, in part, because the actor who played Dumbledore died - he just couldn't be replaced, as he played it as perfect as anyone could want), and also gone is the feeling of mysterious alure of the castle itself. In this show, key locations and sets were changed, and the little treasures of set design that made the first two shows vanished.The actors were there but it felt like their passion to play the parts had left. Everything was glossed up, Hollywood style, but even so the viewer can see through to the loss of onscreen magic.I'm sorry to say it, but it looks like the series - of movies, that is - is going nowhere but downhill."	1.0	Ugh	2004-11-24	19	12	7

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1BS8YM712C0VJ	Will Culp	Released in 2004, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the Third movie in a series of seven Harry Potter movies based on the novels by J.K. Rowling.After the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets alongside The Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter was once again on TVs everywhere, and clogging up the very arteries of Pop Culture, to the point that religious figures were debating if it was anti-christian in its good portrayal of Witches and Warlocks. But unfortuneatly, after the release of The Chamber of Secrets, two very beloved people vital in making the movie departed, beloved Director Christopher Columbus and the world-renound actor Richard Harris. To compensate for their losses, the Harry Potter team went up and rounded up Director Alfonso Cuaron, famous for directing movies such as Great Expections, and Albus Dumbledore's role was reprised by none other than Michael Gambon. With all the loose ends intact, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was up and running, with all the previous actors from the first two movies all reprising their roles, including Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe. Based on the novel of the same name, this movie takes a slightly darker and more mature tone than the last few, showing Harry's growing maturity and teenage angst, combined with the wraith-like Dementors and werewolfs getting a few clips. Don't think that these things would scare off children though, in fact, I didn't find anything to be scary AT ALL, and I just noticed those things different than the first two movies. So does Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban fully justify the terrific book of the same name? Read on to find out!Plot-At the start of the movie we meet Harry with his always-vile guardians, the Dursleys. But even worse, Aunt Marge is coming over, who is a cruel, irratable, and rather-large woman who maddens Harry so much that he uses his magic to blow her up into a human balloon. Frustrated with his life at the Dursleys, Harry goes out onto the streets to search for a new home with all his worldy belongings, but soon he is picked up by the Knight Bus, a bus invisible to muggles that carries lost wizards to their destinations. Soon after, Harry finds himself at the Leaky Cauldron, and he awaits to go to Hogwarts. Before going there he soon learns of Sirius Black, a murderous psycho that is the first person to escape from Azkaban, and rumor is, he's after Harry Potter. As Harry departs to school on the train, he soon learns of the Wraith dementors, who suck all the happiness out of you, and Carefree Professor Lupin. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts, Harry is thrust into a world of Deception, betrayal, mystery, happiness, fear, and many other things that make Harry's third year at Hogwarts the most exciting yet, with the inclusion of Sirius Black, Time Travel, Buckbeak, Hogsmeade, Boggarts, Professor Lupin, and the love of friends.Directing, Acting, Other Comments-First off, I must say how happy I am with how well Alfonso Cuaron has handled The Prisoner of Azkaban, with all the scenery and flow of the movie seeming to be on a higher level than the past few movies. The whole atmosphere is a little bit darker, and many things echo that, such as the dreary scenery,the emotions of Harry, and learning trust with those who he can't. The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen, and here are just a few reasons why-The Whomping Willow- As the Seasons pass at Hogwarts, every time this happens it shows the Whomping Willow's reaction to the seasons, for example, during the winter, it is frozen, and during Autumn all the leaves fall off in a big heap. I thought this was very clever and creative.Time Travel- Late in the movie, Harry and Hermoine use a time travel device to put them back in the past, and the way it interacts with the plot line is genoius, and it adds new scenes to the books that are exemplary. Simply superb filmmaking.The Patronus Charm- Late in the movie, Harry Potter and Sirius Black are attacked by hundreds of dementors, and Harry Potter uses his Patronus Charm. This scene is very riveting, as Sirius and Harry are close to death, and a huge Charm the size of a Megatron-Bomb forces the dementors to flee, and it's in the shape of a stag. Simply beautiful!As for acting, everybody retains the charm the first movies had, and the acting is top-notch as usual from this mostly-british cast.Overall, this is a great adaptation for a flawless book, and I was happy to see the new direction in which the Harry Potter movies are going in. The darker and moodier tone perfectly set the stage for The Goblet of Fire, which is much more darker, and in my opinion, the best Harry Potter novel yet, so I'm happy that Cuaron is the one making it. This is a perfect movie for the summer, interesting to kids and adults alike, and a must-see for the fans of the books.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO SEE A GREAT MOVIE OR IS A FAN OF THE BOOK, PRISONER OF AZKABAN IS PERFECT FOR YOU! MY FAVORITE OF THE FIRST THREE, IT IS A NEAR PERFECT ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK, BUT NOTHING COULD CAPTURE THE MAGIC OF THE NOVEL!Also Recommended:The Return Of The Kings- Lord of the RingsThe Chamber of Secrets- Harry PotterDouble Trouble- Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen(Just Kidding)Thanks for reading!	5.0	The best entry in the Harry Potter series yet......	2004-06-21	5	3	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HPB00OVR5KVO	William C. Metcalf	"When I first saw the movie in the theater, I was unhappy with how the story line was treated.  But, after repeated viewings of the DVD version, I have come to see the logic behind this version and find myself even more amused by what is seen in this movie.  It does keep to the general story line as put forth originally in the books, but as is explained in the second disc of this set, some things just had to be omitted for cimeographic reasons.With the above in mind, this two disc set is an excellent transfer of the original movie.  It also outdoes the first two movies by the fact that it has interviews with J.K. Rowling, the director and actors of this movie.  I have qualms with the games as found in the second disc, but being that I'm ""over the age of 13"" (way too over!), I probably am not the best to comment on them.As with the original Harry Potter books, this movie makes me eager for the rest of the sequels to come out.  No, this movie isn't an exact carbon copy of the book, but if that is what one is expecting, you'll be very dissapointed.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3HP9JNRHOA5CW	William James Taylor IV	"As I said in my review of the second film, the real problem with Chris Columbus was not that he tried to be faithful to the books, it was that he didn't have the talent to pull it off. So after enduring the crappy 2nd film (which managed to be worse than the book, which itself was not too good), the Potter film franchise is given a much needed shot in the arm thanks to hiring of a real director, Alfonso Cuaron, who, despite still being saddled with that idiot screenwriter Steve Kloves, succeeds where Columbus would have fallen flat on his face.Perhaps we shouldn't be surprise that the best of Rowling's books proved to be the best of the films.Which is not to say that the film is not without flaws. The films continue to pointlessly butcher Ron into a stupid, cry baby coward instead of portraying him as the loyal, funny, protective friend that he was in the books, and Rupert Grint's inability to act doesn't help. Exactly why the filmmakers feel they must ruin Ron, and why JK herself allows them to ruin Ron, is unclear. While the original book showed Ron defending Hermione from Snape and, in one of his all time greatest moments, stood up the an alleged killer declaring that he would have to be killed as well if it meant defending Harry, but the first moment is changed to Ron agreeing with Snape after Snape insulted Hermione - which makes no sense following previous events that would have him growing more protective of her, not less, and also screws with the so called romance brewing between them. And who gets to say ""If you want to kill Harr you'll have to kill us too!""? Hermione! That's right, once again, Kloves screws Ron while blowing Hermione way out of proportion, apparently unaware that he is ruining the balance between the trio and making it impossible to believe that Ron and Hermione have romantic feelings for each other. The films never portray Hermione and Ron as having a bond that is developing beyond friendship, and despite so called ""extra hints"" that ""foreshadow"" their love, Ron and Hermione merely come off as two stupid brats who want nothing to do with each other while lacking the romantic undercurrent that charged up the sparks between Hepburn & Tracy as well as Han Solo & Princess Leia. Do you think that Princess Leia would have fallen in love with Han Solo if Han constantly acted like a stupid, effeminate, inarticulate, weak willed coward who's scared of everything - including his own shadow? Hell no. Han wasn't always gallant, but he was never stupid nor cowardly; he also had the guts and the quick thinking, which in the end is what drew Leia to him. While he's not exactly Beowulf or Hercules, or even Aquaman, what is supposed to make Ron redeeming to Hermione is that he's clearly not as dumb as he occasionally appears to be and he's clearly a brave guy, otherwise, he wouldn't have landed in Gryffindor along with the rest of his family. Sadly, it appears that none of the filmmakers involved here, not even Alfonso Cuaron, easily the best of them, really understand that, and they apparently have no idea of how to portray the relationship between Ron and Hermione; they just expect the audience to go along with it figuring that most of them have read the books, so they put little to no effort into making it believable. They don't even try to include the moments that JK Rowling herself used to demonstrate the ever changing relationship with Hermione & Ron; in fact, they have the nerve to throw out those moments and come up with their own crap, but their crap only comes out as superficial and insincere. Meanwhile, Hermione, as played by Emma Watson, continues to move away from the bookworm we knew in the novel to a shallow, ""so cool & charming she's girl power"" twit. (Since when does Hermione cackle at Ron, fret over her hair, wear a pink hoodie with a rainbow belt, has the strength of Rocky Balboa that allows her to punch Draco down rather than just slap him, and show up looking dirty blonde instead of frizzy brown?).Ron deserved better.Adding insult to injury, while it may not have been intentional on the part of the filmmakers, is that Hermione and Harry, who are presented as sharper and more focused, which is somewhat true even in the books, come across as having much more chemistry between the two of them than Hermione does with Ron, and at the end, they are even shown mocking him, once again throwing the balance of the trio out of whack because we don't see that Hermione also has a tendency to annoy Harry even though they're friends. Maybe Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe just have a natural chemistry with each other, but this also screws with the audiences because the film versions of Hermione & Harry seem to play so well off each other that it seems they are the ones destined to be together, as opposed to Hermione being with Ron (this will also make it even more difficult when trying to sell the audience on the concept of Harry's future romance with Ginny in ""Half-Blood Prince""). When Hermione reaches out to a distraught Harry at Hogsmeade and flashes her big brown eyes to him, while Ron keeps his distance, you half expect Hermione to embrace Harry and give him a kiss. When Harry and Hermione are alone in the Forbidden Forest, you half expect Harry to rip Hermione's clothes off and make love to her (their lovemaking would probably be spoiled by the arrival of either the Lupin wolf or the Dementors). I know this probably wasn't intentional, but the filmmakers don't seem to understand that they're giving off the wrong impression to audiences.Despite these unfortunate changes, star Daniel Radcliffe finally begins to show us just how good an actor he's becoming - he's easily the best of the three, striking the right balance between his serious and light hearted moments without going over the top like his co-stars. Radcliffe works very well with both David Thewlis, in the role of Lupin, and Gary Oldman, in the role of Sirius Black. It's too bad that Radcliffe was not given more of a chance to interact with the new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, a fellow Irishman chosen to the replace the late Richard Harris, who's life & career sadly ended with the last clunker.Cuaron's stronger sense of pacing and visual narrative along with characterization also become apparent in his handling of the action pieces and atmospheric moments of fear. I sincerely hope that he returns to direct either the sixth or seventh installment."	5.0	Again, simply the best	2006-07-01	2	1	1
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RDS7ZMZEJLNF	William McCleft	"This new chronicle in the Harry Potter sequence is nowhere near worthy of the rosy ratings of most reviews because of two simple reasons.The first of these is the acting.  I feel that the actors preformed their parts well, but I have several major qualms with the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, about his choices for the portrayal of the characters.  The first major flop was Dumbledore.  The actor played the part well, and retained the look and sound of the old Dumbledore, but the lines and intonation were appalling.  The literary purpose of Dumbledore is as a source of safety and comfort for Harry, but this movie lost all of that.  The primary problem was that Dumbledore lost all of his appeal to the audience because he no longer retains that indelible Dumbledore quality of warmth.  He was brisk, snappish, and terse in his addresses to the students, and this is a serious departure from the caring and deep Dumbledore we met in the first two movies.  The theatrical lighting also enhanced this new image: the first two movies had a great deal of yellow and orange light, while the color swatch for this was more toward the cooler colors such as blue.  The other acting difficulty is apparent by even looking at a poster for the movie; Harry is no longer the central character.  After seeing this film, I came away with the impression that Hermione had achieved dominance in the film titled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  This is but one of the two major reasons that this movie is barely worthy of two stars out of five.The other reason that this movie disappoints me is the content.  While I have to admit that all of the sequences shown in the movie were very good, it is what is not shown that is the most distressing.  The Harry Potter books have a unique charm resulting from Rowling's phenomenal ability to characterize, the intense reality of the world she weaves, and her ability to build a plot rich with intrigues out of minor supporting details.  And her characterizations often occur alongside her sublime plot details, which only add to her skill as a writer.  But this movie only barely manages to capture the world she wrought in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and loses the plot entirely.  Too many things were left out, many of which left viewers puzzled.  For example, when Lupin revealed to Potter that he knew how to use the Marauder's Map, none of the characters batted an eyelash.  Moreover, the entire subplot about Harry's father was omitted; this included who ""Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, Prongs"" were, the fact that they were all Animagi, or wizards who can transform into animals, or why Harry's patronus was a stag.  I feel that this is likely connected to Harry no longer being a central character in the movie bearing his name.  Overall, I feel that this movie strays dangerously close to what Christopher Coloumbus alluded to wanting to do with the Harry Potter series, take all the action sequences from all the books, and combine them into a single movie.In conclusion, I feel that this film seriously undermines the characters and mutilates the plot.  By changing the character focus and leaving out central story elements, this movie not only poorly portrays this book, but also changes things so considerably that it will be a huge hurdle to recover from these blunders in the Harry Potter movies to come."	2.0	A Brutally Honest Crtique	2005-05-14	11	8	3

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2T14I4WE5L6GP	Willow	"Okay, I love, love, love the Harry Potter books. So much that I was not planning on seeing any of the movies. But we watched the first one in school one day, and then you know the rest. I saw the second, and then counted down the days until HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN came out in theatres.The second the movie starts (heck, you could tell from the previews), you know this movie is going to be a lot different than the previous two. It's a lot darker, and the new director seems to add some more realism to the movie (no, I'm not crazy. But something about the first two movies felt so...fake, whereas this movie felt a little more realistic) - I think its because the kids are in normal clothes most of the movie, instead of their Hogwarts robes. I personally liked the change, but I know a ton of people that didn't.Anyway. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the best book in the series (so far, anyway), introducing a new character to the readers (and watchers, too). Sirius Black, the ""bad guy"" of the movie. He just escaped from Azkaban and he's coming after Harry. Because he wants to kill Harry Potter, and because he's just an all-around bad guy, Azkaban sends some of their guards - the Dementors - to Hogwarts to make sure that Sirius Black doesn't hurt anyone. The Dementors were one of the best additions to this film: creepy, yet not creepy enough to scare anyone. The idea behind them is a lot scarier than the way they look.HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a great movie - the best out of the three, if you ask me. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but all of them are, because the series keeps growing. Anyway, this movie is darker than the first two, with less comedic relief (though we still have Ron and the Weasley twins to come in with a few really good jokes/one-liners at just the right moments) and a generally more depressing feel to it. But you expect changes with a new director. Yes, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was different, and you know what? The next one probably will be too, because there's going to be another new director.My favorite out of the three - highly recommended.Overall grade - A+"	5.0	Better than the first two movies, though some disagree	2004-11-25	5	3	2
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	I have enjoyed all 3 Harry Potter movies, but a warnign to parents with small children: view the movie before letting smaller children watch it. The Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the scariest and darkest of the 3 movies (not that I consider the other 2 scary or dark). The Dementors scared me, a little old 37 year old, and they are sure to send small children to bed with nightmares.With that said, the Prisoner of Azkaban does justice to the book. I feel that the movie does Harry Potter justice in form and feel. Obviously you cannot capture the entirety of a book in a 2 hour movie; they are different medium. But I do believe the movie is as compelling and fun as the book.The actors are spot on. In fact, as I read the books I can't help but picture the actors from the movies. They are convincing, lovable and memorable. Especially Hagrid!I don't know how the rest of the series will turn out, but they compliment each other as well as can be expected. Each adds a new dimension to the other.	5.0	Great, But Not For Real Young Children	2005-08-02	0	0	0

Jamison"""	"I have only watched the DVD four times since I bought it last week. This is after watching it three times in the theater and reading the book twice, and listening to it once. So I am not a fan, at least not as much a fan as maybe two or three other people in the world! I am very interested in using this and the books to contrast the differences each art form makes on the audience. (Can you say ""audience"" for a book?) There are some basics. The advantage of the movie over the book: it takes hours less time go from start to finish. The impact of the visual stimuli coupled with the music is tremendously powerful. The disadvantage: same. The advantage of the DVD over the movie: you can watch it on your terms. Disadvantage? None depending on the equipment used. I have tried it on a small lap top, large PC screen, and HDTV projector. (Dogs bark and you have to let them out and so on, but is this a disadvantage?) There is an advantage to the soundtrack CD over the DVD: it takes even less time from start to finish. It sounds like the advantage goes with the less time it takes to enjoy JKR's imagination when a big concern -- the real issue for most of us, is how much time you can afford to spend in JKR's imaginary world when we don't really have time turners of our own. Question: apart from the pecuniary value in all of this, (how much wealth has been transferred here?) are there any costs associated with the use of words like ""Muggle"" or phrases like ""Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!""? Has there been any thought to using these movies as part of the media blitz in the Middle East? What happened to Nearly Headless? Agreed: the explanation scene between Harry and Dumbledore is important. What happens if the movies get too movieish? Worst: no time line for HP6?In short, the books are wonderful, the movies are wonderful, the music is wonderful on its own, so all of these offerings are absorbing and entertaining, so if you have the time to be entertained why not be entertained by the best? But a serious question remains that posed by Neil Postman in his book ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" and Allan Bloom's ""The Closing of the American Mind"" both of which suggest the visual art form of movies (and TV especially) are harmful in the big picture. Pierre Bourdieu also riled against the media (""On Television"") Which do you think is going to win over the minds and hearts of our children -- movies or books?

I love the books and I enjoyed the first 2 Harry Potter movies.  However, this 3rd movie installment is not even in the same league as the first two movies...IT IS MUCH BETTER!!  It stands on its own as a really well done movie.  The plot is great and more mature, the acting is superb (much better the the earier movies, and the special effects continue to amaze.  My whole family (from 7 to 60) all enjoyed the movie (and in three weeks, we've seen it twice).Of course the movie can not cover everything in the book, and the next two moive installements will be cover less as the books have gotten longer.  It is important to begin to remember that books and movies are two distict mediums for entertainment.  We avid Harry Potter fans are lucky that both books and movies can be of such high quality.  The movies need to be judged on their merits as a movie, not as a clone from the book.  I will continue to enjoy both for the distict qualities that they have to offer and hope the the new movies continue the high quality that ""Prisonier"" has soon us.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AD0Q0C1X0YD0Y	W. Miskin	I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, and as the third book is my favorite I had been counting down the days until the movie came out. However, while the general plot line was followed, I was bothered by the things that were changed or added. There's an obvious sexual undertone to this movie that is completely absent from the book-these kids are still only 13. I was disappointed by the lack of respect for the JK Rowling version, let's face it, the woman can write, and she's captured millions all over the world. I loved both the first and second movie as they did remain true to the book. There's a difference between leaving out less significant plot lines (such as the roosters in the second) and actually altering the way the scenes are played out. I was especially disappointed by the way Harry found out about Sirius's betrayal, and the scene at the Shrieking Shack. These scenes are the most powerful in the entire book in my opinion, yet they were haphazardly put together and didn't carry enough information. I would hope that the DVD has some additional deleted scenes, something like the LOTR extended versions, that may satisfy many fans. I understand the &quot;director's interpretation&quot; excuse, but come on. The acting was superb, but the magic of Hogwarts and Harry Potter got left back in the first two movies. This movie became a story about a boy who wanted to avenge his dead parents, and just happened to know some magic. The magic that IS Harry Potter, the way that JK Rowling writes, was overlooked completely. I felt that this movie did not do this incredible book justice.	3.0	Good, but not great	2004-08-01	4	4	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A303AR58MOOYAV	"Woofboy ""Woofboy"""	This is the best Harry Potter movie yet.  I read the book for the Sorcerer's Stone, and then enjoyed the movie since I read the book before I saw it.  Then when the Chamber of Secrets came out, I never got around to reading that book.  I didn't enjoy that movie as much.  I figured it was because I didn't read the book.  Then the Prisoner of Azkaban came out and since I didn't read the book, I wasn't planing on seeing it in theatres.  Needless to say, I did see it since I didn't have much better to do, and I liked it a lot more than the first and second Harry Potter movies.It was about Harry's third year at Hogwarts when he finds out that his godfather (who was accused of killing Harry's parents) escapes from Askaban prison.  He was the first person ever to escape from the prison, and it was thought that he would come and kill Harry to get rid of all of the Potters.  The Guards of Askaban called Dementors come to Hogwarts to search for Harry's Godfather, and other stuff happens which I won't say since I don't want to ruin the movie that much.Some good things about the movie...  Only one short Quiddish scene.  Thank goodness for not having the numerous long and boring quiddish scenes like in the previous two movies.  It had some good allusions too.  When watching the movie listen to the peoples names and watch what they turn into (you may not get it if you don't know about space or animal's scientific names).  And best of all, it was an original story.  My biggest problem with the Chamber of Secrets was that it was too much like the Sorcerer's Stone.I would talk about the bad stuff in the movie, but I won't because when I read a review that talks about bad stuff before I see a movie, that gets stuck in my head.

I love the Harry Potter books and I enjoyed the first two movies, but the visual style of Prisoner of Azkaban is just wrong.  It is the same visually as the Lemony Snicket movie, and while it may work for that franchise, it doesn't work for Potter.  There are other ways to make a ""darker"" movie, but using that horrible visual style (I don't know if it has a name) isn't the way to do it.  There was a bad balance between indoor and outdoor scenes (too much outdoors).As has been mentioned previously, the new Dumbledore isn't nearly the force that he is on the pages and in the first two films.  I understand the actor who portrayed him has passed away, but the new one is lacking in general bearing.Too many CRUCIAL details were left out of the movie.  I was waiting for someone to mention to Harry that his father and two of his friends deliberately turned themselves into Animagi to support/contain their werewolf friend (Lupin).  No one mentions that his father turned into a stag when he transformed and that's why Harry's Patronus is a stag.  The moviegoer is left in the dark on this fairly juicy piece of info.The McGonagall and Snape characters were a couple of the few high points of the movie.Again, the visual style of the movie just looked cheap, and that coupled with a swiss cheese plot was just too much to overcome."	1.0	Disappointing	2005-07-26	11	9	2

Even when one ignores the fact that no film can ever live up to the book it may be based upon, and that the Prisoner of Azkaban is at least twice the length of the previous two novels; the movie just does not meet the standards set by the previous two movies. To begin, the movie is only about 135mins. in length. This may seem inconsequential at first but please note that each of the other two movies were at least 190mins. in length and ,as I said , the book is twice as long as the other two. This being the case a large amount of the plot was cut as well as crucial information for those in the audience who prefer not to read the books first.My only hope is that somehow they actually filmed many more scenes (or at least a few ) and that these scenes will be available on some sort of Extended Edition DVD a la LOtR because frankly, this movie just does not cut it.	2.0	A Supreme Disappointment.	2004-06-11	8	7	1

Rowling series concerning young Mr. Potter and his place in the wizarding world.  It is important to realize that Film and Print are different mediums and the size of the print volumes ABSOLUTELY prevents a complete and total inclusion of all details, every character and subplot - so don't whine about the choices that were made by the screenwriter and J.

Worth buying without a question, although try not to pay retail, ever.HIGH POINTS: Overall image quality and sound transfer Usual clean, well organized menus on Film Disc Inclusion of ""more than expected"" elements from the book Finally gone to a standard issue DVD case Wonderfully seemless transition of directorial duties that serve the story telling & character growth VERY well.LESSER POINTS: Extras Disc is slightly too ""puzzle"" based and isn't as full as it really should be, frankly, even when you paw your way through it. The cast interviews are a little shallow, but are at least ""something"" over the total absence on Film 1 and the ""skeletons"" on Film 2 There should be more More MORE as far as all the content elements on the Extras Disc including on-location / set and prop and costume sorcery that brought this modern tale to the screen.Peaxe,Rev.

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1Q15TP2FXYYMF	"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo"""	I put this review off for a long time because I wanted to re-read the book before offering final judgment on the movie. I have to admit that I cannot add my name to the supposed list of people hailing Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n as the perfect director for this pivotal film in the Harry Potter series. It is natural that a new director would make changes to redefine the world in his own image, but I think this movie makes far too many changes - I could forgive that, but some of the additions are just, well, silly and wholly unnecessary. J.K. Rowling herself might love the shrunken head on the Knight Bus, but I have no use for it - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is not a comedy, and it does not need the intellectual equivalent of a man doing a pratfall. At Hogwarts, you get ghost horsemen crashing through windows and thumping into the Great Hall. There are a number of similar additions I consider useless at best. Why throw these things in there? It's not like you are starting with a weak story and having to pad the film. Did Cuaron think he needed to add a few silly scenes in order to make the film appeal to children? As if there's a child in Western society who isn't already a rabid Harry Potter fan. And the clothing rubs me the wrong way - rarely do you see the kids in their Hogwarts uniforms in this movie. And speaking of Hogwarts, it looks nothing like it did in the first two films; I kept expecting Julie Andrews to come strolling over one of the hills singing The Sound of Music. All of these needless changes took away from my enjoyment of Rowling's story. The fact that the kids are outgrowing their characters didn't help either - Neville, Malfoy, and, to some degree, Ron hardly resemble themselves from the first two movies. I didn't like the fact that Dumbledore's attire was completely changed (and that little rubber band in the beard thing was - to me - horrible) - in my opinion, all of that added unneeded complications to the transition process from the late Richard Harris to Michael Gambon in this pivotal role.I'm not saying Cuar&oacute;n didn't do some things well, though. The guys and gals who designed Buckbeak (in both model and CGI form) went well beyond the call of duty and should be praised. Aunt Marge, Professor Trelawney, Professor Lupin, and Sirius Black were perfect embodiments of their literary selves. Hogsmeade was an unqualified visual success. The Dementors were brought to life very effectively. Definitely, in many ways this was a very impressive film. Notice I haven't mentioned the story yet.Ah, yes, the plot. Obviously, I think the movie left out more than it should have to make room for a lot of unnecessary fluff. What we do have, though, feels somewhat disjointed to me - just a bunch of scenes thrown together. Obviously, I knew when the seasons changed as Cuaron went to the well too often with the soaring seasonal transitions, but I did not get the sense that a school year at Hogwarts had passed by the end of the film. Speaking of the ending, I will declare that it was well done indeed. It could have been confusing for younger viewers (assuming, of course, there might actually be one young viewer out there who hadn't actually read the book before seeing the film), so I was glad to see Cuaron really take the time to concentrate on bringing it off as seamlessly as possible.The extras on the bonus DVD are something of a mixed bag. I think I speak for all of us when I thank the studio for not making us go through some kind of infernal maze just to find a deleted scene. The five deleted scenes included here, though, aren't much to talk about. The games and the tours of Honeydukes and Lupin's classroom will appeal to some, but the real meat of the extras comes in the form of the cast interviews (even though they do force us to endure more of that infernal shrunken head), the featurette on the extraordinary animals seen in the film, and the interviews with director Cuaron and author J.K. Rowling.I know I've been critical of the film, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. I just think it could have been much better than it was. Many of us take our Harry Potter extremely seriously, and I just would have preferred stricter adherence to Rowling's original story (and, of course, less silly fluff).	5.0	Very Well Done But Overdone In Some Spaces	2006-06-12	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A14PTUYOB5QH57	Xandra Cohen	"two words:  that&iexcl;s it?  This was the first of the Harry Potter series where I read the book and watched the movie.  (I watched the 1st 2 movies before actually giving the books a try)  And I just have to say that the movie was disappointing by far.  Where to even begin??1) the very first scene:  harry was writing an essay about ""witch burning in the fourteenth Century was conmpletely pointless--discuss"" in the middle of the night, not practicing &iexcl;lumos&iexcl; over and over again.  He&iexcl;s not even supposed to do magic out of Hogwarts!2) Hagrid&iexcl;s hut has suddenly slid down a (pre-PoA) non-existent hill.3) The scenery has definitely changed.  I don&iexcl;t remember the land that Hogwarts was built on being so bumpy.  As I recall, in Chamber of Secrets, the whomping willow was right next to the school (on flat ground) when it drove through the school, past hagrid&iexcl;s hut, and into the dark forest.  All of this was on flat ground!4) The divination room (as I remember from the book) had a trap door as the door.  The door in the movie was anything but a trap door, seeing as it&iexcl;s just A DOOR!5) The stupid/pointless animal candy scene:  what exactly was the point of that??  Apparently that&iexcl;s more important than Harry finding out that his father, Black, lupin, and Pettigrew made the marauder's map or that Gryffindor finally won the quidditch cup (first time in at least 7 years).6) Since when do dementors fly??  I remember Harry looking down and after seeing first the &iexcl;grim&iexcl; (who actually turned out to be Sirius) then a bunch of dementors looking up at him, he falls 50 feet.  a) he doesn't RUN INTO THE DEMENTORS IN THE CLOUDS b) he doesn&iexcl;t fall 100s OF FEET c) dementors GLIDE! d) and one more thing:  since when does harry wear GOGGLES??7) the fact that they never explained what Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs meant. For all the people who hadn&iexcl;t read the books knew, Harry&iexcl;s patronus was a bush!8) The lack of several characters including Wood, Cedric, and Cho. (mainly Quidditch)9) Harry was hitting Malfoy with mud (not snow), then he went back through the tunnel in honeydukes to head off malfoy incase he got back and told someone that he saw harry and that&iexcl;s when Snape catches him right after he gets back in the school.  Snape doesn&iexcl;t catch him wandering the halls at night looking for Pettigrew.10) and the thing that bothers me the most is the ending.  FIREBOLT:  should be in the middle movie!  And it came w/ a feather??  That was how harry was to know that it came from Sirius???  Wow...and then they also left out Pigwidgeon who delivered the note from Sirius saying that the firebolt was from him and would be Ron&iexcl;s new pet.The movie, all in all was very (I won&iexcl;t say bad because to anyone who hasn&iexcl;t read the books might think that it&iexcl;s good) disappointing and rushed.  It didn&iexcl;t really flow.  I was finding myself longing to get the 3rd book and using it to guide me in exactly what part the movie was at because it was just...not as much confusing as not clear enough.  The story (or more back story) was badly explained if at all and the movie pretty much disregarded the rest of the book and just focused in on the Sirius Black conflict.  It was very non dimensional unlike JK Rowling&iexcl;s version of PoA.  It also felt unusually short.Although the acting WAS wonderful. Oldman (wish he could&iexcl;ve had more lines/scenes), Thewlis, Rickman, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson were great!  And Emma Thompson made a lovely Professor Trelawny.  Michael Gambon was good, however no one can ever replace Richard Harris as the true Dumbledore.Aside from the actors, none of which I can really complain about, I just have to come out and say it.  The movie SUCKS.  Read the book, the movie does it no justice at all."	1.0	That was it?  Where'd the other half go?	2004-08-09	36	17	19
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A6UIW92G7ZMVW	Xiao	this Harry Potter movie was darker than the others. also very fun to see how they grew up! Hermione is really a girly girl now and it's nice to see that. the only thing that bothered me in the storyline that it is not very clear how close Sirius, Lupus and Harry's father used to be when they were young. Yes, they tell him they were friends, but in the book it is better described how they were at school. that is my only critic.	4.0	different than the former 2 parts	2004-07-21	1	0	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18W0HJWUDJDYE	Yasminda	I am an avid Harry Potter fan and I have read all the books at least four times each.  I think that the &quot;Prisoner&quot; movie was done much better than the first two.  To start, it shows how the magic world is changing for Harry and how it will continue to change as the story unfolds throughout the future novels.  It's important to point out that the new director has been known in the past to put a dark spin on his interpretations in movies.  But I thought that this dark point of view is what is needed at this point in order to show that Harry and co. are no longer children and are entering into more dangerous territory.  Although the director did edit some parts of the book that I would have like to see, I think the movie overall does a great job in showcasing the future of the series.  I think the actors are really starting to come into their own and showing more depth in their interpretations of the characters.  I love to see how comfortable they are with each other in this film and to see how they are growing with these characters.  Overall, I think this movie is great and I can't wait to see &quot;Goblet&quot;.  Although I do agree that &quot;Goblet&quot; should be longer or made into a two part movie because to edit book four too much will ruin the movie and movie goers that don't read the books will be completely lost then.	4.0	Well Done!	2004-11-25	2	2	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1K6ZI6SXQ4HKV	YouKnowWho	"For the people who are bitc*ing about one camera shot or a part thats left out of the book, Id'e like to see them direct it.It is impossible to include everything from the books so get over it!!!Every camera shot is beautiful. THIS is a director with a vison. Chris Columbus was ok, but every camrea shot looked the same. The same old straight ahead camrea shot. But in POA, the camrea moves, the shots are visually complex and stunning and *different* than what your used too.The teenagers are actually wearing clothes! They have a good wardrobe this time around. It makes them seem more like teenagers now that they're not in the cloaks all the time.The movie is (for the millionth time) darker. The look of the film reflects this new mood. And I'm glad the director chose to go this route and actually deal with the meat of the story because HELLO! They are 14 in the movie not 5 or 6!!! So please adults stop bringing your damn toddlers to the movie because it's for teenagers not 7 or 8 year olds who never touched the books.The movie was genuinly funny instead of going for cliche lines (that werent in the books)like Columbus. I suppose I'm being hard on him but Prisoner of Azkaban is just so much better. But don't take it from me. Listen to J.K Rowling who wrote em' who was quoted as saying she ""absolutley loved"" the film. So I guess that means she doesn't care if a few things are swithced or left out. So why should you then?"	5.0	Actual cinema this time around	2004-08-11	2	1	1

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1QRYZ7YTL9M24	"Y. Smith ""LovinGeorgeW"""	I am a big Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books and I've seen this and the other two films. I knew what was going to happen of course, but my friends who came along with me did not. I've seen the movie with four different people who hadn't read the books, and none of them understood the movie. I had to explain it twice. Personally, I thought it far better than the first two, but it cut way too much out and did not tell enough backstory. As for acting, I thought Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job. He was dead on - his anger in spots gave me the chills. I also thought Alan Rickman was awesome. His voice, his expressions, he IS Snape. The Shrieking Shack scene just proves it. I was also surprised by David Thewlis as Remus Lupin - He was not how I pictured Lupin at all, but he played the part wonderfully. It is a great movie and I suggest seeing it, especially if you have read the books.	4.0	Confusing movie - Great acting by Radcliffe and Rickman.	2004-08-03	1	1	0

B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AP3B615GM191G	"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg"""	"In the first two Harry Potter films, the plots/action are primarily geared towards a much younger audience than the medium.  There are some ""tense moments"" and drama in those films, of course, but it isn't until ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" that the series really starts to grow up and deal with some more mature themes.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an escaped prisoner from the terrible Azkaban prison, come to Hogwarts in search of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) for reasons dealing with Potter's deceased parents.  Hermoine (Emma Watson) & Ron (Rupert Grint) still play large roles in the action (Hermoine especially in this one), while new Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) brings a new dynamic to the Hogwarts third-year experience.In terms of ""growing up"", this film does so more with themes than content.  There isn't any objectionable content in this one, but the themes and some of the characters present are sophisticated enough that younger children might have difficulty following them.  Basically, this is the type of movie that seeks to maintain a fanbase and not create new followers based on this effort alone.As with the book, the ending portions of ""Azkaban"" really serve to change the entire tone of the series.  I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice it to say that it feels as if the saga could go in any direction now and not be limited by the more child-friendly plots.This is also the first movie of the series that has noticeable differences from the novel.  Nothing too ""gasp-worthy"" or anything like that, but certain parts of the narrative this time are indeed re-arranged to better suit the cinematic experience.Overall, ""Azkaban"" might be even better as a movie than as a book because it skips over some of the ""fluff"" found at the beginning of the book and gets right into the thick of things from the get-go.  Despite a few key scenes that were explained a bit better by Rowling herself, this movie is the perfect complement to its literature twin."	5.0	The Series Starts To Grow Up	2013-05-06	0	0	0

Wide-screen's the way to go to enjoy the great F/X.Would I buy this again? Yup, as a gift. Problems? None. What I liked? Great story that translated well on the big screen. F/X become more sophisticated with each film, and this one is no exception.Advice to families with small children: The action can be intense. Great script, great F/X, but not every child may be prepared for it. Read the book either to and/or with your child and be prepared to explain, explain, explain every small detail. And watch the film with them too. The series was meant to be shared.	5.0	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	2013-12-26	0	0	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1POFVVXUZR3IQ	Z Hayes	This is a much darker version than the previous two movies. Director Alfonso Cuaron creates a movie that is permeated with a menacing air, and with creatures such as soul-sucking Dementors about, this is quite natural. The bright, bold hues of the previous two movies gives way to misty dark hues that seems depressing at times, yet is very crucial to the story as the plot does get darker, as does the series progressively.The trio of Harry [Daniel Radcliffe], Ron [Rupert Grint], and Hermione [Emma Watson] have definitely matured as actors and seem more confident in their respective roles. We have Michael Gambon as Dumbledore here [since actor Richard Harris died], and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is played convincingly by David Thewlis [though at times I felt that his character in the book seemed more commanding than on screen]. Emma Thompson plays the Divination teacher, Sybil Trelawney, and I felt that though she is a good actress, her character in the book was much darker and meaner. On screen she seems more of an airhead than anything else.The reason I gave the third movie instalment of Harry Potter 4 stars instead of five is because I read the book, and felt that some crucial plot points that explains a lot had been sacrificed in order to keep the movie to a manageable length. I understand this, especially so since the books in the series do get much longer in length, but I felt that at least some of the important plot points should have been included...for example, there is no real explanation as to the dynamics of the four friends - Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prongs, or the significance of the stag patronus that Harry conjures[ his father was Prongs, as he could tranfigure into a stag]...there should have been a short scene at least about why the three friends minus Lupin decided to become Animagi [tranfigure into animals].Oh well, I guess its too much to ask that all crucial plot points be included in the movie version. On the whole though, this is really a pretty good adaptation with credible acting, and wonderful CGI effects [the dementors, the hippogriff Buckbeak, the conjuring of the patronus etc]. And the scene where the Time Turner is used [where Harry & Hermione go back in time] is pure genius.	4.0	An entrancing, darker version, with some exceptions...	2007-08-03	3	3	0
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RYDDLJ1PN50M	Zippy	I have to agree that this was a great movie in it's entirety, but I was very dissapointed with it. I have to agree with a previous review I read on this site and say that if you are a real HP fan, you would not care how long the movie is. I dont understand why this was the longest book in the series yet it was the shortest movie. Too much time was wasted on parts that are for one thing, not even in the book, and two, wasted on scenery. TOO many changes were made to this movie when compared to the other 2. The buildings were changed, the location of buildings and trees were changed. Understandable that the plots get darker and darker but the first 2 movies were so much more engaging. They had a mystical sense about them that made you want to see more.. (another point of the 3rd I didnt like, the kids were dressed in jeans and jackets, bla bla bla..) I mean I thought they would end up in a GAP ad or soemthing. I will admit here and now I was not a HP fan in the least when the series blew up and became a huge hit, but the first time I saw the first HP movie on HBO or something I absolutely fell in love with the series. I now own all three movies and the 1st 5 books.I guess it is different if you have not read the books and saw the azkaban movie because in essence you don't really know what is missing, but if you are a fan of the 1st two movies by director chris columbus you know how some of us feel.So with that in mind, I hope this NEW director takes into consideration that real fans do not care how long the movies are as long as they follow the book and capture the fantasy that is Harry Potter. For all those out there that have no seen this movie, give it a go. Even if it's not at the top of my list, it's still a great movie to see and share.	4.0	PLEASE BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS!!!!!!	2004-11-30	12	6	6
B00005JMAH	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)	APLNEENH0JNST	"ZuZu ""AFrodisiac18"""	The movie was acted out Very Well from certain characters... another great performance from the trio Harry (Daniel) Ron (Rupert) and Hermoine (Emma) and from other members of the cast..McGonagal Hagrid Sirius Snape ect..who give the Movie the feel of the book.However i would say i was dissapointed with the rest the first time i watched it..i was sorley dissapointed! The transiton from Columbus to Curano is very evident. I think it really failed to portray the quality of the novel which i still do after watching it twice. The Darkest and most exciting of the collection so far wasnt represented in the movie..the running time was TOO short and Hogwarts set was more reminiscent of Rivendell..it seemd a different place..and the layout of Hogwarts had changed (Did they think FANs wouldnt notice??!)After watching it a second time i have a more positive view of the movie..once the inital shock of the major change in direction, portryal, scenry and acting is digested and you view it for a second time it becomes much more pleasurable and i found myself taken with the movie, laughter, anticipation  and other feelins thorugh all..Curanos touch is different but good in a sense, it is a major let down to the original movies, the feel and style is way to different yet after a second viweing i wasnt too fussed as i appreciated the rest.I dont think Gambon did well as 'Dumbledore',Ian McKellen would have done much better.Yet the original Dumbledore was the best, really portraying him well, this loss of such a great actor was evident in the new film.Lupin and Pettigrew wernt what i was expecting, didnt feel their acting at all, and the firebolt looked AWFUL!!!the bookFinal Thought?? Watch it twice or more an you'll enjoy it more! Try and get the first two films out of your mind and view it as its own film which is hard to do! But still a good movie but im sticking with the Bookp.s the format of the new dvd was SO dissapointing, totally put me off buying it at all, shouldv continued the original packaging!	3.0	Major DISSapointment!	2005-01-13	6	6	0
