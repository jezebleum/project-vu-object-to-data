B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	"The Back to the Future trilogy is GREAT! I bought it a year ago and it is outstanding. I don't see how other reviewers could criticize this trilogy because there is NOTHING wrong with mine. The ""widescreen"" isn't off the page or anything. The trilogy is just like any other. As for the actual movies, they're amazing. Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies. (especially when I like the idea of time travel) The delorean is what really brings out all the movies. As for others, I definately recommend this to you!"	5.0	Great Trilogy and NOTHING wrong with it!	2008-06-17	1	1	0

The bluray video and audio is unbelievable, as if the movie was just made recently. I just watched part 1 and now going through the extra stuff and the extra stuff is like more than 3 hours. Damn.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3UT41TWD7N0D5	AbeStreet	"For some reason I was only a casual fan of these movies until I purchased them on DVD.  I thought they were decent films, with good special effects, an interesting plot, and some decent acting.  Still the movies didn't rank high on my ""favorites"" list.  However, that all changed once I purchased them on DVD.  I watched the films back to back and the overall story became so much more enjoyable for me.  I really appreciated the way that the filmmakers were able to, in 1989, recreate the original 1985 sets.  The actors picked up where they left off without missing a beat.  The special effects hardly seem dated.  The various sets of the same town in different time periods were very well done.  What impressed me the most though was the story.  I'd forgotten just how many times the characters had jumped back and forth through time.  The story is somewhat complex and keeping track of all the time paradoxes and the alternate futures requires the viewer to remain focused and to pay attention to everything that is going on.While I think Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd made a great acting team I personally think that Thomas Wilson is the unsung hero of this trilogy.  He is able to create the various members of the Tannen  family and the various ages of the different Tannen characters so perfectly that they really do seem to be portrayed by more than one actor.  It's a shame that Claudia Wells (Jennifer Parker) and Crispin Glover (George McFly) opted out of doing the two sequels.  Still, their replacements did a fine job.Lastly, what more could you want from a movie(s)?  An original story, decent acting, humor, a touch of romance, plenty of suspense, and enough special effects and action are sure to keep any viewer glued to their television sets.  The next time you're at home with an afternoon to kill try watching these films.  You'll be surprised just how fast 6 hours can slip past!"	5.0	"You ""Slackers"" need to purchase this trilogy!!!"	2005-11-08	7	7	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AF0ZBV5OJG80S	"Abraham Figueroa ""Abraham of the Jungle"""	"Being a kid who grew up in the late '80s-early '90s, Back to the Future always took my imagination to so many places. It's always been one of my favorite franchises, and now the wife loves it as well. As a high def aficionado, of course I was going to pick this up! And what can I say? It is outstanding! The picture quality is as good as the negatives for these films will allow. I was able to hear a great improvement in audio as well. And as a previous owner of the trilogy on DVD, it is great to see all of those bonus features added in and many more! I also finally get to own the films not only in HD, but also in their correct ratio.But what really compelled me to write this review was the packaging. Every single review I read (and the set has only been out for a day) keeps whining on how terrible the packaging is. Which was really strange to me, because when I first opened up my set and saw it, I though, ""wow, that's a really neat way to hold the discs--it contains the packaging's need to touch your disc to a bare minimum!"" Which was a problem I always had with multi-disc sets--one way or another, they could scuff or scratch the discs against each other. But this way, they're practically being held four tiny bits of plastic around the edges, and nothing touching your disc on the reading side. Maybe I'm a strange person, but when I first saw it and saw the design, I saw the little spring-like throngs at the bottom and figured, ""oh, these are holding the discs up. So you push down, and out comes the disc."" Which is what I've been doing and I have had no trouble taking out or putting back the discs. So, thumbs up. I love this set, and the packaging."	5.0	Awesome collection, great picture and audio, and yes, awesome package!	2010-10-27	9	4	5
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2CKFK43Z4CTPF	A. Bursaw	"First off, I put in 5 stars so you could read this without too much difficulty finding. BTTF looks amazing in its complete restoration, with the stunning quality that a blu ray could offer. So when I upwrapped this sucker, I fired up the blu ray player and opened the box.I wanted my fix of Doc Brown and Marty McFly.Problem 1: WTF is this packaging? Blu Rays held in place by clips with the digital copies behind them. When it comes to movies in general I tend to take care of my things. But BTTF, well, I baby this Trilogy. So now I open this box and pray that I can figure out the correct method in freeing the Blu Ray from its clip without breaking a chunk of the side off of the Blu Ray in the process. I want to protect my investment, how come they couldnt do something like the old trilogy on DVD that I purchased when they first went to DVD? Why do I have to play a game of russian roulette with discs I just spent over 50 bucks for? Honestly? And taking the discs out was the first challenge, putting them back in was fun too. I didnt expect this epic fail of packaging.BUY SOME NICE REPLACEMENT CASES for your Blu Rays so you dont have to store them in this case. Ugh.Problem 2: After the product was unpackaged, it really was easy to hold the jacket of the Blu Ray, wrapped around the case with the actual discs of the movie and have the inside case slide out of the bottom of the jacket. I didnt bother to think about this situation before it happened to me. Im sure someone else out there has already done this as well. Thank god when this happened, it bounced off of a soft matress of a bed I was viewing this movie from. But if it was to fall down onto a hardwood floor or a hard tile floor, who knows how well the packaging could hold up. Just goes back to wondering....WTF is up with this packaging?Problem 3: Extras were a little shaky. Most of the extras were recycled from the DVD set when it first was released as a trilogy. The digital copies were a huge plus, but if you are a die hard fan of this trilogy, im sure many were expecting the Eric Stoltz footage (since there was 5 weeks of it, as explained in the online ""teaser for the BTTF blu ray edition"" that came out a week and a half ago.). Unless I completely missed it (which I skimmed through all of the extras from the 3 discs) I kinda wanted to see the BTTF with whatever they had with Stoltz in it, just because it would be a completely different look at a movie that I have enjoyed hundreds of times before. It would've been interesting to see that kind of stuff. But nope, not there. Thats kinda sad considering we are celebrating a 25th anniversary edition digitally restored with digital copies and as many extras they could pack in.If I have overlooked it, please correct me if im wrong.Problem 4: I was expecting some more stuff in this special edition set. Like maybe a little model DeLorean that opens up to store your Blu Rays or maybe a sports almanac or something. The Dark Knight got this treatment; the little Batman mask to open up with the blu ray discs inside. Maybe paying a little more money to get that extra bonus, it wouldve been a nice little treat. Im sure you could figure out other things they couldve done with this Blu Ray set. It seems a little bare for a 25th anniversary edition in the United States to come with NOTHING else.Of course the quality and the restoration of the Trilogy brings it up to todays standards. Looks very pretty in Hi-def. Although I have seen these movies many many many times, the clear picture really made this purchase shine. It is still an awesome pickup if you love this franchise, but it still felt kind of lame that there couldnt been some more packaged with this."	5.0	Want the Blu Ray?

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1446K814UTW3C	"""adalton"""	This trilogy became available on DVD on Dec 17, 2002 and I purchased it the 18th. Obviously I've not sat through everything this set includes but only played with it.The trilogy set is available in either Widescreen or Standard. The DVD set comes in a single plastic case containing all 3 discs, and can be displayed either by itself or with the cardboard box wrap-around it comes in. The case includes a single booklet with some written documentation and includes scene index for each film.Lots and lots of stuff. Each of the 3 discs contains the following: Deleted scenes can be viewed individually or together with a PLAY ALL option, with or without commentary audio; outtakes (funny clips and bloopers) [not available on disc 3]; Q&amp;A film commentary; film commentary by director; film commentary by producers; the making-of; trailers; animated menus; other extras.There is also a film commentary by the star (Michael J Fox) available only on disc 1 (Part I). The Fox commentary is made up of embedded video picture-in-picture of Fox discussing things about the film, the scene, or his life, and is activated by clicking the Enter/Play button on the remote when the icon displays on screen. There is a pause while switching between commentary mode and live film mode. It's great to see him 'live' again. He looks good.One of the 'subtitles' is in the form of 'fun facts' which mention something about the film, the set, the scene, or something else relevant to the film. Available on discs 2 and 3 only.My remote's audio button will not change the language or go to commentary on any of the discs. For this, I needed to go through the menu system. On disc 1, the subtitle button does not change but also requires menu selection. However, on discs 2-3 the subtitle button seems to work fine so that languages or 'fun facts' change while in any language. It looks like the decision was to do the Fox video commentary on disc 1 and 'fun facts' on discs 2-3. This may have affected subtitle switching on disc 1. No subtitles are available on disc 1 while in any commentary mode.4-1/2 stars out of 5 for disc inconsistency. It would have been 5/5 if all three where the same, with disc 1 having the extra bonus Fox commentary video. I don't want to have to remember which disc does what... Boy, am I lazy. I'll just enjoy these great films. An incredible amount of work has gone into this DVD set and just to have these wonderful films on DVD is great.	4.0	Wonderful Fun finally on DVD	2002-12-18	4	2	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1AXHNRDJEQ0B	Adi Adler	While some of the movies in the trilogy were better than others (the 2nd one seems to be many people's favorite, while the third doesn't seem to have a lot of fans), the movies themselves (especially the first) are still a classic.Even though the subject and jokes might seem like a big cliches nowadays, the movies themselves were a little bit deeper than the surface, and contained a few pseudo - philosophical questions regarding time travel (if someone in he present changes the past, what will the effects be?). The movies also contained qyute a few period jokes, even though this became less evident throughout the trilogy.With an outstanding cast, this may as well be a classic for people like me, who grew up watching this series.	5.0	A Classic	2003-10-29	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2PV6GK1HV54Y9	ADRIENNE MILLER	Wow the complete trilogy! i love all three of the back to the future movies. Michael J. Fox was probably the first actor i remember watching as a little kid. Eric Stolz was originally cast as Marty McFly but the director had a change of heart and cast Fox instead. I think the second is my personal fave, but all are great and still hold up. Hey even Elisabeth Shue is in it (love her to pieces!). The 1980s was the coolest decade well since i was born in it. if you love these movies you have to get it, trust me it's worth it.	5.0	"""Are you saying my mom has the hots for me?!"""	2006-04-13	5	4	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2CQQVBO9POMP8	A. Edell	I always have been and always will be Back to the Future's biggest fan. These three films defined my childhood, so needless to say, I was ecstatic to receive my blu ray copy in the mail when it was first released. The good news is that the quality of the transfer to HD is excellent. Piercing colors, wonderful resolution, near-perfect sound... and from an old 80's movie no less! The new documentary series about the making of the film was pretty good (not amazing). As with every making-of, the story of making the first film was by far the most interesting. The featurettes about the second and third film was somewhat dull.I was also disappointed at some of the extras. For one, they had all of the legacy featurettes from the original DVD collection, WHICH I ALREADY OWN! Not a fan of rehashes. Secondly, I really really really wanted to see full scenes featuring Eric Stolz (the original Marty McFly). But I was saddened to find that there was in total, about 20 seconds of the footage, and its buried deep in the new documentaries.It was fun to see some of the odd promotion videos for the franchise, especially the Back to the Future ride! I really got a kick out of that.All in all, I highly highly highly recommend this new release for all fans. If you don't have a blu-ray player, then it would probably be ok for you to just stick with the original DVD release if you already have it. If not, this is definitely the set to own. I don't regret buying it at all.	4.0	Almost perfect	2010-11-23	7	6	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2HFIFAE3RLO0M	AirdevilAirbrushing	"Well I may be biased, since this was my first impression of Blu ray quality with my Samsung player I just purchased, and the Back to the Future trilogy is probably my favorite movie of all time, but for some reason, the clarity of this movie shot in the 80's is even clearer than some of the movies I purchased that were recently made in the past 5 years (maybe it has to do with Universal Studios or something) It's amazing how this version of my favorite movies jumps off the screen like it does in it's full 1080p glory.  I don't even remember seeing it in that quality EVER, since I don't think I saw it in the theater back then, but watched it on VHS then DVD.  I watched all 3 in a row on my 61"" Samsung DLP tv and I'm looking forward to watching them at my parents house on their new projector when their home theater is finished.  This Blu ray set is DEFINITELY worth the price. Amazon had the best price (which they always seem to have, when it comes to media, DVDs, CDs, etc.) Don't go to Wal-trash...their prices aren't ALWAYS the lowest, and most things can be found elsewhere without having to deal with parking, lines, no service help, etc. The only negative I can really say about this set is that the discs are very hard to remove and put back in since they are attached by an ""arm"" type of clip on either side.  I just don't want to damage the discs, but other than that, with some moderate care, you should have no problem...other than that, a definite gold mine!!!

The movies are a lot of fun and hold up very well.  They also look and sound great.  The most fun for me was the huge amount of bonus material included.  There's about an hour of material on the disc for each of the movies and a separate bonus disc with close to an additional 3 hours of material.  That's a lot of BttF!  Some of the bonus material repeats information from earlier segments, and some of it seems needlessly segmented on the bonus disc, but that's a minor complaint.  This set is great.  Every fan of the movies will want to own this one, even if they already have the earlier release.	5.0	great stuff	2011-01-01	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1JHQT5ZS4JDCC	Alex	Let's get real: if there's someone who doesn't love Back to the future (BTTF), you've got to be kidding me!!! This is one of the best trilogys ever made.I watched the first movie back in 1987 and i inmediately fell in love with the movie subject. I watched it in local tv, here in Costa Rica when the VHS machines were a hit. I desperately begged my mon to get me a copy of this movie. I've got the first and the second movie in 1989. And later on, came the third one.When you watched the movies you never get tired of them. As a matter of fact , i've learned must of my english watching this movies with CC. hard to believe uh?Michael J. Fox rised his career after this movie. And what about Christopher Lloyd?The soundtrack is a classical too. The soundtrack of back to the future is to the middle 80s what the StarWars soundtrack was to the early 80s.Im waiting to christmas in order to get these movies. Do it as well, you'll never regret.	5.0	This is a must-have-DVD!!!	2002-08-04	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2EKUK64EH74ZI	Alex	This is not a review of the trilogy. I am sure most people who are thinking of getting this set have already watched the movies. If not, there are plenty of reviews out there. I am just disappointed that why do I have to watch 10 minutes of crap every time I want to watch any of the movie? That is so annoying. I paid and bought this blu ray set. I should not be forced to watch 3-5 rubbish trailers/videos before I can watch the movie.	2.0	Love the trilogy but why do I have to go through 10 minutes of crap before I can watch the movies?	2011-12-04	7	6	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AX3Z95IPNLK0S	Ali Hosseinian	This is a 80's child dream, the complete back to the future trilogy on DVD.  What made me fall in love with the trilogy was the charasmatic and down to earth Marty McFly, and also one has got to love Christopher Lloyd as the famous and wacko genius Doc.  I liked all 3 of the films, because of each of the delt with a different adventure in a different time.  The DVD features are excellent, and they are features, I ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH!!!  The only complaint I have is the packaging.  Why couldn't Universal give seperate cases for each movie instead of giving one big case for all of them, it is just a minor quibble I have, well go out and buy this boxed set, it would make the perfect gift for Christmas.MEMO TO STEVEN SPIELBERG:  Next Christmas I would love the Inidana Jones films on DVD also, hopefully I will be able to get that soon!	5.0	Time travel has never been so fun!	2002-12-18	0	0	0

Each one is an amazing masterwork of fantasy, action, adventure, and humor.  The acting, writing, and directing is stellar in all three. They also come with a healthy dose of nostalgia for many of us who grew up watching them.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are great, and their time travelling adventures in and around the town of Hill Valley from the Old West to the future keep one thoroughly entertained with the changing fortunes and styles of the McFly, Tannen, and Brown clans.  These are fun for everyone, and continue to, no pun intented, stand the test of time.	5.0	3 of the Best Movies of All Time!	2013-09-25	1	1	0

I am not disappointed. Maybe they tweaked these films or something, but they look great and still hold up (even if their predictions for the future were way, way off).

I ended up throwing the cover away and wrapping it up anyway since there was a time issue. Any other time I would have sent it back with the quickness and never accepted such unprofessional shipping practices.Not happy about the quality with shipping this in a box with other items and causing it to get ruined.The movie quality itself I am told is fantastic.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2527P4J639JUD	Amy Capuano	First, I have to say regarding the formatting error on discs 2 & 3: get over it!  Reviewers have portrayed this mistake as a failure on a massive level, but it's nothing of the kind!  With an exception or two here & there, the average viewer won't notice any difference, & you won't miss anything spectacular.Also, I don't understand the complaints about a boxed trilogy set vs. single discs.  Several reviewers seem to think only the first movie is worthwhile, & while that's a matter of opinion & everyone is entitled to their thoughts on it, the outrageous number of special features make this worth the price for the first movie alone!  Besides, any true BTTF fan would appreciate all the movies taken as a whole, not just individually.That said, I am happy to say that these were the first DVDs I ever watched, & I was amazed!  If you think you're a fan of the trilogy now, wait till you experience the jam-packed special features, sharp, clear picture, & as-you-watch-it commentaries!  I have yet to see a DVD with more features!  This release is no slapped-together version: lots of time & effort were put into creating menus, q&a; sessions, commentaries, explanations of visual effects, interviews, & FAQs, & into gathering behind-the-scenes & promo materials, including trailers, outtakes, music videos, stills, sketches, &, best of all, deleted scenes!  I can promise all fans that there is NO WAY you will be disappointed with this DVD release!And if you've never seen these movies, or have seen the original & not the sequels, now is the time to get on board with these amazing comedy/adventure/romance/action/sci-fi flicks!  Introduce them to your kids (or your parents!) - they're sure to appreciate them on a whole nother level.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A21BN3LOR4JY29	April M. Love	My comment about the difference in the sequels to BTTF is this: the ideal sequel--in my book--is one that expands on the original story.  Movies that repeat the same plot, same jokes, same gimmicks, miss the point of good storytelling.If you want the same story, or are obsessive enough to want to repeat the same experience, then watch that movie again.In any case, I really enjoyed all three of BTTF.  We got to know the characters better and at deeper levels.I recall, while watching BTTF III in the theatre, feeling close to tears when the Mary Steenburgen character almost fell off the train.I guess the moral of the differing comments here, is that everyone sees movies from their own perspective.	5.0	Not the Same Old Re-Hash	2003-03-08	5	4	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ARYH4TGIGMHS9	arturo_gtz	I'm not going to review the plot or the quality of the movies... instead i'm going to review the content of the DVD (everybody knows that these movies are truly classics).This collection contains Spanish subtitles in almost all of the extra features, something missing in almost all the Region 1 dvd that contains Spanish subtitles (even in some Region 4 DVD like the Simpsons!), there are also French audio track and subtitles; one thing that is new in all the DVD that i had bought up to day, are the bloopers or outtakes of the movies, you will laugh louder with these, also you can find Deleted scenes with explanation from Bob Gale about why these escenes where deleted, some FAQs with the answers directly from the authors from the movies (do you remember the question &quot;Why Dr. Emett Brown (from 1885) can't remember that he send Marty to 1885 in 1955?&quot;), two audio comentaries (without subtitles... what a shame :( ), very interesting featurettes, production notes and a lot of stuff.About the Repress of the Widescreen Edition of the discs 2 and 3, i had watched all the DVD and i can't find anything noticeable... in fact, i don't know what is missing or what is worng with these discs (the only flaw that i noticed was in the Disc 1, when George Mc Fly punches Tannen, you can notice a one second freeze, but nothing else)A worth buying	5.0	Very good collection	2003-01-01	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AE8CC1FFMT69F	Asian Inferno	"Imagine this: An empty parking lot at night, A grey van parked somewhere in the center, two figures are visibly examining something behind it. Time passes and one of the figures is down on the ground, the other has disappeared into the vehicle behind it being chased by a van of pursuers. The vehicle is grey and metallic in color, and looks very angular and futuristic. You'd think it was a normal car, but it's equipped with various mechanical parts mounted all around it. The two vehicles speed around the parking lot, but it's the grey car that takes your interest. It speeds at a drive-up photo hut and continues to accelerate. You'd think it's going to crash, it's inevitable! But instead it defies logic and physics, snap hissing as its attachments open up a portal, in which it disappears into a blue vortex in an instant. The only sign of its existence is a burning duel trail of tire tracks that light up the black pavement.If you haven't guessed where the scene came from already and what I'm about review, it seems obvious that you've stumbled here by accident or maybe you are just following a recommendation. Whatever the reason, you're here!""Back to the Future"", a science-fiction movie that primarily portrays the 80s in which it is set, defined a generation and a time period and revolved around a teenage boy (Michael J. Fox) and his journey backwards and forwards in time with his older eccentric scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd). Along with an all star cast and a highly acclaimed director, writer, and producer (Robert Zemmerick, Bob Gale, Steven Spielberg); this is an instant classic with universal appeal. I'm not here to spoil the movie (s) for you so if you want a plot summary, you'd have better luck with IMBD or Wikipedia. To note, the success of the first movie spawned two additional sequels that also appear in the box set: Part II and Part III. I'm here to review the Back to the Future 25th Anniversary Edition DVD set that was released in 2010. Breaking down the Price, Presentation, Special Features & Bonuses, and Packaging; we will dive into the most definitive box set for the Back to the Future films to date!""All right, give me a Pepsi Free."" ""You want a Pepsi, PAL, you're gonna' pay for it."" - So retail-wise, it's been sometime since the thing was first released ($50), so the price has gone down over time and now you can generally get it in the $20-30 range. You'll want to save money and it's a bargain to get all of this for such a low price. I did manage to find my new copy at a wholesale store at a cost of $13, so word of advice is to shop around to get the best deal.""Time circuits on."" ""What do you mean ""Time Circuits on""? Doc, we're not goin' back now!"" ""Yep."" - Presentation is better than expected for a re-release of an old classic. It's been 25 years since the first movie came out, and in that time home video formatting has gone from full screen to widescreen. You now see much more than the VHS versions of the 90s, and the cropping problems that plagued the 2005 edition of Part II and Part III have been remedied. Not only this, but the films have all been digitally re-mastered in a way that breathes new life into these classics. The footage is crisper and cleaner, and more details can be seen. The audio has been also improved and allows a wonderful 5.1 surround sound compatibility that draws you into the movies through voices and the famous 3-note theme song. The menu interfaces are easy to navigate and pretty interactive as well! If you really want HD (1080i) quality though, you might want to head on over to the Blu-Ray version and check out that.""Wait a minute, Doc. Ah... Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" ""The way I see it, if you're gonna' build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?"" - The special features are much more numerous than what you'd expect from most box sets and include a variety of original and new content to watch after the feature films. The typical behind-the-scenes features are included and show the work put into maintaining continuality as well as quality into the trilogy. All of the basic features include commentary, deleted scenes, and more. But the appealing features that are shown include newer interviews and retrospect featurettes into the films now that so much time has passed. Getting to see the cast and crew together and talking about the experience and things untold is just wonderful. Along with the disc features described on the disc, there are also digital versions of the movies for your high-tech mobile device (IE: iTouch, Cellphone) as well as an offer for a free copy of Episode 1 of the 2011 episodic game series, ""Back to the Future: The Game"" by Telltale Games. The amount of content is just staggering and this is only a glimpse at the full content.""No wonder this circuit failed. It says ""Made in Japan""."" ""What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan."" ""Unbelievable.""  - Finally we get to the packaging which for all purpose and intent is appealing even to look at. What you have is a thin cardboard cover slip that is holographic and has a flip out front that shows you all of the features that are featured in the packaging. Once that is off you'll have a fold-out, four paneled interior that is an exact copy of the cover slip, but inside holds all of the discs of the packaging (seven in all!). What follows are three movie discs, three digital download discs, and a bonus disc full of the older content. My one negative comment on this product as a whole is located in this section. You see, the disc holders aren't your typical easy ""push middle"" type of a format. Instead to have a very flimsy plastic that looks like it can easily break and two indents for each disk for fingers. What you'll need to do is not push and tug like a normal disc holder (that would break it), but push and lift from one of the two indents for the disc. It's unusual to think that Universal decided to do it this way, but it seems they might have been testing a new format for packaging. Otherwise this packaging is wonderfully done, and even features the poster art for each of the movies behind their respective discs.""Hey, Doc! Where you goin' now? Back to the future?"" ""Nope. Already been there."" - This is truly the most definitive version and packaging of the Back to the Future movies thus far. It's what I hope to expect from other box sets in the future (Jurassic Park 20th Anniversary Edition, anyone?) My one negative aspect as noted was the disc holders, but overall it's worth it. It's a wonderful time to re-watch it if you've haven't seen it in awhile and also a wonderful time to see what everyone was talking about if you are new to the series (Like I was!). The value to money ratio is definitely for the benefit of the buyer, and what the buyer gets is a piece of cinematic history with the perfect format and presentation that one could ever want with a box set of movies."	5.0	The Best BTTF Box Set One Needs!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2WFNZWC8O6O1J	Atticus	(Spoilers Throughout!)BACK TO THE FUTURE was the instant smash-hit of 1985.  It still is magical today.  Marty McFly discovers that old Doc Brown has invented a time machine!  Marty travels back in time to escape the shooters who killed Doc, but while in 1955, he interferes with his parents' romance, putting himself in danger.  He then tries to alter the past to get his parents to meet, and save Doc's life.BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II wasn't recieved well by critics and audiences.  Sure, it's not as good as the first, but is a well-worthy sequel.  Marty and Doc travel to 2015 where 1955 bully Biff Tannen is old.  He temporarily steals the time machine and gives his younger self a book of future sports statistics.  Young Biff then becomes rich, and when Marty and Doc return to present-day 1985, it's hell on Earth.  They must travel back to 1955 and get the book from young Biff!BACK TO THE FUTURE PART 3 picks up right where II's cliff-hanger left off.  1955 Doc Brown helps Marty travel to 1855, where Doc was stranded.  Marty assumes the identity of Clint Eastwood and tries to get the infatuated Doc back to the future, instead of staying in the Old West with school teacher Clara Clayton.  Great conclusion!The trilogy DVD is great, with all three movies and awesome bonus features.  All movies are great and are worth owning.  The plot is mind-blowing and will leave you wondering HOW'D HE DO THAT?  All these movies are Amazon.com Essential Videos, and with good reason.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AHSY48775P8RI	Avalon Daughter	"What a fantastic package!  I had been waiting for the Back to the Future trilogy and was just delighted when they announced they were releasing it.  After seeing what it had to offer, I don't regret shelling out the cash at all.So why is this so good?  Let me tell you!  There's three discs in the whole package and each one has: an outtake reel, deleted scenes, commentaries, original trailers, original music videos, TV specials, artwork, behind the scenes photo galleries, makeup tests and more tidbits than you can imagine.Let me reiterate:  each disc is complete with all of the extras you can think of (including hilarious outtakes) as well as a bunch of extra features.  For instance, in the first movie you can either: watch it alone, watch it with a Q&A; with the producers, watch it with commentary, watch it with animated trivia facts at the bottom or watch it with Michael J. Fox's commentaries on a smaller screen.  WOW.There's no baloney on any of these discs -- that means NO unwanted advertising, no forced watched previews and there's enough extras that you don't feel cheated on buying the set.  You know what I mean  -- they advertise ""special features"" and most of the time it's simply a trailer.  This is definitely NOT the case and at this price it is DEFINITELY worth it.But what about the movies?  They look better than ever.  The sound is so well honed that you feel as if it were created originally in surround sound.  Colors are crisp and scenes look sharp.  And I highly recommend widescreen version to get the full effect.Five stars and then some.  This is just such a bargain, you'd be silly to pass it up.  Plus, I don't know what else they could add to this to ""reissue"" it so I recommend you grab this one rather than see if another version (probably more expensive) will come out.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"The summer of 1985. What a wonderful time in the cinemas that was for a little kid like me. After witnessing ""The Goonies"", another cherished childhood movie, I went and saw the first BTTF movie. Another defining childhood moment at the movies. The wonder and magic of that first film, and the subsequent sequels, is still strong today. All of the wonderfulness that is the original movie and the trilogy as a whole, is collected here in this box set with a worthwhile pile of fun and wonderful extras. Since you already probably know the films and stories, there is no real need to go into detail with all three films. The basic premise is teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox)going into the past to 1955, thanks to Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) and his DeLorean time machine, and has to get his mother and father together or he will never be born. The resulting sequels has Marty and the Doc going into adventures in the future(part 2), and going back to the wild, wild west(part 3). There is no denying the wonderful and whimsical charm and brilliance of the original film, thanks to Robert Zemeckis' wonderful direction and script(with Bob Gale), the endearing characters, and many wonderful set pieces. The sequels don't fail to entertain, but the original can't be touched. Part 2 was all over the place and showcased Zemeckis and Gale's wonderful vision and creativeness. Part 3 was more simpler, and returned to the softer charm of the original. The load of extras here is a major treat. All 3 films come with the same set of extras. Deleted scenes, outtakes, music videos, screen tests, etc. The little documentaries and behind the scenes stuff is great. All 3 films come with short specials that were originally done at the time of each film's release. All 3 also come with new documentaries discussing each film, and the second one finally tells me why Crispin Glover didn't reprise his role. Director/co-writer Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale are the main people present in all 3. Fox appears here and there. No Lea Thompson. No Thomas Wilson. No Christopher Lloyd(I hear he never does interviews). No Crispin Glover. That was kind of disappointing. Otherwise, it's fun stuff. There is also some page to screen comparisons, and some behind the scenes look at the hoverboard creation and designing the town square of Hill Valley. This is definitley a collection worthy of high praise, and worthy of being in your own DVD collection. It's a series of films that are looked upon very fondly, and rightfully so. That summer of 1985 was one that made huge impressions on me, and BTTF can be thanked for that. Pick it up."	5.0	Hey McFly!!!	2007-03-23	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A27OW71FRLBQ8X	B.

Part one looked great, and I guess my mother in law hadn't seen it before, so I popped in the disk to the right of part 1 (which should have been part 2).  Surprise!!!  It's another copy of part 1, so sadly its time to call universal customer relations.  I'd be lucky if I get an exchange by new years :(.  But I did put in a copy of the DVD part 2 from the earlier set, and ewwww how awful in comparison to the blu ray Part 1.  I can't wait to see the part 2 blu ray.  Part 3 looked excellent, and since both part 2 and 3 were shot at the same time, I would imagine that the entire set will be well worth anything you have to pay for the set.  Also, don't pay any attention to the reviews that mention disk exchange (unless there is an extra copy of part 1) - those are referring to the DVD set (and are dated 2003).  4 stars for the duplicate part 1 and no part 2 issue.	4.0	Disk holder and Extra copy of part 1	2010-12-18	2	1	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A18AW4W1C5F1FZ	Becky	Im writing a review on the 25th anniversary edition in comparison with the fullscreen version. I watched both the fullscreen and the widescreen versions of this side by side and I noticed the video was messed up or different in this widescreen edition.I have some screenshots I took that show what im talking about.[...]In this first screenshot at the part where the doc is pushing the button on marty's shirt to get it to the right size for him. You will notice in the widescreen version you can see more on the left and a little more on the right but just a little. The bad thing is, the top is cut off plenty. Look at the vent above the doc's head, its cut off alot. The fullscreen version show the same amount and more at the top and bottom but has just a little bit cut off of the sides. Overall I would rather the fullscreen version at this rate.[...]In this second screenshot comparison At the part where the doc tells Marty to look for a guy named gryph and hands him 50$ You will notice in the widescreen version you can see a very tiny bit less on the left and a little more on the right but just a little. The bad thing is, the bottom is cut off plenty. Their pants and torso are cut off. The fullscreen version shows about the same amount and more at the top and bottom also a little more on the left and less on the rightOverall it seems that the fullscreen version shows the full video from top to bottom and the widescreen has the top and or bottom cut off but a little more on the left and right sides of the video. So basically the amount you gain or lose on the top, bottom, left, and right are about equal. If they cut off the pants on the bottom of one part in the widescreen version, you will notice you gain a piece of the car on the side or other things on the sides that could not be seen in the fullscreen version. Overall it looks like you get more picture with the fullscreen version.Aside from those video things to consider the packaging was very nice and well set up. you wont have to worry too much about discs coming loose and getting scratched.The plot and story are great, I grew up on these movies and loved them greatly and am sure you will not be disappointed in the storyline.	4.0	Video cut off and messed up it seems	2011-12-19	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80's.  I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like.  It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon).  It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically.  Lots of fun scenes.Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!)  I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time.  Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns.  Awesome!These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed.  The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series.  Maybe, maybe not.  I don't really know.  I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time.  A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice.  Not in this case.	5.0	buy and own	2007-07-10	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2H1QA1Z1TZI6S	"belvis ""i don't have one"""	"This is the greatest trilogy ever.  Nowhere else will you find a trilogy as well rounded and thought out and beautiful as ""Back To The Future.""  It's amazing to think that there was actually a four year gap between ""Back To The Future"" and ""Back To The Future: Part II"" and ""Back To The Future: Part III.""  They stick together so amazingly that its hard to believe that the whole trilogy was not planned carefully in advance.  Watching all three movies from beginning to end in a row is a real experience and feels like one large, amazing movie.  No other trilogy can claim that.""Back To The Future"" (1985):  This one started it all, and it's just a wonderful movie, definately one of my favorites of all time.  You'll never find a movie that combines so many different genres so skillfully that you don't even notice it.  This movie has comedy, drama, action, adventure, and romance all rolled up together in what seems like such an effortless package.  The acting is also top notch.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd go down in history as a wonderful comedic team, and Thomas F. Wilson is simply incredible as bully Biff, but it's in the sequels where his talent for playing multiple characters of multiple generations really shines through.  Crispon Glover is simply hilarious in his strange, zany way, as George McFly.  Lea Thompson is sweet, innocent, and adorable.  Great movies come with great casts, and this one definately has that.  Grade: A""Back To The Future: Part II"" (1989):  Although some will disagree, I believe firmly that this is the best of the entire trilogy.  It ties part one and part three together beautifully and has an incredible plot full of glorious loopholes and time paradoxes guaranteed to give anyone a headache, and what a glorious ride it is!  Even more exciting than the first, this one really does go on lik a roller coaster all the way to the slam bang finish that leads into part three.  All around the perfect movie.  Grade: A+""Back To The Future: Part III"" (1990): Although this is my least favorite of the series, it's a wonderful movie and closes off the series rather wonderfully.  This movie really gives Thomas F. Wilson a chance to show his talent and also adds the very loveable Mary Steenburgen as a romantic possibility for Doc.  It all comes down to an exciting, sorta sad/sorta happy ending that sends off the entire trilogy beautifully.  Grade: A-The DVD set was somethng I anticipated for a very long time, and it didn't dissapoint, even with the totally overblown framing issue (which is no longer an issue as it has been corrected).  The digital remastering was miles above my overwatched, grainy videos of the trilogy and the sound was very exciting.  The features also didn't dissapoint.  The commentaries are all very interesting, and I really enjoyed the audio conversations.  The documentarys, especially the 45 minute ""Making The Trilogy"" (which is split into three parts, one part per movie), are real fun and full of information.  The movies also come equipped with outtakes that are actually funny (in the case of the first one, outrageously funny) and plenty of exciting deleted scenes.I gotta say, Universal may not be my favorite company when it comes to DVDs, but they really did it right when they made this set.  We get three incredible movies in excellent quality for a good price.  How can you say no?Overall Grade: A+"	5.0	This Is The Greatest Trilogy Ever	2006-01-27	8	7	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AHKFKIA5V9QH	Ben	Is there no quality control at Universal? Like many others who bought this box set immediately after it was released, I was very disappointed to find out (after it was released) that there were misframed shots in the widescreen editions of Parts II and III. I've never come across this problem with any other major studio release before, and it's quite disappointing to see a major DVD release such as this one suffering from this problem.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A31I3HXMD5H1EL	Benjamin J Burgraff	"If there was ever a film series that was meant to be viewed together, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy is it! Delightfully madcap, the misadventures of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, in his signature role), and his mentor, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd, achieving well-deserved stardom), tweak not only the time travel genre, but westerns, family comedies, rock n' roll, and Hollywood's concept of life in the future, as well, while taking viewers on an exhilarating ride!Sadly, in the initial release of the 3-disc set, there were formatting problems on BTTF Part 2 and Part 3, but Universal has corrected the errors, and the entire series looks terrific, now!'Back to the Future', the first of the trilogy, is the best, of course, introducing the McFly family (nerdy father Crispin Glover and repressed mother Lea Thompson, both playing characters years older than their actual ages, are terrific!), and villain Thomas F. Wilson (every kid's nightmare bully, grown up). Escaping terrorists who 'kill' Doc Brown, young Marty is launched in a souped-up DeLorean back to 1955, where he accidently disrupts history, interrupting his younger, but still nerdy father and oversexed and curious mother's falling in love (she falls for Marty, instead). Now Marty must not only return to the future to 'save' Doc Brown, but he must unite his future parents, before his family disappears, forever! (Watch for a young Billy Zane in a bit part, as one of Wilson's gang!)'Back to the Future, Part II', filmed four years the original, replaces Glover (who made some insane salary demands) with Jeffrey Weissman (who isn't really seen much), and Claudia Wells (who had taken a hiatus from acting), as Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, with Elizabeth Shue (who would achieve stardom a few years later), and picks up where the first film ends; Doc Brown recruits Marty and Jennifer to journey to 2015 to 'rescue' their future kids! The overly convoluted plot (this is the weakest of the trilogy, although the most inventive, in many ways) has the evil Biff getting hold of a sports almanac from the future, amassing a fortune, and 'punishing' the McFly family, starting back in 1955. Marty must again return to the past to straighten things out, and prevent Biff from ultimately murdering his father and marrying his mother! Then, to top things off, Doc Brown and the DeLorean disappear, thrown back to 1885, and stranding Marty in 1955!'Back to the Future, Part III' is a terrific finale, as Marty, aided by 1955's Doc Brown, travels back to 1885, to rescue the 1985 version. Doc, meanwhile, falls in love with feisty school marm Mary Steenburgen, and must, with Marty's help, change history to prevent her dying, while Marty deals with Biff's evil ancestor. A climax with a time-travelling locomotive brings the trilogy to an exciting conclusion!There are a LOT of extras in this DVD package, including documentaries from the initial release of the films and DVD exclusives; a in-depth interview with Michael J. Fox about his participation (On the first film, filmed simultaneously while he was starring on 'Family Ties', on TV: ""I was sleeping two hours a night, but I was 22!""); a commentary track with writer/producer Bob Gale and producer Neil Canton; another audio track, featuring a live college discussion with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis; outtakes and some really hilarious bloopers; and more!This is a dream presentation of a dream series, and if you haven't bought your DVD player yet, BUY one! This collection is THAT good, and VHS simply can't touch it!With the 'Back to the Future' DVD Collection, to paraphrase the movies, ""The Future is here!"""	5.0	Time to go Back to the Future, Again!	2002-12-09	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1V54RKOJSB79C	Bernard Dy	I bought this because I was a teen back when it first came out and it was one of those iconic films of the 80's. With my kids now approaching their teens, I wanted to start going through all the classics of my time and share them. I had put this trilogy in my cart and was planning to pick it up a few days later and was quite pleasantly surprised when just before summer hit the item went on sale, dropping the price further (not that it would have made a difference, Amazon's regular price was already a few dollars lower than one of the retail stores where I'd seen it).We have now watched the first two of the trilogy and I must say that although I cannot disagree with critics that feel the first film is the best, I must also concede that the series as a whole has aged remarkably well. It remains collectively entertaining and inventive; perhaps Zemeckis's best work. Good performances all around, and fun for all ages, though there is a little cussing (some of which make up part of one of my favorite quotes of all time from George McFly). And I'd forgotten how dark the second film gets.I won't get into plots and such here as you'll find plenty of that elsewhere. But the films look pretty good on Blu Ray and at Amazon's price I can't complain. Repeated viewings are also worthwhile as each time I seem to find little sight gags that I missed on previous viewings, all three are filled with them. I've been reading some of the reviews of the film elsewhere and can't believe how bad the ratings are from some critics...if you had to choose between the millions of crap films made in the 80's and this trilogy, it's not even a contest.	5.0	A great series that has aged well	2013-06-08	1	1	0

I've also read some things about the widescreen format being wrong. If it is, I sure didn't notice a difference. I have recently watched the VHS version and to me it seems like your getting more picture than the VHS version. I didn't buy this because it was widescreen, I bought it because I really enjoy all 3 of these movies. And is rating it lower gonna effect Universal?

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1ONX8Z6NY20IM	bigdub_1	"This review has very little to do with the quality of the films.  Without question, the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is the greatest film trilogy ever made.  If you disagree, it is not because you have a different opinion; it is because you are wrong.  As far as the discs themselves go, they are top-notch as well.  It is easy to see that much time and effort went into making each film's presentation as amazing as humanly possible.  The extras are also of high quality.  What makes this package unworthy is the casing the discs are housed in.  On the plus side of things, I highly doubt it is possible to pick up a single copy of this set and there be a single disc loose.  However, there is a reason for this.  It is as if the casing were engineered to keep the discs from ever leaving, even when its owner wished to re-experience the 1.21 gigawatts of awesome each film contains.  If you are not careful, YOU WILL BREAK A DISC.  I have successfully removed my discs from their sad prison without damage, but I fear not many will be so lucky.  Again, the discs themselves are wonderful.  The casing is, simply put, manure.  And I hate manure."	3.0	Blu Ray Packaging Extremely Temperamental	2010-10-29	12	8	4

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AKOZ8T5S6DFEF	Brad	When I received this for Christmas the year of its release, I was unaware of the framing issues.  I had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements.  On top of that, there were warbling sound issues with part 2, and the Michael J. Fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu.(This was reported on many websites)  Also, the trailers were all full screen, not widescreen.  Apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release.  The thing that angers me the most is that since I couldnt return part 1 to universal initially, ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen....ughhhh.  I can live with it in fullscreen and I am not gonna exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with Universal.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AYQP8XMHTG2YR	Brandon J. Smith	I'm not a particularly picky DVD/Blu-Ray buyer. If the price is fair, all I really need is for the movie (or tv show) to be presented at a high level of quality. The other aspect of a set that satisfies me is if the makers demonstrate a respect for the customer by showing they've made a real effort to provide a good product. This can be done through good/plentiful extras, by cleaning up the audio, sharpening the image, or just by giving cool and functional packaging.In all regards but one, the Back to the Future Trilogy Blu-Ray set comes through with top marks. My one criticism is of the strange disc holders that make removing the disc an unnecessary test of patience and coordination. Why the discs can't be held in a normal, easy to remove/replace way, I just don't understand.That said, look at everything else: The movies, of course, are amazing. The first one is the best, but both sequels are fantastic, as well, adding to the story and not just rehashing the first movie. The picture quality is stellar, as is the sound. For those who like to delve into extras, there are more than enough. Universal has done right by this trilogy and has created a set that fans will really enjoy and be proud to have in their collection.	5.0	Great Series Done Right	2012-08-22	3	3	0

The movies are classics, they're beautifully remastered for the new format and there's plenty of great extras here.  But there's stuff to be desired. The set has all of the extras the DVD Trilogy set had, plus some more great stuff like the now defunct ride footage.  But the biggest problem I have with this set is that the packaging leaves much to be desired when you compare it to the sleek, elegant, and clean look of the DVD's box.  Plastered with colorful artwork and stuff it just looks, well, corny. It's also bulky with the flip-open cover on the outer box and the flimsy inner plastic cases leave much to be desired in the quality department.  Then you try and to remove the discs.  You know how with most disc removal you slightly press on the inner circle and lift the disc out by its edges?  Not the case here. Here you... Well, I'm not sure what you're SUPPOSED to do but I ended up just having to, slightly, bend the disc to get it out of its berth; the discs are in three double-layered plastic cases. (The BD itself and the ""digital copy"" DVD on the lower tray.)  Probably the best idea here is to remove the discs and swap them out with the DVDs in the older set. You get a nicer, more elegant, box with easier to use disc holders to boot.  Put the DVDs with their ROM counterparts in the BD case and store it, leaving the BDs in the old DVD case.And then there's the BIG issue. No. Swag. Not a big deal until you do a Google search for ""Back to the Future BlueRay"" and ""collectors edition"" or ""Region 2"" or something along the lines and see what Britons and people in Europe get. A box filled with goodies like reproductions of the news papers seen in the trilogy, lenticular photos, and a mini sports almanac.  With all due respect, it's a bit silly that an American made movie, American actors (yes, Fox is Canadian) and released in America gets a bare-bones set like this to comparatively loaded UK Swag-filled R2 box.  There's even a R2 set that comes with a model of the DeLorean.Back to the Future Trilogy Limited Edition Collector's Tin- That's what they get in Region 2/Europe. Where's OURS, Universal?So while here the movies are great, the transfers great, the discs' extra features great the cheesy box (in both design and execution), the incomprehensible disc trays and the lack of Swag-Filled special editions leaves one scratching his head.  Buy this set, for sure, if you're fan of the movies but just know that it could have been better, may someday likely BE better with a future release and you may need to consider moving the discs to cases that you can use without risking damaging the discs."	3.0	Quality or Quantity?	2010-10-26	12	10	2

It's a poor design, and you may want to hold off until they are released individually in standard Blu Ray cases.I bought some replacement cases to store the Discs in, but wish I had artwork to insert in the cases.Would be great if Universal Pictures offered standard Blu Ray replacement cases with artwork to solve this problem.	4.0	Tabs broken on Case	2010-11-16	6	4	2

GET OVER IT. These movies are highly entertaining and I'm not gonna sit and wonder why I only see 1/2 of a tree instead of all of it or whatever, that's just plain dumb.  The extras are great and seeing michael j fox talking about these movies in 2002 is nice..theres even a Parkinson's commericial with Mohamed Ali and Fox that is actually comical despite the serious issue it talks about.  BTTF III is the weakest of the three..I think they could've just skipped making that one and nobody whould have noticed story-wise.

All 3 are superb movies, and are fun for the whole family! I'm suprised that not too many people liked the 2nd one, because it was really good! The 1st one's still the best though, that I do agree!Summary: Back To the Future: Marty(Fox) gets sent back 30 years into the past! His only hope to get back to the future(1985) is Dr. Emmet L. Brown(Lloyd)!Back To the Future Part 2: Marty(Fox) and Dr. Brown(Lloyd) go to the year 2015 to fix a problem with their family. Marty spots a sports almanac from 1950-2000. He wants to take it back with him, but Dr. Brown stops him. But, Biff(Wilson), takes the book in the time machine, brings it back to himself when he was young, and tells himself to place bets. When Marty and the Doc. get back to 1985, they are in a alternate universe, they must go back to the time that young Biff got his hands on that book! A great sequel!Back To the Future Part 3: Marty finds Doc.'s grave and goes back to 1885 where the doc. is! He must bring him home, before Mad Dog Tannen(Wilson) kill him.Three great movies, to make the best sequel I've ever seen!

Spielberg, R. Zemeckis, the production staff, all the actors: M.J. Fox, L. Thompson, C. Lloyd, M. Steengburgen, C. Glover, T.F. Wilson and all the crew.What may happen if suddenly you find yourself stuck 30 years ago and being responsible for the falling in love of your parents? Would you be able to do it? Your own existence is is jeopardy!The second movie has even more special effects and a interesting sight of our possible future, 30 years (again) but in the future. And a sight of an alternative present which remids us we are the architects of our own future.The third one, the most hilarious of all, has another trip back in time 100 years in the past. Where Dr. Brown finds his match, makes some contrbuiton to the science of that time, and finnally found another way to travel in time...Definitely one of the best trilogies ever made, I just don't know why it took them so long to release the DVD, I hope the additional material is as good (or even better) as the movies.	5.0	One of the best SciFi Stories ever told...	2002-06-25	10	9	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AKVU4HUG6AN1U	"""chick_flick"""	"""Back to the Future"" is one of my all-time favorite sci-fic trilogies. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Speilberg, it's a true classic.""BACK TO THE FUTURE""PLOT SUMMARY: In the first chapter, we are introduced to young, high school student, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), who befriends a ""mad scientist"", Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's latest invention is a time machine, which looks like a car. When Doc and Marty go out to test the invention, Doc gets shot, and for protection from the shooters, Marty jumps into the time machine, not realizing that the machine has been marked for the year 1955, when his now, divorced parents (popular mom, nerdy dad) met and fell in love. When he is sent back into 1955, it is up to Marty to get his parents back together before he and his siblings completely vanish from a photo, which means they never existed.""BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II""The second chapter is a bit more confusing, since Marty must go back and forth through time.PLOT SUMMARY: Marty and Doc are back in 1985, but not for long. Doc soon goes through time on his own and comes back to warn Marty about his future. Marty is married to his high school girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), but his future son is in danger with the law. So Marty and Doc (along with Jennifer) travel to the year 2015, where Marty is supposed to fix a deal with Biff Tannen's (Thomas F. Wilson), the bully who used to pick on Marty's dad in high school, grandson. The elderly Biff picks up a sports almenac that Marty bought in an antique shop in the year 2015, and travels back to 1955 to show his young self how to get rich. When Marty and Doc learn of this, Marty must go back to 1955 to retreive the almenac, before Biff changes history. Little does he know that damage has already been done, when he goes back to 1985 to learn that his whole life and hometown of Hill Valley has completely changed...with Biff as a wealthy leader, Marty's father is dead, and Marty's mother has been married to Biff! Now, once again, Marty must go back to 2015 to get back the almenac and not only save his future, but also his family's as well.""BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART III""PLOT SUMMARY: In the final conclusion of the trilogy, Doc has always dreamed of living in the Old West of the 1880s, so he travels back through time on his own. However, when Marty discovers that Doc's life might come to an end if he stays there, Marty must go back in time to rescue Doc. Unfortunately for Marty, Doc has fallen in love with a school teacher, Clara Clayton (Mary Steeburgen), and Marty has gotten himself in a duel against Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), one of Biff's ancestors. Now it's up to Marty to face his fears once and for all, and to pursue Doc to come home where he'll be safe.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: What is there to say? I love the complete trilogy. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb...Michael J. Fox is in his best role (er, ""roles"") to-date, and Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson are stand-outs. For 80's technology, the special effects are excellent. The storylines are funny, smart, creative, and original. The directing, producing, writing...everything is wonderful! The films provide twists, excitement, humor, action, and adventure! Perhaps ""Part II"" was the weakest of the three, mostly though because they tried bunching too much into one film. And you'll probably only enjoy ""Part III"", depending on how much you like Westerns films. But all three films are spectacular and you must own this DVD set!The DVD's special features, by the way, include a detailed discussion with Michael J. Fox, hilarious outtakes, deleted scenes, commentaries, Q&A; by the films' writer/producer, ""Hoverboard"" tests, a complete making of the trilogy, animated anecdotes, music videos, evolution of the special effects, behind-the-scenes of each film, DVD-ROM extras, and the films are digitally remastered. The DVD is available in wide screen and full frame formats.I highly recommend the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy.Score of all three:100/100A+"	5.0	The greatest adventure ride through time traveling ever!	2003-01-13	1	0	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A25TDEGIPHZTZS	"chris banez lim ""Crutchead"""	"This boxed set of the three BACK TO THE FUTURE films is a must-have for anybody who have their own personal little library of DVD's.I guess in the whole history of Movie-dom, this not only comes as one of the best TRILOGIES ever, but I never find anything that equates it as to how well it have come up with such a very wonderfully amazing spin of the time-travel continuity fiction plotline, that builds up to an even more comedicaly complicated execution in its storyline structure by its sequel, from an already intense storyline.A lot of great salutations to film director Robert Zemeckis who also wrote the screenplay along with Bob Gale. Definitely not only one of their best work, but in the whole genre of movie-making absolutely.Another aspect that made BACK TO THE FUTURE work out so well is the blessed instance wherein they got more than lucky with the cast that they have pulled out to star in the movie. The DVD's extra features have also dwelled about this matter and how nearly they got into not having Michael J. Fox who's the only perfect star to play the part of Marty McFly. Furthermore it's even amazing that they have been so well with having some elements and scenes well incorporated to the sequels. A lot of certain details and peculiarities are also discussed/featured in this boxed set's extra features. This had got to be seen to be believed. Although there have been a few changes, such as the one for the part of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer - most f the cast remain intact. `Tis peculiar though that Marty on the scene where in he just got back from the past, and seeing his girlfriend by the garage exclaimed ""you look different"", something that went unnoticed - anyhow I guess that explains it in the plotline of sorts, being that some changes did occurred in the movie's story.And another real notable thing about the movie is the great performance of Crispin Glover who played the part of Marty's geeklish dad George McFly.Anyhow, everyone in the cast is great, and most excellently Mr. Christopher Lloyd as the goofy prof Dr. Emmett Brown.In passing, kudos to those who've comprised on the making of the movie, mainly to Robert Zemeckis (who's work in producing the pre-LOTR directorial flick of  Peter Jackson THE FRIGHTENERS which also stars Michael J. Fox is also such a splendid job)... and , oh what's that- a  certain Steven Spielberg on the credits. Well , he really did nothing but executively produce this flick - which I guess did quite enough of a bit of a not-so useless help for the flick in Hollywood politics. So much for the great Mr. Jaws director in taking too much credit and applause.In toto- this movie trilogy is one of the best there is, a total classic. Indeed."	5.0	t  i  m  e  l  e  s  s	2006-01-09	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2JQ7HJ1SEHYY9	chris horan	"I also feel compelled to clarify the widescreen/fullscreen debate on this release.  The simple point: if you want to see the movie as it was in the theater, get the widescreen version.  In some movies (probably including these), you do in fact get more picture on the top and bottom in the fullscreen format (see Air Force One) but still lose some on either side.  These were filmed in Super-35, I believe, and that extra footage on the top and bottom is ""junk footage"".  Watch some behind-the-scenes on virtually any movie and you'll see the monitor that the director watches and it usually has some sort of white frame on the screen.  What's inside the frame will be seen in theaters.  With Super-35, the ""junk footage"" is added back in to the fullscreen VHS or DVD release.  Of course you then run the risk of seeing mistakes, ie: boom mikes that didn't fall into the white frame on the director's monitor.  Bottom line:  if you're any sort of movie lover and like your movies how they're supposed to be seen, how the director INTENDED them to be seen, get the widescreen format."	5.0	one last clarification...	2002-10-04	42	32	10
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1FKCBXTUDNH3D	Chris Macias	"The package arrived quickly, courtesy of my Amazon Prime account.  The movies came in a tri-fold case, with a shiny cover sleeve. I like the artwork on the package, simple and not cluttered.  To my surprise upon opening up the package, I found six discs, three are the actual blu-ray movies, and the others are the ""Digital Copy"" versions.. You need these discs to be loaded up into your computer before you can download them.  I am sure these discs are there as some sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM). I was expecting a leaflet with a code and website to download from, but that just may be my expectation derived from my Downloadable Content (DLC) experiences from game consoles.The film seemed grainy, the audio however was superb. I dont have a fancy setup, I watch my Blu-Rays using my Playstation 3 connected to my TV via HDMI. It seems that the movie studios are taking a generic approach to the menu options.While there were some animations, it felt very similar to other Blu-Ray menus, which i suppose is fine, kind of bland and boring in my opinion. I really dislike the load new movie previews from the Internet, fortunately if you mash the menu button you can bypass most of these.The films themselves have aged well, as they still manage to keep me entertained from start to finish. I did not notice any aspect ratio issues, that other reviewers pointed out. All in all a solid product, and an awesome set of movies. I would recommend to anyone who has a blu-ray player, based on my audio experience alone."	5.0	Blast from the Past	2011-06-18	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1KL7KX0TMR3OC	Chris M.	Tihs is my all time favorite movie trilogy and I was ecstatic when it was released on DVD.PROS:I am very happy with the quality of this Blu ray. As you may understand, this quality didnt exist when the movie was released. A studio had to remaster the video and sound of this movie frame by frame. This is a very tough job, and tougher to do it this well. From the moment I hit play, it was like I was watching the movie for the first time. (Ok maybe not the FIRST time but close enough). Digital copy is a heaven sent plus. I love digital copies. The quality is better than a lot of the digital copies I own.CONS: When you enjoy a movie like this much you like to view the extras. Some of these extras seem to be unprofessionally short and unedited. Some features, from the moment you hit play to the moment youre back in the menu only about a minute passes. Some features have no narration and just makes you feel short changed. It feels like they put all their resourced in making the movie look great and then ran out of $ to make decent extras. This is the reason I did not give it 5 stars.Overall I think this is a great Blu Ray trilogy and would recommend it to anyone.	4.0	Amazing quality and digital copy! Poor Extras	2011-06-28	1	0	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ABUIGI1ZORZ61	Christian E. Cajas	There are other movies involving time machines but none of them seems to include a realism to the character's emotions as deep as this trilogy. It also does a better job at explaining time travel paradoxes.Out of all three movies part II is my favorite, because of all the different scenarios, and the way events from the first movie occur simultaneously with the second, something never done before. You'll spend hours watching these movies because of the audio commentary. The staff brings up many interesting ideas that weren't used in the movies as well as anecdotes and personal thoughts (such as, how will they feel when the real 2015 comes around). One bad point about the extra features: the Q&A; sessions are a little dull, and in the third movie it ended in just 25 minutes.	5.0	The best time-travel movies ever made	2004-11-30	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2N84VEBTQFDSU	"C.J. Roger ""C.J. Roger"""	"Back to the Future, one of the best and most creative film trilogies of all time has made it to DVD, giving it the format it has been longing for.The Back to the Future series of films stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a young 17 year old teenager who gets trapped in a non stop romp traveling through time in a souped up DeLorean sports car time machine. And also joining him is, Christopher Lloyd, portraying Dr. Emmett L. Brown,the inventor of said time machine, a white haired and wild eyed scientist who no one ever took seriously.Back to the Future (1) starts off in 1985 where Marty meets up with  Doc in a Shopping Mall parking lot one night, when something goes wrong and unexpected visitors arrive, Marty has to speed away without delay. As the speedometer on the car reaches 88 mph in speed, the DeLorean and Marty are suddenly transported in time to the year 1955. Marty meets his soon to be parents, (Played by Lea Thompson and Chrispen Glover respectively) has a run in with the bully, Biff Tannen (portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson),  that has always made sure to keep his father down and has to figure out how to fix damage he has done to his own existence through  his interactions with his future to be parents.  If that wasn't bad enough he still has to find a way to get back to his own time in a time machine that has no nuclear power left to operate it. It truly is a great story and movie for all ages, one that you will want to watch often.Back to the Future Part II picks up right where the first left us. After getting back to 1985, Marty's present has changed for the better. Unable to even get a moment to relax though Doc arrives in his drive way telling him that his future is in jeopardy and off they zoom to the year 2015, where Marty finds that he has children and has to deal with Griff, the grandson of Biff, find  a way to fix his own future which hasn't turned out as great as he hoped and prevent himself from being seen in the process. He buys a sports almanac that will tell the results of all the sporing events up to the end of the century. When Doc disapproves he tosses the book away only to wind up in a now very old Biff Tannen's hand. Old Biff steals the time machine, hands it to his teenage self in 1955 and when Marty and Doc return to 1985 it is a world they don't recognize. Biff is rich, married to Marty's mother and Marty's father has been killed. They must once again return to 1955 and prevent Biff from ever getting the almanac so they can save the present and future forever. A great sequel overall that keeps the BTTF flavor that we loved in the first and even revisits the old movie within. Seeing the DeLorean fly was also quite cool and the story is a lot of fun. A movie to watch more then once though as it can be confusing at points but it is a wonderful follow up to the first film.Back to the Future Part III is the final movie in the saga. It starts in 1955 where Marty is stranded as Doc while in the time machine got hit by a bolt of lightning and he and the time machine got sent to 1885. Marty must use the DeLorean that has been packed away in a cave by Doc so many years prior and go back in time to rescue Doc from an untimely death. Along his way in the old west, he has to deal with Indians, the founding of his town of Hill valley, a gangster by the name of ""Mad Dog"" Tannen and his friend Doc falls in love with a school teacher named Clara, (Mary Steinburgen) which may put the plans to return to 1985 in Jeopardy. The worst part is the car has no regular gas due to an unforeseen event on Marty's arrival in the old west and now they need to find a way to get a train fast enough to get to the 88mph speed they need for time travel. It's a fitting end to a great trilogy and gives a new taste on BTTF with a lot of old west references and gun battles and a fun ending that won't disappoint.Disks includes a lot of extra features like cut scenes and commentary on both the cut moments and the movies themselves by screenplay writer Bob Gale .  There is the making of the BTTF trilogy, music videos, little pop up snip its that you can have appear to give you facts of moments in the movies.. and much more. The extras alone make the movies worth it, but you get three great movies and the extras all for a great price. Truly one of the best sagas getting the treatment that it has been so long over due for. If there is one set to get for your movie collections it is this one.As Marty would say.. ""This is heavy!"" and I coudln't have said it better myself."	5.0	Marty, you've gotta come back with me...	2004-08-15	4	4	0

If you were a child of the 80's then this is the trilogy for you!	5.0	Riding in the Dolorean	2003-05-17	1	0	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Despite being slightly dated, a lot of the films from the 1980's, such as ""E.T"", ""Gremlins"", ""the Princess Bride"", as well as Robert Zemeckis' ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, manage to be good films in their own right and yet hold a special place because of how often they were watched or how influencing they were to our childhood. While one is the most well-known and best of the 3, each of the films in the trilogy has their own strengths that create a satisfying whole. Combined into one set, you can watch the gigantic time-travelling story and not only have fun in doing so but remembering how strong they were to us growing up.The first film finds Marty McFly, an aspiring musician in 1985, friends with eccentric/brilliant scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, who has just invented something extraordinary: a time-travelling car built out of a DeLorean. But trouble happens and Marty is transported to 1955 and interferes with his mother meeting his father. Not only stuck but having to somehow get his parents together, Marty finds out more about his parents and with the help of Doc, has to get Marty back home.The second film has Marty, along with Doc and Marty's girlfriend Jennifer having to travel to 2015 to correct a familial problem. However, upon returning to 1985, things are incredibly worse and they find out that old Biff Tannen, the bully from the first film, went back in time and allowed his younger self to become rich and powerful. Now Marty and Doc have to correct the timeline while trying to avoid interfering with the actions of their ""other"" selves.The third film has Doc accidentally sent back to 1885 and Marty stranded in 1955. But he founds out Doc ends up getting killed a week after writing a letter to Marty so rather then go home, Marty travels to the Old West to rescue his old friend. However with technology being vastly underdeveloped as well as a possible love interest for Doc and Biff's ancestor wrecking havoc, Marty has to finally get back to his own time and hope Doc wants to come with him.Unlike let's say Pirates of the Caribbean or the Matrix trilogies which felt more like a stand-alone followed by a gigantic film cut in 2, the films in Back to the Future have more of a continuing story but each film feels distinctive unto itself to warrant any watching of any sequel at any time since they're so familiar. But they are separated by cliffhangers and it helps to watch them all to get a feel for the films as a whole. On that note, the first is an undisputed classic that never seems to age despite some relative obviousness of special effects. It's the sequels that become the interesting one since I liked the ingenuity of the second but found it a bit darker, less funny while the third had a good concept and tonally was similar to the first but just not a good story overall. But the films are so enjoyable that it doesn't really matter in the end so it's all fun anyway.Each film contains some good featurettes like a making-of made at the time, a retrospective, a scene-specific (though kind of dull) commentary, a Q&A; commentary track where Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale answer questions from audience members, deleted scenes, a Michael J. Fox subtitle track a la Matrix's ""White Rabbit"" and a trivia track similar to the Abyss. The special features are welcome, unfortunately they just feel slight and don't seem as in-depth as you'd like for such classic films.I'd very much recommend the set for those who loved the films as well as the maybe 3 of you who have never seen it and can enjoy it whenever you want."	5.0	3 classics, one package	2008-03-11	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A186AQVVKCANL5	clwinter	Back to the Future only conjures up extremely fond memories of my childhood so when this baby came out on DVD I had to have it. To my great surprise I found the extras on the DVDs to be just as entertaining as the movies themselves!The movies themselves vary in degree and by far the first one is the best and the most original. The duo of Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc both give witty, funny and unique performances. As Marty accidently goes back in time to 1954, he inadvertently changes his parents' histories which need to be put back on track if Marty wishes to remain in existence. Throw in Biff, the bully, a great chase scene with Marty on a skateboard, and the classic one-liners between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and you have before you a classic.The DVDs present the movies in their original format with no surprises or added scenes. However, the extras on each of the three discs add even more hours of enjoyment. There are interviews with Michael J. Fox, a commentary by the producers during the film if you chose, and, my favorite, Universal ancedotes which pop up during the movie giving little know facts about the making of the movies. There are quite a few deleted scenes on each disc which only add to the storyline, and you can chose to view these scenes with or without commentary. I would recommend doing both. And then of course, there are my personal favorites, the outtakes, which are hilarious and show a side of this movie making experience that cannot be missed.A must buy for any quality DVD collection!	5.0	Great Movies in a Great DVD Package!	2004-07-30	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AV1CUVEAURBXL	"C. Moulton ""Fellow Author"""	"A look at The BACK TO THE FUTURE-TrilogyBy Charles E.J. MoultonSmall town, America. 1955. A young boy saves his friend from a car accident, who thanks him by simply jumping on his bike and driving off into the sunset. Sounds like pure soap opera, fifties style.Yes, but with a twist: the hero is his son and they are both 17 years old.Huh? What was that? 17? Both?Rewind the tape. Marty McFly's friend, the much older Doc Brown, has invented a time machine with the help of plutonium-smuggling Libyans. During a demonstration, Marty McFly is accidentally catapulted thirty years back to a time when his parents were in high school.Oops.The only problem is that he never expected to stand in their way. He interrupted with his parent's first meeting and now Marty has to get his folks back together so he can be born.At first, it doesn't work at all. His Dad is a complete wimp, mobbed by the local bully Biff, and his own mom is in love with... Marty. So it takes a whole lot of courage and pain and playing of love songs on proms to get them back together before he can by the help of a lightning bolt go back to the future, only to find out that he changed his parents: his formerly drunk loser parents are now prime yuppies out for tennis speaking like rich middle-class people. Who are better people? Losers or phoneys? Is the loser more honest because he lost?Wait a minute, there is more. In the second picture, old Doc Brown travels back from the future, 2015, to tell Marty and his girl that their kids are in trouble. They go there to save them, but Marty is tempted by the dark side of the force (sorry, Mr. Lucas). He is chased on a hovering skateboard by Biff's grandchild when he buys an almanac that reveals all sport results of the later half of the 20th century. Doc prevents him from taking it back with him, but evil things lurk in the minds of men and the entire story becomes a very Shakespearian parody.Old Biff steals the book and takes the time vehicle back to the past and gives himself this desirable object. The result is a 1985 Hill Valley Gambling Hell with Biff as the rich devil replacing his murdered father. They accordingly go back to the past to fix this present in the past. They do succeed, run into themselves a couple of times, before burning the book and saving the future.You think this is over? Not yet. Doc's car was struck by lightning and sent back to 1885. Marty has to travel back there, against the Doc's wishes, because he finds out that the Doc was murdered by Biff's great grandfather. He does so, in the process letting Indians rip the fuel line. The result is that he meets his ancestors, his grandpa even pees on him as a baby, in order to find a home in his own town a hundred years back in time. He gets into a fight with Biff's grandpa Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (""I hate that name!""), who challenges him to a duel. The Doc, however, has fallen in love and after the victorious duel he elopes with his Miss Clara Clayton, whilst Marty pushes up to high velocity by a steam train into the present.But there is hope yet.Doc returns with a new invention, prompted by the hover board from the future.He is now the owner of a time steam train.Sound like fun? Yes. It is. Fast, furious and funny.But let's look a little behind the scenes, shall we now? Having read two of Michael J. Fox's biographies, I am a little smarter. He tells us that his now very evident Parkinson's disease comes from an accident in the hanging scene of the third movie. ""Accidents are temporary, film is forever."" These were his exact words.However, we must admire a man who so bravely left Canada to become a star and decided to work day and night on two projects while doing the movie.What about the characters in the film?All Marty's family are losers made winners in the movies, through Marty's timely doing. Biff's family are winners made losers in the movies, also through Marty's doing. There is thus a reverse side to the movies, with Marty undoing ill and doing well. Is it too bad that Marty and Doc are not together at the end? Yes. But Doc was always lonely and now has a family in the only place he ever really truly loved: the old west.Looking at them as a whole, with all of their reversible fun of characters meeting themselves and changing lives, the most interesting part of it is still how the characters can change personality wise according to circumstance and situation.Marty's mother is a drunken housewife who, completely and utterly resigned to a dull poor life, really has given up. But because of loving a man of heroics (Dad prompted by Marty) she turns into the fit, self secure and hip mother in 1985. The hip mother, however, turns into a rich, silicon pumped and frustrated wife in the alternate reality just because wealthy Biff murdered her husband and married her.Biff is a pure sleaze, who has been used to winning all his life and therefore does the same thing he did in the fifties and even gets away with it because no one tells him otherwise. But the fact that Marty's father has the guts to retaliate in 1955 he turns Biff into a meek and shy car mechanic thirty years later.Receiving the book from himself in 1955, moreover, turns him into the evil man we all love to hate.Marty's father is a shy loser in 1985 because no one ever told him he was a capable man. But by receiving the right courage he dares to take the risk he needs and becomes a successful author and eventually a happy, rich grandpa.Marty's problem is that he never lets anyone call him coward. And so he gets into an accident in 1985 that ruins his life. But by the actual intervention of Doc he changes his mind and is able to not get into the accident and thereby make himself a future with his girl without being a loser.TIME magazine was once quoted as saying that these films are like a fugue improvising on the theme of the previous movies.Interesting point, this. A man might change his life if he makes the right decisions. What are the right decisions? Being strong and feeling strong. Having the guts to say: ""Man, I am so talented. I can handle this, all right.""Marty travels close to hundred and fifty years in time to find out that it isn't the main thing to defend yourself against people who judge you ignorantly.Defending yourself to save your soul from ignorance might be the main thing.The main thing is not holding on to your past mistakes and letting your intuition lead the way. Is that what Marty does? Time is illusive and strange and maybe that is what the movies want to teach us. That going on with your life and working from the moment is the most important thing. Don't keep reminding yourself that you did a mistake. Make sure that you don't make the mistake again. Don't be a bully like Biff or as quick in the draw as Marty. Be as good as you possibly can be. Sail through time in your own speed and with your own elegance and eloquence. Don't be intimidated by past mistakes.Don't be so sure that you cannot learn anything from a movie just because pop corn and coke is labeled on the cover of a motion picture. Surprising truths can be found at the backsides of cereal cartons. This little extravaganza about time tells us that hotheads do little good in following grudges.BACK TO THE FUTURE:  Three Motion Pictures  (  1985,  1989,  1990)Director: Robert Zemeckis  Music: Alan Silvestri  Actors: Michael J.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1T3O2LILVK0C4	"Count Orlok '22 "":("""	In 1985, director Robert Zemeckis (Used CarsandRomancing the Stone) released a film that was destined to become not only a summer hit, but also the beginning of a classic comedy trilogy. Back to the Future had it all; a great cast,a brilliant soundtrack, and a clever time travel story. It also didn't hurt that the film was produced by hotshot filmmaker Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind,the Indiana Jones films, andE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) and the original story was written by Bob Gale (1941), who was first inspired by looking through his father's old high school yearbook.Back to the Future - 1985`80s teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back in time to the 1950s when his parents were his age. Desperate to return to the future, he looks up Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the eccentric inventor who would later create the time machine. But things become complicated when Marty fortuitously alters history, preventing his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) from falling in love with his father, George (Crispin Glover). With Marty's very existence at stake, Doc prepares an elaborate setup that will send Marty back to the future but Marty must first unite his parents while avoiding high school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson).Naturally after the success of Back to the Future, both Robert Zemeckis and Universal Studios wanted to make a sequel. Universal got more than they bargained for when Zemeckis offered to direct two sequels. With Back to the Future Part II, writer Bob Gale decided to tell a more complicated story that dealt with the consequences of altering the timeline. The film was unfairly criticized for its complex story and the dark vision of an alternate 1985, but it still was rewarded with commercial success and it built up anticipation for the third film. Back to the Future Part III took the characters to the Old West and returned to the more lighthearted comedy/romance of the first film, but it ended unsatisfactorily with the destruction of the time machine.Back to the Future Part II - 1989Doc Brown returns from the future to warn Marty that his future children are in great danger. He, Marty, and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) travel from the year 1985 into the year 2015 in order to save Marty's children, Marlene and Marty Jr. (Michael J. Fox) from the corruptive influence of Biff's grandson, Griff (Thomas F. Wilson). Biff steals the time machine and travels into the past. When Marty and Doc return to 1985, they arrive in their hometown to find that it's become a haven for crime and disorder. Biff rules the town, and worse, he's married to Marty's mother. Now, Doc and Marty must travel back to 1955 to correct the timeline and restore the future to its normal state.Back to the Future Part III - 1990After the time machine is struck by lightning and Doc is sent back in time to the year of 1885, Marty seeks the aid of Doc in the year 1955 so that he can repair the time machine. But Marty discovers that the Doc in 1885 was murdered by Biff's pugilistic ancestor, Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). Marty travels back to 1885 to rescue Doc, who's living out his dream of life in the Old West. Doc's fallen in love with a schoolteacher, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), and Marty must now convince him to return to the future.The Back to the Future trilogy has become one of the most successful trilogies ever made, as well as being one of the greatest examples of time travel in films. Blessed with a brilliant ensemble cast headed by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd,a stirring score by Alan Silvestriand amazing special effects, the Back to the Future films are now regarded as classics.The 3-disc DVD set, available in both Widescreen and Full Screen versions*, includes the following bonus features:Disc 1: Back to the FutureThe Making of Back to the Future vintage featurette, Making the Trilogy: Chapter One featurette, Q&A; with Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, an enhanced conversation with Michael J.

Rather than preserving the original aspect ratios of the films, the DVD technicians simply placed black bars over the Full Screen version of films (theFull Screen versionof the trilogy was not affected by this error). The accident caused an outpouring of complaints by so many fans that in 2005, Universal released a corrected version of the complete trilogy.	4.0	Classic Comedy at 88 Miles Per Hour	2008-09-16	2	1	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	The DVD is an ideal medium for box sets of this type.  The films look great, sound great, and there's the nice bonus features to keep the fans of the film entertained for many additional hours.  There are two commentaries per DVD, and luckily the participants in the commentaries (Zemeckis, Gale, et al.) are interesting and have some good stories/insights.  There are also a number of little documentaries, on a variety of topics.Clearly, the first Back to the Future is the jewel of the series - fun, fresh (at the time), with outstanding performances that catch just the right spirit.  Both Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) and Christopher Lloyd (as Doc Brown) get right into their characters and we have fun because they are having fun.  The time travel is pretty simplistic and follows the one timeline rule - if you change something in the past, the future you know will be altered by it (see the Terminator films, Star Trek, etc.).  However, the filmakers wisely avoid explaining time travel in detail, which is a smart move because it isn't really a science fiction film, but a comedy.Back to the Future II is much more a polished exercise in filmaking, and it feels somewhat like a technical exercise.  Because the timeline winds back and forth between 4 time periods (including two different versions of the year 1985), it certainly benefits from a second or third viewing.  Watch it to admire the technical skill, and the deft juggling of the time travel - Marty gets to watch himself play at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, for example - and try to avoid the cynical thought that the filmakers are just trying to repackage the 1st film to make more money.I was very disappointed in the third film when I saw it in the theatres, but it's growing on me since then.  It is still the weakest of the three - it's a little thin on plot and the dialogue is definitely below the standard of the first two.  However, it comes together with a fitting if artificially cheerful conclusion at the end.	4.0	Great to see these films again after all these years	2003-12-12	3	3	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"I think this is the way to buy this set.  The widescreen version originally had a problem with the last two movies, and I wouldn't get that until I knew for sure it was fixed.  Besides, since these are movies kids will appreciate most, the full screen versions tend to be what kids like (even though I always prefer widescreen).What I discovered is that my younger children did not know these movies.  I wondered if there being twenty years old would keep them from enjoying them.  I shouldn't have worried.  They enjoyed them immensely.  There were some cultural references that they did not get until I explained them (more from the 50s than the 80s), but that helped them gain some perspective on how culture changes over time.Unlike ""The Lord of the Rings"", this was never meant to be series of movies.  However, the huge global success of the first film led to the other two.  One evidence that a sequel was never planned is discussed in one of the extras.  It was pointed out that if they were setting up a sequel in the last scene of the first film, they would not have brought Marty's girlfriend in the car.  Having her there created tremendous problems in the second film, as you know if you have seen that film.The first film was inspired by the notion of a teenager discovering that his parents were once his age.  The time travel is the means to make that discover happen.  While the danger of changing the future is always there, it doesn't always have to be for the worse.  It sets up some very interesting notions about time travel, but it isn't really a movie about that or special effects.  It is about growing up in whatever time one lives and finding a deeper connection with one's parents and their lives.The second film begins in the future (building on the ending of the first film).  Because of something Marty was thinking about doing there and Biff acts on, the whole of history is changed again, and this time for the worse.  Doc Brown and Marty have to go back and prevent that change from occurring.  This leads to some very complex plotting because we have Marty's parents living their lives, Marty from the first film doing his thing, and now Marty from the second film coming back there to try and undo what Biff from the future has set in motion.  We learn from the extras about how hard these shots were to accomplish using the new Vistaglide from ILM.  Nowadays, it would be easy in digital, but unavailable in 1988.The third film was shot while the second film was in editing.  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is the romantic lead in this film!  It is set in the old west.  At the end of the second film the flying time machine is struck by lightening and disappears.  Moments afterward a car drives up from Western Union delivering a letter they had on file for seventy years.  Brown explains to Marty that he is happy in the past and to not come for him, but tells him how he can get home to his time in 1985.  But Marty learns that Brown was murdered shortly after the letter was written and is determined to go back and get him.The problem is how to get from 1885 to 1995 without any gasoline to get the car up to 88 mph and how to get there before Doc is killed.  Do they make it?The extras are interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films.  There is commentary that you can listen to for all three films as well as short documentaries, some deleted scenes, and a few outtakes.Buying the movies as a trilogy this way is quite affordable and the extras make it an even better buy.Recommended!  However, beware that in the mid 1980s that most of the successful teen films were ""R"" rated, so the studios made sure there was some swearing (mostly the SH-word) to make it a bit more ""mature"".  It kind of sounds out of place today - which would likely have WORSE language.  These films are rated ""PG"" and that seems right."	5.0	If this isn't a classic yet, it is certainly something close to it - and a lot of fun, too.	2006-12-27	1	0	1

A very smart script, sure.  Though I have seen the film a lot of times, I just go on having the same fun as before!  The characters are lovely, the actors are very good.  The script is just genial, one of the best ever written.  You cannot get bored, even if you have seen it hundreds of times.What else can be said?  It's just great.People here seem to like better the first part.  To me, the best part is the second.  By far.  Is a more inteligent script (still!), someone could get confused by the story and changes of time and all of that, but it is so well, and clear, and easily explained in the film, that you understand it and don't even notice how easily.  The first is very good too, anyway.The third part, as someone wrote here, you like it depending on how much you like westerns.  I don't, but the film is still very funny, though is the part I like the less.That's everything.  If you haven't seen it, do it.  It is really great fun.	5.0	the best thriology	2002-12-18	2	0	2

Pricing on amazon is a good bargain for a collectors edition like this one.The only downside I can think of is the non-inclusion of a bonus disc with stuff like making, commentary and such.	5.0	Classic Trilogy...very good transfer to blu ray	2013-12-27	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ALNRJZMNHMJD7	Curt Remmel	"Back to the future is perhaps the best fantasy/comedy/adventure flick to date! And a great 80s' montage, as well (God, is this really almost 20 years old??). Along, with, of course ""Gremlins"", ""Ghostbusters"", John Hughes' movies and ""Miami Vice""... But what makes this movie special is, that it seems to have aged a lot less than the other movies of its time - which is a tremendous achievement keeping in mind that this movie somewhat ""boasted"" with its time-travel special effects. The trick is, effects shouldn't manipulate the movie. Zemeckis was a genius ahead of his time, too many directors haven't learnt this lesson even yet. Why don't they make movies LIKE THIS anymore? Just set a likeable character (college kids seem to work well) in a predicemen, and let him work and stumble - the balance is essential; needs to be comedic, but not a farce - his way out of it through a 1000 minor and major situations and setbacks. All right, this guy ""grows up to be"" an unlikely hero, but do NOT reward him too much in the end (yeah, yeah, ""rolemodels for the kids"", blah blah. There is a surplus of ""educational"" movies, no need to to be ramming it down everybodys' throats every possible chance!). And do NOT forget the darker issues, even a little grown-up material. Only the really-really-unimportant side characters are to be card-board stereotypes. Special effects come LAST. Keep up the pace, etc etc.  BTTF can also boast with its pace: comedic stuff from the starts and about a dozen ""endings"": great sentimental peak when George FINALLY punches Biff->We move to Marty having to play the guitar->the kissing scene (with a delay and a twist)->Johnny B. Goode-> and only THEN we move to ""going home"" with its problems- more than just a few plus running against the clock... and yet, after the ""happy end"" we're left with a great closing scene! Talk about a roller-coaster-ride! Your hands squeezing the nearest pillow. ANY more suspense or action and you'd and up a nerve-rack. Action, adventure and comedy, fitting for all ages. If you don't like this movie, there there just has to be something really wrong with you."	1.0	Great 80s' montage!	2009-10-01	5	0	5

Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc and it's so good to see Michael J Fox before his parkenson's became evident. I think the 1st and 3rd movies are the best but you won't fully understand the 3rd without watching the 2nd movie. My favorite is Back to the Future 3. Doc gets a great role in that movie, and hey it's got everything! Romance, cowboys, Indians, shoot out, music, dancing, train crash and oh the flux capacitor too!Small amount of swearing in the movies and some cleavage but nothing too objectionable.	5.0	Fun to watch trilogy	2013-04-22	0	0	0

My review is for the 25th anniversary Bluray edition.I like the concept and the discs themselves is not bad. I would have given it 5 stars but I'm giving it a 4 because of the casing in which they come. There is an outer cover made of cardboard (seems very cheap) and you cannot hold it without having the discs slide down from it all the time. Also the way the discs are held together is very weird. If it wasn't for the included instructions on getting the discs out I would have probably broken them due to the bad design or my frustration!Could have been better!

I don't know which one I like better cause there so different from each other, but of course they would be nothing without the 1st one.The 1st one is a classic. The 2nd one is cool, because they used the time machine a lot and had more effects. The 3rd one is great, because it's a whole new adventure.One of the great things about this DVD for me is that I can see the deleted scenes and all those other extras.Well, I can't wait until 2015 because we're suppose to have flying cars like in part 2.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1HX00DL0SZM1G	"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer"""	"Ever since the DVD format was launched in the early months of 1997 there have been movies that have been among the most requested, the Holy Grails of DVD if you like. Initially these included such titles as BRAVEHEART (in 1999 a website was launched with the sole purpose of persuading Paramount to release the Oscar winner on the small shiny discs) before the mountain relented and released the epic in 2000. The same was true with WHERE EAGLES DARE, which went through many twists and turns (including a confusion at the studio level over rights) before finally emerging on the format from Warner in 2003.One of the most often requested titles in those early days of DVD was the Steven Spielberg produced BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy and, after several false starts, it eventually made its triumphant arrival in the latter half of 2002, going on to be one of the biggest sellers of that holiday season.Released theatrically from 1985 to 1990 (with episodes 2 & 3 filmed back-to-back) the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies were among the most popular movies to come out of American cinema in the 1980s.With ingenious scripts that were pure brilliance, the cast and crew were obviously having a great deal of fun filming these three movies and it shows on the screen. The humor is infectious and the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) time travel references are definite highlights in these light hearted science fiction classics.""Back to the Future"" featured a great cast from a youthful Micheal J. Fox, to a zany Christopher Lloyd and a gorgeous, beautiful and sexy Lea Thompson.The movies on this set come well recommended, however be warned, the second and third movies feature some bad aspect ratio errors, however these are easy to overlook.I particularly enjoyed the documentary that is split into three sections. Although I would have liked it better presented in the same manner as similar documentaries on the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES sets (ie all together), this is a minor quibble for they are uniformly informative and entertaining.Also of note in this set is an audio track from a lengthy presentation that Director Bob Zemeckis made to a college class on the movies.If you have yet to add this trilogy to your collection, what are you waiting for??

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	This trilogy tells the story of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) adventures through time in a time machine of Doc's invention.  The first film is the best; it has more heart than the others as Marty plays Cupid in the 50s to make sure that his parents fall in love and marry the way they are meant to.  The second film relies more on zaniness as our two heroes rush breathlessly between the past and future trying to correct paradoxes of their own making.  The final film is a let-down; there is some time travel business at the beginning before the story settles down to a standard Western comedy with all of the stereotypical elements.  Strengths of the trilogy include the performances of Fox and Lloyd, lots of complex fun with the time stream, and the many inventive ways that the supporting cast is included.  A weakness is its tendency to go for the easy joke every time, even at the cost of making our hero seem somewhat dim-witted, such as Fox ordering a Pepsi Free in the 50s or ice water in an Old West saloon, hollering in panic like a cartoon character, or flying into uncontrollable rages at the suggestion that he is a coward.	4.0	Part I ****, Part 2 ****, Part 3 ***	2005-04-02	6	2	4

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1FHKTXCB0CKKM	"D. Barreto ""ladydi4476"""	Great Scott!! I've waited for the release of the Back To The Future Trilogy for quite some time now and I couldn't be happier that it's finally here! Yes I know all about the mis-framed widescreen versions, but I've seen all three discs and I don't see anything wrong with them. Not so much that I have to give the dvd set a one star rating or even return the movies. I love these films because of the stories behind them and the acting and the affects. If I can't see every bitty piece of it, I'm not going to get that upset over it. I suppose the only way to truly see the difference is to compare it to a perfectly framed version. In any event, the dvd box set is awesome. The transfer of these pictures look so clear and so colorful and the sound is blowing me away. I am actually hearing sounds in there I'd never heard before and I've seen these movies many many times! The extras are very good as well, I especially love the deleted scenes and outtakes. The menus are very cool too. All in all, I am not gonna get bent out of shape over the whole widescreen issue, I am looking at these films for what they are and for the reason I've loved them for so long. They have great storytelling and humor and well they are just so much fun to watch. BTTF is my all time favorite film and this box set has become my all time favorite dvd, I know that's heavy isn't it? :)	5.0	It's about time!	2002-12-22	3	2	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2E0TJ49NACDBA	DelusionalAngel	"This is very tough to rate fairly.The movies are exactly what any BTTF fan expects them to be.  My hubby was thrilled with the extras and seeing it in blu-ray meant he was noticing little details he'd missed before (and he's such a huge fan that we headed off to the ""Twin Pines Mall"" parking lot before we opened this up, so that's saying something).That said the whole BD Live thing is beyond frustrating.  It was taking forever to load the discs even when our net was at its best, so we turned off BD Live - which improved nothing, then it just whined at us - how dare we turn it off.  I'd love to give this 5 stars given how much this series of movies means to the hubby, but with all of this glitches, I can't.  If you love the series, yes -- you will love the blu-ray quality and the extras, but the BD Live is a pain even if you turn it off it seems to keep trying to worm its way back into your attention and freezes everything up, pause the movie a few seconds too long and it will freeze up,  it's basically a very glitchy set up and was actually the first thing I've had to return to Amazon in the decade or so I've been using them... The second copy was a bit better, but it has also frozen multiple times.  The stars it does get are for the movies, extras, and behind the scenes stuff (5 stars there)... if I were rating it solely on their BD live set up, it'd be 1 star as that was implemented very poorly."	3.0	The movies and extra are fine but...	2012-01-05	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A36MEL70EEFBFS	D. FURLANO	Although I'd like to echo what so many of you have said (that this Back to the Future series is absolutely awesome), I'm actually writing to correct a statement in an earlier review.  The reviewer from Australia stated that the BTF widescreen edition is achieved by chopping the top and bottom off of the full screen edition.This is not correct:  the full screen edition is the one that is cropped--the sides of the widescreen picture are chopped off to fit a square TV screen.  When they do this, the viewer never sees the entire picture as seen in the movie theater.  Some don't care about this because they just want a full screen view anyway.  Many others (like me) prefer the widescreen edition because we see 100% of the movie, as it was seen in the movie theater (and we just mentally tune out the black bars on top and bottom of the picture.)Although I have the videos, I'm definitely going to get the DVD trilogy--it appears that it was certainly worth the long wait!	5.0	Widescreen Version is the Most Complete	2002-09-14	14	12	2
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AU32ZJ0LGMBSA	"dgdbear ""David"""	"I hopped on the blu-ray wagon a couple of years now, and as I go catching up with buying and watching some initial releases, I keep discovering old reviews that clearly show their age now and should be updated according to current standards.Because, quite frankly, I really doubt the same reviewer would say today that these movies are free of the dreadful DNR. That may be the case with the first part of the saga, that shows a healthy layer of grain, but both parts II and III have been scrubbed of most grain, which shows up turned into digital noise instead on the 2nd and it's mostly absent on the 3rd installment, which fares the worse of all three.It's only too bad, because, other than that, light and color seems to be spot-on for the whole trilogy.So although I gave a 4.0 score for the trilogy as a whole, separate and more accurate scores for each video presentation would be 4.5 for Part I, 4.0 for Part II, and 3.5 for Part III.Audio for all three movies is an adequate recreation of the original, warts and all, with the logical limitations in dynamic range for films of that time and age. As it's usual with most 5.1 modern remixes, channel separation sounds too artificial, and I think we would have been better served with a 2.0 surround mix (although it is my understanding that at least the 1st movie enjoyed a 6-track mix on 70mm prints).As for the extra features, there's little room for complaint here. The newly produced 6-part ""Tales from the Future"" documentary leaves almost no stone unturned, although there are some interesting tidbits from the prior 3-part ""Making of the Trilogy"" (also present here) that were left out (for example, ""Tales from the Future"" bring us footage of Eric Stoltz as Marty for the first time, but makes no mention of C. Thomas Howell having been considered for the part, as we learn from part 1 of ""Making of the Trilogy"").All in all, it is quite a joy to revisit the memorable saga with such a good audiovisual presentation and accompanied by such a trove of additional material."	4.0	Back to the Future	2011-06-23	3	3	0

These movies are my favorite sci fi films. I have probably watched all three more than 50 times. There is something very interesting about time travel. I love the whole 1980's to 1950's theme in the first movie. Very great acting and scenery. For the second I really enjoyed seeing what the future would probably look like. Many people don't like the third movie but I think it was really cool. The third movie provided a great close to a great time traveling trilogy. The image and sound quality of these box set DVD's was amazing. Just watching these movies on DVD you would have thought they were not that old. I also like the many extra special features added with this box set as well. My only wish is to own these movies on Blu-ray.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A273OBI0I4OULO	Dog Welder	My one star rating is not an indication of the quality of the films (the merits of all 3 movies stand on their own) and the chance to have the BTTF Trilogy in one nice package is certainly a great idea.  Unfortunately Universal, when creating the transfers for the 2nd and 3rd movies, managed to improperly matte the films.  This means that the image area you are seeing is NOT the theatrical release.  These problems have existed since the R2 versions were released 6 months ago, but Universal decided they didn't want a new transfer process to interfere with their Q4 Holiday profits and are banking on the fact that most people won't notice the problem or won't care even if they do.  If you have the current DVDs you will be able to have them replaced.  You can call Universal at 888-703-0010 for information on the replacement process.  (New DVDs won't arrive until late February.  Thanks, Universal!)  This is a poor showing by a studio who once produced quality DVDs.	1.0	Formatting on 2nd and 3rd discs are faulty -- buyer beware	2002-12-19	140	106	34
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A26KJQ9ZVXCSNE	Donald William Antonow	GreetingsI have been waiting for BTTF to come out on DVD for a long time as many of you have.  I rate the movies with 5 stars, but must tell you I can only give Universal 1 star for their package labeling!  I purchased the Widescreen DVD on 12/17/02 on it's release.  I played BTTF 1 DVD in sync with the VHS Full Screen version and did an A/B comparison.  What you have been reading in previous reviews about the Widescreen version really being the Full Screen version only matted at the top and bottom are TRUE.  The Widescreen version does not give you any more picture left and right and it does cut off from the top and bottom when compared to what we are used to from the old VHS version.  Most Full Screen versions of movies are done in Pan and Scan where you do not get to see everthing left and right through most of the film.  BTTF was not done this way.  Bottom Line....  If you own a Widescreen TV, Get the Widescreen Version as that is how it was presented in theaters.  If you own a 4:3 TV, get the Full Screen version.  You absolutely will not be losing any picture left and right.Don	5.0	Widescreen vs Full Screen	2002-12-18	4	0	4

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	"I have to say that I only recently saw Back to the Future and inmediately it turned as one of my favorite movies. After watching it, I bought the entire trilogy and the results are awesome!!!.Back to the Future (1985):BTTF is a great film because it has a lot of elements in the right place. It's funny, the cast is impeccable, the premise is original and smart, is really entertaining and the friendship between Doc and Marty feels genuine giving the movie a heart. Zemeckis accomplished a film that in other hands could've been a complete mess but here, it's completely unerstandable and not hard to follow. BTTF is a truly classic that has stood the test of time and is my favorite of the trilogy. Simply a masterpiece.Back to the Future part II (1989):Sequels, as we know are dangerous propositions that can either expand the story in glourious ways or sink it in the deep bottom of oblivion. Fortunately, BTTF2 is not the case of a bad sequel and indeed it expands the story in interesting ways. The movie has a lot of elements that made the first so good but also it complicates things more and takes the adventure to new levels. We go to the year 2015, an alternate 1985 and we go back again to 1955. The special effects are really good, although some of them seem dated by today's standards. Still, the story is really good and keeps you involved the whole time. The cast as always is impecable and it is also worth noting that this is the darkest film of the three.Back to the Future part III (1990):The third film in a trilogy is usually the worst one. But sometime is always the best (TS3), in this case BTTF3 is not the best of the three but is still really good and concludes the trilogy in a high note. The movie is lighter than the previous one and a little bit more entertaining too. The western setting is spectatucar and surprinsingly it works really well. The characters of Marty and Doc Brown end as full rounded characters and in the case of Doc Brown we see him in a completely new perspective. This movie is full of humor, romance and great action sequences. It is really high quality entertainment.Video & AudioAll three BTTF films were given full restorations with impressive results. The image in all three is clear, crisp, full of contrast and detail. Skin tones are mostly natural and grain is visible though not annoying. Sometimes the image looks a little soft but that's because of the techniques that they used to film them. A faithful and outstanding tranfer for all of them. Thank you Universal.In the audio department, all three films feature 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the results are great. Dialogue is crystal clear, the music sounds clear and there is no sign of hissing or other annomalies. A great audio presentation.Bonus Features:This package is full of bonus material spread across the three discs. The most note-worthy is a six part new documentary newly created for this set that are called ""Tales from the Future"" spread across the three movies. In the first movie you have ""In the Beginning..."", ""Time to Go"" and ""Keeping Time"". In the second movie you have ""Time Flies"" and in the third you have ""Third Time's the Charm"" and ""The Test of Time"". This six-part documentary is incredible as all the people involved in the making of the films discuss everything that was done with the trilogy. It's a piece that should not be missed. Alsoyou have archival documentaries from previous releases, audiocomentaries, galleries, trailers, The Back to the Future Night with Leslie Nielsen  and The Back to the Future Ride (both are great), deleted scenes, The Phiysics of Back to the Future and much more.You also have Digital Copies of the three films.My set also came with a Hot Wheels DeLorean replica.Closing Thoughts:The BTTF trilogy is one of the best that have been released and regardless which one is your favorite (mine's the first), the three of them offer high quality entertainment. With great restorations and a good amount of bonus material including a spectacular new documentary, Universal have made this set a must-own for everyone.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A25CMSI6S7S63C	"D. Steigman ""Movie fan from silents to now"""	This review is about 2010 Back to the Future Trilogy on SD. When it first announced a lot of us were wondering if we should get this set or not. Of course the decision is entirely up to youMost of you reading this have seen all 3 Back to the Future movies - so I will not talk about the stories. I have written about them in previous reviews. Overall as a general statement I love the entire series of Back to the Future - even though the first one is the best one - at least to me. Its a science fiction, action adventure , comedy & family film with time traveling to the past & future, where the cast sees themselves & families in all different time periods. The characters are all wonderful - they give me the same feeling the original Star Wars trilogy gives me. The characters are immortal , no one else could play these same characters. I wouldn't want it.Now about this set - the packaging is similar to the original box set trilogy. When you open it you will see SEVEN discs. They are the 3 films, 3 digital copies and an extra disc that is full of new supplements.The supplements have been ported over from previous editions and there are several new features such as a Michael J Fox interview , etc.Point # 1 - if you love the movies & what's on this set like I do - you might want to get it for all the extra bonus materialsThe discs are placed in a way that I dont mind - The movies discs are firmly placed on top of the digital copy discs.. you basically open/unfold the set and there are all the discs. It is just like the Alien Quadrilogy or the Rhino MST3K DVD setsNow why I like this particular set up is because I dont need the digital copies so all I have to do is pop off the top disc which is the film.Point # 2 - if you have no issues with the discs and how they're placed - plus there are 7 discs in this set - this set is for youIt is cost effective at the moment - it is on sale on websites & I'm sure stores have it on sale too.. Seven discs for a sale price of 30-35.00 to me is a bargain which leads tooPoint # 3 - it is affordable when you think about what you're getting for the sale price. At the moment the cost to upgrade isnt too steep..The last thing is that the transfers - be it Blu-Ray or SD - these are slightly cleaner than the previous release (not by much)So after all Ive said - is it worth getting this new trilogy ? I think so - if you're a serious Back to the Future fan Id really get it - just like me..it seems like an upgrade with all the new features & for some the digital copies might be of interest.If you're a casual fan - and are satisfied with the features from the previous separate DVD releases I would at least consider this new set. I cant see it being upgraded yet again with another release (but you can never tell).Now that we have gotten so much deserved ultimate editions of blockbusters Id like to see studios invest in movies that have not seen the light of day on DVD -	5.0	The 2010 Trilogy - Should you buy this set	2010-10-28	9	8	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1HM783CKNQLP5	DSTorre	This trilogy is very, very good. And its honestly one of the best ones out there that continues to have great quality on all 3 films- something not many trilogy can boast. Storywise, it is unique and entertaining, with lovable characters(Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd did a phenomenal job with their respective roles!); and the special effects may have aged by now but it is still a visual marvel all things considered. The flow between all three films are continuous, so its best to start in chronological order.In my opinion, part 1 is the best, followed by 2, then 3. Of course opinions may vary since some likes 3 best. I suggest you just judge for yourself. And that said, you wont have problems with the picture and audio quality. Both are suberb in this Blu-ray release! And with a great number of special features to boost.If theres are complaint I have, first, its the casing, especially how you remove or re-place the discs. Its a bit difficult and awkward to do, which they are probably aware of, because they included an instruction paper on how to do it. They probably want it to look unique, thats why they made it the way it is. And just like other Blu-ray discs that offer a digital copy, its pretty useless to me. And unless they re-issue a new one, current ones' expiration was last November 30, 2011. But these arent enough for me to substract a star. Still very much worth it, for both old fans and newcomers.	5.0	"""Back to Nostalgia!"""	2012-04-09	2	2	0

Sun	Always felt the time difference between the first and second episodes were way too long, but I'm glad they came out. Thought number 2 was decent, but didn't like the wild west concept of number 3 at first, but it grew on me. Doc Brown is a great character and it's hard not to like Michael J Fox as Marty. Excellent supporting cast, great music and effects and the nostalgia of the 80's just made the movie work.	3.0	First one was the best	2009-05-23	0	0	0

I really love this set of movies and have fond memories of seeing all three of these movies on the bigscreen during my adolescent days.I really like how all three movies are tied together.  For all intents and purposes, this really is a 3 part Mini-Series, which just happen to be put out as three movies.It is one of the only movies I can remember which offered a ""cliff-hanger"" at the end of each film (parts 1 and 2).  Part one's cliff hanger being Doc returning from the future with bad news about Marty McFly's future kids, and part two's cliffhanger being the Western Union Message delivery service giving Marty the message from Doc, that he is still alive, in the pouring rain.Also, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only movie, which included ""previews"" for the next movie (part 3) at the end of the prior movie (part 2.)  When I saw this, I knew right away they had already filmed most of the 3rd in the series. I can't recall if they show this on the DVD. I'm pretty sure they don't, but they definitly showed it in the theater.I liked how Michael J. Fox (as well as the Biff character) played several parts, playing his grandfather, as well as his daughter, in part 2.  It certainly wasn't ""Eddie Murphe"" character acting genius, but it was good comedy relief, within the comedy.  Very funny.I would like to know why the girlfriend part was replaced by Elisabeth Shue.  While Elisabeth Shue does a much better job in the part, it was quite jarring to see this part replaced, and threw off the momentum of the movie ever so slightly.  They could have at least made her hair dark?  Other than that, no complaints.Another fact that I don't see mentioned very often, is that Crispin Glover did not appear in Parts 2 or 3, except for repeated film sequences from part 1.  Another actor played the part of Marty McFly's father in parts II and III.  Just another tidbit of trivia for you BTTF junkies.When I first saw this movie, I remember thinking: there was no American town such as that one.  No small town has a Malt Shop in the ""downtown area"" for example.  Well, I just recently moved to a small Northern California town, and it really reminds me of the town featured in this movie.MC White says: Check it out!!!"	5.0	Awesome Additon to any DVD Collector's Collection...	2006-06-22	1	0	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2F7PEA3G37YDT	dylan21484nj	"The original Back to the Future was the biggest movie of 1985, and is one of the greatest films ever made. Why? Because it deftly blends science fiction, comedy, nostalgic period piece, and suspenseful thriller all together to create a time-hopping adventure that appeals to just about anyone of any age. Michael J. Fox stars as skateboard-riding teen Marty McFly, who finds himself accidentally launched back to the year 1955 by mad scientist Doc Brown (played with wild-eyed zest by Christopher Lloyd) and his nuclear-powered time-travelling DeLorean, where Marty inadvertantly prevents his own parents, George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) from meeting and falling in love. Now faced with the most literal example of an existential crisis, Marty must play matchmaker to ensure his own birth, prevent bully Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) from keeping Marty's future parents apart, and with the aid of a Doc Brown thirty years younger, find a way back to 1985 before he's ""OUTATIME""! Filled with clever gags about time travel, the perils of purposefully and accidentally altering the course of history, as well as Alan Silvestri's epic score and the music of Huey Lewis & The News, Back to the Future succeeds as a one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see.Back to the Future II picks up immediately where the original film left off. Marty and Doc zoom to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's future son from being arrested, an event that will destroy the McFly family's legacy. After a run-in with Griff (also portrayed by Wilson), Biff's part-cyborg grandson (hey, it IS the future), they succeed, but the elderly Biff discovers the time machine and swipes it in order to give his 1955 self a sports almanac that'll make him filthy rich. Marty and Doc return to 1985 and find that their hometown of Hill Valley has become a demilitarized zone, where millionaire Biff has total control. In order to turn things back to normal, our heroes must head once again to 1955 and steal the sports almanac from Biff.Back to the Future III finds Marty stuck in 1955 once again after a lightning bolt sends Doc and the DeLorean to 1885. Marty must once again enlist the younger Doc for help getting back to his own time, uncovering the damaged DeLorean the elder Doc left stored in a cave. However, Marty discovers that the elder Doc gets shot to death by notorious outlaw Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Wilson again portrays this role) and resolves to rescue Doc from this terrible fate. Upon arriving in the Old West with the repaired DeLorean, an errant arrow from a charging tribe of Indians (or Native Americans, if you want to be P.C.) rips the DeLorean's fuel line. And since gasoline does not exist yet, Doc and Marty must not only prevent their own demise at Buford Tannen's hands, but figure out a way to power the DeLorean up to 88 MPH in order to get home.Back to the Future II & III were filmed back-to-back, five years after the original's success, noticeable in the differences in a handful of characters (Fox's hair seems slightly different from how it appeared in Part I, the actress who plays Marty's girlfriend has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue, and Glover priced himself out of both sequels by demanding an absurd pay raise). The back-to-back sequels always felt problematic to me, as neither film feels particularly ""whole"" when watched on its own. Part II always feels a little frantic and overstuffed with action, and Part III is often left with the task of resolving the plot. Part II ends on a cliffhanger, which is disappointing since it leaves the movie feeling incomplete, and you have to watch Part II to understand how the characters get where they are in Part III, which also leaves Part III feeling incomplete. Franchises like The Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean suffered from the same problems, and I'd prefer if Hollywood abandoned this practice and opted for a ""one film at a time"" approach.Also, some prefer Part II due to the film's faster pacing and multiple settings that include the past, alternate present, and future. Others will prefer Part III for its Western feel and slight elements of steampunk, as well as its similarities to the original film, since it also sees the main characters trapped in the past and seeking a method to return to their own era.Though they're great films, they aren't without plot holes. Why does the successful McFly family live in the same house and in the same neighborhood as when they're poor? Why don't Marty's parents recognize him as the person who got them together? Why is Marty's brother going to work in a business suit on a Saturday? Why does Doc return from the future to get Marty in broad daylight if he's trying to keep the car a secret? It's a time machine, so couldn't Doc have chosen a more secretive moment to come back? When Old Biff returns to 2015, he fades away yet the broken top of his cane doesn't? Why doesn't 2015 Hill Valley start to transform after he returns? If younger Doc finds out that his older self gets stuck in the Old West and gets shot, why can't he take precautions to prevent this, similar to the way he does in the first film? Why does elder Doc act surprised and upset when Marty arrives in 1885 to rescue him if his younger self knows that Marty is coming to save him? After Marty arrives in 1885, why don't Marty and Doc dig up the damaged DeLorean that Doc stored in the cave only a few months prior and use its gasolene on the repaired DeLorean to get home?Another personal gripe with the movie is the fabrication of Marty's confrontational attitude when he's called a chicken or a coward. Characters with flaws are necessary in telling interesting stories as flawless characters are boring and uninteresting, but the introduction of this character flaw feels forced since it's never addressed in the original film. The writers' intention is transparent; the chip on Marty's shoulder was put there just to generate more conflict.Overall, the Back to the Future Trilogy is a fun time-traveling adventure spanning three films. Whatever your feelings regarding Part II & III, the original film is clearly the best of the trilogy."	5.0	One of the greatest films ever made (and its sequels) finally come to Blu-Ray!	2011-01-22	4	4	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3V8ZQTULDS7XG	"Eddie ""Classics Old & New"""	"This is as typical of a teen eighties movie as you can get, in fact the eighties might have been the decade that those teen movies were invented, if not then this is when they definitely got popular. The formula is generally the same, there is a self assured kinda rebellious young man who sometimes gets in trouble, has a nice girlfriend, and gets into all kinds of trouble. He listens to cool music, says ""ayyyyyyy"" a lot, and most of the time has some sort of mullet. Some of the teen movies are good, some of them awful, but this one is a cut above the rest, Back to the Future is one of the best movies of the 1980's, and 80's superstud Michael J. Fox leads off this excellent movie. He plays Marty McFly, a high school kid who hangs out with the crazy scientist Dr. Brown, a wacky spaced out inventor played to perfection by Christopher Lloyd. The performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and their chemistry really are what make this movie they are perfect for their parts and really make this the movie that it is.The plot is very nice too. We see Marty McFly's neighborhood before anything was there, and it was just open land. We see the small town he lives in when it was much smaller in size, and there wasn't so much expansion. We see a lot of cool stuff in this movie. This is a movie that holds your interest through the entire thing. I have to admit I am a science fiction fan, and I have always been fascinated wit the concept of time travel, and while this movie is a complete fantasy (they travel back in time in a Delorean) It is also interesting to see the makeup jobs in this movie, we see characters 30 years in the past, and we see 40 year old people playing people who are twenty years old and vice versa. The highlight of the movie remains Christopher Lloyd, who plays what might be his best part ever, he is just too funny for words, and is so over-the-top he gives this movie the perfect tone, and compliments everyone around him with his great performance.The story progresses nicely, the last half hour is priceless, as we see Michael J. Fox play Johnny Be Good to a crowd who has never heard rock and roll as we know it. Then he goes back to the future and he almost misses it. The movie has the Quantum Leap aspect of it as we see what opens when you alter the past which affects the present in ways we never would have thought of. This movie is both a nice timepiece for the fifties and the eighties, showing at least the way that people in both time would like to have thought they were, in an idealistic world, so the movie is interesting like that, and has a nice touch of comedy, and science fiction here. The two genre's mesh well here, and sometimes Science Fiction and comedy don't always go well together. (see Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) It is also kind of funny to see the time period conflict with each other, we see things that are done in the eighties, and not in the fifties and vice versa. While there are no belly laughs in the movie there are enough jokes and enough interesting moments that will definitely make you think, this is not a socially conscious movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is something that is very interesting. This movie is probably the centerpiece of Michael J. Fox's film career, he rarely had a films this successful other than the two sequels, and this was a monster hit for the day. While it is one of the best eighties movies it is also one of the best about time travel, corny it might be but Back to the Future remains one of the best of it's kind, it's kinda hard to classify, but of whatever genre it is, it is one of the best."	5.0	This series is pretty McFly for a white guy	2008-10-08	3	2	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2HM796P90DP8U	Eddie	I know i will get mean looks for saying this but this trilogy is the best(Better than Star Wars, 1st half and second half) It is just because i like these movies. They come together so perfectly, and you always want more. I wish their would be a number 4 but that wont happen. As said in some of the extra features, The first movie was suppose to be the only one and the end was just a joke, but they did it anyway. The first movie takes place in the past, the second takes place in the future, and the third takes place in the past past(Old West.)Though just looking at the movies tell you that they are from the 80's. The first is like our past going farther into the past and the third is the past going farther back in the past. The future one was a little off, since we pretty much are in their future now, and they didnt have everything like us...But my all time favorite thing of this movie is.........The Delorean!!!I love this car, it is the coolest car i have ever seen, even now. But they are expensive. I have seen one once at Universal studios, and one at mcdonalds, that somebody owned.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A28KLGN71H1WX5	Eric Hodge	Ok, I got this thing figured out ;-)There are two sets of clips for each blu ray -- a bottom set that moves, and then a right and left fixed set.It's actually very easy -- here we go.1. Pull the disc downwards by inserting your index finger in the center hole of the disc.2. Beneath each disc is a set of plastic retaining clips -- you will see the clips give a bit as you're pulling the disc down3. After activating the clips, you can now gently lift the disc out.4. To return the disc back to its holder, simply place the disc back by tucking it under the right fixed clip, pull down on the disc to activate the bottom clips, then you can gently pop the left side of the disc under the left fixed clip.Try this a few times, and let me know how it goes. Hope you found this helpful. My discs remained scratch free.Best...trilogy...ever	5.0	Step by step blu ray disc removal process	2010-11-01	19	16	3
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2IS16K96YSFDV	Eric Mayforth	"In ""Back to the Future,"" Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is part of a family with many issues caused by mistakes made in the past.  He has an unlikely friendship with scientist Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the inventor of a time machine, and winds up accidentally going back in time three decades from 1985 to 1955.  There, he must maneuver in order to get his future parents to become interested in each other--then he must find a way ""home"" to 1985.When Marty goes back in time, there are several amusing situations in which people of different generations get their wires crossed.  The plot is engaging and entertaining, but the one big flaw in the movie is that the viewer has to suspend disbelief a bit during the climactic scene between Marty's father and the school bully--it just isn't completely believable.Nevertheless, ""Back to the Future"" is regarded as an Eighties classic, serving as a vivid reminder of the impact our actions have on our future.  President Reagan even enjoyed the movie and quoted from it in one of his speeches.Also included in this DVD set are the other two movies in the trilogy.  The second film is set in 2015 (a date that seemed far, far away in 1989 when I first saw the film in college but, unbelievably, is now only a few years away), and the finale has Marty and Doc travel back to the Old West of 1885.  The third entry is better than the second, but neither of the sequels measures up to the original.  There is also a disc containing deleted scenes and other bonus features.The films in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy might not be suitable for younger children to watch due to language and other issues, but these three movies teach the virtues of courage, foresight, and independent thought and would be great for adolescents (adults would enjoy them, too)."	4.0	"""History Is Going to Change"""	2011-09-30	4	0	4
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1JVRNFEEA8CRF	Eric Shank Van Eenige	The greatest science fiction trilogy of the 80's has finally come to DVD! Michael J. Fox built his career on his performance as Marty McFly, the clever, courageous teen whose life changes when he accidently goes back in time to 1955 and interferes with his parents' first meeting, thereby changing history and preventing his own birth! Christopher Lloyd is hilarious as the wide-eyed scientist Emmett L. Brown, who was coy enough to fashion a time machine out of a DeLorean sports car. All three movies are equally well-written and executed magnificently by director Robert Zemeckis. This three-disc set is definitely worth owning!	5.0	At last!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	APM06HT7JIPZ5	"Erik Morton ""Erik Morton"""	&quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE&quot;The best of the series by far, this sweet-natured sci-fi-fantasy-adventure-comedy is a real winner.  Robert Zemekis' second big hit (after &quot;Romancing The Stone&quot;), &quot;BTTF&quot; is in a way, every genre in one (except maybe horror).  It's at times hillarious, other times romantic, and the finale is nerve-racking!  Everyone knows the plot, so I won't bother with that.  A great movie for everyone!Rating: 4.5 Stars&quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE-PART II&quot;This sequal loses the charm &amp; spirit of the first, and replaces it with lots of action and suspense.  While this terrible loss is at first unforgivable, once you watch both making-of documentaries, you realize why this might have happened; you see, director Bob Zemekis wasn't able to give the film his full attention (since he was shooting &quot;Part III&quot; at practically the same time), so the film loses his trademark touch.  But complaints asside, it's a very entertaining movie, with so many clever twists and turns in the paradox-filled plot that it's very impressive!  The special effects are really good, too.  Yet another entertaining movie, yet not really worthy of the Zemekis name (a big let-down after the first).Rating: 4 Stars&quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE-PART III&quot;The third entry in the awesome series gains back all of the Zemekis touch, and loses all of the constant hectic pacing of the &quot;Part II&quot; (except for the finale, much like the first one).  And what comes off is a highly enjoyable sci-fi western!  There's a well-handled (yet somewhat under-played) romance between Doc Brown and a school teacher.  This is an improvement over the second installment, and returns to the fine quality of &quot;Part I&quot;.  A Worthy conclusion to one of the best movie series ever!Rating: 4 StarsSPECIAL FEATURESThe extras on all three discs are great.  The deleted scenes are really interesting to watch, and some allow the movie to make more sense.  The Outtakes are hillarious!  Each movie features two making-of documentaries, the better ones being the &quot;Making The Trilogy&quot; features.  I haven't listened to any of the commentaries yet, but I hear they're all really good.  (NOTE: Don't watch the &quot;Most Frequently Asked Questions&quot; feature on the third disc.  While it offers some insight on all three films, in the end you become very confused, and it makes it harder to just sit back and enjoy the movies without asking all these questions yourself and trying to figure it out.)CONCLUSION~ This three-disc boxed set is well worth your money.  Its a very interesting series, as all three films are so different from eachother (especially &quot;Part II&quot;).  But its also a unique movie trilogy, because everything in all three films are so connected and entwined.  A must-buy for any movie fan!OVERALL RATING:  5 Stars	5.0	Great DVD Collection.	2002-12-31	3	2	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A29QA79VLQGHY6	Flipper Campbell	"Watching the trilogy back-to-back-to-back on DVD allows viewers to catch many of the quick visual references to previous and future ""Future"" films. Director Robert Zemeckis and writing partner Bob Gale loved tinkering with their premise, and it pays off in the attention to detail that's sure to inspire multiple DVD viewings.Executive producer Gale does the heavy lifting on the DVD set's many extras, appearing throughout the featurettes and on the three films' commentaries (with fellow producer Neil Canton). Gale speaks softly, with a Ben Stein-toned delivery that won't keep anybody up late. The extras have far too much duplication. ""You're probably sick of hearing us talk about these movies,"" he says gently as ""Future III"" begins. Only the obsessed will disagree.Gale works hard, though, and delivers the goods for those hungry for production stories. He recalls how Universal chieftain Lew Wasserman ended a salary holdout on ""Future III"" in Hollywood ""Godfather"" style, with the balking filmmakers getting nothing extra. "" 'Don't mess with Lew Wasserman' was the moral of the story,"" Gale remembers. Production of the second and third films overlapped, with Zemeckis editing ""II"" while shooting ""III.""Zemeckis, Gale and star Michael J. Fox get in their camera time in ""Making the Trilogy,"" a snappy DVD docu that runs as a serial across the three discs. Original making-ofs lead off each disc's extras. The first is surprisingly interesting. Zemeckis and Gale appear on a second audio commentary for each film that repurposes Q&A; screenings with USC film students.Fox chips in here and there, looking good. His enthusiasm level peaks as he speaks of the scene in which his Marty character invents rock 'n' roll in ""Future I.""The set comes in widescreen and full-screen. The widescreen version shows the film as matted by the filmmakers for theatrical release (1.85.1). The full-screen shows the images as shot (about 1.35:1), so there is a bit more visual information. The otherwise informative DVD packaging doesn't cover this. Images look OK, with minor speckling. Colors seem fine for popcorn movies from the '80s.The remastered 5.1 Dolby has some decent rear effects, mostly swooshes and blasts as our heroes ride their time machine, but nothing heavy. There is no DTS track.Deleted scenes should interest fans, especially a dark take in which Biff Tannen's ancestor Mad Dog shoots a father in the back as his son watches. (No one should die in the series and not come back, they decided.)"	4.0	Get 'Back'	2002-12-16	0	0	0

Universal has been unresponsive to my emails asking when the new, corrected retail package will be available, and how they will be identified.BUYER BEWARE.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AH56CQBNQEND5	Fred Rutherford	"The ""Back to the Future"" Trilogy is one of the greatest DVD sets out there. Yes, we are all aware of the framing issues in the initial widescreen versions of BTTF 2 & 3. They have supposedly been fixed now though? Anyway, the quality of this set overall is excellent. Besides three excellent movies, also included are ""hoverboard"" tests, director commentaries, pop up trivia, outtakes and deleted scenes, music videos, behind the scenes features, special effects segments, and more. As a complete box, I couldn't have asked for a better set. It's a great bargain considering all that's included. The 5 total minutes of ""bad framing"" is disappointing, but in no way does it take away from the whole of the story. You are still aware of what's going on whether you're seeing it for the first time, or if you've seen it a hundred times. I rank these movies in order of release. 1 is great, 2 is the best, and 3 is good. If you don't already own this set, I suggest you add it to your DVD collection.

This is phenomonal picture and sound. Ive noticed alot more than i used to on the dvd. The one major complaint i have about this blu ray which really upsets me is not about the movie at all but rather the packaging. Its HORRIFIC it took me almost 10 minutes to try and get the darn disc out without breaking it and even then i got scuff marks each time i pulled it out. Its the worst packaging from any company of any dvd and blu ray i have ever seen!!! You have to push the disc down slip it out of these two clips on the sides and lift it out. Its simple once you get used to it after like days of figuring it out but i cant even imagine the damage its going to do to the discs themselves after constant use even after like half a year. I already got scuff marks just trying to take it out the few times i took it out. I complained to universal which sent me a diagram of how to properly pull the disc out. I suggest if any of you experience this problem as well complain to universal like i did. After they get enough complaints hopefully theyll change it. Just search universal blu ray on a search engine to find the site if your going to complain which i recommend if you experience this problem.	2.0	Superbly remastered, picture and sound are amazing.

Absolutely no complaints regarding the sound or the picture. Looks about as crisp as could be expected. Signature quality transfer. It almost looks like it was filmed last week and set in a different time, like a period piece ...but it is from a different time. With a quality transfer, it would rival many of the new releases done within the past year. Great Job.	5.0	1.21 Jigawatts !!	2010-11-01	4	4	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I	"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan"""	Besides Star Wars, Back To The Future is quite possibly the greatest trilogy ever created! What bad things can be said about this almost perfect trilogy? Nothing. The acting in the film is great, but the real magic is in the stories. Being able to go into the past and the future, who wouldn't want to do that. No matter where they go in the movie, the scenes are fantastic and it looks like they are actually back in time. You forget that you are watching a movie and feel like you have traveled with Marty. Just about everything in this trilogy is brilliant, it is about the only series I know of that has the sequels be even better than the original while the original being amazing. Highly recommend trilogy that you are truly missing out on if you haven't seen these films. You have to see them or you will have never seen what a truly great movie is!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1LXO4DUE5LL02	Gary L. Stanley	This DVD set has been well worth the wait. I only have one problem and that is I've not been gettin enough sleep lately. I always say to myself that I'm only going to watch the outtakes on BTTF III, and wind up spending the next 2-3 hours going through all the extras on the disc. Back To The Future is the most imaginative time-travel movie ever made, and it was done with heart and mirth. I'm extrememly happy that the trilogy was distributed as a 3-disc set and think the price was fair for all the obvious effort that went into the DVD authoring. While the original movies were in Dolby Surround in the theaters and on the VHS tapes (I have the VHS box set as well..purchased before DVD was invented), the Dolby Digital remix is perfectly done and adds impact to the film. The casting director should have been given a medal for perfection in selecting Christopher Lloyd as the mad (but lovable) scientist and Michael J. Fox IS Marty. No one else could possibly have pulled off their interaction and comic timing. I can't think of anything that could have possibly been added to this set. I also saw absolutely nothing wrong with the widescreen presentation. I'm now content until the Indiana Jones Trilogy is transferred to DVD!	5.0	OUTTATIME	2003-01-02	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3AXMN6V7KTG0Q	Gaurav	Well, I have always been a fan of BTTF...and so I ordered this Anniversary Box! To put it simply, it is by far the best, these films have ever looked and sounded to me! The video quality is superb - great colors and exceptionally crisp clarity- and the sound is simply awesome as well. I mean, there are background music cues that I had never noticed, before I saw these films in Blu Ray.The extras are also good and will provide you with some great information about the way these films came to life.So, if you are a fan and really want to have BTTF as a part of your Blu-Ray collection, then Just go for it! It really doesn't matter how many times you have seen these films before, you are sure to find them more enjoyable and so much better to watch that you won't regret buying this set! I will recommend this set to all BTTF fans...Hope you have a great time watching!	5.0	The best way to watch these Classics!	2011-08-07	3	3	0

With the direction of Zemeckis, the handling of Spielberg, and the comedic talents of Fox, how could you go wrong? Yes, parts 2 and 3 lost a bit of the luster of the series, but part 1 was genius. Who wouldn't want to have known what their parents were like at their age? Original storytelling with heart, Hollywood could do some refresher courses on how to make movies by reviewing this one.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A22QE8T8PSSHLC	George D	The Back to the Future Trilogy is one of my favorite movies of all time along with the Terminator trilogy.

Marty also has another problem he can't go back to 1985! There is only man that can help him his name is Doc Brown. Marty must find a way to get his parents back together and find way to get back home to 1985 before time runs out!

I have been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD.  Back To The Future was the biggest movies in 1985 grossing 210 Million dollars.  The sequel I thought was just as good if not even a little better released in 1989 but it was unfortunate that it didn't do as well as the first.  The third on released in 1990 went back to the west, I thought this was the weakest of the three but finished up the series on a well note.  I can't wait for the DVD Boxed Set!	5.0	Yes! Finally!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A33CSAZV1PMVTX	"Gift Card ""New Godzilla"""	You know there are very few movies out there that take you back to your childhood like this film.  I have been waiting for films similar to this to respawn back in the public eye and not only was it a great movie that asked the question of going back in time or in the future and all the trouble it caused.  It just made you dream like if you had the ability to do it all over again would you change a thing because some of the changes that were made in this film through the course of 1 2 3 certain decisions made had a great outcome while others left his father dead and a peaceful town in dismay.

I heard about the release and I was so thrilled. At long last DVD has met the future literally. I have been the biggest fan of the films since they all came out. Back to the future is such a great movie that is full of fun, action, and tons of adventure. I, as many fans are probably like, know the film inside out and know the dialogue by heart. The cast is a great combination of actors that give a great performance for a great film. This is by far by all time fave film. Zemeckis and Spielberg make this film work. I love all aspects of the film. When I saw the extras and stuff I was like, WOW, at last we get to see stuff almost hidden for years. So much to see, so little time, so much to see again. If you are a fan, the DVD is a fantastic collection to any DVD collection. I can't wait. Not sure what else to say, but At last, finally. I will no doubt find time to watch it all. You cant get all this on VHS thats for sure.So many great lines. ""Hello anybody home?"" ""Think Mcfly think."" When this baby hits 88MPH you are gonna see some serious S***.""

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A10L8O1ZMUIMR2	G. Kleinschmidt	The &quot;Back To The Future&quot; movies are well known by most people and are considered to be a classic. It plays not so much on going back in time to save the world, but yourself. It plays on all the things we wonder about time-travel but are never seen in any movies but these. Now to start off with, my liking for them goes in order; the first is my favorite, second is my second favorite, and third is my least favorite. The first film has a unique magic to it, and is capable of surviving the playback test. I could watch it a hundred times and not get sick of it. It's charm keeps bringing you back for more. However, I feel that the other two, mostly the third one, just drag on. The second one is helpful to answer your questions from the first, but the third is almost nonsense. But keeping the somewhat low price in mind, it's so worth it to buy this box set even if you like only the first.The whole set is very nice and polished, picture and sound quality are great and make it seem like you're watching a brand new movie. There are a fair amount of extras on each disk and all are very fun to look through. I guarantee that once you buy this great box set, you will have hours of fun experiencing Marty's adventures through time!	5.0	Unique Spin On Time Travel	2003-01-19	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AMFGLBG3YUR7H	G. Monstre	So a teenager, a time traveling car and a mad scientist have three major adventures together. Can anyone say trilogy! If you are particularly prone to enjoying the Back to the Future trilogy than this is a nice DVD set to embrace into your collection. It contains not only all 3 movies but some never before scene footage of how the films were made. This series is a family favorite and gets watched at least once a year. There is something amazingly wonderful about time travel and the idea of changing one's future and past. The fantasy gets lived out through these films. Doc is a fun character who probably would be a little creepy in real life but is in his element as the mad scientist who pulls Marty into adventures within. In doing so, Marty gets to change his parents lives and in doing so his own.	4.0	Traveling Time with Humor	2013-01-05	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A5WMBIOGE8Q6N	"Golden Lion ""Reader"""	"I bought the trilogy for 40 bucks.  Back to the Future epitomizes youthful vision of future possiblities; classic science fiction humor of spaceman from mars; a bridging of two generations where the younger generation realized the older generation had their own standards of hip and fair play; a friendship between a wacky wild eyed scientist and a protoge; a comic strip injection of sci -fi fun;  a cramed schedule of events not to be distrubed or changed; the protrayal that the past as more clean, stylish, and exciting; a fair amount of crudity and surprising range of liberty allowing Biff freedom to swear;  a mean social statement of rape or molestation by Biff as a betrayal of the social purity of the fifties; Biffs desire to take possession of Loren in all time periods; rule breaking convert undertakings yielding to smoking and drinking;  a reoccurring center focus on the year 1955; a emotionally charged music sound track;  tons of historical memorabila, names (Hepburn and Reagan), cars, songs (Mr Sandman); a insecure, ackward, greasy hair father who complancy and ackwardness is unsettling; a smashingly cool Toyota 4x4; a Jimmy Hendrix rendition of ""Johnny be Good"";  a lettermans jacket, sneakers, and a skate board;  a truck load of cow manure in Biffs car; a chess game with time;  a clock tower that needs funding in all times; three love stories: Marty, Doc, and Parents; and an ice cold Deloran.The fifties introduced the beginnings of social rebellion by the youth.  Under the tight tumb of their parents teenages sought to break the rules: make out in the back of the convertible, sneaking the old womans liquor, and smoking in the park lot.The future include cyborg implants, social interactive computers, flying cars, and virtual reality interactions.

It will be interesting to see Eric's interpatation of Marty.  This will give all of us a facinating insight as to what effect the director was looking for, and perhaps why Eric was ulitmately replaced with Michael J. Fox.  Originally I had heard that that Eric Had almost completed the entire film, before he was replaced...Now wouldn't that be something.

The films look beautiful in blu-ray and everything is crystal clear!For those of you who are debating on buying this set, GO FOR IT! Splurge! I never grew up watching Back to the Future as a kid, I was never interested in the film (don't worry, I was a total Indiana Jones/Jurassic Park snob), but I was convinced to watch the trilogy. Hesitant about the whole time-travel theme, I was dreading wasting what felt like an eternity on something I knew for sure I was going to dislike. GREAT SCOTT was I wrong!!! After seeing the trilogy just one time, I fell in love with this classic and watched it non-stop for 4 months (I wish I was joking). 2 years later and BTTF is one of my favorite films to date. Everything from the acting to the script to the special effects is astonishing! Michael J.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ARY6TY5V733ND	"Hannah ""BookWorm"""	As I only first saw the film this christmas, I must say that even though being made over 15 years ago, it is a brilliant film. And having the whole trilogy together in a box set, is even better.The first film is about a 17 year-old boy, Marty McFly, whose friend Doc.Brown invents a time machine. Accidently, Marty is sent back to the '50s.Where he intervenes with his parents first meeting, now he has to get them together or he won't be born. It's a very exciting film, and I mostly liked it because it was set in the '50s, and I think the '50s is a fun decade, and the makers really used their imagination.The second film, wasn't as good I thought, but still an intresting sequel, they send Marty and Doc into the future, where Marty has to set things right with his children. But he makes a mistake and has to go back to the '50s again, to set it right. Although some people think it's confusing because they go through many time changes, I thought it was fun, fast, exciting and a great twist.The third film, is probably my least favourite, but they still chose an intresting genre:Cowboys and the Old West! This is a favourite to everyone and they used it brilliantly, when Doc's life is in danger,and Marty has to go back to 1885 to save him.All three films have excellent cast members, Including: Michael J.Fox (Marty McFly), Christopher Lloyd (Doc. Brown), Lea Thompson (Marty's mum), Thomas F.Wilson (Marty's enemy)and in the 1st film Crispin Glover (Marty's dad). They all played the parts wonderfully, and gave it their all.The extras with the film were all very good, especially the Making of The Back To the Future Trilogy. I recommend this product for everyone to watch, it's also a good family film, and I promise lots of laughs and fun, watching this trilogy!	5.0	A Brilliant Trilogy Set!!!	2002-12-31	0	0	0

This will free it from the tabs on either side and it can easily be lifted out. To return it, just reverse the procedure.

But I can say that the set is fantastic. The image quality is spectacular on all of the films, and you've got both new HD extras, as well as legacy features from the older DVD sets. On top of this, there are multiple commentary tracks for each film. If you're like me, you'll be binge watching these movies and extras. The outer slip cover is very attractive, and inside you'll find the three discs inside an unfolding plastic case.	5.0	Timeless movies and a great Blu-ray set.	2014-06-25	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AUUH6Z8MSGGF	Haunted Flower	"3 Blu-ray Discs, 3 Digital Copy Discs, released October 26, 2010The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy of movies was directed by Robert Zemeckis and written and directed by Zemeckis with Bob Gale. It was produced by Steven Spielberg and along with the first movie inspiring a sequel split up into two movies, an animated series, and a Universal Studios ride (which can be watched as an extra in this set!).Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, a high schooler with a girlfriend named Jennifer played by Claudia Wells and a family that is less than successful. Marty is friends with a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who has invented time travel with the use of a DeLorean! Marty accidentally goes back in time thirty years and runs into his future parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover as high schoolers and almost screws up them meeting and getting together. In the first film, he has to find a way to set things straight for history while helping his dad face a bully named Biff played by Thomas F. Wilson and get back to the future.In the second movie, Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc go to the future to the year 2015 where there are flying cars and other weird stuff to prevent Marty and Jennifer's son from making a big mistake. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, future Marty, Marty's son, and Marty's daughter. Most other cast members returned except for Crispin Glover whose demands were too high for another film and he was recast by Jeffrey Weissman and Jennifer Parker was recast with Elisabeth Shue due to Claudia Wells having personal family problems and dropping out of acting for a while. The main conflict is that future Biff finds out about the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his past self to become a millionaire in 1985 when Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc return to it. After facing an ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Pottersville horror scenario with Biff, Marty and the Doc go back to 1955 again to set things right.In the third movie, Doc is accidentally sent to 1885 and Marty goes back to the old west to rescue him. He meets Irish ancestors and ends up in a showdown with Mad Dog Tannen (another incarnation of Biff because no one in the town of Hill Valley ever leaves). This one just feels like an excuse to make a fun western, but it also lets Doc Brown have a love story with Clara played by Mary Steenburgen.This is a classic, iconic movie series. Clearly, the first movie is the best because it is the most relatable, wanting to see your parents at your age and the charming story that goes with it and how it all magically ties together. Even though the other two movies were well thought out and planned for elements to tie in, it was never quite as special. It is a little more forced and the subplot of Marty never being able to react well to someone calling him ""chicken"" (or ""yellow"" in the third film) seemed more immature than I thought Marty was portrayed in the first film. The original ""Back to the Future"" is arguably one of the most memorable and influential movies of the last 25 years and is always a feel-good one to watch.Bonus Features:There are three parts of a six part series on the making of the Back to the Future trilogy. You learn soooo much about the process, casting, and what it was like with Michael J. Fox's schedule recording for television during the day and for the movies at night and getting very little sleep. It is fascinating to learn how the story came together by putting events on index cards to make sure everything tied together smoothly. There are bunches of deleted scenes that mostly gave unnecessary exposition and extra jokes that took up more time than needed.Beyond those features are archival featurettes: On Disc One, ""The Making of Back to the Future"", Making the Trilogy: Chapter One, and ""Back to the Future"" Night where Leslie Nielsen hosts a playing of the movie on TV with interludes about how the film was made and preview footage of the sequel AND the Huey Lewis and the News ""Power of Love"" Music Video. On Disc Two, there is ""The Making of Back to the Future Part II and Making the Trilogy: Chapter Two. On Disc Three is ""The Making of Back to the Future Part III"", ""Making the Trilogy: Chapter Three"", ""The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy"", the music video ""Doubleback"" by ZZ Top who appear in the film, and Back to the Future: The Ride that you can watch.The Q&A; with Michael J. Fox goes over some of the information already covered in the Making Of Series, but fills in a lot of blanks about makeup, crew, working with the car, etc. Every answer is set up with a visual zooming in and then zooming out which gets jarring when you hit ""play all"", and otherwise is a great feature on this set. For audio extras, you can listen to Q&A; commentary with director/writer Robert Zemeckis and producer/writer Bob Gale on all three films. It is one session broken up into three parts, but they are not feature-length commentaries. They go more into detail about why certain actors were recast and how stories came about and situations with producers, etc. There is also feature commentary with producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton on all three films.In the Behind the Scenes feature on Disc One, you can watch original make-up tests, outtakes, photo galleries, and watch the storyboards version of the nuclear power plant scene that was cut in favor of the watch tower story with and without producer commentary. The deleted scenes involve embellishing story to emphasize ideas we already know (Marty's dad is a loser, etc.) as well as ""showstoppers"" which stop the movie to have some jokes. On Disc Two, there are outtakes, production design, storyboarding, designing the DeLorean, designing Time Travel, a Hoverboard test, evolution of the visual effects shots, and photo galleries. On Disc Three, you can watch more outtakes, designing the town of Hill Valley, designing the campaign, and photo galleries."	5.0	The definitive Back to the Future Collection!	2010-12-31	4	4	0

Sooo when he returns to the future, shouldnt he have arrived in the future where his is rich, and not the same future Marty and Doc are messing around in?Second:Doc Brown came back to 1885 in one Delorian, then hid it away, right? Then Marty took that same car in 1955 and took it back to save him. OK. So then there is that whole deal with the gas tank being punctured, having no gas, and needing that whole train-senario. ok, here it comes . . . But! Why didnt they fix the puntured gas tank, then fill it with the gas that was in the Delorian that the Doc hid in the cave? Or use whatever energy source it had for this sequel. 'Cause with Marty bringing it back to 1885 they would have 2 Delorians to work with . . .ok I'm nit-picking . .I know.	4.0	My only two issues with this movie. . .	2003-01-17	2	2	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A457S8SW690NM	hi	This trilogy is probably one of the best of all time. If you don't already know the plot, it's basically about a time machine in which a scientist and an average man go back in time and go to the future to change awful events from happening. All of these events center around Michael J. Fox's character. What makes these movies such a blast to watch is that adults and children will appreciate it. It blends in adventure and comedy and is an absolute blast. The first one is probably the best because it's the original and in that one they go back in time so that Michael J. Fox's character's parents don't break up but get married. If not he wouldn't be born. And so forth, with the second one involving the children of Michael J Fox's character and the 3rd one which takes place back in the old west. While the third one isn't nearly as good as the others, it still is enjoyable and this trilogy is the one perfect for all families to watch together.	5.0	A great movie for ALL ages	2005-06-21	1	1	0

I had borrowed this set. So I'm not too upset by it and will wait until after the date mentioned to buy my set.The extra disc is full of information on the making of the movies, that most will find enjoyable.Overall, an entertaining set of movies with very few shortcomings.

I know this is an issue with many other movies, but it seems like Universal product is the worst when it comes to this stuff.Also, ""Making of the Trilogy: Chapter Two"" on disc 2 is exactly the same as ""Making of the Trilogy: Chapter One"" on disc 1. Haven't checked to see if ""Chapter Three"" has a similar error.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AMF5LHI9IOIH1	Irishgirl	"First of all, whoa to those who have never seen the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy. These are fantastic Steven Speilberg films that have become 80's cult classics. Action, fantasy and adventure abound within these three small discs.Okay, first let's start with ""Back To The Future."" I don't even remember when I saw this film for the first time; probably when I was about 6 or 7 years old. This 1985 film features Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover. Fox plays Marty McFly, an average-joe 80's kid who loves his skateboard, his electric guitar, his girlfriend and helping his scientist-inventor friend Dr. Emmett Brown with experiments. Lloyd is Dr. Emmett Brown, who with his poofy white hair, wide eyes and enthusiastic attitude, comes across as the perfect ""mad scientist"" with big plans of inventing a successful time traveling machine out of a Dalorian. Glover plays George McFly, the nervous, nerdy father and high school kid (back in 1955) with an uncanny knack for letting people like the fast talking user-bully, Biff, intimidate him. Thompson plays Lorraine Baines/McFly, the somewhat too laid-back, matter-of-fact mother and boy crazy high schooler in 1955.  Marty McFly's life is about to change after, through an exciting and somewhat tragic sequence of events, ends up traveling back in time to the year 1955 in Dr. Brown's time machine. Suddenly, Marty is out of place in a world where a ""Tab"" is not a soft drink, juke boxes rule diners, ""The Jackie Gleason Show"" is brand new, and life preservers are not a fashion trend. Now Marty, filled with culture shock and confusion, has to figure out how to get back to 1985, but he soon finds out that time is limited and that the people, places and events he comes in contact with will change the future. Marty only has so much time to make things right in 1955 and get back to 1985 before his very existence is erased. It will take Dr. Brown's help, a lot of timing, a clock tower and a certain thunderstorm.  The romantic advances of his own mother, convincing his father that he needs to take his mother to the dance, and of course the wrath of big bully Biff (Tom Wilson), are just a few of the obstacles that Marty will have to overcome on his journey back to the future. It's a wild ride from start to finish. Pulling the film together is a very urgent, exciting orchestral soundtrack along with some great songs including Huey Lewis and The News' ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back In Time.""1989 brought us ""Back To The Future II"" picking up where we left off in the first movie. If you thought the first film was mind-boggling and complicated, BTTF II is all that and then some. The whole crew returns in this ultra wild ride filled with non-stop heart pounding action. Marty is once again caught in a time where culture shock fulfills him. The year 2015 features places like ""The Caf&eacute; 80's"" where computers literally take your order and ""Pepsi Perfect"" is a popular drink of choice. Skateboards? That's old school. Try ""Hover Boards;"" boards with no skates that literally fly. Shoes lock onto your feet, and fancy rubber-like jackets have a built-in adjuster and dry-cleaner. This year is where the adventure unfolds. When Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer literally fly space-age style from 1985 into the year 2015 with Doc Brown to take care of some ""future"" trouble involving their kids, they soon learn what can happen if Doc's time machine falls into the wrong hands. Our old pal Biff is an old-timer now, waxing cars for his mirror-image bully grandson Griff. After a conflict in the ""Caf&eacute; 80's"" involving Marty's son Martin Jr., Marty Sr. and Griff , Marty (sr.) and Griff go on another wild chase similar to one of the chases in the first film. Not long after, both Marty and Jennifer find themselves at their future home and are able to see themselves as middle-aged adults as well as witness all the new technologies around their home. Imagine your fingerprints being your ""key"" to the house. Imagine making a fresh Pizza Hut pizza right in an oven. But the adventure really starts when Doc Brown throws a sports almanac from the years 1950-2000 in the trash that Marty had bought at a retro store as a souvenir in the hopes of placing some winning bets when going back to 1985. A certain old man that we all know and love ends up with both the almanac and Doc's time machine. By the time Marty, Jennifer and Doc return to 1985, their nice town of Hill Valley is literally a wounded battle zone of graffiti, guns, smashed cars, bikers and barred windows, save for an enormous and luxurious building conveniently titled ""Biff's."" There is no more George McFly, and guess who Marty's new stepfather is? Marty now finds his life in the balance again and his mom a bit ""bigger"" than he remembered last. After realizing what has happened, Marty and Doc Brown end up heading back to 1955 to undo even more than before. Obstacles this time involve avoiding their other selves from their previous trip back to 1955 in the first film and to not let anyone or anything tamper with their current mission as well as the mission that their other selves were on from their previous trip. Oh yeah, and the biggest obstacle of all is Marty having to steal a certain sports almanac from a certain young high school bully. Who might that be now? Yep, it seems young Biff had a surprise visit from a ""distant relative."" Marty must get this almanac back in order to make the 1985 that he remembers in Hill Valley come alive again, or else the alternate 1985 could leave Marty in ""hell"" forever, or even dead. The adventures of Marty, Doc and the time machine go non stop to the end where we're left wondering what's to happen next. Let's just say that some lightning sucked Doc Brown back a little further in time. Again, the outstanding and exciting orchestral soundtrack is back to keep your heart pounding and you'll also get to hear Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" along with Sammy Hagar's ""I Can't Drive 55.""The final chapter in the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy came in 1990, with BTTF ""Part III."" Picking up where we left off from Part II, Marty must go back in time to the old West; 1885 to rescue Doc Brown and bring him back home to 1985. After learning from the Hill Valley cemetery that Doc had died from a gunshot wound in 1885, Marty enlists the help of the 1955 Doc Brown to help him uncover the time machine that had been stored for several years, fix it up, and go back to the old west. There Marty is out of place once again in the rugged terrain of Hill Valley where cowboys and Indians are abundant, horses are the only mode of transportation other than trains, saloons are the main hangouts complete with women of the evening and you can go to an actual bath house to wash yourself up. Oh yes, and the beloved Hill Valley clock tower is just being built. Rickety houses and shops and dusty dirt streets dot the rather scenic land. Good things and bad things come with the old west for both Marty and Doc. Marty runs into his immigrant Irish ancestors, Doc falls in love with the beautiful Clara (Mary Steenburgen) after rescuing her and both Marty and Doc have to fend for themselves against the old west bully, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen and his cronies. Doc is faced with painful decisions concerning love and the future and Marty needs to survive a high-noon quick draw shooting contest with Mad Dog. Doc shows us his dancing skills at the town fair, while Marty shows off his gun slinging skills. Doc almost gets his head blown off and Marty was about to become the victim of a good ole' fashioned hanging. As a blacksmith, Doc makes horseshoes and invents ice machines for tea. With all this old west charm, the two have to find a way to get the Delorian pushed up to at least 80 miles per hour. With the help of a rigged train and a old fashioned hold-up, Marty and Doc may be able to do just that. But it is a wild ride of speed and explosions that involves the two as well as Clara, and their initial plan could be altered making Doc's future (er....past) different. The original orchestral soundtrack takes a rather intense western tact with harmonicas and themes that are reminiscent of the old western movies. It also features ZZ Top's ""Doubleback.""There are lots of extras including the making of all three films, commentaries from the cast and crew, bloopers, deleted scenes and more. The acting is great, the music is memorable and the special effects were a true asset to the 1980's in film. The ""Back To The Future"" trilogy are definitely films that will be timeless well into the future."	5.0	Films That Will Last Into The Future	2007-01-09	2	1	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2Q0FBE77W4SV0	Jackson Hill	"PART I: The perennial classic featuring Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown and a DeLorian DMC-12 as a time travel machine with a license plate reading OUTATIME. When Doc is gunned down in a shopping mall parking lot, Marty escapes in the DeLorian--only to be propelled thirty years into the past. There he looks up the version of Doc Brown existing then and tries to tell him what's happened. In the process he pollutes the time stream, thusly opening up the possibility that his mother and father will never meet--and the reality he will cease to exist if that becomes the case. Marty must then attempt to rectify the situation with his parents and then convince the 1955 version of Doc to help him get back to 1985, back to the future. So how does this now-22-year-old movie hold up? Pretty well, for the most part. It was a fun movie in 1985 and it's a fun movie in 2007. Not to be taken too seriously, just something to sit back and go along for the ride with--full of humor, excitement, teenaged abandon, great characters with enjoyable dialogue and some interesting time-travel dilemmas, both comedic and mildly dramatic. Even thought-provoking at times. But this movie never gets heavy-handed; it's all about having fun. Sure, there's a certain displacement when considering I was 16 when I first saw it and now I'm nearly 40. There's a definite sense of time's unforgiving passage when it's recognized that the ""present"" in this film (1985) is now nearly as far in the real past as Marty took the DeLorian when he went to 1955. Still, not much has aged badly here, and for all its typical movie clich&eacute;s I still enjoyed living in the past with it. OUTATIME, indeed.PART II: Getting back was only the beginning. Recapping the end of part one and immediately continuing from there, this sequel finds that Marty, after visiting 2015, must travel back to 1955 again to prevent disastrous changes to his version of 1985. Got that? Once again, a successful film full of charm, humor, excitement and cool time travel dilemmas is in store for the viewer. My favorite parts were Marty's visit to 2015, where we see all manner of future technologies in play (flying cars, wall TVs, robotic waiters, video phones--imagine!), a cool retro-80s caf&eacute; (which is really retro to the 2007 viewer, heh) and, more interestingly, the dismal results of Marty's life. Oh, that's me? And my family? That's where I end up? No way. Oh, to know then what we know now and be able to go back and do it again, do things right the second time. It's a nice sentiment, if bittersweet in the knowledge that only the movie persona Marty McFly has that ability to go back and make things right. In addition to the 2015 aspects, I also liked the nearly-apocalyptic vision of 1985 we're treated to, with the ever-vile Biff Tannen having been transformed into a megalomaniac controlling the city. All of which isn't to suggest this movie got serious on us. Not at all. As with its predecessor, things never get too serious or heavy-handed; it's still about providing excitement and fun for the viewer. And in this, it was another enjoyable movie. Not as good as the original perhaps, but not that far behind either. The only negative I can point at is, as with the first film, it didn't really have an ending, but rather just an offramp to the next sequel.PART III: In the last installment of the series, Marty--trapped for the moment in 1955--gets a Western Union letter from Doc Brown penned in 1885 informing him that he's trapped there, the time machine's broken, and it cannot be repaired with materials available then. Yet he's buried the DeLorian in a remote location so that Marty and the 1955 version of Doc can dig it up, repair it, and thusly send Marty back to the future one last time, back to 1985. Doc says he's happy to live out his days in 1885, not to attempt to go back for him. But soon thereafter, Marty finds that the 1885 version of Doc is shot and killed by a member of the ever-tormenting Tannen family mere days after writing the letter. So, after excavating the DeLorian and repairing it, Marty heads back to the old west of 1885 to save Doc. Got all that? Good. So then, how did this third installment fare when compared to the previous two? Not so good. I think they went to the well one too many times with this. Most of the humor, charm and excitement were still attempted, but this time around they were only partially successful. It all began feeling flat. Most of this movie takes place in the old west. In doing so, we get an interesting look at the inception of Hill Valley. And while I do appreciate how they gave us multiple perspectives of the town and famous clock tower throughout the three movies, I found the period spent in 1885--which is basically this whole movie--to be lacking compared to all that came before. Michael J. Fox donning multiple roles (and genders) once again and a cameo appearance by ZZ Top weren't enough to really liven things up, either. By the end, with the big train scene, I was just waiting for it to be over, remembering how much fun it had been to revisit the first two Back to the Future features...and vaguely disappointed with how bored I became with this last one."	3.0	OUTATIME	2009-09-22	0	0	0

They made you want to see the next one as soon as it came out. I had to know what was going to happen to Marty and Doc Brown.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1GBMGSDDG7BFL	James Crouch	It's been a long wait, but now we can cross the Back to the Future trilogy off of the list of great movies not currently available on DVD (which sadly still includes the Indiana Jones trilogy and the first 3 Star Wars movies). Upon watching the Back to the Future movies again, I enjoy them now just as much as the first time I saw them. There's just something about them that lifts them up above so many other movies. Maybe it's the way that they skillfully blend action, comedy, science, and romance into everything you could possibly want out of a movie. Or perhaps it's the amazing chemistry between the cast, particularly Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. The filmmakers and cast do a great job discussing the themes of the movie and the many genres that they encompass on the DVD special features. I'm just not sure exactly what it is, but something makes these movies come together in a way that few films do, they are simply wonderful films. Part 1 is my favorite of the three, probably because it is very interesting to me to think about meeting my parents in high school. I think that the film's originality really struck a chord with viewers. While some people feel Part 2 is the weakest film in the series, I think it should be commended for its creative view of the future as well as the amazing job that was done in integrating the scenes at the high school in 1955 with scenes from the first film. Part 3 is more straightforward adventure, and very enjoyable to watch. The DVD extras were handled very well. There are commentaries and documentaries for each film as well as deleted scenes and outtakes. The outtakes from the 1st film are absolutely hilarious. All in all the Back to the Future would make a very worthy addition to any DVD collection.	5.0	True Cinematic Classics Finally come to DVD	2002-12-18	3	1	2

So the minute I saw this available for preorder on Blu-Ray I was all over it.The sound is amazing and the picture is clear and beautiful. Notice I dropped a star on the review? It wasn't for the second movie (though the second movie is worth the demotion) but for the graphics being too good. Yes, too good. The graphics were so good you could see the actor's make-up. I don't think the producers expected to see this in high definition so you can really see the make-up and masks when they are trying to disguise or age a character.I'm so glad these came in. We watched them all almost instantly and intend to do that every year or so. I love traveling back and forth through time with Marty and Doc!

He was working on theFamily Ties: Season 3tv series in the daytime and had to stay up all night to work on the Mall parking lot scene with Christopher Lloyd. Michael J. Fox was getting only five hours of sleep each day for the rest of the filming and admits to always being half-asleep.""Back to the Future"" was released July 3, 1985 and the story begins on October 26, 1985.Marty McFly (Michael J.

With a DeLorean automobile turned into a time machine, Doc explains to Marty he is going 25 years into the future (2010). When the Libyans find Doc and shoot at him, Marty escapes in the time machine and ends up in the past, November 5, 1955 in Hill Valley at the exact spot.There he meets his own father (Crispin Glover) and his mother (Lea Thompson) who are teenagers.Like ""Star Trek"", you are not suppose to alter the past in anyway, but in Marty's case, he must find Doc in 1955 to help him with a time machine and get his mother and father to kiss at the dance, so Marty can exist and get back to 1985.Very cute movie and a lot of fun to watch.Also in the cast: Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Thomas F.

Rated PG. Running Time: One Hour, 47 mins.Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Written by Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale.When Marty came back to 1985, not everything was quite right. Because Marty interfered in the past with Biff almost sexually assaulting his mother and his father stopping Biff and how his mother and father finally connected, the present 1985 is not how it should be.So Doc returns in the DeLorean time machine to pick up Marty and Jennifer because their kids in the future, October 21, 2015, are not right either.  However, when Marty runs into his son on the square, buys an almanac which Old Biff gets a hold of and then Biff takes the DeLorean time machine for a quick spin to who knows where, it alters 1985 once again.While Hill Valley and the McFly family is in despair, Biff is all-powerful rich.  Doc and Marty must go back to November 5, 1955 and make things right again and not run into themselves or let themselves see them.Returning cast: Michael J.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2Q38TX39UBQ9P	James Mielke	This review is about the packaging, not the movies (which are great to meh in descending order). Why does Every studio that creates multi-disc box set have to pack them in customized, horrible, difficult to use, damaging to the discs-packaging? Back to the Future Trilogy is no exception. What's wrong with disc spindles? It's only six discs (including digital copy discs), not twenty, so why Universal felt it was necessary to lodge these discs in inflexible, brittle, plastic side-tabs is beyond me. In order to pull the discs out you need to wedge your fingers under the sides of the disc, on the disc-read side, and unsnap it from its housing. Same goes for the digital copy discs although those come out more easily.Putting the discs back in is a mysterious process that involves unnerving amounts of plastic grinding against plastic, and 'pinching' of the disc to get it to fit back in under the tabs, none of which is good for the longevity of your remastered blu-ray collection. I wish movie studios would get over trying to innovate with standard boxed collections like this and just stick with what works.I give the collection four stars because the movies shouldn't be penalized for bad packaging, but it's really the first movie that's the winner in the bunch. The second movie was decent, but it doesn't age as well. The third movie, like most third movies, didn't really need to happen, and is just a poor postcard of its era. Great to have them all in one place, so I'm glad for that, but these movies are not created equally.	4.0	Great collection, horrible disc trays	2014-02-09	0	0	0

This is one of the main reasons I bought a DVD player! This set comes with the Making of Back To The Future, a show that was aired on TV a while back. It showed a bunch of behind the scenes stuff, as well as previews of Part 2 and 3. There's also deleted scenes, and a ton of other special stuff that makes this DVD completely worth the price of admission. All I need now is the Cartoon series on DVD and my collection will be complete  :)	5.0	A Classic Finaly Available!	2002-06-25	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3I4A6OCPMZGUS	"Jason L. Baucom ""frodisman"""	This is one of the greatest trilogies ever to come to DVD. I love the time travel stuff and it was well thought through. Though after watching all 3 a million times I do tend to find discrepancies in the time travel and the history it changes.The photo in 1955 shows Emmitts tombstone mentions Clara on it. This is before Marty goes back and the revene is still called Clayton revene. Emmitt doesn't rescue her until Marty shows up. So how did he meet her previously (as stated on the tombstone) if she was dead in the revene?In 1885 if Emmitt is there via the time machine shouldn't there be 2 time machines then if Marty comes back to 1885 as well? Thus Emmitt could have replaced the fuel line and had leftover gas. (maybe)In part 2 when Old Tannen steals the time machine in the future goes back and gives the Almanac to himself in the past then how did he make it back to his future? I did notice the extras does show him come back and disappear but was not in the main Movie.Reguardless, the movies rock. I can watch all 3 over and over.	5.0	Greatest Trilogy Ever!

This is the official Universal Studios statement on the problem:&quot;Universal Studios Home Video is aware of a minor technical framing issue on the &quot;Back to the Future Trilogy&quot; widescreen DVDs. The framing appears differently from the laserdisc releases for approximately two minutes during &quot;Back to the Future II&quot; and four minutes during &quot;Back to the Future III.&quot; The framing difference is unnoticeable to widescreen DVD viewers and does not detract from or interrupt the viewing experience. Consumers with further questions can call (888) 703-0010.  All future pressings will have the correct framing.

In a review that I read of this, I will correct what one person who wrote a 1 star review said. ""How could the DeLorean need fuel? They have Mr. Fusion (junk converter) in BTTF3?"" Well, if you listen to the movie close enough, Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the Flux Capacitor. Mr. Fusion does not power the internal combustion engine. Mr. Fusion only converts the trash to a usable ""Plutonium (PU 238/239)"" and provides power only for the time trip, not the engine.Either way, the Fullscreen version is the best one and is worth every penny."	5.0	BTTF I, II, and III Trilogy FULLSCREEN (Not WS)	2005-07-24	5	0	5

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1MMKUAZAKL395	Jevron Mc Crory	If there's only one thing DVD's should be applauded for, it's for giving old classics a new lease of life, and this particular title was destined for digital before anyone even knew what digital was. The Back to the Future Trilogy will, in most of us, invoke the same feeling of overwhelming nostalgia as when veiwing the original Star Wars trilogy.It's been such a long time since I've viewed the original and wow, why did I wait so long before re-stepping back into the familiar DeLorean and riding through one of the most cleverly scripted and tightly paced films in history. I was blown away all over again by what the makers achieved in terms of, pretty much, everything. The performances are every bit as convincing and funny as you will remember and the sight of the DeLorean taking hair spin turns and breaking the time barrier only serve to ingrain this film deeply in your subconscious. It's simply what it set out to be, a thrill ride of honest intensity and adrenaline populated by sincere and truthful human characters that you generally care about.The second part is, in more ways, even more successful. The plot is so tightly woven and controlled that you can't help but gasp at how much detail is included, from the Mc Fly family history to the correct way to turn on lights in the future. And for visual candy, you cannot beat the beauty of the flying DeLorean.How much you enjoy the third will ultimately depend on how much you like westerns. While obviously retaining the style, wit and bravado of the BTTF legacy, it is alot more digestable in terms of plot and even set pieces. Though as a film by itself, it is a wonderful achievement in entertainment, viewing the installments in order may lead you to feeling ever so slightly let down by a conclusion to the one of the most twisted and brilliant trilogies ever to take place outside of a galaxy far, far away.Keeping in tradition to the BTTF stamp of excellence, the extras on the DVD hit eighty eight miles per hour from the get go and rarely let up. Embarrassing other lesser DVD boxsets with it's desire to leave no stone unturned, we get 'on location' and retrospective documentaries examining the aspects and realities that the film makers endured in order to bring this adventurous tale to the silver screen. Cast and crew remincese fondly about how everyone involved was so excited about the potential of the script and the freshness that Michael J. Fox brought to the production. The star himself even sits in for a few interviews, giving himself wholeheartedly to talk about the movies that made him a household name.While a frankly shocking reason is given to explaining Crispin Glover's absence in BTTF part 2 and therefore, all the extras thereafter, it is the absence of Doc Emmett Brown himself, Christopher Lloyd, that resonates most of all. Why he was not included in this celebration of the trilogy goes unexplained and therefore, unforgiven.This minor gripe aside, this box set is for everyone who managed to hop onboard the DeLorean first time around. For others, this is the perfect medium and compliation to catch up with the time travelling duo as they were meant to be seen. It's astonishing how well the films have aged, and how much better than recent films they remain to be. A knockout!!!	5.0	A stunning rift in the  movies continuum Marty!!!	2002-12-04	124	100	24

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3MQ672FYFNM7B	JGC	"""Back to the Future"" has gotta be the very best movie of the 80's. For anyone under 30, you know that the 1980's is the new 1940's. This is the golden age of cinema for the MTV Generation. And that just makes ""Back to the Future"" so much more special because even with tons of other great feature films, it still stands out.The movie has so many great lines and catchphrases, such as, ""Hello, hello, anyone home? Think McFly, think."" I can not so fondly remember how my teenage uncles used to imitate Biff and knock on mine and my brother's head just like Biff did to George. Another great line, ""history's gonna change.""I also love the entire cast. From beginning to end the cast is totally perfect. My favorite of course is Michael J. Fox as Marty. He was the perfect actor to play this role because he was so cute and cool and brave. (BTW, can you believe they were originally gonna use Eric Stoltz! Can you say: MISCAST!!) I also love Crispin Glover (Geroge McFly, although in the 2nd one he was played by Jeffrey Weissman) who was so completely funny. Christopher Lloyd as the Doc was perfect. He totally reminded me of his character from ""Taxi."" Rounding out the cast is Lea Thompson (Lorraine, Marty's mom) and Thomas F. Wilson (as the unforgettable Biff Tannen.) I also like both of the Jennifers (Claudia Wells was in the first one) (Elisabeth Shue was in the second 2 movies.) My favorite Jennifer was Claudia Wells but she refused to do the sequels because of ""personal issues."" Maybe she wanted more money like Crispin Glover? Oh and I also really liked Wendie Jo Sperber (may she rest in peace) (who played Marty's sister, Linda.) I especially liked how Linda took the curlers out of her hair at the dining room table, that's so 80's!!Instead of going on about the storylines and plots for each of these movies (that the entire world has seen) I thought it would be more fun to describe some of the old and otherwise archaic technologies, culture and styles that were displayed in the ""future"" Hill Valley of 2015. It made the movie appear somewhat dated, but that's why it's an entertaining 80's film.Payphones - There was a clear shot of one during the daytime scene when Marty left the cafe. I can't remember the last time I've even seen a payphone, let alone used one (maybe 10 years?) Last year the country's biggest phone company announced that because of the advent of cell phones they were getting out of the payphone business.Picture Frames - There was a ton of these all over the McFly's end table. Although not obsolete yet, most agree that within the next few years we will begin to see less and less of these because digital frames will be much easier to access.Bulletin Flyers - These were displayed outside of the cafe, near the dumpster. This is something else that I can't remember seeing for years and years. Probably because of electronic networks like Craigslist.Sales Staff that ""wait on"" customers - The saleslady in the ""antique"" store was totally waiting on Marty and trying to get him to buy something. The small ""mom & pop"" stores of yesterday are nearly totally gone. And those huge department stores that replaced them do not have the time, energy or patience to wait on anyone.Faxes - Marty's home had fax machines everywhere (even inside the closet!) First of all, did you see how antiquated the print on the faxes looked? So 1985. For the home consumers, faxes and telexes are about as useful as Morse code. And for businesses they will be a thing of the past within the next 5 to 10 years for obvious reasons.Mailboxes - There was one in the ""center"" of Hill Valley (next to the USA Today newspaper dispenser.) With electronic billing, text messages and cell phones we are mailing less and less. ""Snail mail"" will never completely evaporate, but these old-fashioned-looking mailboxes are becoming a thing of the past.Green Screen Door - This was the door that old Biff scampered out of before he got in the taxi to follow Doc and Marty. You'd think that in 2015 they would have nicer looking doors? This one looks like something straight out of the 1950's.Oversized Earnings - The saleslady in the ""antique"" store was wearing this godawful pair of yellow earrings that are roughly the size of a Jr. cheeseburger from Wendy's. And the old Jennifer also had on a pair of these large things on her ears. Ear-jewelry like this has not been in style since ""The Golden Girls"" were on TV.Wallpaper - The McFly's home was covered in this. This is something else that is totally out of style. Last year when I was helping a friend redo her kitchen we went to a popular home improvement store to get some border and were told that they stopped manufacturing this years ago....The entire ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" is beyond perfect. And, the music is so fast and funny. Huey Lewis & The News. My goodness, talk about bringing back the dead. The Trilogy is not too much and not too little. You know how some movies can drag on and on and on (like this review?) that's not the case here. Michael J. Fox was a brand-new man in each of these movies. Of course the first one is the very best. But I enjoyed ""Back to the Future Part II"" immensely (and Part III, as wel.) As any child of the 80's can attest to, this movie was such a hugely anticipated event. ""Back to the Future Part II"" was almost like a religious experience because no one could live without it. Everyone has to see all 3 of these movies. Even if the ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" had Skippy, Elyse, Mallory & Tina Yothers it still couldn't be more 80's! Sha la la la..."	5.0	Hello, hello, anyone home?

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1ZU55TM45Y2R8	J. Haggard	There are not many movies I go back to and watch more then once. In fact I recently cleaned up my DVD shelf and traded in or sold most of my old movies but there are a few that I will forever keep. One of which is the Back to the Future trilogy, this to me is one of the greatest movies of all time. I grew up watching Doc brown and Marty, I've ridden the ride at Universal Studios and it's just a great movie.The Blu-Ray edition takes you back to the classics, only the sound is enhanced and pictures are a bit more crisp. In fact there are some close up shots on people where  you just think they shouldn't be shown in blu-ray format because of obvious makeup lines that are more apparent in hi-def then standard DVD. BUT, it's a great movie, I go back to it time and time again and I love the enhanced sound this blu-ray edition brings, like the story board mode which as you watch the movie pops up story boards so you can see how the came up with the scenes (optional viewing mode).If you are a back to the future fan, or just a fan of great movies get this.	5.0	Still great after all these years!	2012-01-07	2	2	0

I just received the 1/25/05 widescreen release of the BTTF trilogy release on 1/27/05, from Amazon/Borders, and I am very pleased.  I have viewed all three movies and some of the special features.  My set up is a 50 inch widescreen TV and a 6.1 sound system.  The sound and vision was excellent.  I was reluctant to purchase the trilogy, due to past poor reviews of the widescreen version with errors on disc 2 and 3, with letterbox black bars on the top and bottom.  I did not detect any portion of scenes with less picture information or black bars on any of the movies. The viewing screen was filled, in my opinion, perfectly.  The 5.1 re-master sounds great and is utilized very well.  In fact, I am able to force on my two rear surround speakers in conjunction with my side surround speakers and my decoder fills my room with sound.  The most obvious sound effect is within the last 15 minutes of disc one, where a helicopter sounds like it is circling the room from the right to rear to left.  The viewer has the feeling of being in the center of the screen.  Great Sound.......The packaging on this new release has a cellophane wrapper indicating - All 3 movies! Lowest Price Ever.  Own it before time runs out!  Widescreen.  I checked the DVDs to try and determine if indeed these were updated versions.  The second DVD does have the obvious ""V2""  (for version 2) on the face near the bottom, after all rights reserved.  The third DVD does not have ""V2"" on the bottom, as I was hoping.  Thereafter, I placed the DVDs in my computer to check the contents date.  Disc 1 (that never had any problems) had dates from 2002.  Discs 2 and 3 had content dates from 2003.  Just to be sure, I put the movie to the test and compared the noted problem scenes on the BTTF framing web site, and found disc three to be correct.  So, I am satisfied and believe that I have updated versions of the widescreen DVDs.NOTE:  On a regular TV (Not Widescreen), there are the black letter box bars on the top and bottom of the screen, but they are not visible on my widescreen TV.4/2/05.  I recently watched all three movies for a second time and turned on the trivia track - A great special feature for another viewing.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2A6NH6DPE0VXR	"Jim ""Pimmy"""	"Back to the Future: This has to be one of the most cleaver and fun films about time travel. Michael J. Fox plays Marty Mcfly who's a slacker who just wants hang with his g/f and play the guitar. His camping trip plans with his g/f get crushed when his wimpy father lets his high school bully Biff get away with his crashing up the car. This ruins Marty's plans since he was going to use that car on his camping trip. His parents met pathetically. His dad got hit by his grandfather's car and she went to the prom with him because she felt bad for him.He meets his scientist friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) at a mall parking lot in the middle of the night to discover that he made a time machine out of a car. Doc pissed off some terrorists though by stealing some key  parts for it from them. Doc gets shot and while Marty trys to get away in the car it sends him to 1955. There he's very out of place of course since he's from 1985. In a smart and funny scene, while at a restuarant he doesn't realize he's sitting next to his father. There Marty sees a young Biff pick on his father while Biff makes fun of how Marty is dressed. Then Marty follows his dad and sees him peeping on his mom ""who of course is young and not his mom yet"" from a tree. George ""his dad"" falls from the tree and almost gets hit by a car unti...Marty pushes him out of the way and gets hit instead.Although he doesn't have the perfect family, it's up to him to bring his parents together since he ruined how they were supposed to meet. On top of things his mom has a crush on....him now. So now he has to try and get his coward dad to be a man and ask her out, although Biff is always in the way when he trys to do that. He has to meet Doc from 1985 too and convince him that he's from the future from a time machine that he invented. Since Doc is his only chance to get back to 1985. Marty also needs to try some how to stop Doc from dieing in 1985. The result is clever, funny and well made film that is sure to entertain you.****Back to the Future 2: This sequel takes place where the first left off. Doc, Marty and his g/f take off to 2015 where they have to save the future of Marty's kids. Sure that sounds weak and it sorta is but this is a fun movie with clever ideas about the future. The 2015 scenes are best scenes of the movie. You have flying cars, flying skate boards called hover boards, dehydrated pizza and jackets that dry themselves. So that makes the 2015 scenes all fun. In the most entertaining scene Marty has to disguise himself as his kid who looks just like him except he wears a colorfil hat. He needs to stop his son from getting in deep trouble with Biff's nephew...Griff. Marty stands up to Griff which leads to a fun chase on hoverbaords.After saving the future of his kids, Marty causes a whole lot of trouble by buying a sports book about everything that has happened in the last 20 years in sports. Figuring he can make money off it. Doc sees it and gets rid of it. Old Biff though figures out that they came from a time machine and takes the book and time machine without them knowing. He gives the book to Biff from the 50's which causes Biff in 1985 to be rich and powerful which ruins the life Marty knows. His dad was murdered and his mom is now married to Biff. So to get 1985 back to the way he knows it he needs to go to 1955 and get the book from Biff before he can use it.In the end the time machine gets hit by lightning which sends Doc ""without Marty"" to the 1800s"". So it ends with Marty once again looking for help from the Doc of 1955. The result is a fun movie with clever ideas but you have to turn your brain on high when watching it too. It's not as good as the first but the futuristic scene is one of the best ideas of the future. I mean when I saw this movie I waited patiently for flying cars to come out when I was little lol. In a side note, look for Elijah Wood as a little kid in the 2015 scene in the diner. He plays one of the kid that remakrk to Marty about the cowboy arcade being a babie's toy.*** 1/2Back to the Future 3: In much more mild story with less happenings than part 2 Marty has to go to the 1885 to save Doc. Turns out that Doc will get shot by....you guessed it...a distant relative of Biff lol. Doc buried the time machine in 1885 so Marty could use it in 1955 to get back to 1985. Since Doc knew the time machine only had enough energy left for one trip. Instead though Marty goes to 1885 to save Doc. Marty gets in trouble though with cowboy Biff and turns out that Doc is the one that has to save Marty from getting hung.Doc tells Marty that they aren't getting back home without gas but figures out a plan to have a train push the time machine until it reaches the right speed to get them back home. They complicate things more though when Doc saves a woman Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) from heading off a cliff with her wagon. Marty realizes that she was supposed to die because her dieing there is a part of history. Doc of course doesn't take that well since he thinks that changing things in history is very dangerous. Still though he finds himself falling for her and has to choose between going back to the future or staying with her. Marty gets himself in more trouble with cowboy Biff when he stops him from shooting Doc. He agrees to a drawer figuring he'd be back in the future by the time that day comes.This is a good movie but a little too laidback compared to Back to the Future 2 or even part 1 for that matter. I mean I wish they just weren't in the west the whole movie if it was going to be the last one. It doesn't go out with that much of a bang. I also don't think Michael J. Fox playing a distant relative works since Lea Thompson plays...the his wife lol. I guess that's supposed to be funny since she also plays his mom. Since the mom had a crush on Marty in 1955. I would've preferred a cowboy George Mcfly instead, now that could've been funny. But this is still a good movie since the west scenes do work and Robert Zemeckis still of course makes sure we're entertained.***I heard that Michael J. Fox might being willing to do a part 4 where Marty is like Doc now and a scientist as well. Not sure of how much that one is true since he doesn't act much due to his health. I think that could only work if Zemeckis directs but I hear he would only produce it. I'd also like to see Tobey Maguire or Topher Grace in a Marty type role if it happens. Some times good things are better off just left alone though."	5.0	One of the best trilogies	2006-04-14	6	3	3

They have been aroind for 20 years, but they never seem to grow old.  Michael J. Fox really hit his acting stride with these movies.  His performance is exceptional both by his ability to deliver a line and be his facial expressions.At first I thought I enjoyed the first film the most and gave the sequels little credit.  Then I realized how they were all intertwined and came to appreciate all of them for their entertainment value.  The supporting role of Christopher Lloyd helps make the movies all come together.  He's both whacko and serious, dramatic and funny.  He was the perfect choice for the goofy scientist.

But, to give a little bit of background: The ""Back to the Future"" trilogy are action/adventure/comedy/science fiction movies that deal with time travel.  The films started with the premise of going back into time and seeing what your parents were like in high school, but they became more involved than just that.  The films also touch on what happens if you go back in time and how your actions can affect the future.  These are not serious movies.  They are fast paced, and are a lot of fun to watch.  These were some of my favorite movies when I was growing up.This is a three disc set with each movie being on a DVD.  Each film has multiple commentary tracks (a Q&amp;A session serves as a commentary), and a pop-up trivia feature so that when you are watching the movie little tidbits of information about the scene or the making of the scene.  There are also deleted scenes, outtakes, and two ""making of"" documentaries for each film.There has been some controversy about framing issues for discs two and three, and this held me up from purchasing the movies for more than a year.  On the widescreen set (which I am reviewing) for several minutes in each movie the movie is mis-framed.  Specifically the frame is raised higher than it should be so that in one particular scene it cuts off the bottom of Marty's body and his hand and shows more of the empty air above his head.  Knowing about the mis-framing bothered me quite a bit, but when I was watching the movies this time I forgot all about it and didn't notice it at all.  If you see a screen capture of a scene it is noticeable, but not so much when you're enjoying the movie.  If this is a concern, Universal will replace your discs with corrected DVDs, but I still haven't been able to find one in the store.  As it stands I am perfectly happy with my set and will not be sending the discs in for replacement (despite the framing issue bothering me on principle).This is a great DVD set, and though I may not be watching the special features over and over again, I am so glad to own these movies on DVD.  The movies still hold up well years later (even the first movie).  If you like the Back to the Future movies then you should get this set."	5.0	I love this set!	2004-02-26	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2TDK8D4HEMUYW	"John ""MovieAddict"""	"Time travel films have had some major impacts on the film industry over the years, but even more so on American culture. You can look back to some of the earliest films and detect a hint of sci-fi / time travel in them; just take a look at H.G. Well's ""The Time Machine."" However, I think the biggest and best time travel film ever made is the 1985 hit ""Back to the Future."" Here is the plot summary:It is 1985. Marty McFly (a young Michael J. Fox) lives in the small town Hill Valley, located in the middle of nowhere, and is friends with the town eccentric, Professor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who, unknown to Marty, has just built a time machine after thirty years of ideas. A time machine that runs off plutonium.After some unfortunate incidents occur, Marty accidentally travels thirty years back in time using the time machine, which is made ""out of a Delorean!"" - to 1955! Now, his only hope of getting ""back to the future"" is to hunt down the inventor of the machine: Doc Brown. Only a few problems; not only has Professor Brown not invented the time machine at this point in time, but Marty has also interfered with the past - by accidentally keeping his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) from meeting, therefore disrupting the space-time continuum and keeping Marty from being born! (Also, keep in mind that his parents are his age in 1955.)""Back to the Future"" could be called a very controversial film. After all, after traveling to 1955, Marty's mother develops a crush on him. I would call that pretty controversial. However, unlike some other films, the controversy is not the only thing ""Back to the Future"" has going for it. There are many things that make this movie great. I'll analyze the plot first; not only does it have fun with the notion of time travel, but it sets a character that we care about in situations that we want him to be in. Let me expand on this...I get tired when time travel films have a great premise, but get mixed up in boring subplots and fail to play with ideas they could have. A lot of people love ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure."" I'll admit that was a good time travel film, but ""Back to the Future"" plays with the actual notion of time travel much, much more, and by doing so creates some major laughs and ""thinking"" moments.""Back to the Future"" also has a great sense of direction. [...].Produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, ""Back to the Future"" gets 5/5 stars from me - it has originality, humor, great actors, an excellent plot, and mind-boggling ""what ifs."" it has to be one of my favorite movies, and if you see it, it might become one of your favorites, also."	5.0	Truly one of the best comedies ever...	2003-06-02	2	2	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ABX7SEE84DMLU	John P Bernat	"Well, there are five reasons.1.  The screenplay's treatment of science.  As much as I like science fiction, science fiction fans have developed a jargon which has alienated normal people.  SF folks know, for example, not only what a time warp is, they also can explain the general theory of relativity which allows for such a thing.  So you have extremely involved scientific theory which must be explained to a lay audience, in such terms that they are not put to sleep.  H.G.Wells understood that, and Robert Zemeckis does, too.  So, without patronizing the audience or cheapening the literary value, the theory is developed and then illustrated in straightforward, dramatic and accessible terms.  It helps that the scientist-hero is lovable but not quite sane.2.  The screenplay's treatment of extremely touchy human issues.  OK, so you go back in time and your mother falls in love with you, which is punished by the extinguishment of your own existence.  Sound like lighthearted fun?  Can you only imagine what Quentin Tarantino would have done with this material?  But here, it becomes independent fuel for the plot, made ""safe"" by mom and son consummating their relationship, only to find that they taste funny.  Our socio-sexual mores are protected, and the universe is restored to peace and balance.  And they did it in only two shots, too!3. Production values. Today, we have amazing capabilities in CGA, capture technologies, and digital special effects. Back in 1985, they had pyro, models and matte photography. But hey, feel the love here: they built a town square set, meticulously remade the 1950s, and then ""aged"" it for it's run-down 1985 look. You feel as though you grew up there and then lived there throughout its degeneration. The sheer brilliance of the filmmaker's dedication to these premises is not an accident. Our Auteur (Zemeckis) and our Angel (Spielberg, before becoming the total gozillionaire he is today) said we'd spare no expense in creating a lovingly detailed picture of the past and the present...4. Our ability to identify. This is a movie about us. Most great movies are just that. We identify with the protagonist, the archetypal wise-guy American ""kid,"" featured in American films since before Mickey Rooney. We identify with his finding his own past - thus completing a quest we can all identify with. But finally, we identify with everyone. Even the parents, who lose and then find their relationship in the present. Even the bad guy who, while not redeemed exactly, is placed into a role commensurate with his gifts. Even the scientist, who, in a wonderful moment in all screen history, expresses the Dr. Frankensteinian triumph but in a way that makes us all share his joy: ""It Works!!"" This, after many, many failures and disappointments, exposing him to ridicule as a ""mad scientist"" at worst and a moneyed loser at best. What could be more American than that?5. Gestalt. Call it what you want, but consider the conceptual continuity of these three movies. 1985 remained the ""present"" for all the films, right? Even this one and BTTF3, made some years later, preserved 1985 as the fulcrum year.Quick quiz: of all the eras depicted, which one was the best: 1885, 1955, 1985 or 2015? Tough question, given that there were at least three distinct 1985s, etc.But look: even the ""best"" 1985 was, in significant ways, not as good as the movie's 2015. Our predicates, then, are that obstacles can be overcome, the past reinvented as needed, and, most importantly, ""the future is what you make it.""I like this new millenium of ours - how about you??I've found no clearer demonstration of a fundamentally optimistic philosophy in any movie I ever saw. Even though these 3 films intentionally avoid sentimentality (all right, you could argue that), they express a relentless optimism that enables characters and, derivately, ourselves, to take charge of our situations, invent new solutions and fulfill Doc Brown's mandate.You cannot leave the movie without feeling more empowered about your own life. And it does not get any better than that."	5.0	Why Was This The Best Science Fiction Movie Ever Made?	2005-04-10	4	2	2
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A179PJPTIADPIN	"John ""Sir Winston"""	"It's about time that someone figured out a (BETTER) way to keep discs securely in place.How many CD's, DVD's, or BD's have you opened, only to find the disc loose inside the cover?  How many disc cases do you have, where some of the center hub tabs have broken off and no longer secure the disc?  How many times have you thought you were going to break a disc, bending and twisting it, struggled to get it out of the case, because the center hub is too tight?  This is a problem that needed addressing years ago.If disc packaging was this way (spring loaded bottom with edge tabs) from the beginning, and all-of-a-sudden, packaging was switched to the center hub method, people would REALLY be complaining.  This new packaging is a much better way to keep discs secure, in place, without coming loose in storage or transit.As for the center hubs that don't have the little plastic tabs that break, that do an excellent job of securing the disc, ...  In many cases you need to twist and bend the disc to get it off of those tight hubs.  Many reviewers (see Planet Earth) have broken their BD's, attempting to get them free from center hubs that are too tight.  Damage or breakage seems to be the misconception that reviewers are having with this new packaging.With the new packaging, there's no need to bend the disc.  It won't become dislodged in storage or transit.  The chances of scratching or damaging the disc by removing and replacing it, are very much less.  This is a better way to secure the disc in its packaging and easier to remove and replace, once you know the secret!  But until this packaging is standardized or ""the norm"" ...I won't be likely to loan it to anyone without giving them simple instructions, first!I recommend this Back to the Future Blu-Ray Collection for all the positive reasons mentioned by others.  I also recommend you learn how to remove and replace the discs PRIOR to doing so."	5.0	Disc Packaging: It's about TIME! / No pun intended	2011-06-10	7	6	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A357A1TI51VT1S	"JOHN SPANGLER ""Johnny Spang"""	I'm not going to waste your time or my time saying how great this trilogy set is. And it is. But the problem is, if you're not careful, you could ruin this entire DVD set within a short period of time. Universal should be ashamed. And maybe they do this because they think if you ruin the set, you'll buy it again? I really don't know. But I've came to the point where I don't want to keep the discs in the case anymore. Removing, putting it back in the case, it doesn't matter, I always felt I was going to scratch or ruin the disc. There are two springs at the bottom of the case where the disc sets, you put pressure down on these springs, then you're supposed to press down in the middle of the disc and it's supposed to come out. First off, there was no instructions. I actually had to go on Google and youtube to find out how to properly do it. Even by watching, it's still a pain, and I still have serious issues putting the disc back in the case. I think I scratched the first disc by the defective casing. I don't blame Amazon at all, but I probably will be returning this. If you're scared about taking the disc out, you can check out youtube for help, but even with proper instruction, it still seems overly problematic and this should not be like this. Universal again, should be ashamed.	2.0	Great movies, worst packaging in DVD history	2010-11-08	10	5	5

However, for those who have trouble with the disc management system...it's fairly simple.I personally don't like it, I actually broke the mechanism that holds Part 1 before I figured it out.Basically, you just need to push the disc down so it bends the two plastic ""arms"". Then you can lift it out. I broke it by actually using my fingers to push them down, and they snapped fairly easily. Luckily blu-rays are very scratch resistant so it's not really an issue.Also, a fun fact for those out there. This comes with a coupon code for TellTale Game's Back to the Future game.

The audio and video quality is amazing.  This film series was truly before its time.  In fact, it seems that in Part II you see a cameo by a flat-screen wide aspect TV (the scene where McFly's son switches on the TV and commands it to go to like 8 channels at once).  Also, the Nikes Marty wears in Part II look a lot like the sneakers teenagers wear nowadays.  Heavy!As for the trilogy pack, the price was great on Amazon, it included the BD DVD as well as Digital Copy for each film.The extras will take me many hours to get through but that's a good thing.  It is chocked-full of stuff.  Other reviewers mentioned the conspicuous absence of Christopher Lloyd in the extras.  If that's so I'll likely downgrade this review later.Other than that I was blown away watching this on my home theater system.  My wife, who had not watched these films in some time, was amazed.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3P8KV8AD1I3O7	Joseph K.

It takes extra space on a DVD in providing higher quality audio, and 'I do' watch extra features, and am glad most DVDs have them. In a lot of cases, they can be just as interesting as the feature itself.I'm certainly not going to purchase a special 25th Anniversary 'Trilogy' Edition of anything, if sacrifices were made to cram it all on one DVD.I also read other's reviews, and didn't know about the original Trilogy, disk 2 and 3 having black bars 'installed' over the feature to make it appear as widescreen. I'm wondering if after all this time they are still doing exchanges? I intend to find out... That was a 'very' helpful review, wish I would had seen it a long time ago.I do hope the information provided by amazon.com about this 25th Anniversary Trilogy is just a misprint. To cram all that on one DVD, no doubt sacrificing special features, would be a crime.

""Back to the Future,"" made Michael J. Fox a movie star, and Robert Zemeckis a directorial star.  ""Back to the Future"" created some of the most memorable screen characters in film history. Dubbed a special-effects comedy, it's a flat out entertaining movie and unique piece of film work. Seventeen years after the original's release, it has remained a classic and continued to entertain all of us. We all thought back to what it would be like to travel back in time, see what our parents were really like and how they fell in love.  We all thought about what the future would be like, and if there would be flying cars, holograms, and who knows what else.  People's imaginations took off and the possibilities seemed endless and the movie truly gave us something to think about.As the last scene takes place, we realize that this wasn't just a movie we were watching, it was a film that we all could relate to. That life is whatever you make it, that our future isn't written...we control our future and our destiny. We may run into the Biff's of the world and many other obstacles...but we are the ones who ultimately determine our own future. And that is clear to us in the end.It's a trilogy that takes place over a couple hours in actuality on a late friday night-early saturday morning in 1985, but that takes us from 1955 to 2015 back to 1885, then concluding in 1985.

Michael J Fox remains one of my favorite actors and I'm happy to add this box set to my collection.I'll always remember taking my mother to see the first Back to the Future when it hit the theater, nothing beats watching a movie on those huge screens and surrounded by speakers, it was awesome.  I was so excited and couldn't wait for it to start, in those days I thought (and still do) that Michael J Fox was a great actor and absolutely adorable.That day is still vivid in my memory because I was so into the movie but realized, after several questions from my mother, that she was completely lost!  She couldn't keep up with the Future, Past, Re-Create the Future concept, laughing at her puzzled and bewildered face I tried to explain the plot as the movie went along but still to this day I don't think she truely understands what happened!I think that the first movie was the best, the second wasn't bad with their futuristic view but the last seemed to be lacking the original excitement of the whole time travel concept and seemed to be missing energy.You definately have to pay attention to what's going on or, like my mother, you'll be confused too.	5.0	A Great Trilogy	2007-01-16	0	0	0

Now I don't have to worry about my tapes deteriorating due to serious playback...and can retire to the Collectibles cabinet.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2WXARHO7VTZ8A	Julie	"""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite movie ever since I was a little kid and I am so excited that it's finally coming out on DVD! Michael J. Fox is probably one of my all time favorite actors. The first one is of course the best, but I still really like the 2nd one because its take on the future is so cheesy! The 3rd one never caught my interest, but I still watch it because I think MJF was cute when he was young (even though he's old enough now to be my dad. LOL). I asked my parents to buy it for my for Christmas, but I now know that my brother's girlfriend is getting it for him, so I don't even have to worry. BTW, if you really like MJF, you should read ""Lucky Man"". Talk about a great book! Well that's my review!"	5.0	I CAN'T WAIT!	2002-11-27	25	6	19

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2YOB4L6PQHS1F	Justin D. Morgan	"I purchased this item as I wanted to get it before the Digital Copy promotion had expired. I was disappointed when I saw that the Digital Copy promotion seemingly ended late last year, and that no Digital Copy codes were included in the package.Then I looked at several recent reviews, and saw that several people had gotten new Digital Copy codes from Universal within the past two weeks. So I contacted Universal from their Digital Copy site on June 13th, and received new codes last night (June 18th). I can confirm that the new Digital Copy codes worked, and I now have all three movies in my iTunes library.I am deducting one star since I had to contact Universal to get the Digital Copy codes, and their reply took more than two business days (it was three business days for those counting).***6/28/2012 Update:I purchase movies to enjoy, not to review. Plenty of others have already critiqued the plot of the movie, and have also digested the visual quality of the Blu-ray transfer. So I am sorry if you didn't appreciate my original ""review"" that was pointing out that Digital Copy codes, which were said to be included in the Amazon description, and were actually missing from the package I received. I do deduct point(s) for missing parts, and would have actually deducted half a star if Amazon allowed.So the only thing that I am going to say about visual quality is that while it has been a while since I have watched the DVD version of the trilogy, I can tell that the Blu-ray transfer is superior to the DVD (as it should be) -- and Universal didn't manage to ruin the visual gags in Back to the Future II, as was the case with the original trilogy DVD transfer (which is the version that I owned). But I am not the kind of person that measures charts with a digital camera; likewise, I am not going this watch a movie, or any other, and find every last flaw (visual, plot, etc.)I will also go ahead and thank Universal for including Digital Copies of all three films, instead of UltraViolet ""copies""."	4.0	Universal Sent New Digital Copy Codes	2012-06-19	4	2	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1OBJ2263JCK5	Kenneth M. Gelwasser	"Just recently my six year old came to me with an urgent problem. He just had to see a movie ""with time travel in it!"" I'm sure there are lots of sci-fi/fantasy films that would fit the bill, but the first thing to pop into my mind were the iconic '80s ""Back to the Future"" series of films.Years ago, I had a ball watching this entertaining yet, convoluted Sci-Fi trilogy. The films feature high schooler/amateur musician, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his friend & employer, scientist, Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) as they go back and forth (in a Delorean sports car/time machine) between the past (1955/1885), present (1985) and future (2015). They are trying to to fix the ""time continuum"" that has been mucked up, when Marty accidentally (in Part I) keeps his parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson) from meeting and falling and love in 1955. Marty must get them back together or else he and his family will cease to exist! From there a whole series of time vexing conundrums are set to happen with ripple effects in both the distant future (Part II) and the long ago past of the 'Wild West (Part III).Well, I showed these three films to my six year old and not only did he enjoy them, but he became fanatical about them! Like, most kids, once he saw the series, he wanted to re-watch it over and over again. Now, in most cases, watching the same thing a few zillion times might drive the average parent nuts. But not in this case. It seems like no matter how many times you watch these three films, you will discover something new, that you hadn't realized or connected before. Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale's scripts work brilliantly together. They remind me of a 'Rubik's Cube' or one of those old M. C. Escher illustrations that seems to go on into infinity. Eventually if you watch these films enough times, it becomes clear there are plotlines, details, dialogue and themes, that keep re-occurring in patterns over and over again between characters and generations, no matter what the year is. These three films are just the ultimate in the ideal of movie sequels. Each film really does depend on the other to tell a truely complete story.Besides the brilliant scripts the films also offer wonderful acting performances (especially Fox, Lloyd and Thomas S. Wilson as various bullys in the Tannen family tree), good special effects (which still pretty much hold up for modern day, CGI savey viewers) and a majestic, memorable score, which will stick in your head for days. The three films have now been put together in a three DVD box set called ""Back to the Future: The Complete Trilogy"". This includes over ten hours of 'extras' including audio commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes ETC.These films will both overwork your brain and excite your imagination! Highly recommended!"	5.0	"""Roads? Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads!"""	2008-05-28	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3P98J5DZ00A75	"Ken Roberts ""social historian"""	"I guess the best way to define if an older movie (or series, in this case) is still considered good in today's society is how the younger generation reacts upon first watching it.I have four children, ranging from 7 to 19, and all but one consider the Back to the Future trilogy to be a classic (one of my children - my 12 year old - is at the ""I only watch cartoons"" phase and has no interest in human television, although he peeped out every so often to catch what was happening).All of us laughed out loud throughout the series (watched over the course of three Saturdays) and were totally engulfed during the playing of each movie. My 16 year old especially loved it and considers it right up there with Star Wars - quite a feat for my son to say that.I thought it would be more dated than what it was. I mean, they bring up having to get back to 1985 quite often (hard to believe 1985 was 23 years ago at the time of this writing), there is a scene of Marty McFly doing Michael Jackson's moonwalk, and, most notable, was what the producers imagined 2015 would be like (flying cars and hover boards) - highly unlikely, now that we are only seven years from that actual time.But, that's minor in the big picture. The whole reason for this series harkens back to the movies of the 1930's - escapism and entertainment. And that's what these movies do for me - takes me away from the crap of today's society, even if only for a short time.I enjoyed watching the extras: deleted scenes; the making of; commentary.Another reviewer made a comment about how far we have come with special effects since the making of these movies, and that the special effects used here makes these flicks look dated. I don't think so. To me, it looks less computerized than today's effects. I feel the quality is excellent.You definitely get your money's worth with this set. This is a great series that I cannot recommend enough."	5.0	Escapist Entertainment at its Finest	2008-03-02	3	2	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A26G35WR7QCFR2	Kevbo	"Let me begin by saying that I bought this great trilogy because I love all three Back to the Future movies.  My favorite is the first one, but the second one intrigues me the most.  The third is still a great flic.  These are classic movies and everybody should own them.That said, I'd like to review the DVD collection in particular, as offered here.The great feature about buying DVDs nowadays is that the consumer gets all those wonderful ""unknown"" features that weren't shown during the cinematic release of the film.  Namely, the deleted scenes, funny out takes, the ""Making of..."" documentaries, and other features like exclusive web sites, trivia, art, etc.What I have found is that times have certainly changed since the 1980s, and thank God for that.  Technology has required a higher level of competition amongst movie makers and sellers.Watching the Back to the Future (BTF) extra features, I have to say that I was only about 40% appreciative.They included the commentary dub-overs, which I usually like.  They also provided a more recent, slightly more candid ""Making of..."" documentaries on each disc.  They also had the out takes and deleted scenes (with commentary option) available.  So why was I only 40% pleased?First, the bonus material is not included on one separate disc like most trilogy packages are being sold nowadays.  If you want to learn about the BTF sequences, you will have to pull the individual disc to do so.Second, I only marginally appreciated the original 1980s ""Making of..."" features because, back then, it was a marketing tool.  They released the ""Making of..."" videos around the same time as the cinema release so as to tease viewers into watching the film (hopefully) numerous times.I understand those times are gone now with DVDs being released within only weeks or months after the cinema release - not like the old days when the VHS was released a year or more later.  But this leads to my third issue with the BTF trilogy package.Third, it seemed the producers (Bob Zemekis and Bob Page) felt obligated to offer a more candid approach to the ""Making of..."" reel.  I appreciated that, but the documentaries were still largely weak as much of the background or ""science"" behind the films were left out.  They were also rather short as a result.  But I did appreciate the business angles each producer/director provided.  (The actors were just trying to sell the movie... still.)Fourth and last, the BTF trilogy turned out to be less-than-great in terms of the special features offered in regards to what the directors/producers offered.  That is, there are two features that are selectable on each disc that is titled something like ""Directors'/Producers' take on the movie and discussion.""  You click on the link and it simply returns you to the Main Menu.  That is, there is no special feature here... was it removed or are the discs bad?To summarize everything I reviewed here, let me just say that the Back to the Future trilogy does not compare favorably with other trilogies on the market (like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and other movie trilogies from that time period).  Specifically, the DVD features of the BTF trilogy truly lack in comparison.Since we mostly expect DVDs to offer special features that are quality, I had to give this product a 3-Star rating due to their weak status.  However, I did not rank it lower than that for two key reasons: (1) the price has come down to about $20 for the whole package (about $7 per disc together); and (2) all three movies are must-haves as they are classics.Conclusion: You can still get the great benefits of the movies from this trilogy set, but you won't get the special features that you expect."	3.0	The Trilogy Leaves Something Out	2006-11-27	6	4	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A114L7ZSZ5OLZW	Kev	"Great Scott! Step aside Yoda. Move over Captain Kirk. The greatest sci-fi saga is finally available on DVD. The trilogy is long overdue in the new format, but definitely worth the wait. A bonus to the long hiatus will be the extras that have become standard on all new releases.The plot for the trilogy seems complicated at face value as teenage Marty (Fox) and his unlikely best friend Doc Brown (Lloyd) travel back and forth through time altering the past, present, or future at every pitstop. However, when you watch the films, the story is not complicated at all. The script is tightly woven, the characters are memorable, and the chemistry between the major players (Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, Steenburgen, Glover,  and Wilson) is unrivaled.The simple moral of the story is ""Life is what you make of it.""Going against the grain, I have to admit that the second feature was my favorite of the three. This is primarily due to portions where Marty battles his way through scenes in the first film without being seen by his other self or his parents.....similar camera tricks were seen a few years later in Zemekis's other great film ""Forrest Gump"". I was also amazed at the gratuitous and shameless product placement in the second film, which even made ""Seinfeld"" seem subtle.One thing I've got my fingers crossed for on the extras would be the scenes with the original Marty as played by Erick Stoltz. Allegedly, three weeks of filming occurred before he was switched out with Micheal J. Fox."	5.0	This is heavy!	2002-07-06	66	55	11
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AFXABULS6JAJC	"Kevin Kung ""this is my personalized signature"""	"Back to the Future (1985)Starring: Michael J. Fox, Chris Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. WilsonDirector: Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump 1994, Romancing the Stone 1981)Running Time: 1 hour 51 minutesRelease Date: July 3, 1985 NationwideLanguage: EnglishGenre:  Adventure, Romance, FantasyRating:  9.5/10Who doesn't dream of being the teen icon Marty McFly, (Michael J. Fox) back in the 1980's?  Marty had the talent to conspicuously clasp on to the back of cars to catch a ride to school, play as the guitarist in a band, and have the `perfect' girlfriend every guy at school only fantasized about being with.  He also happened to have a close friend, Dr. Emit Brown, who invented a DeLorean-turned time machine.  He had first hand experience of an invention that allowed mankind to skip in and out of time realms- bringing harmony, causing chaos, and changing the past and the future.The plot was particularly captivating when Marty traveled through time from 1985 back to 1955 accidentally, and ran the risk of being stuck in the past, nightmare amongst many, but never a reality.  Humor came naturally throughout the storyline especially when he saw his parents as teenagers and ensuring that their romance was not interrupted so they can marry and therefore have children, including Marty's existence.  Along the way to accomplish his mission, actions and adventure were abundant as Marty faced obstacles of extreme measures such as collecting energy from a bolt of lightning for him and the DeLorean to get back home, which made time critical tasks within narrow margins of error.Hollywood is criticized for their lack of originality, often overusing the same themes.  Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg's former assistant, shows his talent with a completely original theme and great screen from his 5th movie production.  Prior to Back to the Future, Zemeckis works included 1980's Used Cars, 1978's I Wanna Hold Your Hand , and 1973's A Field of Honor.  While Zemeckis' past few films were comedy based, he was quite a newcomer to adventure type movies.  Somehow, talent compensated for his lack of experience.  The movie Back to the Future has many plots and conflicts that appear, these kind of adventure movies can be tricky because the director must be able to tie in all of the conflicts together for the viewer to understand.  Zemeckis did a great job of making the film plot clear, and cleverly restating the conflicts and situations for the viewers to understand clearly.Back to the Future was Michael J. Fox's 3rd movie while acting and spending most of his early acting career on comedy TV series, such as Family Ties Vacation and Letters from Frank.  Again, he was also a newcomer to adventure movies because of his previous experience only on comedy television shows.  While this film was quite a challenge for Fox, he played flawlessly!  Marty kept to his personality throughout the film as he used tricky physical moves against Big Biff or to get himself back to the future in the DeLorean.  Back to the Future was one of his first ""big"" and ""original"" movies he has ever acted in.Back to the Future is suitable to the interests of all sex and ages.  The movie covers all sorts of entertainment from romance, to adventure, and even has its fair share of laugh out loud from drama to comedy.One theme particularly liked about this movie was the contrast in personalities between father and son, not uncommon in the world today.  It opened up a subject of debate, as to whether a person's in-born personality or the family's influence should play a bigger role in one's brought-up.  If Marty were not brought up to be a more aggressive goal-getter, would he be able to change the destiny of his family?  In contrast, if Marty were brought up in an environment where his father answered to Biff the bully as a slave, would he be able to grow up as an achiever taking on the various challenges during his time travels?The only areas preventing this movie from getting a perfect 10 rating are the following unanswered questions that left the audience somewhat dissatisfied. When the Mom and Dad kissed in 1955, how could a simple kiss ensure that they would indeed get married in the future?  If destiny was so, and Marty messed with destiny, shouldn't his fate also be altered, regardless of his attempt to restore order in his life?  Taking into account the creativity and complexity of the storyline and in any movie this intense, there will be ""what if"" questions that leave you pondering long after you leave the theater.  I would say the little imperfection may only add to the experience.  The last scene is thought provoking, with the reassurance of a sequel.  The film is definitely a must see, as to miss out on such a unique storyline would only meant depriving yourself of an almost perfect movie experience."	4.0	Back to the Future	2005-01-02	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AWC9TL7QGKEFS	killermike2178	"I had the first pressing Blu-ray release of the Back to the Future Trilogy, with the digital copies and that horrible packaging, with lifting up the discs from a weird angle. Well, all of those discs got scratched, which resulted in disc-skipping, and I think the packaging was the culprit. So, I double-dipped to get this set, sans the digital copies (which I never used) and new, simpler packaging, with the standard pegs in the middle that you just push down like with every other DVD/Blu-ray, as opposed to those awful wings. Just push down on the peg and pick up the discs and you're good to go! This should have been the first pressing, with the digital copies being available for download, kind of like the Jurassic Park Trilogy set, instead taking up 3 extra discs and more shelf space, which, by the way, I also love the slimmer packaging, it's about 2/3 the thickness of the first pressing case, so it fits much nicer into the collection on my shelf.Since I didn't review the first set, I'll just give my take on this set, since they're pretty much the same, obviously except for the digital copies and case.Buy this set through the Amazon third party listings, as I got mine for under $27, after shipping costs.Movie: Back the the Future: My all time favorite movie. It's classic and quotable. If you say anything nasty about this movie, then we can never be friends, 6/5. Back to the Future Part II: Big letdown, lazy screenwriting, it just recycles a good chunk of the first movie. My least favorite in the trilogy, 2.5/5. Back to the Future Part III: Not quite as good as the first movie, but leaps and bounds better than the second. Nice to see Doc Brown grow as a character, finally really pushing forward the main character status, as opposed to the sidekick-like status, just there to feed lines off of Marty, 4.5/5. Overall trilogy rating, 4.5/5.Video: There is little to no DNR used here, or if it was used, then it was used very conservatively, because details remain intact, including some you might never have noticed on previous home video releases. Very sharp, but the only reason I'm taking half a point off is because of aliasing. For example, look at Marty's jacket during the school dance scene towards the end of the first movie, it's there. Kind of distracting. But still, very good looking picture. 4.5/5.Audio: Crisp and clean. Dialogue is 100% audible and intelligible. The music (songs and score alike) is loud and dominates the sound stage. Nice use of 5.1 surround sound, even though these were originally stereo mixes, which is obvious, since they're so front heavy, though it would have been nice to include the original stereo mixes for comparison's and purists' (come on, don't be bashful) sake. However, it never feels truly immersive, like the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or Pixar movies, but more of a faux-surround mix (Pro Logic II, anybody?), as in artificially created from the original stereo mixes, not natively 5.1. So, again, I must dock half a point. But still, very good sound. 4.5/5.Extras: Nice to see all of the same special features ported over from the 2002 DVD, and the ride, along with new documentaries, if you want to learn what went into making all of these movies. No more digital copies, but for me, that's a plus. 4.5/5.Overall: I would like to give Universal a 5/5 for this second pressing, since the packaging is simpler and hassle-free. But as I said in the first paragraph, this should have been the first pressing, because you know the old saying, ""Do it right the first time"", and I must dock half a point out of principle for those of us who wanted this type of frustration-free packaging the first time around. But if you didn't buy the first pressing, and are a huge BTTF fan, get this set, you won't regret it. 4.5/5.Note: this review was written by me on Blu-ray.com, but since I cannot give this 4.5 stars on Amazon, I'll just round it up to a 5 out of 5."	5.0	This boxset blows the old one out of the water, in terms of the packaging	2011-10-29	10	8	2

Great special effects that go beyond most of the science fiction movies.1985, the 80s sure was the time when sci-fi films went through the roof!Basic Plot of I:Marty (Michael J. Fox) a young teenager in the 80s, went back in time in 1955 to escape from some gangsters who want to claim back the plutonium Doc took away for his time travelling. Little does Marty know that if he made the tiniest mistake in the meeting of his parents, he would never be born and so he has to make them meet eventually so that he won't disappear from eternity.Basic Plot of II:There is trouble with Marty's future kids and so time travel goes back to his life. Doc brings him to 2015 to disguise as his son and switch the incident of his son going to jail into the gangsters going to jail. A small book, almanac, drives the path to more dangers. When ""older"" Biff got hold of it, he took the chance to go back to 1955 to kill Marty's father. Not knowing the consequences, Marty goes back to 1985 only to find that his father was killed by Biff who is now the present husband of his mother. He then has to go back to 1955 to keep his father from dying but he has to be careful from bumping into himself, the one who travelled in I.Basic Plot of III:Marty is trapped in 1955 and has to get back to 1985. Doc sent him a time travelling letter saying that he went back to 1885 to live his life happily. Marty, ready to go back to 1985, finds a gravestone with Doc's name in it. He died in 1885 because of a tiny loan. Marty has to go back in time to save Doc from dying. When back in 1885, Doc finds true love in a woman who's supposed to die in a cliff fall. It's even more difficult for Marty to save him.You'll know the ending. Will Doc really die? What will happen to the time machine, will it get destroyed?Robert Zemeckis is one great director and really captures the audiences interests.

If you are going to buy the Back to the Future DVD at a store near you instead, BE AWARE!!!!Do ***NOT*** buy the one with the plastic wrapper with a sticker: 'First Time On DVD' - Universal made a huge mistake on the widescreen framing for Disc 2 and 3 on the first DVD Trilogy release, so you get cheated a lot more image compared to the original footage. And yet, these flawed copies are still on the market! An average customer would probably not notice or care, but if you are a true collector or a fan of this movie (who isn't?!) then what good is it to own a DVD with an error?But this has all been corrected on the NEW VERSION... now, how can you tell if it is the new version or not? Well...The DVD cover is exactly the same as the flawed first release; therefore... MAKE SURE you buy the one with an orange sticker on the plastic wrapper that says 'ALL 3 MOVIES - LOWEST PRICE EVER - OWN IT BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT' and made by Mexico; this version is the corrected version!If you want to make sure even further:At the bottom of Disc 2, it should have a 'V2' after All Rights Reserved.For Disc 3, it does ***NOT*** say V2 on the disc. However, if you insert the disc on your DVD drive (on the computer), and then check 'Date Modified', it should be the year 2003! (This goes for Disc 2 as well)There was never a problem with Disc 1 so it's fine being 2002 for 'Date Modified'.Whew... now we can all enjoy this classic movie like it should've been!Personally, Back to the Future 1 & 2 are my favorites; the future world is fun and exciting to look at (Although let's face it, we're not going to be driving flying cars in the year 2010! Only 5 years away...) As for the 3rd one... well, I'm not much into Western setting movies... but still a decent trilogy ending.This is a movie which ALL movie collectors MUST own.	5.0	Make sure you get the CORRECT version!!!	2005-08-16	15	13	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1M7N5V6W0Z0H7	"K. Kainula ""kevinkainula"""	"Filmmaker Robert Zemeckis topped his breakaway hit Romancing the Stone with Back to the Future, a joyous comedy with a dazzling hook: what would it be like to meet your parents in their youth? Billed as a special-effects comedy, the imaginative film (the top box-office smash of 1985) has staying power because of the heart behind Zemeckis and Bob Gale's script. High schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, during the height of his TV success) is catapulted back to the '50s where he sees his parents in their teens, and accidentally changes the history of how Mom and Dad met. Filled with the humorous ideology of the '50s, filtered through the knowledge of the '80s (actor Ronald Reagan is president, ha!), the film comes off as a Twilight Zone episode written by Preston Sturges. Filled with memorable effects and two wonderfully off-key, perfectly cast performances: Christopher Lloyd as the crazy scientist who builds the time machine (a DeLorean luxury car) and Crispin Glover as Marty's geeky dad.Critics and audiences didn't seem too happy with Back to the Future, Part II, the inventive, perhaps too clever sequel. Director Zemeckis and cast bent over backwards to add layers of time-travel complication, and while it surely exercises the brain it isn't necessarily funny in the same way that its predecessor was. It's well worth a visit, though, just to appreciate the imagination that went into it, particularly in a finale that has Marty watching his own actions from the first film.Shot back-to-back with the second chapter in the trilogy, Back to the Future, Part III is less hectic than that film and has the same sweet spirit of the first, albeit in a whole new setting. This time, Marty ends up in the Old West of 1885, trying to prevent the death of mad scientist Christopher Lloyd at the hands of gunman Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson, who had a recurring role as the bully Biff). Director Zemeckis successfully blends exciting special effects with the traditions of a Western and comes up with something original and fun.This is a great christmas gift or just a treat to buy yourself.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AAWM8VUNSWP2C	"K. Novak ""novakaine"""	The movies themselves look fantastic on blu-ray and if you're a fan of the trilogy it's well worth it to upgrade from DVD.  However, if you have the patience, I'd recommend waiting to see if Universal releases the trilogy in a new case.  As others have mentioned, the packaging really is among the worst out there.  Why, after over a decade of perfectly suitable varities, would Universal decide on this one?  I've never seen or used a case as absurd as this one.  I don't mean to whine but any case that has to include instructions on how to insert and remove the discs clearly needs a redesign.  Hopefully Universal will phase out this design or do a recall (it would also be nice if they would replace the cases for those who have bought it already).	3.0	Great Blu-Ray transfer, horrible packaging	2010-11-30	4	2	2

The BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy is up there with the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES films, the ones that HAVE to get on DVD soon! Well, this impressive 3 Disc presentation will hold off my Indy cravings for a while, 'cos this is everything I had hoped for and then some!Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the original BACK TO THE FUTURE is the best of the three, and it's also my favorite movie of all time. Everything about it is good; the time-traveling duo of Marty McFly and Doc is fantastic, Zemeckis' and writer Bob Gale's superb story provides some great humor, Alan Silversti's memorable score is one of my favorites and of course, the Time Machine itself, the DeLorean, one of the coolest cars seen on film since 007's Aston Martin.The premise for the film consists of Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in crazy mode) inventing a time machine out of a DeLorean, and through a series of events, Marty (Michael J. Fox) gets zapped back in time, where he meets his parents and almost erases himself from existence! The supporting cast are great, including Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines and Thomas Wilson as Biff. The clever ideas just keep on coming as the film progresses, with every new idea making the journey even more fun. A true classic.BTTF Part 2 takes the mind-bending back-and-forth through time thing even further, but with less successful results. There are some really good moments though, with Doc and Marty trying to save Marty's son from Biff's son Griff, which much ensuing time-travelling. And the futuristic setting is original and interesting. Not as good as Part 1, but it's still good fun.BTTF Part 3 is a much more straight-forward entry in the BTTF trilogy, with Doc and Marty travelling to the Old West. The action is much more laid-back than the previous films, making this one a more cohesive adventure. Crazy humour and in-jokes aplenty, it re-captures much of the charm that was lacking in Part 2.The DVD extras are fantastic, with a great commentary from Michael J. Fox, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, Animated Anecdotes option to see over 150 facts and trivia notes while viewing, Outtakes, bloopers, deleted scenes, interviews, the original ""Making of Back to the Future"" featurette, interactive production archive and more. The digital transfer is one of the best i've seen, and the Dolby DTS Surround Sound is terrific. A must-have DVD.

How can you go wrong with all of this commentary providing additional information on the trilogy.Back to the Future is one of the greatest trilogies of all time.  It is high concept, high energy and high adventure.  It is also made worthwhile by the talents of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd.  As much as it deals with the concept of time travel, it also deals with adverse situations and coming from a point of having very little at the beginning of part I to having everything at the end of part III. It was extremely well written and well executed and it doesn't get much better than this.	5.0	The Shizzle	2003-07-11	3	1	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1UYUPHN7NOU8F	La Belle (The Beauty)	"Back to the Future is the first movie that I watched over and over again, like an obsession, as a child. I thought it was the coolest movie known to man. I don't know what it is about this trilogy that I love so much. Perhaps it's the whole DeLorean time machine that takes you back in time, or to the future, that really appealed to me. Or maybe it's Marty McFly's ""You don't scare me, I'm not afraid of anything"" attitude that intrigues me. It could also be the duo friendship between a carefree teenager and a mad scientist that made me enjoy it. I'm going to say it was all of the above. This trilogy reeked of awesomeness. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox made a good team for this trilogy. I enjoyed the friendship they shared because, while they may have been two different people who grew up in different generations, they still cared about the welfare of each other. Both of their characters were very likable.BTTF part 1: The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back thirty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.Part 2: Marty McFly (Michale J. Fox) has only just got back from the past, when he is once again picked up by Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and sent through time to the future. Marty's job in the future is to pose as his son to prevent him being thrown in prison. Unfortunately, things get worse when the future changes the present.Part 3: Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.I bought this trilogy a few years ago on the Walmart.com website and I'm very happy with the purchase. I'm glad that I didn't have to buy all three movies separately. It's been a while since I've watched them, since I'm pretty busy nowadays, but each time I watch them, It's always an enjoyable fantasy experience.I often wonder how Marty met Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown. I thought that maybe Doc was a friend of Marty's parents or something, and then from there, became good friends with Marty. That's how things worked with me and some of my older friends. Things don't always work out the same way for everyone though, so it's doubtful that that's what happened. I'm sure that anyone from any generation would enjoy this DVD set. It's also now available on Blu-Ray for those who have a Blu-Ray player."	5.0	One hell of a ride!	2014-01-15	1	1	0

I was told Universal will replace the discs for customers early next year.(That was a bit disappointing)However, the real thing sadly lacking in this set, was the much hyped footage of Eric Stoltz as the original Marty McFly.Basically, the small snippet that was released to the press about a month ago, is all there is.I really think Universal duped the public on this one. I am not exactly sure why, with 5 weeks of footage, theycouldn't release a lot more. It would have been fantastic to have a scene-by-scene comparison between Stoltz and Fox.This was a huge selling point for a lot of people (myself included).I am guessing (hoping) this is coming out in a later version of the movie (How many versions am I going to have to buy!).Either that, or they didn't want to pay Eric Stoltz any money for using more than a certain amount of footage (?).I am rating this higher than I would normally only because the movies are so damn good, but beware.	3.0	Great Movies, Misleading Hype	2010-11-08	7	3	4

The first I want, because it stands alone just fine. Yet Universal in its wisdom (yes, that's sarcasm) has decided we must have the boxed set and only the boxed set?I was insulted enough by that alone, but to discover from other reviews that the two discs I don't want are flawed adds injury to the insult. Let me get this straight: I'm expected to shell out an extra [amount]for two movies I don't necessarily want just to get the one I want more, and for my trouble I'll get lousy copies of those movies?Universal, we deserve better. It was boneheaded not to release the movies as standalones as well as in the boxed set. Even if standalones are coming down the road, those who enjoyed the first movie more (I'm hardly alone in my opinion) deserved the chance to own it separately if they wished.	3.0	No package deals--give me the original!	2002-12-24	6	3	3

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2LJKDPRVR907S	Lisa Siegel	I have always loved the Back to the Future trilogy; I remember I first got it on VHS, then I bought the trilogy on DVD.  I thought that was great since it had a ton extras and the pictures was really good.  I just purchased the Blu-ray version of the trilogy and WOW!  I didn't think the picture could get any better!  They have done a great job restoring my favorite movie trilogy.  And the extras on the discs are great.  I love seeing interviews with the producers, director and cast members including Michael J. Fox.If you're fan of the trilogy, buy this!  You won't regret it!	5.0	Incredible Picture!	2011-01-08	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A6F97U4CSFDAP	litemakr	The new HD transfer of the first film is VERY well done. I have seen the movie many times over the years and I saw details I had never noticed before. The picture is razor sharp, colors are vibrant and they did not go overboard with digital noise reduction.  It looks like it was filmed this year. The sound quality is also excellent. Parts 2 and 3 are not quite as stunning, but still very good.Just about all of the extras from previous DVD releases are carried over, some newly mastered in HD. There is a new series of nicely done documentaries for all 3 films, also in HD. Overall there are hours of quality extras for each film, both vintage and newly created. My only complaint is that I would like to have seen more footage of Eric Stoltz as Marty. They filmed with him for 5 weeks, it would have been nice to see more than the 30 seconds that are on the disc.I have to add my voice to the complaints about the packaging. It is very frustrating and non-intuitive. It took me several minutes to extract each disc until I finally figured out how to remove them correctly. Universal should have included instructions, because it is not obvious. I think they are going to end up with a lot of complaints and returns due to broken packaging and scratched discs. Don't they have a QA department that tests these things??Overall I highly recommend the set because of the beautifully redone HD transfers and wealth of extras. Just read up on how to remove the discs and save yourself some frustration.	4.0	Blu ray picture and sound are GREAT! Packaging is awful	2010-10-27	6	5	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A27KME3COWJM6A	Lmm	Positive things first...The picture on these disks is phenomenal. Universal did an amazing job moving this to HD video. The sound is also great in 5.1 HD. We watched all three of the movies tonight because it made us feel like kids again. The Delete Scenes on the disk are also fun to watch. They actually add a ton of context to the movie. (e.g. why George was late to school, What was supposed to happen, etc...) The digital copies are also working fine on OSX and Windows 7 so far. I have yet to try them out on my Zune HD or IPod Touch.Negatives: The packaging they used is horrible. The disks just fall out of the sleeve when you open the book. Why could they have used the ultra-slim cases that held 6 DVD? Cheap packing to say the least! (very disappointing!) This does not warrant less stars though, because everything else is amazing.	5.0	Back to the Future - Blu-Ray - Bad Packaging	2010-10-27	5	4	1

This collection is for die-hard fans of Back to the Future. Hard to believe the 80's now look so dated in retrospect. This is a classic tale and the movie that made Michael J. Fox a big screen star.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2WINSFAB24YRP	LordoftheFilms	I'm currently watching two versions of Back to the Future Part III...one is an extremely old video version, and one is the widescreen DVD release.  Not only is the picture ten times brighter on DVD, but it's obvious that the filmmakers at Universal didn't really screw-up that royally when creating the widescreen editions.  The video release has extra picture area on the top and bottom of the screen, but if you compared the films back to back, you'd see that you're actually missing footage on the sides of the frame, as opposed to complaining how the framing is incorrect.First off, the films were shot in a soft widescreen format, not particularly wide, but just wide enough to be projected in theaters.  The standard aspect ratio for most films is 1.85:1, and BTTF was shot at about 1.77:1.  But for those who have actually shot a film in 35mm before, you would understand that there are two ways you can opt to shoot a film.  One is full-frame, for when you're aiming for a television or video-release.  You can also opt to aim for the widescreen framing, in which case you'll have to crop out the top and bottom of the image for theatrical release, to take away from distractions.  Either way you look at it, there will always be picture area behind those black bars, it just depends on how the filmmakers chose to crop the picture.  A lot of times, a DVD release will be cropped differently from how it was shown in a theater, to correct any picture errors, such as mics popping into frame, or to enhance wide shots.  Trust me, I went to film school, I'm an aspiring Detroit filmmaker (notice, I said aspiring), and the widescreen DVD release of all three films are how Robert Zemeckis intended his viewers to watch the films.  Even if there is two to four minutes of footage that was incorrectly cropped, why would you want to give up your DVDs and wait weeks before you see them again?On video, there IS extra picture area on the top and bottom of the screen.  However, this is footage that detracts from the filmmaker's vision.  The widescreen edition captures only what Zemeckis intended you to see, and as a purist, is the only edition worthy of my library.Oh, and by the way, after twelve years, all three movies are just as great as they ever were, and the extra features are commendable.	5.0	Breathtaking...a definite thrill of nostalgia to BTTF fans!	2003-02-13	13	11	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AWZFZI6GWSMZ5	Loves Home Decorator	I first saw this movie in the theatre back in 1985 when I was just a teenager and I absolutely loved it.  Here we are in 2008 and I can honestly say, that my opinion still has not changed.  This is one of the very few movies that I can catch on TV at any time and will never pass on the chance to watch it.  After countless viewings, I never cease to be entertained by it.Marty McFly accidentally travels through time and has an opportunity to meet his parents as they were in high school upon their first meeting.  During his time in the past, he also influences the future, which is one of the more entertaining aspects of the movie.  It's hillariously funny, but also makes you think about how every action, effect the next.This movie appeals to people of most any age, male or female audiences.  It's got it all, action, romance, humor.  I think it's a MUCH watch movie.  It's one my personal favorites and has remained so for over the past 2 decades.....	5.0	Opinion of this movie never changes - FABULOUS	2008-09-10	0	0	0

There were things that my husband and I noticed for the first time while watching these DVDs that we had totally missed in all of our many previous viewings of these movies! The way Doc and Marty almost switch roles in the third movie slipped past me when I was younger, but is a lot of fun (and very life-like) once I did recongize the change. The production notes and the &#34;who was originally cast for the role&#34; information was very interesting, too.  I highly recommend this trilogy.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY	MacheteJason	"Back to the Future is about a teen who travels back through time to meet his parents and change the future. While I would rate the films 5 stars and the bonus content gets 4 stars. There is over 10 hours of special features. This Back to the Future set contains all three films. The extras are great with commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, mini-documentaries and trailers but there could have been a little more to make this truly comprehensive. BTTF has so much in the vault. Many of the special features are audio-only or text-based and the documentaries involve only Bob Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Michael J. Fox. I would love to see the workprint of the original with Eric Stoltz. They filmed almost the entire movie with Stoltz before he got replaced by Michael J. Fox. I imagine they don't want to pay him for the rights now but I bet BTTF fans would love it. We see only a few silent clips of Stoltz in this release. Also, new interviews with Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Claudia Wells, Marc McClure, Elisabeth Shue, Eric Stoltz and others would have made it even better. We do get the vintage 21 minute 'Secrets of the BTTF Trilogy' documentary with Kirk Cameron that used to be on its own VHS tape in a 4-pack back in the day.Buy this collection. This is the best release available for Back to the Future (making the DVD collection obsolete). My only complaints are that the ""25th Anniversary Blu-Ray Trilogy"" release adds little except remastering from the DVD collection (a bonus disc could easily be filled).

Between you, you've had three children, your youngest is Marty . . . .If you are Marty McFly you are a high school student.  You fantasize about being a rock star.  You get around on a skate board, but dream about one day owning a 4 x 4 truck.  Unlike your father, you stand up to bullies.  You are smitten with Jennifer Parker and your best friend is Doc Emmett Brown . . . .If you are Emmett you are a scientist who draws his inventive inspiration from Thomas Edison.  While many in Hill Valley may call you a nutcase - and it is true, that you have tinkered about, building many contraptions of dubious value - but now, at last, you've invented something of significance: a time machine . . . .You got the idea 30 years ago for an electronic device that has the capacity to join the present to either an instant in the future or the past.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A51A4CE7Q2SHN	Mark Androvich	"I'm wondering whether or not this set will include the ""Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy"" featurette that I found on VHS a few years ago (hosted by Kurt Cameron). It would also be interesting to see footage with Eric Stolz as the original Marty McFly before the role was recast, and deleted 1950's classroom scenes that were pictured in the book on the making of the film. And how about a Huey Lewis & The News video of ""The Power of Love""? Or how about an option to view the films chronologically--starting with 1885, then 1955, 1985, and finally 2015. (Wouldn't that be confusing?) Heck, with today's digital technology, the producers could even insert Elizabeth Shoe into the first film as Marty's girlfriend!A major logic flaw in Part 2 continues to bug me to this day, however. When Old Biff steals the DeLorean from 2015 and travels to the past, Doc and Marty should have been stuck in the future forever! Consider: Old Biff travels to 1955 to give his younger self the almanac. This action creates an alternate timeline where Biff becomes rich and famous. However, this means that the future we saw earlier in the film (where Doc and Marty are visiting) should no longer exist! If Old Biff tried to return to 2015, it would be to an alternate future which logically follows Biff's rise to power. Therefore, Old Biff could not have returned the time machine to Doc and Marty. Once he left 2015 with the DeLorean, he altered the past and created a new future. Doc and Marty we know should have been stranded in a different timeline. Not a good ending, is it?Yeah, I know, it is just a movie, and I'm going to enjoy the films on DVD anyway, but it would have been better if the writers thought more carefully about the plot of Part 2. Maybe that's why it is the least popular of the three films..."	4.0	Should Be Great! The Wait Is Almost Over...	2002-08-03	0	0	0

There are contributions from almost all of the cast, Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steven Spielberg etc - and great on-set footage too. It's also been pitched at a reasonable price. In short, this is properly good value for money for 3 hugely entertaining films that don't seem to have dated at all.I can only add to the chorus of approval for this - a fantastic presentation.Onwards and upwards to the ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" Trilogies and the remaining Bond films - which were all Lowry Digital Restorations and look as awesome as this..."	5.0	One Of The Best Transfers I've Ever Seen To Blu Ray...And With Properly Great Extras...	2010-12-30	3	3	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1DZKOOMMJM1MI	"Mark Twain ""Sam"""	Anyone who's not a fan of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy should be locked up for some sort of treason to the world of entertainment. Though the first movie is the only one which can be said to stand alone as a whole story, it's when the three of them are put together as one complete adventure that things really get good. In fact, everyone should make a point of watching all three 'Back to the Future' movies in a back-to-back marathon at least once in their lives. Allow the occasional toilet break, of course, but no more than that.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd stars as the troublesome teen and madcap scientist who do their time-travelling in style, courtesy of a revamped DeLorean. Their adventures over the course of the three incredible movies take them from 1985, to 1955, back to 1985, on to 2015, 1985 again(!), 1955 again(!!) and the wild wild west of 1885 (!!!) before returning home to 1985 in time for tea and a couple of Huey Lewis tracks. It features quite possibly the only sequel ever in which a large chunk takes place within its own predecessor, and definitely the only trilogy to feature Christopher Lloyd leaping around the outside of a moving train rescuing a damsel in distress. Lea Thompson, the brilliant character actor Crispin Glover, Elisabeth Shue, Billy Zane and the marvelous Thomas F. Wilson are among the other members of a fine supporting cast. And is that really Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers popping up as squeaking bad boy Douglas J. Needles? Yup, that's right , something for everyone!Go out, buy this collection, watch it repeatedly and, when you're not watching, keep the three discs in a glass display case which only very special friends are invited round to see.

The second one had one of the most longest and confusing time-travel plot ever conceived by mankind! I cannot stand two of the deleted scenes (I will not name them because of spoilers)! The discs have a ""huge"" amount of bonus features ever in a DVD! They have the answers to some of the most asked questions from all the BTTF flicks including if hoverboards ever ""truly"" existed in mankind's history. Michael J. Fox actually was able to do a few trailers with Muhammed Ali about Parkinson's Disease. Amazangly, is also able to do an enhanced conversation with him about his work in the movie, even with his disaese happening to him.

Although he's supposed to be the main character alongside the scientist, he influences the other characters as well & doesn't have direct influence on the plot. in the first one, his parents are the main characters & the third, the scientist gets the main character role. Going on to the plot of the 3 films, the first is the standard ""fix what you created"", the second took on a darker tone & the third is basically the first film all over again.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1UF0ZFC9VF5XU	matt	Back to the Future is one of the best trilogies ever, and probably the most well thought out trilogy ever.Back to the Future: Teen Marty McFly (Fox) accidentally gets shot back to the year 1955.  There he runs into his parents in their teen years and gets in the way of how they meet and fall in love.  Now Marty must make his mom and dad fall in love, within the time course of a week because he only has one chance to get back to the future.Back to the Future Part II: I think this one has the best story of the three.  Marty and Doc go to the year 2015 to stop Marty's kid, Marty McFly Jr. from being arrested and destroying his family.  They are succesful, but the future Biff steals the time machine without them knowing and gives his past self a certain sports almanac.  All he has to do is bet on the winner in the book, and he'll never lose.  Old Biff returns the time machine and Marty and Doc go back to 1985.  When things go drastically wrong (Biff is married to Marty's mother and is a billionaire, George McFly is murdered) they figure out soon what happened.  Marty and Doc must travel back to 1955 when young Biff was given the almanac and destroy it.Back to the Future Part III: Doc is accidentally shot back to 1885 leaving Marty back in 1955.  Marty goes to the Doc (of 1955), and suddenly learns that he is murdered in the old west.  Marty goes back to 1885 to rescue the Doc and get both of them back to 1985.	5.0	exciting, funny, suspensful and awesome!	2005-02-01	7	2	5
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1VCPMT1RRS7K0	Matt	"I'd forgotten how entertaining these movies are after not having seen them in a years.  Back to the Future was an incredibly successful trilogy of films running from the mid-80s into the early 90s.  The casting was amazingly solid and truly made the films stand out, along with special effects that were cutting-edge for the time.Christopher Lloyd is simply outstanding as the the nutty scientist, Crispin Glover perfectly portrays Marty's nerdy father and Lea Thompson is an interestingly provocative character as Marty's mother.  Michael J. Fox was a huge TV star when Part I was released - yet his fame made quite a quantam leap due to Part I and the subsequent movie franchise.The creativity that went into production is apparent in all three of the films.  They're each entertaining in their own ways.  Part I is definitely the most popular of the three.  Part II received mixed reviews and Part III was more like the first, but not quite as well received.  They're all worth seeing and they're all great movies.There is some debate over the formatting of the DVD versions of the film.  I don't see how it makes all that much difference, to be honest.  I watched all three films and enjoyed them, regardless of whether or not an inch of digital information was missing from the top or bottom of the screen.  The movies are wonderful, the bonus footage is extensive- loaded with ""making of"" footage, many deleted scenes, outtakes, etc, etc...If you enjoyed any of the three films, it is worth purchasing the Complete Trilogy, as the price is less than most single-feature DVDs on the market right now.  Great movies that make for great entertainment.  Highly recommended DVD set."	4.0	1.21 Gigawatts of Movie Entertainment	2006-03-08	12	9	3
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A285IWNUBV2C2I	Matthew Brundage	"Back to the Future is my all-time favorite movie. What follows is my analysis of the time-travel themes used in Part I.In BTTF I, when Marty comes back to 1985, he should not have seen his old, original self in the Twin Pines parking lot being pursued by the terrorists because1). His actions in 1955 had significantly altered events and2). He was now in a new, alternate universe.However, when returning to 1985, he should have come across his new, alternate self upon arriving at home. We know this because in the original universe, Marty's family is awkward and miserable, while in the new, alternate universe, Marty's family is cool and confident. The only people who don't seem to be affected by the new alternate universe are Marty and Emmett Brown. Biff, Marty's brother, sister and parents undergo personality changes because of Marty's actions while in 1955, but one glaring question remains: where is the new, alternate Marty? The old, original Marty is now living with his new, alternate family, sans the new, alternate Marty.Brown had known all along that he would be shot by terrorists and was wearing a bullet-proof vest in both Twin Pines scenes. In fact, the Twin Pines scene is a paradox because it happened only once, but takes place in both the original universe and the new, alternate universe. Brown's prior knowledge of the event coupled with his exact replication of the Twin Pines scene seems curious to say the least. If Brown had known of the terrorist plot, he could have staged the demonstration for a day earlier, or gone into hiding, to avoid risking his time machine to terrorist damage. Additionally, his surprise at seeing the terrorists in the first Twin Pines scene was not surprise at all, for he knew in advance they were coming. This leads one to wonder why a grown man would knowingly bring himself into a situation where he would be shot and subject this attempted murder to the eyes of a minor person. His not revealing any of this to Marty prior to the Twin Pines scene probably stemmed from his notion that telling people about the future could have ""severe consequences"" on events. ""A man should not know too much about his own destiny."" Ha. This coming from a man who knew 30 years in advance how, when, where and why he would be shot.Contrary to the themes exhibited in Back to the Future I, time travel does not predicate dual universes. This leads one to think: which 1955 is the true 1955 -- The one without the time traveler or the one *with* the time traveler? Since they happened at the same time and at the same place, how is this possible? If time can be considered a straight line, only one instance of 1955 took place, and it included the time traveler. The old, original universe (with Marty's family growing up awkward and miserable) never even existed because of Marty's intervention. I'm going to argue myself into a hole if I continue doing this, so I'll stop. But I think the answer can be found if one applies Einstein's relativity theory. Or something like that."	5.0	Analysis of Marty and time travel	2003-06-27	3	1	2
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AN7JDZOXH1WC4	"Matthew Easterbrook ""silverscreenjunkie"""	"This is a great DVD set of one of the top five trilogies of all time.  The first movie follows Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) as he travels back in time, from 1985 to 1955 and back again to save Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) from a tragedy in the future; while there, he has to get his mom (Lea Thompson), who has fallen for him, back together with his father (Crispin Glover).  The second movie has Marty and Doc heading thirty years into the future, then back into an alternate 1985, returning to 1955, and finally back to reality, all due to a disruption in the time-space continuum.  The final chapter has Marty venturing solo to 1885, to save Doc Brown from Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), Biff's ancestor.  Doc also gets the girl in this one, played by Mary Steenburgen.Many people consider the Western chapter inferior to the other two, but I'd have to say that while not quite as entertaining as the original, it's definitely better than Part II, which is definitely intriguing, but just a bit too dark for my liking.  My favorite scenes in the trilogy:  the whole high school dance section in the first film, and the train race from the third.  Michael J Fox plays multiple characters in the two sequels, as does Thomas F Wilson, who always seems undervalued when people mention the series; personally, I think one of the reasons it works so well is because Fox is so loveable and Wilson is just so good at being unlikeable -- much unlike his real personality, if you watch the supplements.Oh yeah ... the extras.  There are quite a few here, which will probably take you the better part of a week to get through.  On each disc of this three-disc set there are two making-of featurettes, one contemporary and one restrospective; some pop-up video trivia anecdotes; a feature commentary by producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton; and a chat session hosted by DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau featuring Gale and director Bob Zemeckis (beware, though -- the first movie's Bouzereau-Gale-Zemeckis session goes through the whole film, but the second lasts only about 80 minutes and the third goes only about 45 minutes into the film before they stop).The first film also has a gag reel, deleted scenes, make-up tests, production archives, screenplay excerpts, the trailer, and a video commentary by Michael J Fox (which only lasts about 35 minutes).  The second film has a gag reel, deleted scenes, a featurette on the visual effects and the hoverboard scene, production archives, ""The Power Of Love"" music video by Huey Lewis and the News, and the ever-present trailer.  The final installment includes featurettes about designing the frontier town and marketing the trilogy, a gag reel, a deleted scene, production archives, a TV special on Part III hosted by Kirk Cameron, the ZZ Top video for ""Doubleback,"" the ubiquitous trailer, and finally, a Frequently Asked Questions list.Films:  Part I - 5; Part II - 4; Part III - 5Extras:  Entire set:  5"	5.0	Great Scott!!!

And these are my favorite movies, which makes it all the more upsetting. I also like to spread the love and encourage people to own the trilogy, but I can't recommend this release in good conscience.The end credits for Part I are not right on the Blu-ray or the 2010 special edition DVDs. Most obviously, they're presented at 75% their proper width, but if you look closely, you'll see that they're tilted somewhat, and off to the left. Universal's home video department refuses to acknowledge even that this is a problem, let alone correct it and issue replacements (you'd think they'd be used to it by now!).

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3JZ5L52FM318H	"Matthew T. Weflen ""Matthew Weflen"""	"The films:Definitely one of the most fun film series of the 1980s and early 90s, BTTF really shines. The writing is quite clever when compared to other big-budget tentpole flicks. The ties between the three movies are a lot of fun to notice. Although part 1 is definitely the best of the three, parts 2 and 3 do not drop off too much in quality. Michael J. Fox delivers a good performance, definitely in keeping with the 1980s ""slacker antihero"" archetype. Christopher Lloyd is also quite good as Doc Brown.Part 2 is a lot of fun, naturally, because it gives us a future as envisioned in the late 1980s. But its second half, which returns to 1955, is perhaps even more clever than the first movie's portrayal, because of how it works to show the same scenes from different angles and points of view.Part 3 is tonally quite different than the first two, and a good portion of its emotional investment hinges on Doc Brown's romance with Clara, played by Mary Steenburgen. Their on-screen chemistry is not exactly incendiary, and thus their segments drag a bit.Serious sci-fi fanatics will find inconsistencies to nit-pick. I certainly noticed some. The portrayal of timeline changes and potential paradoxes are rather mind-boggling, and one gets the impression that the writers resolved to not try *too* hard to create a consistent methodology for the changes. The overall moral to the story is a bit cliche (don't succumb to peer pressure), whereas a deeper ethical investigation of time travel (seems pretty nasty to relegate Biff and his progeny to second-class citizen status merely in order to boost your own family's fortunes) might have been more interesting. But you'll be having so much fun a long the way, that deeper questions such as these tend only to occur a bit later.Any way you slice it, these movies are fun enough to keep the younger set intrigued, and smart enough to satisfy a more mature audience.The Blu-Ray:Let me get this out of the way - this packaging stinks. Definitely among the worst box set packaging I've seen. We get six discs packaged in a tri-fold cardboard digipak with no hubs - the discs are held in, on top of each other, by one of the most irritating pieces of plastic ever - you cannot lift these out, you must press and slide the discs in order to avoid bending them precariously against the hard plastic rim of the digipak. Unbelievably dumb. Add to that a totally superfluous cardboard case, which only repeats the box copy contained within, and doesn't even hold the innards secure when lifting. A complete and utter failure, on all counts. I wish companies wouldn't keep trying to reinvent the wheel with these sets. Just put some hubbed ""pages"" on a hinge, for crying out loud.Anyway, the 1080p, 1.85:1 film transfers are nice, especially when considering the era in which these movies were filmed. Compared to films of a similar vintage (such as Star Trek 2-4, Goodfellas, and Batman), these transfers show a good amount of detail and not a terrible amount of noise reduction and edge enhancement (see: Predator). If grain was aggressively reduced on these films, it is not noticeable. They are a definite upgrade over DVD-quality material. The video will not blow you away when compared to a newly-minted transfer of a 2009 or 2010 film. But let's compare apples to apples - these are really good transfers of 80s material. The DTS-HD sound also does a good job, with decent separation of channels, clear dialogue, and some decent bass.The extras are good, with commentaries, several new HD making-of and interview features, and plenty of legacy SD features from previous releases. I do wish we could have had Fox's retrospective interview condensed into one feature instead of split into a dozen snippets per disc. Also featured are the apparently obligatory (and utterly wasteful in my book) digital copies for those of you who wish to watch these movies on a 2-inch screen in the car. Yawn.Conclusion:Despite the overpoweringly dumb packaging, this set is a definite recommendation. It is a good set of family films (there is some mild swearing, but very little sex or violence) that will entertain both kids and adults. The a/v quality is more than acceptable for a high definition release of 1980s films. The extras are comprehensive and entertaining. The price point on Amazon is quite sound for a catalog release.In short, if you like these movies at all, this is a very good buy."	5.0	*Blu-Ray Review* Despite the Awful Packaging, the Movies and Extras Both Shine	2010-10-31	10	8	2
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2EV6SMGMW4UNZ	"Matt Kratz ""c&w and books lover"""	I remember the Back to the Future movies with incredible fondness, as just about anyone does. When it came out in this DVD collection, I jumped at ordering it. It did not disappoint. The movies start in 1985, then go to 1955,back to 1985,to 2015, to an alternate 1985 where Biff is corrupt and runs the town, back to 1955, to 1885, and finally back to 1985 to stay. (Confused yet?) It starts off with high school student Marty McFly meeting his mad scientist friend Doc (Emmett) Brown at a local mall. Doc Brown informs him that he has created a time machine out of a Delorean. He demonstrates by sending his dog Einstein one minute into the future. He then sets the time circuits to a November day in 1955 when he realized how time travel could be done. A bunch of Lybian terrorists whom he had ripped off to get plutonium for the machine then show up and shoot him dead. Marty drives off in the Delorean and winds up in 1955. While there, he jeopardizes his own existence by interfering with his parents' first meeting. He has one week to unite them after finding Doc, who helps him get Back to the Future with a bizarre plan. In part 2, they travel to the future to fix a problem with Marty's kids. While they are there, a 70-year-old-Biff (a bully from the first film who terrorized Marty's father) sneaks off in the Delorean and gives himself a sports almanac. When Marty and Doc return to 1985, they find it has turned into a living hell and must go back to 1955 to correct it. Part 3 finds them in the old west where Marty must save Doc from a grisly fate. The best part is that it was all one storyline.The DVDs feature deleted scenes, interviews, bloopers, and other cool stuff. Anyone might like this movie set. I loved it.	5.0	wonderful!	2006-06-01	4	2	2

Whats interesting to me is the future scene 2015, and how the screenwriters envisioned the future.  Now that we are in the year 2007, its interesting see some of these things exist now, like marty's shoes look alot like some of the sneakers of today, the women with the breast implants! some of the building and car designs are pretty close also.  The only thing they were really off on, was the flourescent in the clothes, the flourescent stuff was big IN the 80's how would that be the style 30 years later?Very Classic trilogy if you ask me!![...]	5.0	GREATEST MOVIE EVER!	2007-08-17	2	2	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	APOUYO1BEPK22	"M. B Cole ""Kegrun"""	"Before I get to the reviews of each movie, I just want to say I think everyone should watch the special features on these discs. I dont usually watch them cause I dont have all the time in the world to do that, but there were a lot of fun to watch. And the outtakes were really funny. Glad they had those to put on these discs.Back to the Future: Part 1-Great Scott!In 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) asks Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a high school teenager, to meet him at the local mall for a late night science experiment. When Marty shows up, he sees Doc backing a Delorean out from a van. But this just isn't any Delorean. This Delorean has been modified into a time machine. As Doc begins to explain how it all works, a group of terrorists that Doc stole some uranium from, show up and begin to wreak havoc. Marty jumps in the car and floors it after witnessing Doc getting shot. But as soon as Marty hits the magic number of 88mph, he is shot back in time to 1955. While trying to figure out how to get back to 1985, he screws up the first time his parents meet, which begins the slow cycle of his brother, his sister, and even himself to slowly fade away from existence. Marty must figure out a way to get the time machine to work again and also somehow get his popular mom to fall in love with is geeky father so he can get back to the future.Talk about a movie that just never gets old. Almost all the laughs are still funny. From the barn scene, to the first time Marty meets his mom as a teenager, to the skateboarding/poop scene. Back to the Future really is just a very fun movie. I think I was smiling almost through the whole thing and I've had to have seen this movie over 20 times by now. I think almost everyone has wished they could go back in time, but who really thinks about going back to hang with their parents. After seeing this movie, it might really be fun to do just that. We know Marty's mom preaches about how girls shouldn't chase guys and things, but when we see her at a younger age, she is doing exactly what she forbids her own children from doing. And when he comes across his dad, he finds out things that he never knew his dad was interested in. And then of course we have Doc Brown, who Christopher Lloyd played perfectly. His antics, and screams, facial expressions, and over the topness were done just right. What a great character. And Michael J. Fox also plays Marty McFly just right to. To think that Eric Stoltz almost played Marty McFly. Thankfully the director thought he just didn't fit the part and refilmed it with Fox.Honestly, I could go on and on and on about this movie and just tell the whole story. But what fun would that be. Just own this movie.P.S. - I love watching old 80's flicks and seeing all the stuff that was cool back then. Also I really like seeing old advertisements or signs. Like the Pepsi symbol back then. Classic stuff.-----------------------Back to the Future: Part 2-We gotta go back in time to save the future that we messed up when someone went back to the past and screwed it up. Yep.The day after Marty gets back from 1955, Doc leaves in the time machine to go the future to the year 2015, only to return seconds later (though much more time has passed for Doc). Something terrible happens in the future to Marty's son. Thankfully Marty and his son are the spitting image of each other so Doc has come up with a plan to have Marty take the place of his son for a few minutes to make a correct decision to prevent the bad incident from happening. But while they are in the future, the Biff we know from 1955 and 1985 overhears Marty and Doc talking about their time machine. So Biff decides to change his crappy life by stealing the time machine and going back to 1955 with a sports almanac with all the winners of every sport up to the year 2000. So when Marty and Doc make it back to 1985, it's a very different 1985 than the one that they left. After figuring out what happened, they must once again go back to 1955 to prevent the almanac from being used by Biff so they can save the future that they know. Whew.I'm a huge fan of the second movie of the trilogy. It used to be my favorite of the trilogy. Probably because of the flying cars and the hover board. Also the more in depth time traveling was definitely nice to have, even though you had to suspend a little bit of belief of how time travel works. Because honestly if Biff goes back in time and changes time, then time should've altered while Marty and Doc were in 2015. To me, the 2015 scenes were cool, but the movie becomes a lot better when they go back to 1955 again. It was a lot of fun to see Marty watching himself do the things he was doing in the first movie. Like when you see him low crawling under a window of the car that part 1 Marty is sitting in with his teenage version of his mother from 1955. Also it was funny to see Fox play multiple characters in this movie such as his son, his older self and even his daughter from 2015. Also it was amusing to see the 2015 Biff ragging on his former 1955 self for being dumb and sounding like an idiot. And also seeing the son of Biff, Griff, was a trip too. Because he's basically the same type of bully his father was in 1955, but more juiced up because of robotic implants. It was even nice to see Zemeckis do an homage to part 1 by having almost the same skateboard scene from part 1 in this movie also, but a more futuristic version of it.Though it used to be my favorite of the trilogy, I'm starting to lean more to part 1 being my favorite, but part 2 is definitely a close second. Once again, this movie is a classic also and I highly recommend it if you loved part 1.P.S. - From the first time I saw this move to right now as I type this... I want a friggin hover board!-----------------------Back to the Future: Part 3-Saddle up Cowboy... it's a Wild West adventure for Doc and McFly.As soon as Marty and Doc get ready to go back to 1985 from 1955, the Delorean is hit with a lightning bolt and sends Doc somewhere in time. As Marty is standing there in 1955, confused on what to do, a mailman comes up to him, handing him a letter addressed to him, from 1885, from Doc. The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, the relative of Biff.While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like ""Good looking guy"", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AW7P5AX8T4EZC	M. Cooper	I'm a big fan of the Back to the Future series.  I think it's a great trilogy of movies without a weak link.  Despite its plot holes, I think I might actually like the second one the most.  Anyway, I've had all the DVDs for awhile now and finally decided that it was time to upgrade them to Blu Ray.  At the time I purchased this trilogy, the normal US version was selling for $42, but a UK import was available for about $27.  I opted for the import.  That was $15 well saved, because all three blu rays worked flawlessly in my Blu Ray player (a PS3 slim).  I absolutely recommend opting for the cheaper, UK import version.As for the quality of the Blu Ray transfers, they are all exceptional.  The video quality on all three is great.  It may have just been the Old West setting, but the third film especially popped off the screen.  Blacks are consistently black throughout, providing great contrast.  The DTS-HD Master Audio soundtracks were great, providing clear, crisp sound.  If I had one complaint about the audio, it's that it seemed a little light on the bass in a few instances, but that is being a little petty.I'm definitely glad I decided to upgrade from DVD to Blu Ray with these movies before watching again.  If you're considering doing the same, or simply purchasing the movies for the first time, I highly recommend you make the purchase.  Universal took the time to do a truly proper Blu Ray transfer and it shows, it is well worth the investment.	5.0	Review of UK Import Blu Ray	2012-11-04	3	3	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A37QUQPYFMR9Y9	"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews"""	Let me be brief but thorough.Back To The Future Trilogy is YEARS in the making.  Obviously DVD did not exist when this movie came out, but it took WAY too long to release once the DVD media became widespread.  With that having been said, let me go through each incarnation separately.==Back To The Future==Honestly, I was expecting more from this.  Don't get me wrong, it looks great, better than regular VHS and all, but it still doesn't look like a DVD.  It almost looks like a laserdisc as far as visual quality goes.  There is a definite lack of vibrance with the colors and lighting, that you'd see on the likes of Jurassic Park or other movies of this type.  The extras are great; there are quite a few extras to go through, and it's great to see this movie again clearer than the VHS.  The audio on this one; I've read complaints about the surround?  Mine seems to be surround-enabled just fine, and I don't even have a 5.1 system.  Things are clearer than before, even to the point where I hear things that I never heard before, in the background, music, and such.==Back To The Future II==Now THIS is how I expect.  Part 2 is very clear and detailed, and vibrant.  Being that this is my favorite of all of the trilogy, I'm glad that it did not suffer the same fate of part 1.  The audio, again, is very well done as well.  It's very easy to pick out intricate details in what you hear.  I think the best feature of the 2nd disc is its extras.  There's a lot of good information to be had here, including the scoop on why we (in the real world) never got to see Hoverboards, as well as the deleted scenes: namely, what SHOULD have happened to Biff after he stole the DeLorean (I won't spoil it, but it should have been left in).==Back To The Future III==Part 3 of this trilogy is also well done.  The picture quality, the audio quality, and the extras are all well done too.  My only complaint on this one is the deleted scenes.  They only have one, and that's just the explanation of Marshall Strickland's absence.  But I wanted more deleted scenes on that one, because there were a lot of unexplained things in that one.Overall, this is a great trilogy that should be a part of the collection, if for nothing more than nostalgic value.  I'd say you should buy this on your first chance.	4.0	"It's about ""time""."	2002-12-18	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2R4XG0L7Z01V8	"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ..."	"I've seen these movies so many times now, it's unbelieveable. And it's even better to watch on DVD. When I was still young, and these were coming out on TV, I actually saw them in the wrong order. I saw the third first, then the second, then the third. Because I've seen the third so many times, I now cannot stand to watch it. It's so strange! The second & first can sometimes still seem to me to be a novelty, as I haven't seen them as much as the third. What's your favourite? Mine is the second I think. It can change depending which one I watch, and which one I remember clearer.I think all the actors are great in this, although I'm not sure about Eric Stoltz being cast originally. Poor guy though, originally Michael J. Fox was the first choice, but scheduling conflicts due to his work on ""Family Ties"", initially prevented him from taking the part. Eric was then drafted in, and filmed at least a third of the movie. (If you look at bttf.com, then there's photos of him in scenes, and he did film a lot of scenes.) Michael then replaced him, driving straight to the movie set after taping of the show was finished every day. He averaged about one or two hours' sleep during production. The bulk of the production was filmed from 6pm to 6am, with the daylight scenes filmed at the weekend. He also had to learn to skateboard for the film. Billy Zane makes his first on-screen appearance in this film as ""Match"", one of Biff's cronies. It took three hours in make-up to turn the 23-year-old Lea Thompson into the 47-year-old Lorraine. Elisabeth Shue was cast as Jennifer, and all the closing shots of Back to the Future were re-shot for the beginning of this film. Christopher Lloyd is a brilliant actor, and although, he doesn't do much press for many of his films, and is really private about his life, I love him in this. Not quite as much as I do in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (WOW!). I still can't believe sometimes that's the some guy. I basically grew up watching him! Watch out for Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers as Needles in parts 2 & 3!I love the Delorean too. Watching it when I was so young, I didn't realise what other time travel movies used, and I never saw a Delorean to actually try it out! Now that would have been fun!  A refridgerator was originally thought of as a time machine but ended up not being used as director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he and Steven Spielberg did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside.Recently, I also saw Gremlins, and was shocked to discover that the main street in this is the same one used in Gremlins! Obviously with different shops & stuff, but it's exactly the same layout. It was so strange to see it that way!The clock is a common feature throughout all three movies. The clock in the clock tower started running at 8:00 p.m. on September 5, 1885. The date is provided by the caption on the photograph Doc gives Marty at the end of the movie. The lightning strikes the clock tower at 10:04 p.m. on November 12, 1955. This means that the clock tower operated for exactly 70 years, 2 months, 7 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes.There exist enough clues in all three movies to reconstruct the travels of the DeLorean precisely (to within a few minutes at worst, except 2015 Biff's arrival in 1955 and Doc's personal travels). There are a few interesting things to note: On November 12, 1955, between the time Biff arrived (or 6 am, whichever came later) and 6:38 pm (the time he left), there were three DeLoreans present in Hill Valley (ordered from its point of view): (1) The instance when Marty was trapped in 1955 in the original movie, (2) the instance when Biff came to 1955 to give himself the almanac, and (3) the instance when Marty and Doc came back to 1955 to take the almanac back (since the second lightning strike hadn't happened yet at this point, there would not be a DeLorean in the Delgado Mine). Not counting the time Doc traveled by himself, the DeLorean spent nearly 71 years (on its own time scale) from its first time travel to its destruction. By the time Marty made his ultimate return to 1985, he was approx. 14 days, 3 hours, and 27 minutes older than he should have been; Jennifer, on the other hand, is 7 hours and 26 minutes younger than she should have been.I love this DVD, and it's one of my most prized, as the whole trilogy is great, and actually comes with extras! It does annoy me now, as I got it just after it originally came out, and it's getting cheaper to buy as the months go by! The extras on this are OK, not bad, but not mind-blowing either. They include: audio commentary by writer/producer Bob Gale and producer Neil Canton; Michael J. Fox discussing his experience making the Back to the Future trilogy; live Q & A session by writer/director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale; hoverboard tests-original ""flying skateboard"" on location road tests; original ""Making of Back to the Future"" featurette; ""Animated Anecdotes"" - option to see over 150 facts and trivia notes while viewing;dDeleted scenes; outtakes; bloopers; music video ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News; behind-the-scenes segments-designing the DeLorean, Make-Up tests, Time Travel, Storyboarding, and Production Design. Just don't watch this in the wrong order! They are stand alone films, but how did I ever understand it when I was that young? I was probably just watching it for Michael J Fox at the time!"	4.0	Brilliant trilogy	2004-12-13	11	10	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1	Melissa	"My favorite trilogy of all time finally comes in a fantastic DVD set. I've been waiting a long time for this ever since DVD's came into production. Everyone should know what these movies are about but in case your new to the loveable trilogy here's a quick run down.The original Back to the Future was made in and around 1985 by the awesome Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and Stephen Spielberg. This answers the question what happens when you go back to the past and you accidently screw up your existance. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) befriends a scientist (Christopher Lloyd) who has invented a Time Machine out of a DeLorean. Well something goes wrong which sends Marty back in time to 1955 of the same but yet different hometown of Hill Valley. He bumps into his parents and while ""running into them"" his mother (a teenager at the time) falls for her future son instead of his father. So now Marty must not only fix up his parents so he can exsist in the future he also must get the 1955 Doc Brown to get him back to the future. The first original Back to the Future was a huge success in the 80's and very well treasured. It had an amazing cast such as: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Chrispin Glover (George McFly), & Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen). It also didn't have a bad soundtrack it had Huey Lewis and The New's hit song ""Power of Love."" And other songs from the movie such as Michael singing ""Johnny B. Good.""Back to the Future 2: It was years before this one was made and came to the big screen. It's a little more drawn out and a bit more complicated. I admit I had to watch it more than once to get the plot of what happened. But it was fun getting everyone to see it at the movies even when I had already seen it. What happens is that Doc Brown comes back after dropping Marty off at home and telling him he's got to come with him to the Future because something happens with his kids. So along with his girlfriend Jennifer (now being played by Elisabeth Shue) they go into the Future of Hill Valley. Well things go right and wrong. And this is where it gets a little complicated. Toward the end Marty ends up getting yet again stuck back in 1955 after correcting the wrong.Back to the Future 3: The conculsion I believe didn't do well as the first and second one. I had a feeling it was made a little fast. However it's very cute and a nice ending to the trilogy. It's set in Hilly Valley's old West. When Marty learns in 1955 that Doc gets shot a week after the DeLorean gets struck by lightening he goes back into the Old West to prevent it from happening. This third and concluding trilogy we see Doc fall in love with Clara (Played by the sweet and charming Mary Steenburgen), and Marty getting over being called a Chicken. Its sad to see the conclusion of the entire trilogy but it will always be remembered by its strong fan base.The DVD Set: Is truly stunning I can't believe all the goodies it comes with and I'm still going through all of it. It has Michael talking about his experience in making the trilogy, outakes and bloopers (I was expecting a bit more bloopers since all three movies it seems they had a blast and in the third movie there's only one blooper so in this section I did expect a bit more but don't get me wrong it's a blast to see the bloopers), deleted scene's, audio commentaries (with: writer and producer Bob Gale and Neil Canton), Q & A with Rob Zemeckis and Bob Gale, Hoverboard Test, Making of the Trilogy, Animated Anecdotes, Music Video's by: Huey Lewis complete video ""Power of Love,"" and ZZ Top's ""Doubleback,"" Evolution of Special Effects,"" ""Behind the Scene Segmant's,"" and a ""Production Archive."" I was really impressed with the DVD set. And have watched it many times. Also in the extra's you get to finally see for yourself if the Hoverboards are real...If your a fan of the trilogy this is the DVD set for you and a must have to add to your DVD collection. And to relive the memories of ""Back to the Future."""	5.0	This is Heavy!!	2003-03-25	1	1	0

I purchased this series for children and was shocked at the language and adult overtones in the movies, especially the second.  Perhaps this was made before PG was split into PG and PG-13.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A307JDNQBO2VC8	mgoblue95	The picture quality of these dvds is really pristine, and the extras are quite nice, though I would have liked to see more interviews with supporting cast members.As many people have noted, parts 2 and 3 seem to have been matted too high on the open matte original print, so stuff tends to get cut off the bottom of the screen, like Marty's jacket and hoverboard in part 2.  Plus there's too much headroom on many of the shots as a result. I just called the Universal DVD return hotline and they are offering a free replacement of those 2 wrongly matted dvds.  You need to send in the 2 dvds (without the packaging they came in) to:Back to the Future DVD ReturnsPO Box 224468Dallas, TX 75260You need to include your name and full mailing address, along with your daytime phone number and reason for exchange.I also noticed that on Part 1 when I try to watch the commentary with Michael J.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A16XRPF40679KG	Michael Dobey	Unfortunately the blu ray review is stuck with dvd and even vhs as far as I can see. Why Amazon does this is too save space , but it makes it harder to deal with. The blu ray versions of these movies come in a nice pack. all three flicks. Just like other packages of movie sets you can't get these seperate yet.  And this three movie series is worth owning by any standards. The first flick is a modern classic and movies like it come around rarely. The two sequels were decent and fun movies and while not classics they are pretty good movies. At this time we are almost 30 years away from this flick and even close to where the second one takes place in 2015, we aren't as advanced as that one would be , but who cares , the 80's could rightly look back in nostalgia at the fifties and we can now look back to the 80's with nostalgia. Fun rock and lots of wild styles etc. The Blu ray package is well done and the movies look great , they remastered them here and they have never looked better. which is more that can be said of many other movies just slung out on blu ray these days. There are tons of extras too so that's a huge plus. Obviously this is a series that needed this treatment and thankfully we got it  here. THe price is steep for a new one it should have  been no more than forty brand new , but on amazon.com it's cheaper anyway.	5.0	blu ray soars.	2012-01-21	6	5	1

The plot shows how just changing one thing in a persons life has an amazing ripple effect. The alternate reality in in the second movie shows how power can corrupt when in the wrong hands.

Put all of that together and you would expect to spend at least 30 or 40 bucks right?

It is based on the notion that time, just like a geographical location, is fixed in some abstract, though concrete, unit held in our universe.  We can travel to the past, with everything from the past held in tact; we may alter the future through our actions in the past, and we can even change both the future and the past by going to both and radically reshaping events by passing along important information from these different periods in time.  Yes, abstract.  I know.  This movie is an intellectual masterpiece, focused on one of one of human kind's largest question:  Is it possible?Now watch the film, and ask yourself, Maybe?

Fox) enters & hooks up to one of Doc's oversized amplifiers that explodes if set on high, propelling Marty across the room in a rather comical scene, where Marty quotes> ""Rock-n-Roll"" we realize that Marty is a typical 80's teenager that hangs out with Doc, probably because he is fun to be around,as Doc introduces his new invention, a time-traveling DeLorean, he is soon ambushed by terrorist that he stole plutonium from, the DeLoren's power source,he is killed & Marty flees in an attempt to escape, which he does into the year 1955, where he has to get in touch with Doc's younger counterpart to find a power source capable of sending him back, in the process he interrupts his parents first meeting, altering his existence, this is intense as Marty now has to get his parents together while the 1955 Doc has to find a power source since plutonium is non-existent in 1955, they realize a bolt of lightning can substitute the source, since history says it will strike the town clock tower at 10:04 on Nov 12,1955, the 1950's culture is neat to say the least, not only does Marty have to reunite his parents, but he has to make a decision whether or not to inform Doc of his inpending fate in 1985, getting his parents together is intense to say the least, but once he does, the real intensity is getting back as him & Doc argue about his inpending fate, as you can guess, everything that can go wrong does,but Doc gets Marty back to 1985 successfully, won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, which is probably minimal at best, but they are successful after all, the second film is fun but un-even, the futuristic 2015 is less convincing in its approach, one can only guess what it will really be like, I just wish they would have done a ""Blade Runner""-like setting instead, this is the only aspect that falls short on the second film, the hellish 1985 that Marty & Doc encounter as they return to their time is consequentual in how time-travel can be misused, they discover that Biff(the first film's bully) has somehow stolen the DeLorean in 2015 as an old man with a sports almanac with sports dates from 1950 to 2000 to travel back to 1955 & give it to his younger self in the hopes of acquiring millions in wealth, which his younger self does creating an alternate 1985 for Marty & Doc, who now have to travel back to 1955 during Marty's first trip to retrieve the almanac thus settngs thing back the way they were, they are once again successful, but soon the same lightning storm that sent Marty back in the first film has now struck Doc in mid-air whose DeLorean now has a hover-conversion, thus sending Doc back to 1885, where Marty now has to go to get Doc, which in turn sets up the third film, which re-captures the warm feeling of the first film, we see Hill Valley as it looked during th old west, & Marty & Doc's attempt to once again get back to 1985, but Doc soon falls for Clara(Mary Steenburgen) who is a local, the lightning bolt destroyed the hover-conversion, & now Doc & Marty's only hope for getting back is pushing the DeLorean up to 88 MPH, which they do on a railroad track, since there are no roads or gas, by hijacking a train, like the first film, Murphy's Law happens once again, but they once again pull it off, with Doc staying behind with Clara, the western landscapes are by far good to look at, the filmakers definately give it a western feel, the same as in the first film's 1950's look, & is a great trilogy in all fairness, despite the second film's flaws, the third more than makes up for it!!"	4.0	Finally!!! on DVD!!!	2002-09-22	2	2	0

These movies were shot in Super 35, as some directors (Cameron) perfer to do.  This method shoots a large, square area, with the idea that it will be matted when shown at a theatre.  The director frames out what is SUPPOSED to be shown in each shot, whether it be 1.85:1 or 2:35.1.  The point of widescreen is not to have more image shown, but to present the movie as it was shown at the theatre.  The error for parts 2 and 3 is not that they are presenting a fake and deceptive letterbox image, but that when the engineer was matting a few scenes, the matted image was placed too high in the picture, therefore ommitting important information at the bottom.So to sum up, the full frame version is all the actual visual information shot by the camera, while the widescreen version is the matted information that was intended by the director as all you should be seeing and is what was shown originally at the theatre.  You can certainly prefer and buy whichever version you want, but you should at least have a correct understanding of what the choices are."	5.0	Learn about matted Super 35	2003-05-08	120	95	25

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1FG91CM8221X1	Miles D. Moore	"""Back to the Future"" ranks among the funniest, most joyous and most perfectly calibrated farces ever put on screen. Robert Zemeckis does a masterful job of combining Spielberg-era special-effects magic with a script that conjures up ever giddier heights of hilarity. Just when you think it can't get any funnier or cleverer, Zemeckis ups the ante. Helping him do so are the brilliant cast, led by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Fox's performance can only be described as a cross between the young Mickey Rooney and the young Bob Hope, and I can think of no higher praise. As for Lloyd, only Gene Wilder in the modern cinematic era can match Lloyd's sublime comic derangement. It's too bad, then, that the sequels fall so short of the standard set by the original. Back to the Future II--depicting the chaos done to posterity when Biff steals the time-traveling DeLorean for a joy ride--matches the original in cleverness and perfection of structure, but it's so mean-spirited that it's hard to watch. Considering the constant pummeling Marty McFly takes in this installment, only people who hate Michael J. Fox could really enjoy it!  Back to the Future III, which sends Marty and Doc Brown back to the Wild West, recaptures the original's sweetness, but unlike the first two has plot holes you can drive a stagecoach through. I might watch the sequels occasionally, but only to remind myself how much better the original is."	4.0	Five stars for the original, three each for the sequels.	2002-12-14	12	8	4

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1KFK4C5UFMPRB	M. Immel	"While the actual films themselves look stunning on blu-ray, this review shall address the packaging.  Seriously, if I would have known in advance that Universal was releasing this collection in such disgustingly ridiculous packaging, I would have held out for the single disc releases.  I tend to go for packaged collections so this one seemed to be a no-brainer.  I literally sat and stared at the disc trays for a good 2 or 3 minutes studying them, waiting on that ""ohhhh I get it"" moment, and the discs would just come out of the trays with no problem. Boy was I wrong.  I seriously thought I was doing something wrong.  The trays do not have the standard hubs we are all used to.  The discs are held in place with these ridiculous plastic clips across the bottom and you literally have to pull the disc to one side while simultaneously bending the tray so the disc will pop out. Every time I open the box I start to get even more angry because I know what I'm in for and it takes tooooooo darn long to get the discs out.  It is THE biggest pain in the a$$.  On top of the disc trays being ludicrous, the overall packaging, slipcase, etc. looks and feels cheap. TOTAL FAIL on the packaging.  I will more than likely post my set on eBay. Universal should slap the fools that ok'd the packaging for this release.  SSSSSTUUUPID!!!!!UPDATE:  While the packaging reigns supreme as one of the stupidest design choices ever, I did find out the proper way to remove the discs.  ""Simply"" press the disc down, letting the clips at the bottom bend, and pull up and the disc comes out.  Thanks Universal for including instructions on how to remove your discs from the packaging.  Oh, and I did notice that one of the clips is completely broken off and shaking around inside the tray.  Again, brilliant package design.  FANTASTIC!!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A27RJ30RN5K9MX	Mitch Weaver	Let's face it. Practically everyone has seen the Back to the Future films. They have become known around the world as being part of one of the greatest trilogies ever made. The films combine superior acting, action, humor, first rate special effects, an amazing overall soundtrack and an extremely interesting look at time travel. The entire cast is filled with amazing actors that include Michael J Fox, Lea Thompson, Christopher Lloyd, and Thomas F Wilson. The only dissapointment cast wise was Crispin Glover. The reason is not because of a bad performance. In fact, he was quite good as George McFly. However, he only signed on to be in the first film, which was quite a dissapointment to the fans of the trilogy. The main reason the cast did such a great job, is because they were assigned the difficult task of playing more than one character. Over the course of the three films, Michael J Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F Wilson played 8 different characters between the three of them.The extras included in the DVD set are outstanding. There are featurettes, deleted scenes, outtakes, and much more. This really lets you see the films in a whole new light. I did have a few complaints however. As you have probably already read, the widescreen format on the second and third films is absolutely horrible. My other complaint, is that they took the &quot;To Be Continued&quot; out of the first film for some reason. While this may be a very small flaw, I was still upset because the film should be shown in its intirety. Overall, this is one of the greatest trilogies ever made in my opinion. The set is worth buying just for the films themselves. The DVD extras only make the set that much more attractive. Now despite the flaws the set has, it is definately worthy of being added to anyone's DVD collection.Just in case there is anyone out there who has not seen the Back to the Future films, I will include a short synopsis of each film:Back to the FutureThe first chapter of the trilogy introduces us to Marty McFly(Michael J Fox) and his friend Emmet &quot;Doc&quot; Brown ( Christopher Lloyd)who is perceived by the town of Hill Valley as a crazy old mad scientist. Doc has discovered a way to travel through time, by building a time machine into a Delorian. Marty is accidentally sent back into the year 1955, where he must find the 1955 version of Doc to help him get home. Along the way, he meets and becomes friends with his parents(who don't know his true identity), and he also has to deal with the town bully named Biff ( Thomas F Wilson). To make matters worse, Marty's mother ( Lea Thompson)has the hots for him, and he must find a way to make her fall for his father(Crispin Glover), to insure that he is born.Back to the Future IIThe second chapter of the trilogy takes us 40 years into the future, where Marty and Doc travel to the year 2015 to insure that Marty's kids turn out alright. Along the way Marty picks up an alminac that contains the outcome of every major sporting event from 1980 to the year 2000. Unfortunately, the elderly 2015 version of Biff manages to get his hands on the alminac as well as the time machine, and delivers the alminac to himself in 1955. When Marty returns to his own time, everything is turned around, and Biff is the most powerful man in town. Now, Marty and Doc must travel back to 1955 to put things right without running into their other selves.Back to the Future IIIThe third and final chapter of the trilogy takes us to the year 1885 in the Old West. Doc is accidentally sent back to the year 1885 after the Delorian is struck by lightning, which leaves Marty stranded in 1955. Once again, Marty must find the 1955 version of Doc to help him with the time machine. When Marty discovers through old records that Doc is going to be killed by a psychotic gunslinger named Mad Dog Tannen, he travels back to 1885 to prevent the tragic death from occuring. Unfortunately, back in 1885, Doc manages to meet a woman named Clara ( Mary Steenburgen) whom he falls for at first sight. This makes Doc want to stay in 1885, regardless of what happens to him.	5.0	One of the greatest trilogies ever made....	2004-01-25	5	3	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A25AXWGBGJ5KBS	"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo"""	"""Back To The Future"" has rightly attained classic status as one of the most entertaining films from the 1980's. It was an unexpected smash the summer of it's release, and one of those movies where images and phrases become part of popular culture within a weekend.I feel the most impressive achievement by the filmmakers is the perfectly balanced tone of the movie. After all, upon going back in time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) finds his own mother has ""the hots"" for him. High potential for creepiness, but it's handled so deftly and sweetly it works wonderfully.The underlying theme, echoed often by the filmmakers on the supplements, is the realization that your parents were once teenagers. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover draw crisp portraits of Marty's folks, filled with delightful little details.Zemeckis and company also balance the ""period piece"" nature of the film with the ""sci-fi"" elements in a way that neither one overwhelms the other. They also simultaneously remember the 50's with a rosy, reverent glow while tweaking it's nose a bit.Watching it again after all these years, I was amazed at how everything works, and at how well it has aged. The funny thing, is that the movie is so well done, the 80's is presented as sweetly as the 50's, now seen from the 21st century. In a goofy way, the movie is its' own time machine. It takes you right back. It's a wonderful film.Now for the sequels. Reductio ad absurdum, ""Number 2"" is the dark, twisted flip side to the first film. It's a Gordian knot of time travel complications. There is a level of genius in having a sequel that revisits the original from a different perspective, from tone to script to even camera angles...the ""perspective"" is skewed.""Number 3"" gives Doc (Christopher Lloyd) a chance to be the center of the film, and by going further back in time, the film offers more simple, less serious options to wrapping up the three films. It's a Western, giving Fox and friends a chance to play on horses, shoot guns and lasso things.While the first film is perfect on it's own, the other two are infinitely better taken as a whole rather than as separate films. They're not totally necessary, but nicely fill out a sort of ""BTTF"" universe.Smartly packaged as an affordable three-disc set, with nifty extras and outtakes that'll leave you begging for more (there's a great ""appearance"" by Roger Rabbit), this is one of the safest purchases you'll make!"	5.0	Terrific entertainment!	2003-06-16	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3U9MW0SL7QAHQ	Moonwalker	Back to the Future is, was, and always will be my favorite movie. It's a timeless classic about generational gaps between parents and children with wholly lovable characters and a message about self confidence no one should miss. The second movie, while not as strong as the first, is still a lot of fun and very creative in the way that it revisits the first film. Part II pays homage to It's A Wonderful Life with an alternate reality created when the characters accidentally mess with the space-time continuum. And although Part III is only kind of average, it's still a satisfying conclusion to the series. If you haven't seen these movies, buy this set and get started; you won't be disappointed.The blu ray set is quite definitive in its A/V presentations (1080p widescreen original aspect ratio and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 tracks on each film). Each movie displays its natural film grain, while still keeping colors vibrant and detail intact. The prints are clear and clean and a joy to watch. The 5.1 Master Audio surround tracks are far superior to the DVDs, and provide great surround effects. However, while this is the best these movies are ever going to sound, they still can't compete with a modern soundtrack (so one shouldn't approach the audio on these discs with that kind of standard in mind).I really thought long and hard about it and I couldn't think of one thing I would have wanted included in the special features that is not already there. We get a brief look at Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, interviews with the major players, deleted scenes, outtakes, and even a storyboard sequence of the original nuclear detonation ending of Part I. There's a massive documentary that covers everything, audio commentaries, and (my personal favorite) the Universal Studios attraction, Back to the Future: The Ride, is presented in its entirety (with line and lobby footage included). The best part about that? The Ride comes equipped with D-Box motion control codes, preserving the original experience of The Ride, which is especially awesome now that Universal has taken The Ride out of its Florida park.Digital copies are included for all three films and the packaging looks glossy and sweet. However, as nice as it looks, the method in which you have to take the discs out was a horrible idea. Instead of the normal method of holding the disc from the center ring, the Back to the Future Trilogy set holds them from the outer rim, forcing you to do a weird maneuver to get them out that will likely result in many scratched and broken discs and/or boxes. For me, it wasn't so hard getting them out, but putting them back in scares me as I have to force through the outer prongs to get them back in and risk damaging the outer rim of the discs.Universal, please, PLEASE set up a packaging exchange for something a little more conventional. The packaging is the only black mark on an otherwise truly definitive set.There always has to be something...	5.0	Great movies, great edition, horrible packaging	2010-10-28	6	5	1

Then in Back To The Future Part 2 we have Marty and Doc Brown going to the Future in the year 2015 then back to 1955, then in Back To The Future Part 3 we see both of them going back even further to the old west in the year 1885.This is a box set that no DVD collector should be without, as all three movies are packed with tons of extra features like deleted scenes and makeup tests.Great set of movies that you will enjoy watching time and time again.	5.0	"""NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT WE ARE SENDING YOU BACK TO THE FUTURE!"""	2003-04-08	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ASEC0MT36EXB5	"Mr. Dj Barry ""sirdbarry"""	There are two ways in which a piece of art can become timeless. First to encapsulate its era so brilliantly it becomes a virtual historical document. And second that it's a piece that rejects a vision of it's time so much so that defies a pigeon hole in history to the point that means it becomes timeless. Back To The Future is such a beast that manages to cover both of these criteria. Thus negating my boundaries.Oh, my godess, what is it here that captures the timeless?Well for a start all the characters manage to capture the paradox of both old, mundane and frustrated repression and yet also capture the spirit of youth and opportunity.Not only this but it (the `85 original) manages to be devoid of CGI and yet be the perfect (and I do mean perfect) blockbuster (consisting of only a handful of special effects- less than fifteen shots.). It is at heart a period piece. Both in it's time travel aspects and in the 1985 setting that by 1989/90 sequels it must leave behind. Not just cos it manages to please the masses in a harmless and surface manner but also happens (unlike Jaws) to be the first blockbuster to cover such edgy subjects as attempted rape, incest, bullying and time travel, while attempting the impossible task of tackling the confusion and frustration of adolescence twenty years before Larry Clarke got his exploitative thinking cap on. Providing us with something a little more hard hitting. Within this I'm sure it is the very equation of perfection. As far as a big budget, big screen adventure is ever allowed to do.If you have ever doubted that your parents were young. This is the film for you. If you've ever doubted there sexy-ness. (Lea Thompson in that dress in Part one) ever been told you'll go blind, if you stare at girls in lingerie (Lea Thompson dressing in font of the window.) If you ever wondered if your old folks were ever young and inexperienced the same insecurities of youth, check this out.But this in itself is redundant as if your old folks have not shown you this film by the time your ten you should prosecute them for child abuse. BTTF is that life defining.It really ticks all the boxes and yet looking on it now as a grown up it seems so much smaller and intimate. More specific to what it tried to achieve. And why? The performances were epic.If we can forget the egotism that consumed Crispin Glover (George McFly) after the first instalment, and the god awful sitcoms of Lea Thompson's future. Not forgetting the tragic illness of Fox's life. It would be mawkish to fault them. Fox is our timeless, eternal, adolescent, inner. Enthusiastic, horny, curious, mildly cynical and most importantly a teenager with charm unlike your average Hogwarts stalwart.Doc Brown in show stealing form, is the weird best friend we all longed for as a child to break the monotony of suburban life. (Really who had such a character in there suburbs- we all had the weirdo's and paedophiles, but where were the mad scientists with a seemingly endless funds to indulge there flights of fancy?)All the elements provide vulnerability, we in our current political climate would balk at as naivety. They even had middle eastern terrorists at the start, for Christ sake!!!Most of all, it provides fantasy, which as I see it is the best way to ask any real questions in life, through metaphor and imagination. Who cant relate to the ideas here? If you cant, I doubt you were ever a kid, or have forgotten, in which case switch off and go sit down and start crying if your withered prune of a heart can manage it.But most of all it's just a great yarn. And that's it's greatest trick. All that intelligence, and heart wrapped up in a freaking great, twisted story for all the family. In many ways (Unlike many of the overly self aware summer hits of today.) innocent, subversive and fun. And not only that but look at the scene towards the end where Doc Brown doubts George has never stood up to Biff. Just Before he discovers the note. Proving that he either knew where the story was going or the makers were truly genii (My collective noun for a genius.) and knew where the two sequels would lead, leaving us with the setup which would become the perfect trilogy, unlike the Worchowski's effort.This is a slightly romantic view of a film made form the capitalist, war mongering regime that Regan was so proud of. Subtexts about nuclear power and it's predicted availability. (Harking back to the 50's when it's discovery was both feared and celebrated and safety was uncertain.) Capitalism, both it's success and failure in the shape of the Delorien. All themes we can be aware of. It was indeed a product of it's time for once born through the studio system. (There's a lesson to be learned there.) It's a tale spun eloquently through the 80's zeitgeist as much as it borrows from the timeless themes of Greek tragedy, but a tale never told without a healthy helping of charisma and humour. A story that will age gracefully unlike the fans like me who will most certainly not.	5.0	THIS IS HEAVY!!!	2006-10-19	2	1	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1B58IHFBFHFQM	"Ms. Emma Crisp ""roslyn_tabor"""	I have been waiting for this ever since DVD was invented. BTTF is made for DVD and will look and sound fantastic I'm sure. The fact that the UK gets the BTTF Trilogy release before the US is a little odd (its released in the UK on 9/30/02) but great for me as I am from the UK! I saw BTTF when it came out when I was 8 and have been in awe of it ever since. Every time I watch the first film (my favourite out of the other two) it still sends shivers up my spine and it doens't age with repeated watching, it was definatly ahead of its time,.if you pardon the pun!I can't wait to see if there are any deleted scenes with Eric Stoltz as the part of Marty McFly (he was origionaly cast in the role but was replaced with Michael J Fox as Eric looked too old to play a 17 yr old - just as well Michael looks so young, he had to reprise playing a 17 year old well into his late 20's!!)but from what I hear they are not included which is a shame, but you never know what might end up on the US DVD extras.Whatever, without the extras, this trilogy is a must, great soundtrack, great cast, great special effects and great script make this a classic film that everyone will enjoy - believe me!	5.0	About time!

I enjoyed seeing deleted scenes from the original movie adding a little bit to the movie I've seen hundreds of times since I was a little kid.  I highly recommend this box set to fans of the series.  I don't regret buying this at all.  Again I can't emphasize enough how good these movies look, I bought Terminator on blu-ray and it doesn't even come close.  They didn't just do a simple port from original film to blu-ray or even just take the DVD and transfer that, they digitally remastered every frame and it shows.  I also really like that it came with digital copies.	5.0	I can't believe how amazing this movie looks	2011-01-22	2	2	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1SYSKR79LA2CB	"Mycroft ""Virture is its own punishment"""	When these films were released I thought they were silly kiddie flicks, but they have grown on me over the years. Perhaps it is the sadness of Michael J. Fox's devastating illness or the charm of watching Elizabeth Shue long before she decided to become a serious actress and lost the desire to act, or the magic of Mary Steenbergan craftily working behind the scene to become more visible than the leads or maybe it just that these films were better than I first thought. No matter, they do make magic. Having the whole collection and getting to see the subtle shifts in ability as the cast matures is magic. Replacing the feeble Claudia Wells with Elizabeth Shue was brilliant. Struggle through the first film and the reward will be better acting all around. Lea Thompson proves she's more than just a teen actor, Christopher Loyd sheds The Rev Jim and becomes a perfect mad scientist and his over-the-top style actually adds to the flavor of the film. This collection is the perfect antidote for lackluster televison and dreary reality shows. Get it and a case of buttered popcorn, some fuzzy slippers get a death grip on the remote and settle back to the future.	5.0	The Future is Now	2009-03-14	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A22PKORC02FA83	Nathan Herman	The blurays quality themselves is nothing short of fantastic.  However the packaging is one of the worst packaging choices I've ever seen.  After struggling for a bit while trying to avoid creating potential scatches the method I came up with to remove them is to first remove the digital copies.  Thats right, they are actually easier to remove. The top part should easily lift under the little clips holding it in place, then just slide it out from under the bluray disc.  Now for the top disks what I found as a trick was to push gently foward on the disc from the center of it until you are safely able to lift the bottom edge up over the  plastic holding it in place. Then slide it towards you and it should come out.  Needless to say these blurays have already been transferred into separate jewel cases.  There's no way I'm putting them back into the packaging!  It still gets 5 stars for being the greatest trilogy of all time!	5.0	Fantastic movies, aggravating packaging!	2010-10-27	5	5	0

I've requested a replacement and once I receive it, I will update this review.UPDATE : March 17, 2002 - I forgot to post an update but Amazon mailed me a new copy without any problems or questions.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3SF7QOSUOXTWZ	"N. Davies ""Scalpel Reviews"""	"*this review relates to the cinematic content of the original 1985 feature only*PLOTA young man, who has somehow befriended a passionate old scientist, is by way of cause and effect (and a naff car fitted with a plutonium-powered time travel device) transported 30 years into the past.  Here, in 1955, the car runs out of plutonium and the young man befriends the younger, less experienced scientist in a desperate attempt to return to 1985.  Complications arise when he meets his teenage parents...REVIEWDated elements of production design and product placement fail to detract from this highly entertaining family adventure. The script is witty, humorous and particularly credible in its amateur consideration of the time travel phenomenon.  The special effects are beyond their time, and editing and sound are first rate.With regard to the overall production and directing of the film, this is Robert Zemeckis's greatest achievement - hands down it beats ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), for which he one an Oscar for best director. While Stephen Speilberg served as executive producer only, ""Back to the Future"" is also one of his greatest films, because it epitomizes his contribution to cinematic imagination.The chemistry of the lead actors - Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd - has perhaps been equalled but is yet to be surpassed on the big screen. They are supported in several hilarious situations by talented newcomers.I am giving this film the highest rating because family adventures like this aren't made anymore and I want to encourage Generation Y to seek out this film in particular. For us Generation X-ers, and even most of our parents, ""Back to the Future"" will remain one of the pillars of 1980s cinema.SPECIAL MENTIONSMichael J Fox for Acting.Christopher Lloyd for Acting.Crispin Glover for Acting.Huey Lewis and the News for theme song ""The Power of Love""."	5.0	They just don't make them like this anymore...	2009-01-07	0	0	0

They are one of the best movies of the 80's. And even of all time. Back to the Future Part 1 is about a boy named &quot;Mardy&quot; who travels back in time to 1955. He runs into his mother, which screws his mother and father relation ships. He needs help from his scientist friend named &quot;Dock&quot;. If you have the collection without the V2 on the back. The first film is not out of the frame. Only on the 2nd and 3rd movie. 8 deleted scences, behind the scense, outtakes and much more!Back to the Future part 2 takes place where Back to the Future left off. Mardy and his girlfriend Jennifer need to visit the future to help their children. Then Biff (Mardys Bully) old self, becuase you see when Mardy and Dock went to the future, Mardy picked up a magizine about 50 years of sports of who wins, which Mardy can then make a few extra bucks. Dock throws away the magazine then old Biff gets the magizine and travels back to give it to his young self. Which Biff then becomes a billionare. There are 7 deleted scences with optional commentary. Behind the scenes and outtakes and much more.The third and final installment of the saga takes place in the old west. You see Dock travels back in time to be left alone, but then Mardy discovers his grave, and then travels back into time to save Dock. Dock then saves a scientist who was suppose todie jumping off a cliff. It is a great and final ending for the saga. It includes only 2 deleted scences, outtakes, behind the scenes and more. Make sure when you buy this dvd it has a V2 on the back. If it doesnt you can call the company and they'll ship you new dvds. If you dont know what I'm talking is about is because they mest up on the framing on Back to the Future part 2 and 3.

For those of us who have seen each movie at least 20 times, we know that Marty, Doc, and Jennifer fly off at the very end, and &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot; appears.  The problem is that this &quot;to be continued&quot; never appears in my widescreen DVD version.  I am aware of problems with the sequels, but I am interested if my problem has happened to any other BTTF fans.  Write response reviews if possible, and take the time to read some of the more extensive reviews as well.  Universal will have to do some revising on this DVD before it is PERFECT.

In part 1, Fox goes back to his parents past, using a funky flying car/time machine invented by his oddball older friend (Christopher Lloyd).  This film gets a solid 5 stars.In part 2, Fox is, again, entangled in time, but zig-zags a bit, starting out by going forward in time.  I loved his wheel-less skateboard!  However, this film did not WOW! me as the first one had done.  A 4-star rating.Finally, the third CD goes back in time again, to a Wild West sort of set-up.  This is the second best CD and the trilogy comes to a satisfactory conclusion.  While, I rate this film at 4.5 stars, I am going the rate the whole trilogy at 4.o stars.  Why?  Well, the whole thing gets a little tiring by the time it is done.  Fox's character is a bit of a twerp.  And, Lloyd overdoes his oddball and excitable ""Professor"" acting.  And, as good as Fox was, watching comedy suited to teenagers for three films straight is, also, a bit much.  Grown-ups may overload on the cumulative ""sweetness"".But, this is a very good set of CDs to pull out for the teenagers for a three-day week-end, at one-CD-per-day.

Has anyone ever look into how many different type of disc containers they have come up with?Anyway, great movies! And on time!	5.0	Back To The Future Trilogy Blu Ray	2011-02-12	2	0	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AZ33AABC169YT	packy17	Universal didn't mess this release up like they did with the original BTTF DVD release - all films look great and are in the correct widescreen format. There's not much else to say about this set. It's Back To The Future. On Blu-ray. With new special features. If you're a fan, buy this.The ONE HUGE FLAW with this product is the awful case design. I'm sure I'm not alone in this - the discs are held in place by a very tight labyrinth of plastics, and removing a disc always gives me a small feeling of fear as if I'm going to crack one of them. Getting them back in is a chore as well, as you have to pretty much force one side of the disc down into place over one of the plastic bits. That, or you could go the bending route... neither of which are very safe.All in all, great product. The films look better than ever and they sound better than ever. I suggest however that (if you're willing) you use an alternative storage solution for the discs. It won't be long until we start seeing a mass of reports of discs being scratched/cracked.	5.0	BLU RAY REVIEW - Great picture, poor packaging	2010-10-31	3	1	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1CVWU8XAV5OO3	Pamela K Scott	Back to the Future.  A classic. It has all of the wonderful elements of childhood, plenty of adult humor, and Michael J. Fox, who play an outstanding teenager.  Christopher Lloyd, in his most memorable role of all time, play Doc Brown, a scientist who builds a time machine... out of a Delorean.  Hey, if you're gonna build a time machine, why not do it with some style?The lines were memorable, the plot very well tied together, and the story fascinating for every type of person- science fiction, fantasy, romance, comedy, action, you name it.  I don't suggest driving 88 miles per hour to pick it up, but I do suggest haste.  Everyone should have this complete trilogy (with extras of all kinds to boot, and good ones, too!)  A lot of people I know won't see this movie again. They say it's all in the past.  Well, I think this movie just got the update it needed for THE FUTURE.  Yes, I'm gonna say it.  Go Back to the Future.  Pick up this film!!!	5.0	Wonderful.	2002-12-29	0	0	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3M6IEYM5ILMIQ	Papadodgio	I'll start off by saying Back to the Future is my second favorite movie trilogy of all time. Back to the Future Part II and III may be weaker than Part I but I still really enjoy them. These movies are clever, funny, and alot of fun to watch.I owned these movies on VHS but I knew I wanted them on DVD. I bought this box set for two reasons. The first reason was because it contains all three films and the second reason is because there are a ton of bonus features. I find watching the special features just as fun as watching the movie, and there are a ton of features here. I love all of the 'behind the scenes' featurettes on these disks and the 'hoverboard test' featurette for Back to the Future Part II. There are plenty of features to last awhile...I think there are around 10 hours of features.If you are a huge fan of the trilogy like I am, there is no way that you should pass this box set up. I haven't had any problems with my set and it was worth every penny!	5.0	Great Edition of an Incredible Trilogy!	2010-06-21	1	1	0

The humor, the action, the attention to detail in linkages among all three movies, all is perfect.  There are a few movies that come to mind as perfect examples of their genre AND 80s culture, and this trilogy is at the top of the list.  From the clothes to the cars to the music, there is no mistaking when these movies originally came out - and that is part of the charm.Micheal J. Fox is at his peak in this series and Christopher Lloyd, too.Unlike some recent disappointing DVD releases (and release strategies - like three different versions of LOTR), this appears to be THE definitive set and one that everyone who owns a DVD player should buy.  I can't wait til my kids are old enought to enjoy these movies, I know I'll enjoy sharing them with them.	5.0	I CAN'T WAIT!	2002-08-26	0	0	0

When I came across this full screen version at the same time that I had gotten a Amazon gift card I new fate meant for me to get it.  Along with original Star Wars this is among the best movie trilogies made and should be a must in any any home. When I had ordered I thought it was a 4 DVD set but it turn out to be only a 3 DVD set with the extras spread out between each movie disk. The original Back to the Future trailer I had forgotten about as well as the music videos that were done at the time for the films.  They were nice surprises to me.While I didn't take any stars off for it I think only thing that would of made this set even better would be if like Ghostbusters and Bill and Ted box sets if we could of had at least one episode of Back to the Future Saturday Morning cartoon series included among the extras.	5.0	go full screen	2014-01-11	1	1	0

I'm so glad they made this trilogy, what a wild ride it was.  It certainly holds up to the test of time because it's just as fun to watch it now as it was back in '85.  The world has changed so much since then and watching these movies is a nice escape from today's nerve wrecking reality.  I wish I could get my hands on Doc's time machine so I could go back in time to fix the mistakes I made in my life... who doesn't!?!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ADE852UR9121C	perfecto	"I remember first watching these movies when I was about 10 or 11, and I loved it. I finally got around to getting this boxset, and as I was watching the movies again, I realize that I enjoy them even more. And that is the kind of appeal these movies have, they offer something for everyone and are suitable for all ages. First, I will give a quick run-through of the storyline for all the movies.In Back To The Future: Part I, we are introduced to Marty and Doc Brown. Doc Brown invents a time machine out of a DeLorean. Marty accidentally goes back in time to 1955, and is forced to look up the Doc to fix the time machine and get him back to 1985. What follows is a hilarious take on Marty's situation where he meets his parents when they were his age, and there are an assorted array of characters, from the ultimate school bully, Biff to the over-strict discipline teacher, aptly called Mr. Strickland.In Back To The Future: Part II, Doc Brown comes back from the future with some disturbing news about Marty's kid. He gets Marty as well as Jennifer, and they go to the future to save Marty's kid from ending up in jail. In the process, they lose Jennifer. While Doc Brown and Marty are trying to get her back, Biff gets into the DeLorean, goes back to 1955 and does something which changes the year 1985. This forces Doc Brown and Marty to go back to 1955, and they have to prevent Biff from changing anything in the past to affect the future.In Back To The Future: Part III, Marty goes back to the year 1885 to save Doc Brown, who supposedly gets shot by a villain called Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. We see the Doc falling in love with a school teacher, Clara and it is Marty that is trying to keep him clear headed. They try to fix the DeLorean to get them back to 1985.The thing about Back To The Future movies, is that they are just so damn entertaining. These movies are hardly serious, nor are they going to change our lives or make us look at things differently. But when you talk about silly fun...this is as good as it gets. It is such a joy watching the characters we love take on different people each installment, and making the most of it. Something that stands out in the Back To The Future series is the script. It is superb. In the first movie, we are given glimpses of how it would be like watching our parents as teens. Were they as good as they always say, or did they have mischievious streaks as well? These are the questions that the writers make us think about, and they do it with such humour and wit. The second movie is more suited for adults. It is definitely more complex, but the way the writers tackle the issues of multiple timelines and alternate realities is refreshing. It is certainly the more ambitious of the 3 movies. And finally, they went back to basics for the third and final movie. The old west is presented quite typically, but still is a delight to watch.The cast give fantastic performances. Because these movies do not require serious actors, they seem to just roll with it. They give very real and honest performances. Trust me, it makes the stories that much more convincing. They give us a sense of excitement and wonder at what they're going through. Everyone from Michael J. Fox to Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson to Thomas Wilson are impressive.In short, if you're looking for a fun adventure...something to relax to, something that is timeless, look no further...this is it. A definite classic in my opinion. At a time when creativity seems to be lacking in most movies, it's nice to be reminded how fun movies can be."	5.0	A must have!	2005-06-30	0	0	0

You just need not to be clutching these things like a gorilla and taking a moment to breathe and look at the mechanism involved.Put the edge of your finger in the center of the disks hub and gently push down.  You will see some clips at the bottom flex and the disk rather easily swings out from the top with a little downward and ""pull gently toward you"" movement.  Same with putting it back in.  After a moment you will go ""Is that all?""I'm not crazy about this type of packaging either but with a small amount of care it works fine and you shouldn't be damaging the disks or your investment."	5.0	How to Release BTTF Blu-Ray disks from package	2010-10-27	9	6	3

Hillman	"This 2005 release, ""Lowest Price Ever"" on the front package contains the corrected Widescreen versions of Part II and Part III.  The original release in 2002 with an oval sticker on the package contains the defective versions of Part II and Part III.The framing was so bad on Part II and III, you actually missed visual jokes!  In Part II when Marty sizes the jacket in the future, the framing cut off Marty's hand when he presses the button to size the jacket.  In Part III, when Marty and Doc are in the Drive-In to leave for 1885, Doc makes the joke about Marty's tennis shoes because the boots don't fit, but the framing cut off Marty's feet.  When Doc tries alcohol in the Delorean and blows the fuel injection manifold, the majority of the explosion is cut out of the frame.Part II DVD will have the marking, ""V2"" on the outer edge next to the copyright.  Part III DVD does not have any new markings, but the Widescreen framing has been corrected in this 2005 re-release."	5.0	The 2005 re-release is the corrected Widescreen version	2008-04-13	216	197	19

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI	"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan"""	"I originally had the trilogy collection on separate VHS tapes; what a joy it was when DVD re-introduced the ""Back to the Future"" series in a crisp, digital format. Several years later, these films have not lost their charm. Director Robert Zemeckis labeled BTTF ""special-effects comedies"", but they seem so much more. What's more enchanting than the notion of meeting your parents when they were in their teens? That's what teen Marty McFly (the terrific Michael J. Fox, at the height of his ""Family Ties"" TV fame) finds out in Part I as he's catapulted back to the innocent 50's in a Delorean time machine devised by his spastic but brilliant scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd, wonderfully quirky on a variation of ""The Nutty Professor""). Doc Brown's warnings of ""drastically altering the time continuum"" get turned on their ear when Marty accidentally does alter the course of events leading to his parents falling in love, and that's part of the fun of the first film as Marty gets into close scrapes with bully Biff (a solid comic performance from Thomas Wilson) and fending off uncomfortable amorous advances from his Mom-to-be (Lea Thompson, in top form). Like Lloyd, Crispin Glover (who was in the first film but was replaced by ""look-alike"" actors appearing briefly in long shots for the sequels) is perfectly cast as Marty's nerdish loser father George. Part II is intricate & clever; perhaps TOO clever at times, because it's just as imaginative but lacks the heart of Part I. Picking up where Part I left off, Doc Brown whisks Marty & his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue filled the role in the sequels, riding a crest of success at the time with ""Adventures in Babysitting"" & ""Cocktail"") away to the near future to help correct events which will destroy their family & marriage. Marty's purchase of a sports almanac once again demonstrates what happens when you change history--this time, with darkly disastrous effect. What follows might be a first in movie sequels: Revisiting key events from the first film as Marty & Doc try to mend the time line by returning to the 50s. You have to admire the minds who came up with such cleverness. Part III brings the series full circle as it returns the charm of the first film--except the surroundings are different. After the flying Delorean gets zapped by lightning, Marty learns that Doc Brown is alive & well...in 1885! With the help of the 50's Doc, Marty goes back to rescue Doc from a fatal shooting by Biff's great grandfather, ""Maddog"" Tannen. A sweet but unexpected subplot twist has Doc falling in love with another science-minded person (Mary Steenburgen) which winds up complicating their journey back to the present. Both sci-fi & westerns are blended together here, capped with a dazzling FX-laden train ride as Doc & Marty attempt to ""push"" the Delorean through the time barrier.There are many, many joke references to cultural icons & ""how time repeats itself"" which are stitched through the fabric of each film. Included are ""making of"" featurettes on each film. BTTF will remain one of my favorite movie trilogies!"	5.0	One of the most magical, endearing & funny movie trilogies	2010-06-27	3	3	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AUS6IZV2XZPAQ	Randy L. Heeren	I am very satisfied with my purchase of this trilogy.  It has hours and hours of behind the scenes and bloopers and How they made the movies, which is very interesting.  The movies come nicely packaged in a very nice dvd holder that opens like a book.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3IQPM5FBNP8FY	"R. A. Staherski ""intheblacklodge"""	... However, the poor framing is absolutely unforgiveable.  The studio knew about it but released it anyway, and now it is up to us, the unsuspecting consumer to get a replacement in February!  Despite how minor this may sound, it is a very major problem.  It honestly looks like someone down at Universal who was trying to cut corners simply took the 4:3 pan and scan version and slapped black bars on the top and bottom, thinking none of us would ever know the difference.  Substantial portions of the picture are often cut off, parts that I can remember vivdly from watching the movies as a kid that are no longer there.  For example, in part 2 when Marty gets out of the lake and his jacket starts beeping at him, you have no idea what is going on becuase the blinking button on the coat is completely out of frame.  My advice is to wait until March if you're going to buy this set...	3.0	Great movie, great extras...	2002-12-27	10	9	1

A fun action packed futuristic adventure movie that will keep you glued to the screen to see what happens.  A good family movie for the whole family. For those who have not seen this movie,  it depicts a crazy scientist who creates a time machine and has a young teenage friend help him record his finding. Things happen that transport the teen to the past, meets his parents as teenagers,  and has to find the scientist in the past that created the time machine to get him back to the future (the teenage's time). While back in the past, the teen changed some events unknowingly and the other two movies have the scientist and teen repair the changes that where made in the past. Also has plenty of bonus material of how the movie was conceived and made.	5.0	Back to the Future trilogy	2014-02-25	0	0	0

These films are classics for all time, and Universal did them right by giving them a fantastic Blu Ray Transfer. The colors are crisp, the darks are dark, and the detail is superb. This Blu Ray disc set not only has a fantastic transfer and audio quality, but the Special Features are fantastic. Basically what you get are most of the features that were all ready available, plus some new HD documentaries and featurettes.The movies themselves are fantastically creative, and are amongst some of the best Sci-Fi films made in the last 40 years. The story revolves around a crazy scientist named Doc Brown who creates a Time Machine, and accidentally sends his partner, Marty McFly back in time to the 1950's, where he accidentally stops his parents from ever falling in love. This premise is original, hilarious, and tense, and the movies, all 3, feel like crazy roller coaster rides. Definitely recommended.	5.0	Back to Blu Ray	2011-04-06	6	5	1

He is the appitimiy of humorious fun and basically a good actor and actually has a very nice stage bio besides.You can be in a coma, or even be brain dead and still enjoy this weird collection of DVDs.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3MQ15651KGVLJ	Rick L.

In my opinion the packaging isn't any cheaper than all the new releases of today the only fly in most peoples ointment is the new design.As for the movies they hold up wonderfully and the transfer is pristine in Picture and Sound.  It is a huge step up from the regular DVDs and how many times can you say that about a Blu-Ray release these days!  My grandkids were seeing them for the first time and they went wild.  (I have to admit I couldn't believe the darn DeLorean still looked good!)So If you're sitting on the fence on this one...take my word for it...it's worth the upgrade...and don't worry about the packaging.Update:  To address the comment.  This is precisely what I'm talking about, even he admits he figured it out, destroying the packaging in the process.  Admittedly he may have a point about the studio springing a new design on an unsuspecting sea of consumers but that doesn't invalidate the fact that it took me 5 minutes to figure it out....but as the Bard once said, ""your results may vary...""...and ultimately ""Caveat emptor""..."	5.0	Great Remastering In Blu-Ray - Nothing Wrong With Packaging!	2010-10-30	12	9	3

Universal utterly failed in the design of the packaging for this set. It has to be the worst blu-ray box set I've ever encountered and I own hundreds of movies. First off, the slip case slides off way too easily. It's only a matter of time before it gets dropped. Second, the discs are incredibly difficult to remove. I don't know who designed this or why, but what I'm really curious about is how he managed to smuggle it out of the madhouse he's being housed in. Seriously, this case was probably rejected as a means of torture because it was deemed more inhumane than water boarding. Finally, the discs are stacked. I hate when discs are stacked in cases, and the frustration is only compounded by the problem described above.I am returning this set for a refund in the hopes that Universal will come to their senses and quickly pull these from shelves in favor of a replacement set. Otherwise, I guess I'll be waiting until these movies get individual blu-ray releases. I might miss out on the extra features, but it will be a small price to pay. Seriously, don't encourage Universal by getting this set. Don't do it.	1.0	Do not buy this set!	2010-11-01	22	8	14

This is the Back to the Future trilogy of movies released on Blu-Ray for the first time. These are some of the most amazing movies there are. I've been a fan since I was a kid and I'll always be a fan of these movies. The video quality is amazing. There are no framing issues such as those that plagued the DVDs when they were released originally. The sound of course is amazing too. The best part of this set is that it has a ton of extras including some of the Eric Stoltz footage that has never been seen anywhere. It has everything the DVDs had and then some.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	"Universal certainly has done it up right in re-releasing the Back to the Future franchise as they have done this time around.This four disc set comes with a remastered Back to the Future(July/85),Back to the Future 2(Nov/89),Back to the Future 3(May/90) and a special features fourth disc,but more on that later.I usually go into plot summaries but by now these legendary films' plots are well known by most so I'll just skim the surface.All the film's two main stars are Michael Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as ""Doc""or Professor Brown.The first film introduces us to the BTTF world as Marty works part time helping Doc clean his work and experimental environment.One day the Doc has plans to test his theory of time travel using a Delorean car.The plutonium which powers the flux capacitor which powers the car was stolen and the Doc gets killed before he can go.This forces Marty to drive it and he goes back to 1955.He finds and meets his parents and he also meets and convinces the younger Doc to help get him back to 1985.Back in 1985 he prevents the Doc from getting killed,but Marty soon realizes they have changed time somehow,as things are quite different at home.While he's taking this in the Doc appears from the future and whisks Marty back with him to prevent a tragedy from happening involving Marty himself.In the second film we find the Doc and Marty trying to prevent Marty's future son from being arrested.Marty poses as his son and gets the job done.However Biff,Marty's nemesis from the first movie,is now rich and famous and married to his mother.It seems the 1985 Biff has given a sports book to his younger self,who has bet on every event in the book and racked up alot of money in the process.In order to correct this they travel back to 1955 to retrieve the book.When they try and leave together the Delorean(driven by Doc)is struck in mid air by lightning and disappears.Moments pass when he is approached by a courier who gives Marty a 70 year old letter.It is from the Doc in 1885.Marty goes back to the 1955 Doc for help.The last Future involves the year 1885 of course.Marty and Doc in 1955 use the info in the 70 year old letter to locate and repair the Delorean.Marty returns to 1885 to retrieve the Doc,but knowing the Doc will be killed if he doesn't get to him in time.Marty manages to circumvent things but the Doc falls in love and will eventually marry and have children(there would be no future Docs without this happening!).Along with this is the problem of getting the car up to speed to return in time to 1985.The Doc determines the only solution to be to push the car up to speed via a train.This they do in a harrowing running battle with Biffs' own ancestor.As they dematerialize from 1885 to 1985 onto the rail tracks which still run on the same spot,he barely gets out before the car is demolished by a modern train.There will certainly be no more time traveling for Marty or Doc.Moments later the Doc from 1885 appears in a train hovering over the ground just to let Marty know all is well and to leave him a picture of he and his family.The film ends as we see the Doc roar back to....?Imaginative,well written and smart these films will leave you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.The plots will also sometimes leave your head spinning as you try to keep up with the changing time lines and whether it all jives or not.The supporting cast is wonderful throughout and the two main stars give excellent and unforgettable performances.As if a remastering of the films wasn't enough,they have added a fourth disc into the mix filled with special features.There is a six part documentary on the film,deleted scenes,several featurettes,the Power of Love music vid,audio commentaries with each film,a look at the Universal studio theme park BTTF ride,and more.Technically each film is in its a/r of 1:85:1 and the sound and picture have never looked better than this.If you have fond memories of the BTTF franchise,fasten your Delorean seat belts for this four DVD set.The films sparkle like never before as you re-discover this wonderful set of flicks all over again.Highly recommended."	5.0	Universal does it up right in the 25th Anniversary edition!	2011-09-17	2	0	2
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1DMYUSXX77JEW	Robert Bauer	What a great 3 dvd set to own. These films are all highly energetic, full of action and comedy, and a great thrill to watch. The special effects are nothing short of mesmerizing. All the actors especially Michael J. Fox, and Christopher LLoyd possessed a wonderful chemistry. You identify with them immediately. As far as this set goes, you can't go wrong. You get all 3 films. They are completely remastered and are in gorgeous 5.1 surround audio (dolby digital only, no DTS). All five speakers plus subwoofer get a full workout here. They all look like brand new. Not a scratch or blemish noticeable. Colors are clear and bright. I recommend widescreen over full screen on this set. In addition to all three films, you get tons of extras. Interviews with cast and crew, the making of the trilogy, bloopers and outakes, deleted scenes never seen before, commentaries, hundreds of trivia and fun facts that you can view while watching the films and many more bonuses. Plus with the new price of this set ranging from $15-$25, you just can't pass this up. I highly recommend this dvd set. Bravo Universal!!	5.0	Great Set. Great Value. Fun Fun Fun!!!!	2007-08-25	3	3	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1YSI93GVIVPPT	Robert Fernandez	Its been a long while since I've seen the Back to the Future movies, so I decided to rent all of them on VHS. Soonafter, I found out that all three films were on DVD(and in WIDESCREEN), I HAD to buy the box set. Luckily for me, I wasn't disappointed. The video quality was MUCH better that the VHS versions, and there were so much special features(Making of's, commentaries, etc.) that you could spend hours just watching them. Of course, there are a few problems with the discs, like the infamous widescreen 'glitch' on Part II and Part III. And the Q &amp; A sessions end early on the last two movies for some reason. Either than that, there are no other problems I could find. Since most everybody else explained the plot of the three BttF films, I'll spare you the same ol' same ol'.Personally, my favorite of the three films is Part III, and I'm really glad that they didn't leave the ending too open. The whole trilogy feels complete, and even though Zemeckis and Gale didn't originally plan to make a sequel to Back to the Future, it was great of them to create the last two movies in a way that they would seem like they were intentionally tied to the first film from the beginning. It's also a good thing that the quality of the sequels aren't so bad that they're unwatchable, like so many other movie sequels.	5.0	Your future is whatever you make it.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1CFU8KU32OGOC	Robert J. Jose	I'm giving this DVD boxset 4 stars instead of 5 because Universal incorrectly framed parts 2 &amp; 3. Which very few people who purchased this may already know. Just look at the message board at bttf.com. That topic is all over the place. When they framed the widescreen DVDs Universal incorrectly framed them. The jacket scene in part 2 shows Marty's jacket cut off the bottom and more unimportant stuff on the top. There are also some other stuff that got cut off the bottom during parts 2 &amp; 3 with unimportant stuff on top. Although the problem is minor and unnoticeable to most viewers but these aren't the movies the directors intended. But those who already purchased the widescreen can call an 800 number and send the DVDs back to Universal for an exchange in February. Check bttf.com's message board for details. My advice is to wait until after February 2003 when the new repressed DVDs hit the market. I want everyone to be aware of this issue. Please let me know when and where the corrected DVDs hit the market.	4.0	Widescreen edition is mis-framed but a great collection.	2002-12-20	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3N44846RKHO40	Robert J. Paulmann	"I really love this Trilogy Pack of the Film's of "" Back To The Future, 1, 2 & 3 "".  In fact, I have this Trilogy in both Formats, Regular & Blue-Ray DVD Formats; As good as the Regular one{ 1 } is, in my own Opinion, I would have to say that the Blue-Ray Version is by far 100 % Better ALL Around.  It is 100 % Better in Audio & Visual, Color & Print Quality, Everything is 100 % Clearer & Sharper; in my own Opinion, you Can't get any of this from a Regular Formatted DVD, ONLY on / with Blue-Ray, in my Own Opinion.  It is because of ALL of these Super Fantastic Improvements that I'd prefer Blue Ray OVER the Regular DVD Version / Format.All the Manufacturers need to do now is to come up with a Multi Disk Blue-Ray DVD Player that can hold up to a Maximum of Six { 6 } Blue-Ray Diskette / DVDs, and they will make the Consumer Extremely Happy; when the 1st Blue-Ray Disk is finished, the Guy / Girl WON'T Have to Continue Opening & Closing the Machine to changing the Blue-Ray Diskette; instead, all he / she has to do is Advance the Machine to the Next Blue-Ray Diskette up until ALL Six { 6 } have been Viewed / Watched / Seen, then they ONLY have to go Opening & Closing the Compartment Draw for the Blue-Ray DVD's ONLY Once instead of Several Times Over.I have a Bran New { Replacement } Multi Diskette { Six / 6 } DVD Player { Regular DVD Player,  NOT  BLUE-RAY  }and I love that Version Type 100 % Better over the Single DVD Player's; besides with a Single Diskette DVD Player, { Regular OR Blue-Ray } by continuously Opening & Closing the Compartment Draw, that will cause the DVD Player to Wear Out Alot FASTER.  But with a Multi Disk Player, there's Alot Less wear & Tear on the machine when it comes to the Opening & Closing, which means it will Last Longer; and by lasting longer, it means LESS Money being Spent to Replace that machine, which means more money in the Consumer's Pocket for Spending on things that Need to be Spent on; For EXAMPLE:  Life Insurance, Medical Insurance, Auto & OR Home Insurance, Clothes, Food, Electric Bill's, Cable & OR Telephone Bill's, Repairs & Maintenance for the Home Steed and or for a individual's Own Vehicle, Laundry & Laundry Supplies, and so on.  These are just a few of the things that people Require / Need Money for.  What are they going to do, where is the money going to come from for Paying for such things, if thy have to continue going out & buying / purchasing another Regular & OR Blue-Ray Player?  As one knows money Doesn't Grow on Tree's, and the Creditor's come around, those people better come with the money, or there going to be in BIG Trouble with the Law.  You Can't have say $500.00 to your name, take that money, Spend it on Food, and then take Exact Same $500.00 Dollars and spend it in other area's.  If you Spend that $500.00 on Grocery Shopping, and the Monthly Telephone Bill, you Can't Spend that same $500.00 on other things for the reason because you won't have it because you would have already Spent it.So in the end, in my own Opinion, I would have to say that for the money, Over the Long Hall, it's Alot Cheaper as well much better for the DVD Player to have a Multi { Six / 6 } Diskette Player instead of s Single DVD Diskett Player, in my Own Opinion."	5.0	What is that?	2010-11-27	30	3	27
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AD2OT3WAW3AX2	Robert Marzano	I just finished watching my Back to the Future Blu-ray Trilogy set (all in one sitting...lol)First off - The set is amazing!  If you like these movies, you should just buy it... Now!Now for the instructional part of this message:Several people are complaining about how difficult it is to remove the discs from the packaging.  They say that they feel like they are going to break the discs while trying to pry them out... Well, the problem is that you are getting in too much of a hurry and you are not examining the packaging.  I've bought several Blu-ray sets that have the discs stored like this.  It's probably the new thing.  It's really simple to get the discs out if you just do it properly.Instead of having the little plastic hub to snap the disc onto (which discs often fall off of during shipping and they get damaged as they slide around in the case), now you have a more secure method.  Two springy plasic pieces rest on the bottom edge of the disc, while three platic tabs (two towards the top and one centered over the bottom) hold the disc securely in place.To remove the disc, stick your finger into the hole in the center of the disc and lightly pull it towards the springy plastic pieces.  They will bend down allowing the disc to slide down and out from under the top 2 plastic tabs.  While it is in this position, you just lightly pull on the hole (that your finger is in) lifting the disc away from the case. Lift it out (carefully sliding it out from under the lower tab).To put it back in, just do the opposite.If done properly, the disc comes out quicker and safer than the old style cases.I don't know about the rest of you, but I get tired of receiving box sets and finding that one or more of the discs have popped off of the hub in the case and become horribly scratched and dinked up.  Some manufacturers have tried to fix this by making the hubs so tight that you DO almost break the disc while trying to get it free.This is a good new method of protecting the discs in box sets.	5.0	How to properly, effortlessly, safely, and quickly remove the discs from the packaging	2010-12-16	7	6	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"I am always hesitant to watch movies which I loved in my youth (boy, that makes me sound old!) - but after getting this set I was VERY pleased that I had bought them. This series still holds up and looks terrific.Content - MoviesThe movies are rightly referred to as classics. I won't bother summarizing the plot since if you are reading this you already know it and if you don't - boy you are in for a treat! All 3 movies are great, my personal favorite is the first followed closely by the third. The writing / planning was so well done that they hold up as independent movies but it all does make more sense if watched in order. I had a great time introducing these to my 6 and 8 year old kids - and they loved them as much as I did / do. Warning - there is some rough language (mostly the ""s"" word) which I had not recalled from watching these years ago.Content - ExtrasThe additional content for all 3 movies is super. There is a many-part series of well produced interviews with all surviving stars and producers / writers / makeup people, etc. Unlike the bonus materials provided with some other movies, these shows really give insight into the production and how problems were solved along the way. After watching the extras I really felt as though I had been there and had an insider's view. There are also sets of still pictures and ""archival"" materials which are prior ""making of"" type shows from years ago. It was interesting to see some of the same people in interviews separated by 2 decades describing things in almost identical words. The experiences of making these films obviously were indelibly burned into the memories of cast and crew alike - their recollections presented in the bonus materials were clearly oft-repeated stories told with fondness.Picture Quality / Sound QualityThe transfers are clean and bright. The detail is almost too good, especially in scenes in the first movie where the young actors are in ""old"" makeup. The image is so razor-sharp that the outlines of the prosthetics used on their faces stand out. I am very pleased they did not choose to use a lot of DNR (digital noise reduction) as going that direction would have been far more distracting. Sound quality is also great.Overall, I recommend this set without reservation and with much enthusiasm. I suspect these discs will be watched many, many times over the next few years in our home."	5.0	Great Scott It's a Great Set!	2011-10-13	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3E8OVRD0N61H	Rob	We all know about the trilogy.  This movie speaks by itself.  Great idea and loved the explanation of the deleted scenes and definitely a wise decision in not including the scene where they murdered Mr. Strickland.In the extra bonus very nice interviews and anecdotes.Regarding the package at the beginning was a little bit of a challenge to try to take the disc out of the case.  I thought that was a very bad idea to do that style of disc case/holder but latter I learned how to do it.  It should come with an explanation of how to take the disc out of the box without scratching the disc.Basically you have to push the disc from one corner towards the other lower corner.  If you see the box has in the bottom part a system of clips that recoils when pushing the disc.  Well, once you learn how to do it you will see that it is actually easier and better than the other traditional disc containers.	5.0	excellent product	2010-12-09	5	3	2

The 80's were so comforting to me.  It was before every movie was filmed with a handheld jerky camera and as much cursing as they could cram in.  Also, it was before the age where everyone had to have a reality show.  The picture quality is very good, but I really can't judge, because I've only watched them on network tv.  The soundtrack was very clear, especially hooked up to surround.  The only negative for me, which is not a part of the movie, is the deleted scenes.

I want to know if this is a set worth buying when I already have the original DVD set.  All I get are reviews after reviews talking about how bad the packaging is.  Are you kidding me?  Do I care about a jewel case?  How about a review on the movie and digital tranfer to blu ray.  Give me a break people!!!!!  Get a life!  That is why half the reviews on products I take with a grain of salt.  All people want to do is complain and pick on the little things.  How about a positive attitude and review the contents of this product.... not the packaging.Some people say they are returning their set hoping to send a message to the studio about the packaging.  Come on folks!I am about to buy this set of blurays.  I am thrilled they exist in the format I want to see them in.  Right now that is all I care about.  I don't care about a less than perfect package.  I wouldn't even care if there were spelling errors all over the package.  All I care about is the quality of the contents!  I hope it is worth buying... but I guess I will never find that answer here!Here is the bottom line (especially for those that say I am wrong).

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1VO4HYL62UGMK	R. Spoto	"I'll keep this brief.  BTTF is one of my favorite trilogies, and when I found out it was coming to Blu-ray, I snatched it right up.The audio and video are wonderful on this set, and I am overall very pleased with it.  The packaging isn't anything fancy, and for an anniversary edition, I expected a little bit more.  It's OK, I suppose.One of the great surprises for me was on the disc for the 3rd movie.  One of the extras is all of the line video from the Back to the Future Ride that used to be at Universal Studios (recently replaced by The Simpsons Ride).  What I mean by ""line video"" is the full video that you would see on the various monitors while you waited in line for the ride.  Beyond that, the disc actually has the full ride video as well!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A4E31BA2I8BK4	"Rubber Soul ""Justin"""	If I could I would give this many more stars than 5. This is without a doubt in my mind the best trilogy ever. It beats Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, and the old and new Star Wars.To start off, the first disc/first movie. The first Back to the Future is probably the best, but I could never choose. It starts this incredibly, imaginative trilogy through time, and gives audiences the feel for time travel. The preformaces from young Michael J. Fox is phenomanal. I couldn't picture a more perfect Marty Mcfly. The same goes for Christopher Lloyd. Who else could play Doc? The whole story for it is amazing, how Marty goes back in time and stops his parents from falling in love and he has to fix it or he won't be born.The second movie is just as good. It starts off, and immediately takes you to the future in the year 2015. You see flying cars and other very futuristic things in the future HillDale (where Marty lives). It's funny, 2015 is only 10 years away and I'm not predicting we will see a whole world full of flying cars and pizzas smaller than a CD. But the special effects were quite advanced for 1985. Crappy effects don't matter to me though.The third, which is many peoples favorite, takes place in 1885. The old west. Cowboys, saloons, duels, the whole deal. But Marty must go back to save Doc's life when he is doomed for death after a future gunfight. Probably the most action packed BTTF movie. The last 15 minutes are very interesting also.If you're the kind of person who loves special features, and behind the scene kind of things, you will love this. There is like 10 hours of that stuff!Everyone is a fan of Back to the Future. It's worth every penny.	5.0	The Best Trilogy	2005-08-06	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AWKV8OISQPT9L	Russell Glasser	"This series ranks among my all-time favorites.  It helps, I suppose, that I shared Marty McFly's experience of being a teenager in the eighties.I love the time travel mythos. Everything about it. Just reading about the history of times long past is a little thrill, and the idea of visiting them has always been interesting to me. Thinking about time travel paradoxes is enough to give most people a headache, but it's not so hard to understand as long as the author sets up a particular set of rules and sticks to them.  Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale worked hard on their rules of time travel, and it shows.The stand-out performance in this series is Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown. At first, ""Doc"" seems like the typical mad scientist stereotype who appears in many movies.  However, he is unlike the usual creepy, amoral figure we see who tinkers with nature and doesn't care about the consequences. Rather than being an insult to his profession, Lloyd captures what's best about scientists -- a deep passion for understanding and shaping the world around him, love of his fellow man and desire to help them, and an eagerness to explain his methods to anybody who will listen.  It is telling that Carl Sagan was a big fan of Back to the Future (which is one reason Zemeckis later directed ""Contact"").  It's a refreshing break from the usual cliche that knowledge is bad and no one should play God. Doc is a truly loveable character, especially to Marty, for whom he is a mentor and father figure.The movies are not without a few problems. The direction is sometimes uneven, especially when characters jump onto the screen from nowhere. Some of the recurring gags are overdone and annoying (""Mom, is that you? I had an awful nightmare...""). The second and third movies are not quite as good as the first. The second movie is much too cartoony, the performances are overblown, and a lot of the sets and costumes are absurd. The third movie is a little too slow in the middle, and it drags through the old west romance plot, until it finally picks up again in the final sequence with the gunfight and the train heist.Despite these issues, the series is excellent in many ways. It's a human drama, a nostalgic look at the past, a mind-bender about the way time travel works, and it has some great action sequences and special effects. Even without modern computer graphics, they made a lot of effects shots that still hold up well today. And of course, the second and third movies make very impressive use of split-screen shots, where two and sometimes even three copies of the same actor share screen time.It's amazing how many special features they managed to scrape together for movies that are nearly 20 years old. Each disc has THREE PAGES of menus for the special features. There's two commentaries and two twenty minute documentaries on each disc, pop-up trivia, cut scenes, bloopers, and various and sundry goodies such as music videos, makeup tests, and pages from the original script describing scenes that never made the cut. Pretty much everyone who worked on the movies gives a retrospective on them, although Christopher Lloyd is conspicuously absent.  (The two Bobs tell us, in one commentary, that he is very shy -- an amusing contrast to the character he plays.)You have to be a big fan of a movie to shell out the $40 or $50 for the entire set. But these DVDs give a lot of bang for the buck, boasting an impressive array of features that will keep you entertained for a long time. This is something fans won't want to pass up."	5.0	Been waiting a long time for this one	2003-01-02	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A11QBGBLJXC9VW	Ryan Christopher Winingnear	"The ""Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy"" is a must have for any one who is a fan of this classic trilogy. In fact, this is THE best release of the movies yet. The set boasts a clear, pristine, picture that has been restored in HD. Actually, I love this set.The Things that I like:+ The first(and well deserved) release of all three movies restored in Full HD+ Universal's U-Control Feature featuring an awesome choice between a showing a Setups and Payoffs, Storyboard Comparisons or Trivia Track to see during the movies (more on those in a minute)+ The pocketBlu feature which can be downloaded as an app to certain devices such as iPhone, iPod touch, Blackberry, and Android allowing those mobile devices to be used as an enhanced remote for certain movies. This can allow you to use the keyboard on your device as your keyboard for faster typing when needed and skipping to certain scenes automatically.+Unlike some movies, the Digital Copy discs of all three movies in this set allows you to transfer a copy of the movies to iTunes so you can add them to you iPod. Meaning that if you don't have these movies on your iPod already but would like to, you get that for free automatically.Things that could improve:+ We wish that these movie discs had the typical pop-up menus of most Blu-Rays, but unfortunately you won't find that on these discs. Press the Disc Menu here and the movie stops, taking you back to the regular menu+ U Control only allows one feature at a time. Meaning that you cant have both the trivia track and Setups and Payoffs come up automatically during the movie.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------U Controls Features:Setups and Payoffs: See how key scenes in the movies are Connected throughout the TrilogyStoryboard Comparisons: Compare key scences with the original storyboardsTrivia Track: Get neat factual information while you watch the movies---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Final Verdict....

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A19OKJ0QRPYBXY	Ryan	Do NOT buy this. The packaging is beyond moronic -- and that's putting it lightly. I had never seen packaging like this before and hope I don't again. Getting the discs out is a major headache and leaves them VERY prone to scratching or even breaking. There is no standard push button -- you need to kinda forcibly push down on them and slide them. Getting them back in is even worse. If you buy this, there's a good chance you're throwing your money down the drain as you'll likely end up with scratched or broken discs sooner or later.The movies, by all accounts, look great. But what's the point if the discs get damaged trying to watch them? They should have packaged them in one standard 6 disc case or three regular 2 disc cases (one per movie + digital copy disc).The UK version does NOT have these packaging problems.	1.0	DO NOT BUY THIS!	2010-10-26	30	17	13

Back to the Future is a true Blast!  The movie is a whimsical movie that you will expect from Spieldberg.  It is not predictable in any sense.  The movie is definately a modern blockbuster classic.  It is completely different than any other time travel movie.  It is whimsical and less scientifical and complicated like we see in most time travel films.  The acting, sound, effects, and plot are all good.  See it, I highly reccomend it.	5.0	An Awesome Movie.	2004-05-14	3	2	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A38Q2EI3LM24VT	"Ryzeldorf ""Ryzeldorf"""	Hellloooo McFly?!?!?!This Trilogy Blu-ray package is well worth every cent!From the complete movie series to the Universal Studios ride and trailers, this disc set has it all. I normally won't buy a box set but I'm very happy I bought this set. The first movie looks amazing and the picture and sound are fantastic. In my opinion the 3rd movie's picture is on par with any modern release originally recorded in HD. In short, buy this set, you won't regret it!Just one note.Note: This set is LOADED with every extra feature you can put on a Blu-ray disc. Our junk Samsung BD-D6500 has presented several issues from audio dropout to freezing picture. I don't blame the disc as our player is unreliable at best. When I would try to go back and repeat the problem, it would play fine. I can't wait for my new Panasonic to arrive on Monday!!!***Also I have had NO issues with downloading and saving the digital copies included although it has a possible expiration date of 11/30/11 on the included card.One last note- The disc holder mechanism sucks bad, but this should not reflect on the movies otherwise.	5.0	Excellent Blu-Ray Investment	2012-04-22	3	3	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3P4EFV9U2EUHO	"Sabriel Eyre ""Sabriel"""	I watched these movies as a child, and upon re-watching them as an adult, I was thrilled. They're still awesome. The movie-making in the first film is just spectacularly good- nail-bitingly intense, funny, and well put together, without being particularly violent or profane. I dig it.The second and third movies are weaker-the second in particular, but after the rock-and-roll of the first movie, you gotta follow Doc and Marty all the way from Einstein to Jules and Vern. The first movie shows you how it's done. The second two complete the story.Watch the Back to the Future Trilogy on sick days and during lazy vacation time. Watch it when work is driving you nuts. Watch it with popcorn and candy; turn out all of the lights and laugh. It's not deep. It's not particularly meaningful. It is, occasionally, trivial and slick- but it's hilarious. It's talking to you. It's for you- so dig in.	5.0	Great Scot!	2005-10-15	4	3	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A309RPK3YWYV9Y	Samuel Krikorian	You are asking yourself if these films warrant multiple viewings over years.  Will they get dull after a while? No, they wont.  Every now and then films that don't seem like they should amount to much somehow capture a bit of magic.  All three of these movies are in that category.  For starters,you combine nostalgia from the 80's with nostalgia from the 50's.  Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox have great chemistry, comic timing and the ability to sell the most absurd scenarios.  What are movies for if not to escape reality for a while?  These films let you do just that.	5.0	Don't hesitate, buy this set!	2003-09-16	1	1	0

I've seen it just about every year since 1985.  It's one of those movies with a story that's engaging but still easy to relate to.  Even after all this time, it still keeps its charm.  You love the characters: Marty, George, Doc Brown, Biff and Lorraine.  You wonder what you would do differently in Marty's shoes.  You marvel at thinking about going back in time and seeing your parents fall in love.  Along the way, there's an incredible score by Alan Silvestri that when you hear it, you know it's from Back to the Future.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A26TR137V0VI6H	S. Brooks	Let's face it: there are some blu-ray titles out there that ashamedly do not take full advantage of all that blu-ray technology has to offer, and that are little more than hyped up versions of DVD releases for which you pay more.THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM! I have seen Back To The Future (and the other parts) countless times many years ago, and have not seen it in years. Now my memory has not been affected, I do remember what the movie and the picture quality looked like. But the blu-ray TRULY brings the Back To The Future trilogy back to life -- it was as crisp and detailed like never before, and the whole experience was like seeing it in the movie theatre again for the first time!This movie, and Avatar, definitely justified the purchase of a blu-ray player. A bit exaggerated I know to say it justified the player -- but the blu-ray movie versions were wholeheartedly worth the price.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3F0HT2YG3X6CD	"Serkan Okar ""movie and music connoisseur"""	Back the Future is back on Blu Ray (this review is for the 25th anniversary Trilogy on Blu ray):Let me start by saying this is probably the best Blu Ray picture+sound quality I have seen in any 80s movie and its superior to many titles from early 90s or 2000s for that matter (I own about 100 Blu ray titles if not more and have seen plenty). It is so excellent that I think it should be considered as a measure of quality for all other productions should try to measure up to. If you didn't know anything about 80s culture, fashion or any other element that gives away the timing of the film, you could easily be convinced that it was shot just recently  (that's how crystal clear the picture is).I am not going to review all the films in the package as I am sure if you are already here considering purchasing this product, you are well aware of the movies. Back to the Future is a wonderful, fun, entertaining movie that has become a classic over the years. After 25 years, it still holds most of its power which is not easy to do for any film. The idea of a teenager travelling back in time and meeting his parents, messing up the time continuum in the process and then trying set everything straight, back to how they are supposed to be is pretty damn interesting theme (the theme evolves further with 2nd and 3rd films). Michael J. Fox is perfectly cast for the role as well as all the other actors. I love all three movies and Amazon's price is great deal (I got it for $35 when it was on special gold box deal). Even if the first movie is your favorite, I would still recommend getting all three movies for this price.They also did an excellent job with special features and bonus materials. Everything you would want to know about the original idea, the production, the casting, script, interviews, Q&As;, behind the cameras, deleted scenes, feature commentaries (multiple) and many more are included. Overall, I would give this item 10/10 on all categories, movies, picture/sound quality and special features. If you grew up in the 80s and if you are a fan, don't even think twice about buying it. If you grew up in the 80s and vaguely remember this movie, I would recommend that you buy it- you will most likely love it and it's probably better than you remember. If you did not grow up in the 80s then I recommend that you watch these movies with an open heart and I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised.	5.0	Back to the Future is back! on Blu Ray!	2011-03-20	5	5	0

Problem is that the digital copy for online watching that I thought I was purchasing as part of this package has an expiration date that has passed so the digital copy is NONEXISTANT! While this is the movie studio's problem, Amazon needs to put pressure to bear on them so that Amazon will not be charged with truth-in-advertising issues!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1N59CBWI0X54S	"Shane ""Shane"""	"(I am reviewing the films only. I hope this review is helpful.)The Back to the Future Trilogy is truly one of the best trilogies ever made. I am here for a short summary on each amazing film.Back to the Future-- Marty Mcfly(Michael J. Fox) is a typical 80's teen who doesn't have much of a life. But one night that all changes when his friend ""Doc"" Brown(Christopher Lloyd) bulids a time machine out of a Delorean. Before Doc has a chance to use it, terrorists show up and shoot him. Marty then gets in the time machine and tries to outrace them,causing him to accidently go back in time to 1955. There his dad( Crispin Glover) is geek that is constanly being picked on by Biff( Thomas F. Wilson). Soon Marty follows his dad and is almost hit by a car. It turns out that is how his mother and dad met and how his mother(Lea Thompson) fell in love with his father. But since Marty has altered that, his mom has got a crush on him. Soon, Marty locates Doc, who is 30 years younger, and tells him he needs his help. Doc doesn't believe him at first, but after getting some evidence, agrees to help. Now Marty and Doc must get Marty's parents together and get Marty back to the future.This is widely regarded as the best in the series and while I don't agree with that, it's still a awesome entry in the series and you will love it.Back to the Future, Part II-- Marty and Doc have to go to the year 2015 to save Marty's children. While he is there, Marty picks up a sports almanac and Doc tells him no bringing stuff back with them. Unfortunley, the Biff of 2015 picks up the book and while Marty and Doc aren't looking, takes the time machine back to 1955 and gives the book to the 50's Biff. When Marty and Doc return, 1985 is now completely different: schools are gone, crime is out of control, Biff is married to Marty's mother, and his father is dead. Biff is also now is a millonaire because of the book. Now, Marty and Doc must go back(once again) to 1955,get the book back, and put the future back on track.This, in my opinion, is better than the first. It has a better story, better effects, and better acting. The Deloren flying looks awesome(they explain why it flies in this and the third film) and the future scenes were amazing. Overall, all this make Part II better than I.(and yes, Doc from the 80's is still alive. Marty changed that, too. But if you want to find how, watch the first one. It explains it.)Back to the Future, Part III-- Due to the events of II, Doc is stuck in 1885(the old west)!!!! Marty goes to see the 50's Doc and shows him the letter Doc sent him from the past( it explains it all in the second)and it said that he is doing well. But soon, they discover that Doc was shot by the ancestor of Biff Tanenn and now Marty must go back in time to save him. When he gets there, he meets his ancestors, Biff's ancestor, and finds Doc. He explains that the gasoline tank was damaged, which is bad news because that is what the time machine runs on. While looking for another way to go back in time, Doc meets Clara Clayton(Mary Steenburgen) and falls in love with her. Soon, Marty finds himself in a fight with Biff's ancestor and tries to get out of it.Plus, Doc begins to have second thoughts about leaving because of Clara, which could cause promblems for Marty and Doc both. Now, Marty and Doc must defeat Biff's ancestor and get back home,even if it means leaving Clara behind.I don't think this is better than the first two, but is still a worthy conclusion to series and I'm sure you will enjoy it.I hope my review was helpful. I hope you enjoy this amazing trilogy as much as I did."	5.0	A fantastic trilogy	2004-11-03	6	5	1

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2QQHIY23PL7H3	Simon	"This is a great set that collects all three ""Back to the Future"" movies for an affordable price. Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, a slacker high school kid who gets into wacky adventures with his inventor friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The first movie is a trip to the past, where Marty meets his parents and interrupts their courtship, thereby endangering his own existence. In the second film, a trip to the future wreaks havoc on the present, and Marty must jump to the past again to set things right. The final movie has Marty travelling to the old west to rescue Doc before he's gunned down by a gang of bandits. Overall, when you watch the three movies together, there is a strong sense of character development and continuity. Lots of little details and flourishes make the time travel aspects consistent unto themselves and make the world believable. Traditionally the second and third movies haven't faired as well critically, but in hindsight all three are tremendous fun and instant classics.A lot of extras on this set, as the producers aren't afraid to dig into the movie's development, discuss time travel, and generally have a good time. There are deleted scenes, special effects featurettes, and the infamous making-of documentary that aired in the 90s. A very strong package.When Universal first released this set, there was a framing error with the second and third movies. I don't know if the disc exchange is still effective, but as of now you should be able to pick up a new copy and be confident that it's a corrected edition. Look for a 'V2' on the fine print of the second and third movie discs to be sure.Back to the Future ranks up there with the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Godfather of 'Holy Grail' trilogies.

Fox is an awesome actor, and most people don't even know he was going through a hard time while making the movies. I suggest this movie for everyone, and I'm glad it was so cheap for such a masterful movie.On a side note, here's another awesome thing. The first time i ordered the movie, it got lost in Shipping, I was a little upset at that, I wrote Amazon.com and within THREE DAYS of my email, i got an email saying they were shipping another one out, free of charge..Amazon is very Customer oriented, and they have Great Service, Thanks again to whoever did that, You made my day. :)	5.0	Masterpeice.	2005-09-19	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A39Z52KPAO8YR7	Skyclad	"Since this is a place not to review the movies, which are great, I will review this specific Bluray set. First off, despite some saying the packaging is a good thing, you just ""have to do this and pull that and pull that"" to get the discs out, it still sucks. You shouldn't have to slide or pop discs out of hard plastic tabs like that just to get them out. The biggest problem is about an hour and 40 minutes into the first movie, when Doc shows Marty the bullet proof vest, this Bluray crashes a lot of players for some reason. I thought it was a defective disc, so I exchanged the set and the second set did it too. Then I come on here and see others had the same problem too. It's not like I have a crappy Bluray player either, I have a less than year old 400 dollar Sony. This is the only Bluray I've had a problem with. The Bluray plays fine in my Sony laptop, but I can't watch the end of the movie on my regular Bluray player. The movies themselves look AMAZING, I just wish the studio would have thought the packaging through more and made sure the movies played on all players."	1.0	Great looking Bluray, if it plays on your player.	2010-12-22	6	2	4

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1T69GLK7QBSFK	SMB3BestGameEver	I have to confess that I did not grow up with this movie (I was and still am more of a video game person than a movie person, though I did watch Disney films and other films as a kid, but let's not go into detail about that) - I just saw the first Back to the Future film less than a year ago after renting it on Netflix, but I still loved every minute of it! I later got the entire trilogy on DVD for Christmas, and I can gladly say that this compilation is worth owning.I didn't see every bonus feature, but I definitely watched all three BttF movies before writing my review. I don't want to spoil any plot details, but out of all the movies in the Back to the Future trilogy, my favorite one is the first one - I also like parts 2 and 3, and they're on par with each other, in my opinion. All three movies have a good sense of humor, as well as great characters (my favorite characters are Marty McFly, Doc Brown, and Biff) and fun storylines. Oh, and the main theme composed by Alan Silvestri is absolutely phenomenal!!!!! The movies are all presented in widescreen, and look and sound excellent, they look like they just came out recently! There are a ton of bonus features too, like commentaries for all three films, the 6-part Tales from the Future documentary, and even the Back to the Future ride, to name a few. The only real complaint I can think of is that it's only a tad difficult to get the discs out. Part 3 and the bonus disc are also on top of each other inside the packaging. May not be the greatest packaging, but whatever, I recently got used to it.If you've never seen every part of the trilogy or haven't watched Back to the Future at all, or if you're a BttF fan who wants to see the many bonus features and you don't own the films anymore, this compilation is a great purchase, whether you're buying it on DVD or blu-ray.	5.0	Awesome movie compilation with lots of bonus features	2014-02-09	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2XUMWYA9DH3HS	SoCalRay	OMG, I didn't believe the other reviews that mentioned how ridiculous this case is. I figured it can't possibly be that bad. Well guess what, I pulled and pried and yanked every which way and the darn discs absolutely would not come off, even pulling at full strength! Short of completely ripping the case apart and smashing the plastic, there seemed no way to get the discs out! Let's just say there is a reason there are tons of Youtube videos instructing how to remove the discs from this absurd case. Even after watching them, it was still difficult to get it out, and once I did, I had the hardest time figuring out how to push the discs back into place! You certainly will never want a visitor or friend trying to watch this to remove the discs themselves as they will likely ruin the case and the discs trying to get them out. I am so flabbergasted at the poor design that I can't even bother commenting on the movies themselves.	2.0	Horrible case!	2011-02-21	11	7	4

Also, I know there was a lot of complains with the packaging, but I think it is fine. I was able to remove and place the discs in the case with ease. No problems whatsoever. I actually like the packaging.Overall, this collection provides loads of content, superb video and audio. The movies never looked and sounded so good.

They are still great films, but wow, it is easy to see how far films have progressed in the special effects areas when you watch a film even just a couple of decades old like these.  Plus, some of the humor was time period specific and not quite on target today.  Nonetheless, still very funny, well written, and entertaining.	4.0	Still great, but getting a little dated	2008-02-23	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1CJ2SOEBZTGG7	Special Features Specialist	(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I focus on the DVD special features)Those extras:Commentary:  PERFECT.  Bob Gale's portion covers pretty much every imaginable thing a fan would want to know.  His track with Zemeckis is good, but unfortunately it's not scene specific.  It also ends before the last ten mintues of part one, in the middle of part 2, and about 45 minutes into part 3.  Producer Canton was totally needless on the scene specific one with Gale, but so much ground is covered that you don't care.Deleted Scenes:  Treasure trove.  Parts 1 and 2 feature about six a piece, but part 3 only one, and it's quite a disturbing one.Behind the Scenes:  Very impressive.  All three original on-set featurettes are here, plus the dopey &quot;Secrets&quot; tv special hosted by MJFox clone Kirk Cameron.  Crazy to see Fox in '85 (he looks like Frankie Muniz!!).New Interviews:  Decent job.  Most of it is spent with Gale and Zemeckis, and Fox for just a bit.  This is the only real lacking thing about the tri-pack, no Lloyd, no Wilson, no Thompson, and of course no Glover.  But the stories and recollections that you get are still plenty fun.Outtakes:  Fair collection of screw-ups, though there's a particularly racist one involving Fox as a Hispanic greaser, and part 2's offerings are extremely weak.  The gut-buster for me is from part 3 involving Fox, Lloyd and a horse.Misc:  This is the most packed category actually.  On screen pop-up factoids; music videos for part 1 and 3; screenplays; Delorean designs; hoverboard tests; make-up tests; poster designs; storyboards; start to finish development of special effects shots.  The DVD box is splitting at the seams!Overall:  Masterful job after a looooong wait for us fans (DVD release date pushed back over ten times since 1997!!!), and though it's probably a bit unfair, the lack of the infamous Eric Stolz footage plays a major part in this falling short of a perfect 10.  Plus an absent Zemeckis on commentary and actors from interviews nags at you, but very small prices to pay for an awesome DVD package to rival most other films.	4.0	IT'S ABOUT..........TIME	2003-10-18	2	2	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A360XXYH9UGYBW	Spencer L. White	These movies have been my favorites since I saw BTTF 1 in the theater when I was 5. Becuse of these movies I have had a lifelong obbsetion with BTTF and the DeLorean DMC-12, but to the review:There is plenty to find on all the DVD's, and a lot of insites into how these classics were made.  The outtacks are funny and the delited senes bring some depth into what they were out to do.BTTF 1 is the best of all the movies, with the strange story of what would it be like to see your parents in High School. BTTF 2 is cool how it goes back to the first film from a diffrent angle.  And then the fun of a classic old west motif in BTTF 3, with the twist the BTTF mode of time travel.  The end of BTTF 3 is the only dissapoinment becuse of the dimise of the DeLorean, but still has a good ultmite ending as Marty is back in his own time and can make whatever he wants of his future.The extras are insitfull, even for the diehards.  The comitarys are all well done, the only problem is that they could not get Robert Zumecuse to do a sene by sene comintary, but the sene by sene comintary given by Bob Gale is very good on all three films, as well as the Q and A by the two &quot;Bob's&quot;.I can't say enough good things about these fun and well made movies, they are the best, and now the new DVD's make them even better!

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	I grew up on this Trilogy and still love every second of every film. You can't get much better than this for original storyline and characters. It takes the time travel theme and explores it in much greater depth than any previous film. Fox is superb as the various incarnations of the McFly family (with ground breaking effects for the time) and Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric inventor to perfection. The time periods in the second and third film are rendered with such detail that you really become engrossed in the film and live it along with the characters. These films aren't heavy, serious movies, but they are brilliantly directed and acted and a great slice of family fun for a Sunday afternoon or just about anytime really. The extras are excellent and really add to your understanding of the whole series and are fascinating to watch in their own right. All in all, these are great films and are highly recommended, worth every penny.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	5.0	Back to the Future	2011-03-04	2	2	0

The movie was not originally intended to have a sequel, so &quot;to be continued&quot; did not appear when it was shown in theatres.  It was added when the movie went to VHS to let people know there would be a sequel.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AVIF4YX05LCO2	"""stefanboumans"""	Well, after too much Internet gossip and anticipation, we can finally enjoy the DVD version of this great trilogy. Actually, nothing needs to be said about the story or the fantastic crew that made it happen, everybody knows it (and if not, you're a caveman amongst other cavemen...or cave-women...). The DVDs have many extras you'll enjoy and then some...Probably the most-talked about issue of this release is the product's interpretation of the soft matted original cut. If you dig deep enough in Internet sources, you'll read a mixture of positive and negative responses. Fact is, on this 1.85:1 version, you will see less picture information in height, and more in width than the 4:3 version. This movie was shot in soft-matted format, which basically means that the original prints were in a kind of '4:3' format, where in the upper and lower regions there is information that needs to be covered (the microfone syndrome...), and was not intended to be part of the screening of the film. This is done in theaters, and again with every video/ld/dvd release. This in contrast to 2.35:1 movies, or otherwise matted films and formats, in which case the widescreen format is 'directly' converted to DVD, and will give a much more complete film than the 4:3 viewing. But that's not the case here.What all this means is that with the Back To The Future DVDs, a new matting has been applied that has converted the original soft-matted material to a new 1.85:1 format. This means that, like I stated earlier, when you compare the 4:3 VHS (that everybody knows) to this release, the 4:3 has some extra film top and bottom, and this DVD has some extra film left and right. This is what the 'confusion' on the Internet is all about. Some people, rightfully, indicate that they are missing peaces of the film (Marty's sci-fi jacked is f.i. not fully displayed in the DVD whereas it was on ld and VHS), but other information is added on the DVD (the hard matted special effects sequences). Thus, some people are inclined to say that this is not the original movie version. Actually, being a soft matted presentation in theaters in the mid '80's and later, it probably differed each time it was presented, with a different projector setting each time, resulting in a different matting and screening each time. This DVD version is just another interpretation of matting. And everybody has something to say about this one!To make a long story short, please enjoy this classic and its many extra features, with or without the knowledge that in every different media format, there is a different viewing of this wonderful peace of family entertainment.	5.0	More than an American Classic	2002-11-16	251	200	51

If you haven't seen them...you should.I was impressed by the quality of the blu rays themselves.  I was fully expecting something along the lines of what Rocky looks like on Blu Ray...basically the DVD transfer on a different format.  These movies, however look AMAZING in Hi Def.  The time was taken in each one to give the viewer a truly Hi Def experience with these classic films.The only negative is the pacakging.  Why is it so difficult to make packaging that makes me scared I'm going to scratch the discs.

This movie contains ""kick butt"" extras and amazing facts straight from Universal.  They take you behind the scenes so well that it makes you want to watch it over and over and over again.  I also learned some facts I did not even notice like at the beginning there is a clock that has an old man hanging from the hands.  This signifies the ending.  Einstein's clock reads 1:21 am and the car needs 1.21 ""jigawatts"" of electricity.  Marty runs over 1 of the twin pine tree when he meets old man Pebody and this changes the name, Twin Pines Mall to Lone Pines Mall!  Also Old Man Pebody's son is named Sherman.  If you have seen Rocky and Bullwinkle than you know Mr. Pebody (a dog) and Sherman (a boy) were time travelers.  Pretty cool huh?  I also found out that in an early script the Time Machine was going to be a refrigerator but the director thought that kids might get stuck in the fridge so it did not work out.

I remember watching them mostly on VHS and TV throughout childhood. We all have those movies that give us the nostalgic feeling of home, this is definitely one of those for me, and I imagine many others. Odds are, you're not hear looking for a review of the movies themselves, you probably want to know how the quality of this Blu-ray release is. It is truly amazing. Probably mostly due to my memory of the VHS and TV versions. Even without that, it still stands strong against many other 80s Blu-ray releases. I've had several friends tell me ""it looks fake"". These people are, of course, not experienced with Blu-ray and a 120hz HDTV. It definitely looks fake, in a good way. The opening scene of the first movie totally blew me away. I was hooked. It felt like I was watching it for the first time. The colors are more saturated, the contrast pops and the blacks are deep, all that typical Blu-ray review lingo is appropriate here. If you're a fan of the movies and you enjoy awesome video quality, this is a MUST OWN!

In blu ray, high def is great for really analyzing all the detail and work that the producers put into making the backgrounds and scenes and you can even see their makeup.The packaging is standard what you would get if you were to purchase it from costco or bestbuy or something.It's weird how the disks are held in by the case's plastic. It's fairly brittle, and I already broke one of the little pieces off, so you must be a tad gentle. Everything plays very well.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ	the-gr8shag	"The third most requested DVD title, the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, finally made its DVD debut in the fall of 2002 (for the curious, ""Indiana Jones"" was number two & the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy was number one).I give the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy an overall rating of four stars (I reviewed each film seperately. check my reviews for more details) & its great to finally have them in the DVD collection, but, the DVD set is technically a mixed bag.When ""Universal"" first starting releasing their films in the DVD format, their home video division had originally slated ""Back To The Future"" as their first big DVD title release, dating all the way back to 1998, but, kept holding back the release date for unspecified reasons.The ""Back To The Future"" trilogy set is a decent release, with all three films ""remastered"" (I use the term loosely) with DVD special features on each disc for each film, including deleted scenes, documetaries on the making of each film, & trailers w/ applicable music videos (The Power Of Love & Doubleback). The audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital w/ optional commentary from writer Bob Gale.What makes owning the set is the special features. Bob Gale lends a lot of insight into the making of all three films from the outline stage all the way to how he is still amazed at the popularity of the films after all these years. The deleted scenes & outakes are what fans have been screaming for and are all here in the set (although there is no raw footage of Eric Stoltz from the original ""Back To The Future"").Since its from ""Universal"" the set is marred with a few setbacks (I don't consider the films to be remastered at all & should be THX certified in future releases. I doubt that will happen).One setback is there is some considerable grain & dirt in the first film. The other problem is the audio to the original ""Back To The Future"". The other two films are fine, but, with the first film, I found some audio noise in certain scenes. A great example is the scene near the end of the film when Marty wakes up, just back from the past, & heads into the living room to see his brother & sister sitting at the dinner table eating breakfast. I have a 700 hundred watt Yamaha Dolby Digital reciever & I could hear the background hiss so much that it was too noticable & distracting (it seems that all films that are pre-Dolby Digital era have this noise, to a certain extent). I thought it might be the disc itself, but, it was actually the film.The other problem is with the second & third films. This has to do with the notorious discovery that these films were pressed on DVD with the films presented slightly out of frame. This is piss poor studio production at its finest and continues with ""Universal"" to this day (another example is the new ""Jaws"" DVD release). I'm not to sure if the studio is still swapping the defective discs for the correct ones, but, you should inquire with the studio before any attempt is made. With ""Universal"" replacing the old defective sets with new ones its pretty much a crap shoot on which version you'll wind up with. Its been said you can tell the difference if you look on the barcode on the package back. It should say ""V2"" underneath the barcode. Don't hold your breath, though. I have still yet to see the corrected versions.The ""Back To The Future"" saga is the best time-travel trilogy in modernday film, sadly the way this DVD release has been handled ""Universal"" doesn't think so. With this set currently discontinued, I hope ""Universal"" will get the kinks out of ""Future's"" future releases. Only time will tell."	4.0	Its About Time...	2005-08-03	3	3	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1DPGJ6GFSWNDE	Throgan	"I love the first one, and always will. The other two are not by any means bad movies, but still manage to fall under the, ""sequels are always worse"" category.The first is a must see classic. The actors are wonderful (I love all the leads, especially Lloyd and Crispin Glover), the story is well done, the music is great and exciting - so it's OK that's somewhat overused - and it's one of the few movies that draw tears from me every time (for those of you who've seen it, it's George's moment). The movie is so awesome that even the fact that a lot of the time travel stuff doesn't make sense (as is usually the case with movies) doesn't phase even a logic-nut like me.I am one of two people I know who like the 2nd one better than the 3rd. I love playing around with time, so seeing them muck around with the situation was a lot of fun. Personally, I would have loved for them to split up this movie into 2 sequesl by playing around more with the future and the time continuum and whatnot, then ending it as the time machine falls into the wrong hands and they spend the rest of the trilogy fixing the past. They do a great job revisiting the first movie in many ways, and I love those parallels.****SPOILER: It's great seeing them go back to 1955, and maneuvering their way around the first movie, even though I wish they had been slightly more faithful to the original shots (for the most part they are). All the actions that characters make in the original movie are almost exactly the same, but there I would have loved even more to be able to watch the first movie and be able to believe that everything in the 2nd movie is happening at the same time. My favorite shot in the movie however is just after Doc sends Marty back to the future, and admires the fire excitedly - IDENTICAL to the original shot - then interrupted by Marty racing in from the background.*****END OF SPOILERPerhaps all that time traveling just confuses people and a western is much easier to follow, which is why people like the 3rd one more...The third movie is a lot of fun, but to me it doesn't feel like, ""Back to the Future 3"". It just feels like an episode to a TV show - you know, where the characters are the same, but the situation is different? Instead of playing with time, they're just stuck in a western movie. Again, it's fun, and after re-watching the trilogy it's fun to see some of the hints of what's to come in the 2nd movie, but other than that I wish they could have made a different movie, rather than giving in to all their desires to make a western.In all, I'm very happy with the purchase, and I've watched the trilogy at least 3 times in the last few weeks I've owned it (surprising, given that I don't have that kind of time.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1ZTSOBAPOWT3	Timotee	"""Back to the Future"" is the most clever and original movie about time travel. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) skateboards and rocks out to Huey Lewis and the News! His friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has stolen plutonium from the local Libyans to test out his time machine. After a drive-by in a van, McFly hops into the machine to escape. But, the meter has been set and he travels to 1958. He was able to see his dorky father and mother (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) and almost changed the course of time. As Calvin, he should have made like a tree and got the heck out of there! Biff was outrageous. McFly meets with Doc Brown and warns him of his future and he eventually goes back home. Everybody lives, time changed for the better and then the bell tower still blew up. Could you imagine what would happen if you went back in time to high school? I know what I would do if I went back to school. Time to give some complimentary knuckle sandwiches to people and write funnier stories for the school newspaper. Oh, back to the trilogy of time. ""Back to the Future II"" went to the future and Marty had to save his children from making some bad decisions. His mother also married Biff and everything went straight to hell. The movie may confuse people, but only real geniuses would understand what's going on. ""Back to Future III"" is the weakest of the series in my opinion. Marty McFly and Doc Brown go back to the wild wild west and play with a train. How fun... Whatever. This is one trilogy you shouldn't pass up. It's definitely a must own for all DVD collections."	5.0	The Trilogy of Our Time...	2002-10-15	5	2	3

I viewed it on a 65"" Panasonic VT60 Plasma, and it was beautiful.  Not all Blu Ray transfers of older movies fare as well.  What is also nice is the movie is 1:85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen which means you get to view it full screen - no ""watchband"" like 2:35:1 here... that is always nice.What is a bonus is that after almost 30 years, I STILL enjoy these movies.  And more importantly, so do my 13 year old boys - which says a lot about how well done these were - it is very entertaining.  I saw the original first movie in the theaters when it first came out, and I am still entertained from beginning to end.So here we have a timeless set of movies which is still entertaining today, and one where the Blu Ray transfer allows you to watch it in crystal clear HD.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A102LP48A7MCQF	tinabot	"I just watched the Back to the Future Trilogy on the 25th anniversary blu-ray release, and I hadn't cracked up that much in a long, long time.I was seven years old when the movie came out in theaters in 1985, and there are so many reasons why watching the whole triology again was so much fun.First of all, it's just such a great film series to watch. It's just as much fun today as the first day I saw it (and then proceeded to watch again and again and again). The acting is just fabulous. The story is really character driven. Even though it's got time travel and some cool effects, it's really about the character Marty, Doc Brown, and the whole gang. The actors really make the characters come to life, but also take it a step further so that they're almost caricatures but at the same time grounded, realistic, and believable. Marty is just that typical teenage kid that any American adolescent can connect with, so you just can't help but join him on his wild and crazy adventures. Doc Brown is totally that fun crazy scientist that every kid wishes was their uncle. Biff and all his incarnations is that burly and perfectly stupid bully that everyone just loves to hate. Then there's Marty's parents, so very Mom and Dad yet so vulnerable and human at the same time. The soundtrack is just so epic and perfect. I think putting this big-sound, epic-fantasy music mixed with 80's hip style really made it feel like an adventure in your own backyard.Next, it's just so awesome to see the 80s again. This film really captures the sensibilities of it's time, and I guess having been released in 1985, right in the smack middle of the 80s, really made it a marker, a touchstone of the times. I was in elementary school throughout the 80s, so I really felt just like a kid again watching it. The experience seeing it at 32 was oh-so-nostalgic of 3rd grade. I grew up with the generation of kids that sat in front of their tubes (not YouTube) watching G.I. Joe, Smurfs, Transformers, Rainbow Brite, and My Little Pony. Sure, it's fun to have seen Transformers and G.I. Joe in live action movies today (and I'm a little terrified of the Smurfs film coming up), especially when you go back to those cartoons today and think ""Wow, I had low standards back then"", but it's such a trip that a movie like Back To The Future is just as great to watch now as it was then. In fact, having become a writer and gotten to know the process of film making and how impossible it is to pull off a great film, I feel like I appreciate it so much more today as a masterpiece of entertainment and story-telling.Finally, the time-travel experience is absolutely perfected for me personally by the fact that this film was shot all in Los Angeles County. I grew up during the 80's in Whittier, CA, and the external high school scenes were shot at Whittier High School. Also, the mall parking lot where Marty blasts off into the past in the suped-up DeLorean was shot at the Puente Hills Mall, my neighborhood mall in my pre-teen and teen years. Seeing the footage of the mall when Robinsons and JCPenny were still there really took me back. And I noticed the Fudruckers that had turned into a Barnes and Nobles and marveled at the fact that that same Ross store is still there! The parking lot looked almost exactly the way it looks today. 25th anniversary indeed!It's also worth noting that in Back to the Future II, Marty, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel 30 years into the future...to 2015. It just turned 2011. That's four years from now! OMG, I cracked up so much at what they had designed the future to look like. Flying cars? Household fusion reactors? Not after 9-11 girls and boys! I can see how it was tough to predict that the biggest change would be in computers and satellite technology and that we'd be able to access the entire developed world in the palm of our hands. But yeah, I remember when I was a kid, my parents said that by the time I drove, we'd have flying cars. Better attach those hover engines to my Honda Odyssey tomorrow.After watching this trilogy again, I started to see some of the influence it had on my own story writing style. In my book, available in paperbackThe Legend of Phoenix Mountainand as an kindle ebookThe Legend of Phoenix Mountain, Kyle's kind of like Marty, pulled into a crazy adventure that changes him completely forever. Ah-gong is a little like his Doc Brown, though he's not as all over the story. I wasn't thinking of these films at all when I wrote the story, but I think the way I handled Kyle as a character does have some of Marty's reactiveness in him. Thank you Michael J. Fox. ^_^One of my greatest childhood disappointments was finding out that the hover boards didn't really exist. I really, really, really wanted one, and I when I saw the footage of the wire-work that went into creating the hover board scenes, I felt so depressed. I wanted so very much for them to be real! Gotta hand it to the special effects at the time for making me dream.I'm so grateful to the people who put these films together and made them possible. It's such a treasure trove of good feelings, good laughs, and good times. To everyone who had a hand in making the Back to the Future films, thanks guys for all the sleepless nights and hard work!

I already knew that there were going to be complaints about this set before I bought it. I only bought this set for Back to the Future Part 1. The other two parts were matted versions and not true widescreen versions. I already own the Fullscreen Laserdisc versions of Part 2 &amp; 3. The dvd versions are poorly matted with too much space above the actors heads and too much information cut off the bottom. I always try to buy fullscreen versions of movies that were filmed on Super 35( Terminator 2, The Abyss). My biggest complaint of this dvd set is that all the documentaries switch back and forth between widescreen and fullscreen. This is only a problem if you have a 16:9 tv but soon everyone will have this type of tv and Universal should have know better. Also the add on sticker that says Widescreen or Fullscreen is deceptive.	2.0	Back to the Future-Trilogy	2003-03-09	7	2	5

When Doc Brown, (Lloyd), creates a time machine out of a car, all hell breaks loose.  The two friends quickly screw up the space-time continuem, and have to repair all the damage.  They are constantly being harrassed by Biff Tannon, who wreaks havok from 1885 until 2025!  Simply the best time travel movies ever.  No movie will ever top them!	5.0	Transported Me Back To the 80s	2002-12-25	0	0	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1TQWUUZB0XLXL	Tracy	"The Back To The Future Trilogy is so much fun to watch!  All your ""How'd they do that?"" questions are answered in the Extras.  I'm amazed over and over again how the producers tied ideas together from one movie to the next.  To see my children respond with excitement just as I did the first time I saw these movies is such a joy to behold.  Michael J. Fox is the best, and Christopher Lloyd ""Doc"" makes time travel believable.  You love to hate ""Biff"" but Tom Wilson is the nicest guy in real life.  The music is a thrill every time I hear it.

He said he could have passed on the 2nd movie but the 1st and 3rd are great.  Now my kids get to see all three and we have really enjoyed watching the movies together as a family.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	Even though Robert Zemeckis was a filmmaker that Steven Spielberg liked and wanted to succeed, in the early 1980s, Zemeckis was on the verge of watching his film directing career come to a crashing end.  Zemeckis had several films under his belt, but all of them had been flops at the box office and had received mostly negative critical reviews.  In the early 1980s Zemeckis was probably best known as one of the co-writers of 1941, the only critically-panned film of Spielberg's early film career.  Things changed in 1984 with the success of ROMANCING THE STONE.  Zemeckis was being hailed and peopled wanted to know what the young filmmaker would do next.  Initiated and supported by Spielberg, Zemeckis decided to go back to a story he had written years earlier with Bob Gale and thus BACK TO THE FUTURE came to be.The idea for BACK TO THE FUTURE was spawned by Bob Gale after a visit to his hometown of University City, Missouri where he spent some time looking through his parents' high school yearbooks and wondered what it would be like to go back through time and meet his parents when they were teenagers.In the film, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an average student and aspiring musician that finds himself trying to come to find a balance between the middle-class existence he lives in and following his dreams of becoming a rock star and marrying his sweetheart Jennifer (Claudi Wells).  Besides music, Marty spends a lot of his free time helping out his good friend, the local crazy scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  Doc Brown has finally succeeded in creating a revolutionary invention and needs Marty's help.  The invention turns out to be a time machine fitted into a Delorean.  The flux capacitor, the device that causes time travel possible, needs a tremendous amount of energy and in 1985 that means it runs on plutonium.  Doc stole the plutonium from a group of Libyan terrorists who wanted him to make a nuclear bomb for them.  Unfortunately, the Libyans track Doc down and kill him.  They try to kill Marty, too, but he escapes in the Delorean and finds himself hurtling back through time to 1955.  The only person who can help him is the Doc Brown from 1955.  Marty kind of likes the era, but then he discovers that time travel is more dangerous than he ever imagined when he accidentally keeps his parents from having their first meeting.  That encounter threatens Marty's own existence and before he can get back to the future, he has to get his parents to get back together.BACK TO THE FUTURE was the highest grossing movie of 1985 and remains one of the most popular films of all time.  It's not difficult to see why.  The film has a great story and is full of great character portrayed by amazing group of actors.  Most people can strongly relate to the characters in the story and regardless of when a person grew up, we can all relate to the feelings of Marty longing to have a stronger relationship with his family and get back home or with his father George (Crispin Glover) having to go through high school dealing with a bully or with Lorraine (Lea Thompson) longing to have a strong man in her life who will protect and defend her.  Of course, there's also the whole element of time travel.  I think most people are fascinated by the idea, even if many of us would never choose to travel through time if we had the opportunity.As a time travel movie, the BACK TO THE FUTURE films stand alone.  They are some of the few movies that set up rules for time travel and follow those rules through most of the series.  There are very few films who illustrate the inherent dangers of traveling through time as well that BACK TO THE FUTURE does.BACK TO THE FUTURE is a movie that everyone should see at once in their life.  It has a broad base of appeal because it has just the right mixture of action, romance, and sci-fi.  Highly recommended.	5.0	"""My Density Has Brought Me To You."""	2007-04-24	8	7	1
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1155GP8U4TGPZ	twg	I recently bought the widescreen version from Amazon thinking I was going to get the corrected discs. They advertise in the picture the box that has the orange sticker that says lowest price ever. It was my understanding that this particular set with the orange sticker contained the updated discs. They sent me a dvd set that did not have that sticker. I opened the dvd set anyway thinking that maybe this set had the corrected discs. Disc 2 did not say ver. 2. So now I have to go through the hassle of getting the good discs. So becareful ordering these from Amazon, you may get the defective widescreen discs. If anyone is interested, Universal is still offering to send free of charge the updated widescreen discs. The phone number is 1-888-703-0010.

Although first conceived as a comedy it gets rather dark with the character of Bif becoming even more the villain in the second film.  The concept of time travel is carried fairly well as far as changing future events if we were able to go to the past and interact with ourselves and others. Thankfully the science conveyed in these films didn't get carried away with itself and left everything quite entertaining.	5.0	Back To A Classic	2014-06-01	1	1	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1VFRKBURX7F2D	Vk Pilla	Got the Blu-Ray set delivered this morning, the packaging was great and the set came in shrink wrap. I played the first part so far and the Blu-Ray conversion is good, though I felt it could have been better, I noticed it's very grainy in most of the scenes.Also the enclosed Digital copy discs did not work for me at all for the transfer (itunes on Mac OSX), iTunes asks for a redemption code for the digital download, but there is no code/insert included in the package to get the digital transfer to iTunes. This is true for all the three parts of the set. It's very disappointing to not able to get the digital copy of this to watch on my iPhone. Contacted Universal with the problem, will update the review based on their response.Update 6/13/12: I received the Digital copy transfer codes for iTunes from the UniversalHidef support team in 2 days. The codes worked and I could transfer the movies to iTunes. FYI - they don't have a toll free number. The only way to contact is via e-mail.Overall a 4 stars, one star is omitted due to the code inconvenience & grainy scenes.	4.0	Review for the Discs not the movie.	2012-06-11	5	4	1

I even checked to ensure that the issue that come people commented like the part with you not being able to see when Marty's hand when he adjust the Jacket to his size in Part II.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	Sure there have been time travel stories before but none quite like this. Suppose you could go back into the past and see your parent's yearbook in action? Suppose your mother developed a crush on you? Finally, suppose your dad was a dweeb and your mission is to somehow make him into a hero. That's what happens to Marty Mcfly (Michae J. Fox in his star making role)all within the span of a couple of days.When Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd in the past and the present)creates a time machine he does it with style; Brown refashions a Delorean sports car with his flux capacitor which allows it to travel through time. It's an ironic touch given the short life the Delorean had as an auto and the futuristic touches on the car itself (i.e., the doors that open up and away from the car like wings, etc.) Brown's plan is to travel to the future but through a terrible series of events, Brown isn't sent anywhere--instead Marty Mcfly his teenaged friend flies into the past.The film is a mixature of both timeless (the Reagan is President line still creates chuckles) and dated (Pepsi Free is long gone) comedic touches. Luckily, there's a visual reference to the soda earlier in the film that helps make the joke still work (if you can catch the brief reference). Steven Spielberg once referred to Back to the Future as the ultimate Leave it to Beave episode with a sci-fi twist.The script by long time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis is packed with visual and verbal jokes that keep you on your toes. The zany direction by Robert Zemeckis is witty and manages to bring out the best comedic side of all the actors involved. It both captures the best elements of Zemeckis broad approach to comedy (as in Used Cars) and builts on that foundation with sly wit and satire (like in Forrest Gump)Although it appears that Michael J. Fox's performance is little more than an extension of his persona, he actually does wonders with his role. He breathes life into a character that could have been a one-note shrill performance. The entire cast is compendable in roles that are a challenge. Lea Thompson manages to portray both the girlish charm of Marty's mom as a teenager and the resigned disappointment of her in middle age.The transfers are generally very good although I noticed in the first film in particular that some of the sequences are quite grainy. I'm not sure if it was the film stock, transfer or the print but it's not all that distracting unless you watch it on a big screen television. It's note a huge problem just a blip that doesn't prevent you from enjoying the film. The second and third films look a bit better and have less grain/compression problems. Perhaps it was more noticable for me because I had previously viewed the film on laserdisc.The commentary by producer/writer Bob Gale and interviews with Gale, Zemeckis, Spielberg and others are enlightening. You also have the option (like Spiderman) of allowing 150 factoids about the film to pop up throughout the feature. Watch it the first time without the facts.The second film traces Marty's attempt to undo the changes in time created by Biff. Biff in the future manages to get ahold of a book that presents baseball results from the past 50 years. He goes into the past via Doc Brown's Delorean and gives it to his younger self. The result is a sleazy future dominated by Biff. Marty and Doc Brown must undo the damage and return the future back to the way it was. The plot is a bit complex compared to the first film. Marty actually goes into the past and sees himself living the first film. He has to do so, though, without altering that visit and setting the future right again. It provides great comedic fun particularly when he does go into his own future and witnesses what happens to himself because of his short temper.In the final part of the trilogy, Marty goes into the past in search of Doc Brown to prevent his murder. Again, the anarchisms of the past/present/future provide considerable comic relief. Although it's not as sharp as the first film, the plot is streamlined compared to the convoulted second film. The third film works a bit better because the audience doesn't have to concentrate on the complex plot (as in the second film)and is already familair with the set up (put forth in the first film). It's not quite as imaginative or innovative as the first film and lacks the visual style of both the first and second. Nevertheless, it's fun and manages to both hold your interest and entertain you at the same time. A note of trivia about the second and third films. They were actually shot back to back to save money on the budget. This was the first film shot in that fashion and, although it's quite common place now to do this (Lord of the Rings for example), it was both quite daring and innovative at the time. Daring because if the second film tanked, Universe Zemeckis and Spielberg would have been stuck with another turkey.The packaging is great with a nice little booklet that includes comments from cast and filmakers.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2ASIT0JYIGHTA	William	"BTTF Parts 1,2,3 were originally released as only a 3 disc box set in Australia with about 80% of the extras available on the USA set. I held off purchasing it as I was only ever a fan of the first one.  Admittingly, the first one was available separately (and still is) in Australia but has a hefty price tag.About two months ago, they re-released BTTF Parts 1,2,3 in Australia in a brand new beautiful 4 disc box set.  This time with all the same features as before, but with an additional disc with more extras for each film. The bottom line is the Aussie edition now matches the US edition.  The decision to buy has been a no brainer now, and works out cheaper than purchasing the first one.  I still just prefer the first film, but I practically get the other two for nothing.  THe additional disc of extras, is not bad at all.  Finally we get the Huey Lewis video for ""Power of Love"" even though they have put it against Part 2's features in error.  As we all know, this song is from the first part.  Also included is the special with Kirk cameron which is very enjoyable.So looking at the three films, I think may of us agree that Part 2 and 3 failed somewhat. It's always hard to beat an original.  Part 2 was a flop somewhat back at the cinemas in 1989.  I remember when we walked out of the cinema, there were not many good responses.  AS for Part 3, it was set in western times and if this kind of setting isn't your cup of tea, then it's not going to pull you in.  It also flopped at the movies.Sit back and watch the Part 1 (skip the others). It just gets better with every viewing."	4.0	Value for money	2005-12-24	3	1	2

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"Got the BD yesterday. Surprisingly, one of the major electronics chains had only three copies, and a local grocery/department store had none. Weird.If all you want to know is whether the BD transfer is terrific, and worth the money, the answer is yes. Rush right out in a buying frenzy! For those wanting more detail, there is semi-bad news and good news. The semi-bad first.I'd hoped Zemeckis and Spielberg would have fixed the occasionally less-than-perfect special effects. For example, in part 1 when the DeLorean carries Einstein into the future, there's an obvious blue-screen ""nimbus"" around the visual blast, and Doc and Marty stand ""on top of"" the fire tracks, rather than the ground. These have /not/ been fixed, nor does it appear that /any/ of the effects in any of the three films have been updated or enhanced. What happens -- as it does in many films, not just these three -- is that some effects look worse than they did in the originals (you can now see that some of what seemed to be floor effects are actually travelling mattes), while others look better -- in particular, several of the VistaGlide * shots are far ""cleaner"" and less obvious than they were originally (eg, the scene in Marty's kitchen, and the two shots with Biff talking to himself at or in the car), to the point where they are no longer annoying.The good news is this. These are absolutely knockout transfers, roughly on a par with ""CE3K"". I've seen all these films in the theater, and on LV and DVD, and there's no comparison. As with many BD releases, it's sometimes like seeing the films for the first time.The ""Back to the Future"" films have always been ""good looking"", but the BDs show just how terrific Dean Cudney's cinematography is. These are often simply /beautiful/ films, beautiful in a way that could not be appreciated in the theater, or on SD home video. The home video version of a film can and /should/ look better than what one sees in a theater, and the ""BttF"" Blu-rays achieve this. (I felt I could see a teensy-tiny bit of edge enhancement on rare occasions -- mostly with text on signs, or bright/dark objects against dark/bright backgrounds -- but it's minor, nowhere nearly as visible as it is in ""Gladiator"" or ""Spartacus"". We also see sometimes see things we shouldn't -- the ""old-age"" makeup on the principal's and Doc's necks, which looks like dried Elmer's glue.)The supplemental material is generally excellent, with unboring ""making of"" featurettes, and the ""deleted scenes"" sequences re-done in HD. (The ""scratched"", low-contrast versions of the deleted parts are, I think, intentional corruptions intended to keep anyone from splicing them into the director-approved versions.)I was expecting to see at least one full scene with Eric Stoltz, but there are only a few silent moments. Contrary to rumor, Michael J Fox /was/ the original choice for Marty, but couldn't get away from ""Family Ties"". Because Zemeckis had to meet a tight deadline, or the whole project would be dropped, Eric Stoltz was signed. It's impossible to judge Stoltz's performance from the bits we see here, but it's obvious that he looks too mature, too intelligent, and too ""strange"" to play the naive, reactive Marty McFly. (It's also difficult to imagine there being any ""chemistry"" between Stoltz and Lloyd. **) Stoltz's dismissal appears to be a case, not of bad acting, but of inappropriate casting. Regardless, when Zemeckis asked Universal to let Stoltz go, and throw out five weeks of shooting, Universal agreed, and Michael J Fox wound up working two shifts a day, one on ""Family Ties"", the other on ""BttF"".A ""practical"" warning... The box includes six disks, three of which are digital copies. The packaging is new to me. I still haven't figure out the best way of removing the disks. Caution is advised.As for the movies themselves... ""Back to the Future"" is one of the most-entertaining and satisfying movies ever made; few ""Golden Age"" movies are of such quality. (The Errol Flynn ""Robin Hood"" comes to mind.) It's therefore remarkable that Zemeckis and Gale had the guts to make part II such a dark and disturbing film. (Steven Spielberg says as much in the supplemental material.) Most people don't like it -- and don't even ""get"" it -- so I'd like to briefly discuss what is arguably the best film of the series.An essential element of drama is /choice/ -- a character has to make a decision that will affect him and/or others. In part II, Marty decides to use time travel to get rich. The consequences of this go beyond personal disaster -- his community and family are destroyed, and other people have their lives ruined. This plays out as a perverse inversion of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", as Marty sees what his selfish choice has lead to.The plotting partly follows ""The Hero's Journey"" -- the monomyth that appears, in various forms, in many cultures. Marty has to go through figurative Hell to set things right and redeem himself, coming back a better person. The next time you watch part II, think of it as the dark middle act of a three-act play -- which it is.* I think I've figured out how VistaGlide worked. It was a computer controlled VistaVision camera with dynamically positionable matte boxes. (ZZZZZZ...)** It's worth noting that when Doc and Marty ""hug goodbye"" at the end, it's a serious, affecting moment, rather than being played for a cheap homophobic laugh. One of the pleasing things about these films is seeing the way Doc's initially coarse, self-centered personality improves."	5.0	"""You space bastard!

Although it is going to be hard to watch these films, knowing what Fox is going through with his life now, it will be nice to see these once again.I have read many reviews on this DVD collection and supposidly, it is going to be jammed pack with goodies.  Each DVD's extras is going to focus on its specific film so no need for hunting around.  The screen shots of the menus I have seen look fabulous.Lets hope the video and audio transfers will be clean.  I worry with older films like this because the film deteriorates over time.  I have not read that they are going to clean up any of the negatives so lets hope they have a clean one.For anyone that has not seen these films, it is about a boy that has a zanny scientest as a friend.  Doc, the scientest, creates a time machine, which creates many adventures for both Doc and Marty(Fox) throughout the three films.  All three of them are pretty action packed and are fun to watch for the whole family.I am going to give this trilogy a 5 star rating because after reading reviews I think this set is going to be action packed.  I am looking forward to seeing the deleted scenes and special features as well as the three films.  It is selling a good price as well.I am sending you BACK to the FUTURE......	5.0	Great Scotts...1 point 21 Gigowatz.	2002-11-01	5	4	1

Here are a few of my thoughts on each individual film...Part One (*****): A film that completely defies the word genre, containing action, adventure, romance, drama, and a heaping dose of comedy to top things off!  Enough clever/subtle sight gags to keep you intrigued after multiple viewings!Part Two (*****): Basically a two-hour extension of the first installment...and what more could BTTF fans ask for?!  Still incredibly genre-diverse, while delving even deeper into the back (and future!) stories of your favorite characters.Part Three (****): Some of the jokes begin to fall a bit flat, but still a solid ending to the trilogy.  Viewers will appreciate some deeper character-development on an emotional level that was lacking from the first two films.If you have never immersed yourself in this incredible trilogy, please do so soon...before you run out of TIME!"	5.0	Some Quick Thoughts About Each Film...	2009-12-14	2	2	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3S98L5B1SR9P1	Zack H.	"First things first.These films were filmed in ""open matte"", meaning the widescreen versions are just fullscreen with black bars on the top and bottom to create an ANAMORPHIC widescreen picture (so the videophiles won't complain about having black bars on the sides of the movies).Basically, they took the 4:3 (fullscreen) version and just put black bars on the top and bottom, thus cutting off a lot of the picture.The Fullscreen versions are the REAL versions, regardless of who says what.There's been a debate on the BTTF.com forums of which was intended (widescreen or full). Well, widescreen would be intended for the theatres, but full is what Zemeckis intended the audience to see. He admitted this himself.NOW.Reviews of the films:Back to the Future -Whether you classify this as science fiction, comedy, or fantasy, this movie could fit all three categories. In 1985, Marty McFly's good buddy, ""Doc"" Emmett Brown, has a DeLorean and is building a time machine out of it. So the two meet at a mall, which was once a pine tree farm, and test it, but when Marty is chased by Libyans, he is accidentally sent back to 1955, and this is where the movie really begins. He accidentally runs into his parents and the evil Biff and his henchmen. Instead of old man George getting run over by the car, Marty does, so Lorraine falls for her own son. But Doc sees a picture of the family and it is incomplete, so he advises Marty to get his real parents together or else he will ""disappear from existence."" When Marty gets back to 1985, he notices a dramatic change in his parents - his dad is not a nerd and his mom actually has self esteem, as do the siblings. Now if Marty himself can quit being a slacker... What stands out is the plot and what results from it, as well as some one-liners (Great scott! by Doc, and This is heavy! by Marty). To realize the full effect of this movie, you must watch the whole trilogy, even if Future II is a little repetive, while III is better than II, but not the original, of course.Back to the Future Part II -BTTFII somehow manages to remain fresh and original. Unlike most other sequels like ""Rambo: First Blood part two"", the Rocky sequels, Superman sequels, and the Batman sequels, this one remains to be as good as the first one. The story can get a little predictable at times and has a few minor plot holes if you haven't seen the last film, but it gives you a few plot twists that make it interesting. Michael J. Fox is simply hilarious in this film as well as everyone else. The special effects are great too even by today's standards. Overall, this is another great sequel for its franchise.Back to the Future Part III -The cast and crew, from the last two Back to the Future movies are back to deliver another comedic performance for the entire family. What can I say about this film? The film offers everything the last two had with loveable characters, clever plot twists, and many memorable scenes. This last one is still fairly predictable and has some plot holes if you haven't seen the last two films, but the plot twists will leave you in suspense. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are brilliant in this film, so the wild west never looked like so much fun.Overall, the Back to the Future series is a great movie trilogy for the whole family to enjoy, and I hope you'll agree too.Bonus Features:The extras include commentaries on all 3 films, deleted scenes, featurettes, outtakes, and much more behind the scenes stuff! If you own a DVD player, the Back to the Future trilogy is a must have for your DVD collection. The only minor annoyance is that they are only selling it as a set and the fact that they are trying to trick everyone into buying the cropped widescreen versions. But, the set isn't too big of a problem. Besides, you were going to get all three anyway...weren't you? :)"	5.0	The Back to the Future Trilogy	2004-10-31	4	2	2

The American packaging is a joke. This is just amazing and when I was opening it, for each item, I actually would say out loud, ""Wow! Holy Crap that's cool!"" This is a high priced Blu Ray that is worth every penny. Get it no matter how you can.One downside I will mention. The version I got must have been designed more for the Asian market because while the menu lets you choose which language to use, only a certain asian language is in 5.1. So I know its a lot of money to throw into one blu ray, but if you can, I would say buy this one for the goodies and then buy the US print for the better audio.Don't get me wrong though, the audio is still great, I have a 5.1 through HDMI and Optical and it was clear and understandable.

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A3SXVRBXA4JB8W	Zombiemonkey	If you're a kid from the 80's and 90's you grew up with these movies and need no explanation of how awesome these films are, so what I will tell you is that the packaging and price suck so if you are able to do so (have a region free DVD player)order the UK version of this set as it is cheaper and has a really cool steelbook packaging.heres the link:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Future-Part-DVD/dp/B001CP4VOS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1267407398&sr=8-1	4.0	Awesome Movies, Awful Packaging.	2010-02-28	1	1	0
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A1LEIDTHSY59DC	ZTT Fan	BEWARE if you purchase this set on Blu-ray.Universal decided to use some strange packaging that rather than use center hubs, uses little plastic clips to hold the edge of the disc in place.This means to remove the disc you kind of have to flex the entire package tray to get the disc out; if you try and grab the disc and pull, you're likely to break off the edge of your disc due to the little clips that extend over the top of the disc surface.I've no idea why Universal went with this horrible package, but if I were you if you order this, save yourself some trouble and add this to your cart as well:10 Empty Deluxe Blu-ray Replacement Cases for Blu-ray Disc Movies #BLURAYN (Blue Ray Blue-Ray Blu Ray)	3.0	Worst Blu-ray Packaging EVER!!!!	2010-10-26	16	13	3
B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A2RJPGIZA4ETHE	Zulu45	I've always been a fan of these great movies, and I'm glad to see it at a new low price.  I bought this trilogy, and am glad that I did.  It's always been one of my favorites.The DVDs are very well presented, and the quality is great.  I haven't had a chance to check out any of the special features, since I very seldom watch those, but I'm sure they're great as well.It's a shame that there are only three movies, I would've loved to see another.  Obviously, a new movie, due to Michael J. Fox medical condition.  I sure hope they find a cure for it, before it's too late, not just for Fox, but for everybody.Then, there's the widescreen issue.  I bought this before I even knew about the widescreen issue, and me being a widescreen lover, I figured that would affect me.  I got even more worried as I read that the one wrapped in plastic are the ones with this problem.  But, after reading further, I found out to find out which ones I have, to check the date modified, and to my relief, I found out that I have the corrected ones.  However, before I found out how to check, I did call the number, to find out that the're still offering replacements.  The number is 1-888-703-0010.I'm sure that all of the ones with the widescreen problem, however, are all gone.  Buy this set, you will NOT be disappointed.	5.0	Great trilogy for a great price!	2006-01-24	6	6	0

B00006AL1D	Back to the Future - The Complete Trilogy (Full Screen Edition)	A13P3AUZCXDZVG	ZZTMASTER	Absolute best trilogy ever, not only that it's on dvd and full screen to boot. This pack is soo good it will make you want to cry. I especially liked one of the dvd extras where people send it their questions about what they thought were plot errors, but you'll be supprised how well put together these movies are after reading them.	5.0	Best Series Ever	2007-03-30	3	2	1
