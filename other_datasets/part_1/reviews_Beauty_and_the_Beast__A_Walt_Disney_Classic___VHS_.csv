6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A23IU7C9VI501H	A. Brown	The movie works great the only thing I notice is that a sign of a video camera pops up in the corner for most of the movie, so maybe the movie has trouble reading? It did not affect the movie, there were no pauses or skips but I cannot understand why this icon shows up.	4.0	A Classic I am glad to own!	2009-06-12	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1VQBHHXIKHIGS	A Customer	Yep, Disney animation. All my students see this movie at some point between leaving high school and when I meet them as university students. Sometimes, their Chinese university teachers show it to them in class. So, I thought I'd see why they love it so much. I'm still wondering. This is a two-page short story, not a film. But on the bright side, if you skip all the songs it's under an hour. I've never enjoyed a singing toon in my life.	2.0	Beauty and the Beast	2006-08-27	49	0	49
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AT2J7H5TRZM8Z	A Customer	I do believe we all love Disney movies...I do not know how anyone could not. They are normally love stories (which I love), but that is not all that there is to it. These movies are animated, but don't you think that they aren't any good. I think they are some of the best movies around! Oh and yes they are created for children, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy them. In fact, I enjoy them just as much now as I did when I was young, if not more. The older ones are better though. I do not really like the ones that have come out just recently (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, etc.).Beauty and The Beast is a classic story of a &quot;beast&quot; and a beautiful woman who comes to love the beast for who he is inside, not just what he looks like on the outside...kind of like judging a book from its cover. This is something we can all learn from. When she first meets him, he is quite mean. But with time, he grows and a wonderful creature emerges from deep within. This is probably my favorite Disney movie. My favorite scene is when she is wearing that gold dress...it's just so beautiful. Everyone loves love stories; everyone loves Disney movies--so when you combine the two you get some of the best movies ever created! I would highly reccommend this movie--adults too!	5.0	My Favorite Disney Movie	2002-11-10	4	2	2

Unfortunately Disney only keeps them around 6 months or so before there back in the vault so take advantage of this offer!And I would also add that Amazon shipped me a replacement DVD after I found out my Blu-ray didn't work.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A238HO2IR6JBPA	Adriano	A masterpiece of Disney in a great presentation! He had the 2D version released in my country, Brazil, and I chose to buy the 3D version American, because it is much more complete than the released where I live. Here the 3D version has only 1 disk, with no glove box (it looks like a joke, just in bad taste). So I hope they continue to release these editions neat with audio and subtitle options in my language!	5.0	IN MY OPINION, THE BEST WORK OF DISNEY!!!	2012-11-22	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F	Ahmed	"It's definitely one of the best animated features of all time. I mean it was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar that it really deserved! An Enchanting tale, catchy songs, magnificent scenes, and a whole line of lovable timeless characters. Also one of Disney's biggest box-office hits, Beauty and the Beast is loved by both children and adults. Just like ""Snow white and the 7 dwarfs"" it deserves to be in all-time great lists and just like ""The Lion King"" it deserves to be a top 10 Box-Office Hit! Thing is this feature is even better on Imax. Imagine a 3-D (almost Monsters Inc. type) Beauty and the Beast film. The whole saga is made to fall in love with. If you don't enjoy the story, you'll enjoy the songs at least. If you hate the songs you'll love the characters- and so on! It's like the classical Disney cartoons- funny but moving. It's sad but at the same time suspenseful. Beauty and the Beast is definitely one of my all-time favourite films. Boy can the singers sing! And the OST LP? Boy-just listen to Celine Dion's serene voice in the title track! Words fail me (in the good way). It's timeless- it's a perfect masterpiece. If you loved the Lion King, you'll love this. It's a treat to watch it again on the big screen! Even with all the computerized animated features collecting big bucks at the Box-office- Beauty and the Beast stands high above all others.The story revolves around a cold-hearted prince who refuses to help a fairy disguised as an old woman. As a result the fairy turns the prince into an ugly beast lost forever in his 'magical' castle where the rose petals count the days until he finally dies unless someone can fall in love with him as a beast. Then the story starts with Belle- a sweet lovable character that loves to read and sing. The film introduces all the characters as they show Belle's father arriving at the Beast's castle for help and Belle going on a 'mission' to save her dear old daddy. This isn't a spoiler so I won't tell you the rest! In short the main question is, can Belle actually fall in love in the ruthless Beast?It's worth the purchase because it's a magnificent musical, a spectacular show, it has comedic characters, and it's overall a fantastic feature!"	5.0	An entirely captivating masterpiece!	2002-09-28	14	11	3

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2WCY11WAGBXBX	Aileen	I originally didn't want to see this movie in when it was in the theater;  I thought I was too &quot;grown up&quot; for it (I was 18 when it came out), and waited for it to come to video to see it.  I saw it at a friend's house and from the first frame, I had a tear in my eye, so I knew I was in for something good.  Boy, did I underestimate this movie.  I loved it!  It did a wonderful job of explaining what the story was all about--a prince turned into a hideous beast by an enchantress &quot;who had seen that there was no love in his heart&quot;.  The bottom line in this movie is to learn not to be tricked by appearances.  True beauty lies within.The DVD release was a real treat for me as I had worn out 2 copies of this tape!  Not only are both versions (theatrical version and the IMAX version) on the disc, but it was really cool to see it as a &quot;work-in-progress&quot;.  I also loved seeing the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video in the end.  Even though I am not a fan of either of them, I really love this song.If you have never seen a Disney movie (and I don't think that there's anyone young or old who hasn't!), don't just rent this one, BUY IT!  You'll be glad you did!	5.0	A Disney Masterpiece	2003-01-06	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2L5SWJS2SHT05	A. Johnson	My husband's aunt bought this movie for me as a Christmas present. It was shipped from somewhere in Indonesia (I think). When she finally got it (late) she tried to play it to make sure it worked and nothing happened. She had to clean it to get it to work and when it did a screen came up that gave you four or five languages to choose from. When you select English it goes to the options to play, etc. If you look at the picture on the dvd case you can see it was copied and printed (good quality print) and both copies she bought had the same UPC code. The movie plays fine but it seems like they just make copies of an original disk.	5.0	Boot legged!!!	2010-03-08	3	1	2

I absolutely LOVE this movie...always has. The colors on the DVD are fantastic and the story line is the best! The new song ""Human Again"" is very cute and catchy! One weird thing I did notice is that when the Closed Caption is on, it will say some things that the characters will not. (Ex. Belle's father asks her if she had a good time in town). I found that a little odd. I checked another DVD to see if there was something wrong with mine, but it was just the same. I'm now wondering whether the old VHS version does the same. Not that I really mind that, I'm just curious, since I'm so in love with this movie! Wonderful classic, never get bored of watching it!"	5.0	Fantastic movie!	2005-02-23	3	2	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A315R030KOP73P	Alexander Miley	"I grew up on Beauty and the Beast... I've seen it at least a half dozen times. But when I sat down and popped this into my Blu-ray player the other night, it felt like the first time. I honestly sat there and thought, ""I've never seen this movie before."" Mainly because, I never had. At times, the characters of Belle, Gaston, the Beast, and Maurice felt like real, breathing individuals. And the hand-drawn backgrounds... Oh my, my, my. Every single leaf, nuanced roof tile, and stone bridge is startlingly clear and rendered in the highest quality imaginable. The soundtrack explodes with vibrancy and rattles the walls with clanging dishes and flatware in ""Be Our Guest."" The by-now legendary ballroom sequence during the title song almost brought me to tears just from the sheer beauty of the image before my eyes! And who ever knew Belle blushed in the film?! I've never once noticed that. Buy this today! This very minute! It is the highlight of my Blu-ray collection and I cannot wait to see the stellar Lion King on Blu-ray next fall!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A26S6MNOJ27EBE	Alicja Z.	I am probably biased because this was my favorite movie from childhood, but this is still one of the best movies ever made. I have so many pleasant childhood memories associated with it. The cover looks amazing and it has many extra features although I haven't gone through any of them except for the three versions of the movie. I still like the original version the best but it is interesting to watch the other two and compare.  This should be one of childhood movies that every kid should see.Some people criticise this DVD by saying that the colors don't look as great but I haven't noticed. I guess I may not pay as much attention to details but to me the DVD is enjoyable to watch and the colors seem just fine.	4.0	Great movie!	2004-12-08	1	0	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A34KG8CVQ9THJC	ali	This movie is a must-have for any Disney fan. Origianlly released in the early 1990's, this was one of the first movies to actually use computer generated environments, although all the characters were still hand drawn. The movie captures the classic fairy tale, where the Beast must make someone fall in love with him despite his appearance.Overall, the movie is spectacular. There are 3 different versions included in this set: the Original Theatrical Release, Special Edition, and Commentary. The Special Edition version includes a couple of scenes that were originally cut from the Theatrical Release, and have since been remastered.My only complaint: I'm not sure why each version was included as a whole, instead of having the &quot;Special Edition&quot; version play the original release plus a couple of extra scenes. Same with the commentary: they could have just included the commentary as a separate audio track instead of re-recording the whole movie over again. I get the feeling that Disney included each as a separate &quot;recording&quot; (as you can see by watching the track numbers on your DVD player as you play each version) to fill up a whole disk with this somewhat short movie, and to justify having a second disk for other &quot;extras&quot;. Overall, though, the movie is worth it.	5.0	Another classic	2002-11-24	1	0	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2WLYA5Z93VAZ7	Amazon Customer	This movie had recently been released in the stores. The only thing is that they only came out with the blue ray combo pack first. Well, I dont have blue ray and didnt want to spend 30 bucks on something I wasnt going to use, at least now. I had heard that the DVD movie was going to come out soon, so I figured I would wait. Well, I missed the time frame for the special release price and well I didnt want to pay twenty bucks if I didnt have to. I decided to come on Amazon and found it for a great price! Anyone looking for movies should first look on amazon before shopping in the stores or opting to buy something that you dont need, ie blue ray.	5.0	Great Purchase. Great Price!	2011-02-26	0	0	0

Until the movie was re-released, I still popped the VHS version from my childhood into my VCR at least once a month to get that warm, fuzzy feeling that only Disney can provide.The storyline is a classic.  Who doesn't love a strong woman who stands up for her family, rejects the bully, and sees the good in someone that most of us would avoid?  The supporting characters make the movie even more lovable, and the songs will be sung for generations to come.The picture quality has obviously been improved with the new release which makes it all the more enjoyable.  As a Beauty and the Beast afficionado, I spent hours with the special features.  The deleted scene has a new song to fall in love with, and it was neat to see the alternate opening.  If you love the movie, you will really enjoy watching the special they did on the making of the film.It's a great value with great additions for a great movie!	5.0	Best Disney Movie Ever	2011-11-10	1	1	0

Plus with all these extra features they have thrown into the mix you have enough to keep you busy for hours.  Because Beauty and The Beast has become a collectors item, you will find most disk at high prices her and at ebay.  You need to be really careful who you are buying from because you could end up with a bootleg copy like i did.  Please check all seller backrounds, email the sellers with questions before purchasing and if they refuse to provide you with any answers dont trust them,and do not buy from them.

I'm typically viewed as anything but romantic, but this really hits the emotional chords I tell you.  People are always stunned to see it's one of my favorite movies, with me being a pretty macho type usually.  I must admit, it nearly bring out the tears, so give it a try on some tough guys you know!  It is perfect in every way, I could not recommend something more strongly.  It has the songs, the comedy, romance, action, drama, strong and memorable characters, you name it.  The female lead is strong too, really a great persona.  Of all the Disney heroines, my favorite one, nobody else can even come close.  The theme song is unbeatable, beautifully done by Celine Dion and some other fellow.  Her best song too, ha why not add that accolade as well.It's great for winter time, as that is when the movie takes place (in France too, nice and classy+accents if you excuse the politics--which aren't present in the movie, I didn't mean to imply that).  Well I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but if you are one of those then you are missing out big time.  See it, have your kids see it, friends, relatives, dates, and anybody else you can persuade, or coerce!  Then get the theme song and play it on repeat, and picture the smashing ballroom scene in the movie (unforgettable)!	5.0	Greatest Disney movie ever	2005-12-05	5	4	1

The music really helps move the story along. Unfortunately, for so many animated movies today, the music is more of an afterthought rather than a crucial element of the story. The characters are delightful. And, Belle is an excellent role model for young girls of a strong, intelligent, and independent woman.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A337N68GI0AMA6	Amazon Girl	"Beauty and the Beast is the story of Belle, a girl living in a small French village who dreams of adventure. She is considered strange in her town because she is always reading, and sees the handsomest man in town, Gaston, not as a dreamy potential fiance, but as the rude, conceited man he really is. Belle's father stumbles upon the enchanted castle of the Beast, which will remain under a spell until the Beast, formerly a handsome prince, learns to love, which must happen by his twenty-first birthday. Belle comes to rescue her father, and agrees to take his place as the Beast's prisoner. Although the Beast seems harsh and bad-tempered at first, Belle and the Beast learn to love each other, to the displeasure of Gaston, who finds out about Belle's friendship with the Beast, and had planned on marrying Belle himself.This is an amazing movie, definitely my favorite of all of the Disney movies, and it could be my all-time favorite movie, too. The characters are so lively and full of personality. The Beast's servants, who have been turned into objects under the spell, add a lot to the movie. The musical numbers are fantastic - the humorous ""Gaston,"" the flashy ""Be Our Guest,"" and, of course, the breathtakingly beautiful ballroom scene, where Belle and the Beast dance to ""Beauty and the Beast."" This is a great movie for people of any age, and a must-see for people who have enjoyed other Disney movies."	5.0	Disney's Best! (and possibly my all-time favorite movie)	2005-07-26	1	1	0

Unlike other Disney heroines, Belle is a true role model: a fiery, intelligent, independent woman who  falls in love because of the man's (or beast's) character not looks.  This movie is timeless and I love it as much now as a sophmore in high school as I did as a 5 year old who waltzed around in Belle's yellow dress every day for years.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ARHG5NDLV78CC	"Ana Rivera ""I have ten thousand kitties in my..."	If memory serves me right, I first saw this film in a theater back in May 1992. Although it was great I didn't officially get the video until this very DVD issue in 2004. I was ashamed of myself for not getting the original video release right away back in 1992.The film itself is an unusual one for the average fairy tale. Typically, when one hears a fairy tale like 'Snow White,' 'Cinderella,' 'Sleeping Beauty,' or 'The Little Mermaid,' all of which the Walt Disney Company turned into splendid animated blockbuster hits, he/she can expect a type of 'love-at-first-sight' consequence; they see and like each other immediately. But in this one, the meeting is so much different: Belle, the leading character, doesn't know who she'll be in love with. She just wants 'adventure in the great wide somewhere' and not to be married to Gaston, the so-called 'Don Juan' of her French village whom everyone favors over Belle. But is Belle interested in him? I don't think so! Gaston is wicked on the inside, but he'll stop at nothing to get Belle for his wife.But when Belle searches for her father, she does escape Gaston's clutches but at the same time becomes the Beast's prisoner. And at first she is afraid of the Beast, who had been a self-centered Prince once before. Eventually they get to know and love each other because the Beast wants to be 'Human Again' and have a kind heart, and Belle, with her outer and inner beauty, is the one who gives this kind of love to him and his servants. And in the end, a spiritual transformation seems to take place much similar to that in 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'It should be noted that an old peddler woman turned the bratty Prince into a Beast and his servants into objects who haven't been used for ten years because he didn't take the hag's 'inner beauty' seriously. THIS is the most important part of the whole film: 'True beauty comes from within.' That's so true: you don't hear that in a lot of films or even WITNESS it.You'll love this new version's bonuses. Not only is the song 'Human Again,' which was used in the Broadway production of B&TB;, worth noting for its cheerful melody and fabulous PIXAR-type design (it was thrown in as 'an all-new musical sequence'), but there is so much to enjoy that I can't explain it in full.My only complaint is that the Walt Disney Company seems to have this ridiculous policy of 'release something on video/DVD and then throw it into the vault after three months.' That was where this release went: into the vault. Hard to believe such a wonderful studio could do such a 'limited edition' thing to its beloved hits. They're only released once every few years. To people who'd like to see the films, they either have to search long and hard for or wait to see these films on TV, if ever at all. Later.	4.0	One of the most remarkable films ever made.	2005-01-21	3	3	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	"One word that instantly springs to mind when I think of the Disney's `Beauty and the Beast' is EPIC.  Yes, this film has stood the test of time (if 20 years can really be regarded as a serious `test') and has proven to be one of, if not THE, most beloved Disney film currently in circulation.  It was, up until last year, the only animated film to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination (`Up' finally joined the elite group, and I have a feeling `Toy Story 3' will rightfully join them this year) and it's easy to see why, for frame for frame, song for song, emotion for emotion; `Beauty and the Beast' is a notch above the rest.Not only one of the greatest animated films ever made (my money is still on `The Grave of the Fireflies' as the actual `best') but `Beauty and the Beast' has the added bonus of being one of the greatest musicals ever put to film.  Each song beautifully illuminates the films central core and adds depth and meaning and affection to every frame.I mean, there are very few films where I will stoop to singing along, and this is one of the few.The fact that this film reduces me to a gigantic ball of weepy goo is not really important, but it must be said that the emotional resonance within `Beauty and the Beast' is another reason why this particular film is such an important and substantially memorable addition to the Disney canon.  The tale told, that of a spoiled Prince banished by an enchantress to live his days as a horrid beast until he learns to love and can be loved in return, is one that sticks with the audience and really invests itself.  The layers of depth here are beautifully examined, albeit in a sing-song and rather kid friendly manor, so that even adults can walk away feeling something in their hearts (which is precisely why this garnered that Best Picture nomination).  The repartee between The Beast and Belle is actually believable and adds a layer of reality to the proceedings.  You can see the heart of the film worn on its sleeve.""Isn't this amazing!""Alas, my love for the rich animation, the boisterous musical numbers (`Be Our Guest' is one of the best Disney songs, ever), the impassioned performances (they may merely be voice actors, but the emotional relevance is there in every syllable) and the soulful understanding of the material goes unmatched, really.In my eyes, this film should have EASILY taken the Oscar that year.  Sure, `The Silence of the Lambs' was a great film, but it is no where near as beloved as moving as this classic Disney experience!"	5.0	Disney's masterpiece!	2010-12-09	2	2	0

I had the unfortunate displeasure of watching the remastered blu ray version.  All the colors of the original movie, extended version or not, looked washed out.  Normal skin color was so exaggerated that it looked pink and horrible, there was no detail at all.  All the characters looked washed out, no definition to their faces.  It was a nightmare.  My husband did not notice at first so I waited till the end of the movie and put in the dvd version, non blu ray, that is also included in the diamond edition and then he noticed.  He said ""Man, its like night and day, what a difference, its a much better picture on the regular dvd than blu ray"".  I also have the 2 dvd platinum edition bought many years ago and that also looks better than the blu ray.  the only reason this getting one star in my opinion is because it DOES include a regular dvd version (by the way the dvd version also has 3 different versions of the movie on it) with all its beautiful detail art work and correct coloration.  if it did not have the dvd I would rate the blu ray as a negative 2.  don't waste your money like I did on this edition.

Before it came out, I felt the same way about The Little Mermaid.  When BATB came out I couldn't believe that TLM could be topped, but it was, and then some.  There's no need to repeat all the other reviewers' remarks - I can only say I got into this thanks to my children, and I will be enjoying it for the rest of my life (along with a number of other Disney classics like Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp and Jungle Book).  The characterizations, voice and animated, of all the characters is beyond description.  This is the last Disney animated feature I've seen where I appreciated the computer-assisted animation (the ballroom scene is unbelievable).  I consider Disney's output to have reached its absolute climax with this film - it's been all downhill since.  You can see the difference once it became all computer-generated.	5.0	Disney's Animation Climax	2008-04-13	1	1	0

We suspected this was a bootlegged copy, so we contacted Disney.  To describe the bootleg to you: the printing looked almost professional except it had a copied look to it; the ""select angle"" button came up a lot while we were watching it, although usually at the chapter marks; the picture was very pixelated while we were watching it when there was a lot of action in the scene. After speaking to Disney, also, the underside of the disc says, ""Beauty and Beast Disc 1 D9A."" I was told by their representative that Disney doesn't print the name of the movie on the underside; rather, they print a barcode.  And we were asked to report it."	1.0	Buyer beware of bootleg!	2010-02-12	19	12	7

Blu ray & DVD combo, one of my favorite Disney films Beauty And the Beast, I already had an old DVD version of this film but the disk did not upscale very well, I don't know why it didn't upscale well, whatever but I decided to go ahead and buy the film on blu ray disk and also get a better standard DVD version also, and I saw the Three disk Diamond Edition right here on Amazon and I thought it would be a great choice to cover me and my familys love of this Disney classicThe three disk Diamond Edition includes two blu ray disk, and one standard DVD and all disk include some nice extras in particular blu ray disk one has the feature with all available version of Beauty and the Beast with audio commentary, and documentariesBlu ray disk two has a lot of extra features, and finally disk three is Beauty And The Beast in standard DVD format but still of digital quality it upscales so much better than my prevous standard DVD, and it also includes extrasWhats not to like?...um..well maybe one small thing it's not a big deal but the disk are not in widescreen as I hoped unless my blu ray settings are wrong the film disk and special feature disk seem to be in full screen only let me know if I'm not playing it right or need to adjust my blu ray settings, lol but over all just an Amazingly Sharp picture and a fun film. this blu ray set is well worth buying if your like me and prefer the best picture and sound with a side dish of extra's with your Beauty And The Beast.	5.0	Amazing picture quality and great blu ray & DVD filled with extras!	2011-12-18	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A26OR9VFY3J8CT	"Anthony Marray ""amarrayw"""	"The only animated feature to be nominated for ""Best Picture"", this film was the peak of Disney's artistic musical animations. Right after the success of ""The Little Mermaid"" Disney went ahead with ""Beauty & the Beast"" (Walt Disney wanted to do the film for years and sadly didn't live to see it realized). But today it is great to remember Disney during its artistic Renaissance (From ""The Little Mermaid to ""The Lion King""). ""Beauty and the Beast"" has not only great musical numbers, and beautiful backgrounds, but also great characters and an emotionally appealing story. While I think the only realistic character (in terms of motivation and emotion) was the Beast, I found that Belle was a well-realized heroine who in a twist saves the hero with her emotional strength and kindness. The timelessness of the story was well brought out in the title song that played during one of the most romantic scenes ever in animation. This is a film that shows the importance of looking for the beauty within. It also celebrates the life-changing effects that friendship and love can bring.

This is the official Disney product, shrink wrapped, and great quality! I'm not sure about the complaints- it does include a DVD version as well as a Blu Ray disk, so it could be that perhaps people put in the DVD thinking it was a Blu Ray- which there is a difference in quality of course.

The colors in this new one are not only much more vivid (as expected) but have been transformed into bright pink and green all over the background of the film. They even went as far as changing the color of Belle's eyes. She was one of the the few princess figures from traditional Disney who had brown hair and brown eyes, but now she has hazel eyes. It is a small thing, but part of what made the film so great was the mundane beauty of Belle. Disney transformed the original film into something aimed even more so at little girls and has reinforced the culturally false ideals that beauty cannot be mundane.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AMICVV9N2U2R4	Atli Hafsteinsson	"I'm hard pressed to think of an animated film that's as concrete and moving as Beauty and the Beast. It has such incredible magic over it. Audiences felt it, and still do. I first saw it at the age of 5. I am now 24, and Beauty and the Beast has lost none of that zest. That's a hallmark that only the best movies manage.A spoiled prince is cursed to live as a beast until he can earn the love of a girl. His chances look slim until fate brings Belle into his life. A clever girl for whom country life is but too tame and predictable, she agrees to be the Beast's prisoner if he will let her father, a prisoner in his dungeon, released. The road of the two to each other's heart is rocky to say the least, what with the Beast's temper and Belle's sometimes reckless curiosity. But rocky starts have a way of leading to good things. Unfortunately, pig-headed brute Gaston has other plans and is not hesitant to exploit Belle's father to do it.The animation in this movie is incredible. There's a sense of life and, dare I say it, realism that draws out the incredible beauty this medium can produce. The Beast is particularly amazing. Visually, Beauty and the Beast is a triumph. Take the ball room scene, with its sweeping camera shots and the chandelier, with our heroes dancing underneath on a marble floor with gigantic windows.The score, by Alan Menken, is excellent as well. Three of the songs were nominated for Oscars. One of them, the enigmatic title track, won a statue, as well as the score itself. ""Beauty and the Beast"", beautifully sung by Angela Lansbury, gives me goosebumps to this day (as indeed does the whole ballroom scene). It even works without the symbolism in the lyrics that you come to detect when you become an adult.There is a certain epic quality around Beauty and the Beast. It is a film without any notable dud elements. All you're left with after the movie ends is a sense of great appreciation for this film existing. Beauty and the Beast is a masterpiece that still thrills and charms the socks off anyone fortunate enough to discover it today, young or old. That's a rarity.Great as the movie is, the picture restoration done here is a complete joke. The colours are all washed-out and ugly. Just look at the Beast's fur; it's nowhere near the shade of brown it should be, but much lighter. It's as if someone put a filter over the whole movie and washed it out, which greatly harms the movie's visuals. For the quality of the movie and the extras, I have to detract a star from that. There's a difference between enhancement and ruining."	4.0	A Masterpice, but What is Up with the Colours?	2010-10-08	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2C27IQUH9N1Z	audrey	"Having a toddler, we didn't have the chance to see this film in a theater so we were very pleased to receive a complementary copy from Disney, and have watched the film many times in the past week. The movie a real Disney classic in the sense that it appeals to children and adults. The introduction tells the story of a selfish prince who, being uncharitable and unkind to an old woman, is turned into a beast while his castle and servants are enchanted. They can only be returned to their natural state if the prince falls in love, and is loved in return, before the last petal drops off an enchanted rose. The animation and Menken-Ashman songs are some of Disney's best. The film deserved its Oscar nomination, and you can see why it became a successful Broadway musical.You could spend days looking through all the dvd material. If you've seen the special editions of Snow White or Monsters, Inc. you'll know what to expect. There are two discs: the first contains three versions of the film -- the original theatrical release, the IMAX theater edition with the new song 'Human Again', and a fascinating ""work-in-progress"" version that alternates between pencilled, cartooned and fully animated representations. Disc Two contains many dvd extras. There are games, trivia quizzes, featurettes about the making of the film as well as the musical on Broadway, two music videos, and excellent features showing the behind-the-scenes doings of cast, voice work and art. Our favorite extras were Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game, where you answer several questions and are told which character you most resemble, and ""The Story Behind the Story"" where celebrities recount the origins of many Disney tales, including The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Jungle Book, Mulan, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty & the Beast. I really enjoy seeing the layouts and designs, and how the animations are drawn and developed. The trivia games are lots of fun, and IMHO they work better than the games requiring navigation with the remote.Packaging and foldout look very nice and, with so many options, are extremely helpful for finding the features you're interested in. We are very happy with this excellent family film and the many extra features included."	5.0	a Disney classic with tons of bells and whistles	2002-11-07	15	13	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ANGH6401L9Y0T	"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93"""	"The best of the recent (OK, relatively recent) Disney animated fairy tales. We have returned to the fully shaded, detailed art work, and only the insufferable Gaston is angular in style. This is full of the little touches that make Disney stories so fine for both children and adults, like jokes that mean one thing to the kid and quite another to the adult. Cute characters like Chip (a chipped tea cup) who are also clever and resourceful, and an enchanted prince who, when finally the spell is broken, is truly handsome.Belle is bored with her Provencal little town where nothing changes, reads books of romantic fantasies, and longs for more than ""this provincial life."" But she loves her father, an eccentric inventor who is generally thought crazy, but who actually makes things that work. While he goes off to the science fair to exhibit his latest device, Belle is pestered by the most egotistical, arrogant, idiotic muscle-head in the village: Gaston, who considers Belle the only girl in town who is worthy of his greatness. He refers to her as lucky that he has decided to make her his wife. Belle strongly disagrees.Meanwhile, Papa is set upon by wolves, his horse runs away in fear, and he seeks refuge in an isolated castle that just happens to be enchanted. The prince was turned into a beast because he was rude to a witch (let that be a warning to you all, fellahs), and his entire staff was turned into household objects. Not inanimate objects, mind you, but ones that retain their basic personalities while becoming wood and metal and porcelain. My favorite is Lumiere, the maitre d, a candelabra with a very smooth style and an illuminating personality.Belle comes looking for her father, and offers herself as a hostage in exchange for him. Lumiere, Cogsworth (a clock) and Mrs. Potts (the tea pot, of course) try to get Beast to control his temper and be nice to the girl, hoping that she will fall in love with him and break the spell. It has a time limit: a magic rose is wilting, and someone must love him before the last petal falls.Of course it all works, but exactly how it all comes about is marvelous. Look for some pretty biting social satire in the march of the villagers up to the Beast's castle to kill him. You may find yourself remembering a few lines from ""Hotel California."" I did.Yes, of course share this with your kids and grandkids. It's a lovely story, and worth watching over and over to catch further nuances."	5.0	He's a Beautiful Beast in the End	2012-05-10	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2T7I92XX8MCU7	"""bclayton12"""	One of the better Disney pictures, this captivating 1991 musical is a treat, to say the least. A classic movie that when digitally restored with an additional scene, is better than it was, fully deserving of its Best Picture nomination.A beauty who is smart and loves to read books, goes to a magnificent castle, where her clumsy, warmhearted inventor father is being held captive by a cold-hearted beast (a prince under a witch's spell) and its inanimate objects (who are actually the prince's servants under the same spell).The girl rescues her father, but must stay with the beast in return, where he hopes to find someone who will love him before a magical rose's last petals fall, otherwise he will remain a beast forever.The movie, fully deserving of its well-earned Best Picture nomination and its Oscar-winning songs, is a delightful movie with inspired vocal acting, clever songs, captivating animation, and its solid morals intact. Rarely has a Disney movie be a fully enjoyable film for kids, as well as adults.Even without its bonus scene added to the Imax version of it, it's still a captivating, witty, and beautiful movie. See it when you can, but avoid the newest movies, such as &quot;Atlantis.&quot; Those are good, but they're not the cinematic treat this memorable piece of Disney is. See the older ones, such as this one.	5.0	A Disney film that deserves it's Best Picture Nomination	2002-02-05	11	8	3

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2IAR5XDY0KT2F	Becky	Regarded by many as the greatest animated film of all time, Disney's classic &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; is a majestic and exhilarating movie experience.  It's a film so amazing, so spectacular, it received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture - an historic first for an animated feature film.This &quot;tale as old as time&quot; follows the story of Belle, a bright young woman with a vivid mind, who longs for &quot;something more than the provincial life&quot; than she experiences in her small hometown village in France.  Because of her ambition and her longing for exploration and adventure, she is misunderstood by the other townsfolk.  And also, due to her being the most beautiful girl in town, she has attracted the attention of the handsome, yet unkind, selfish, arrogant, and vain Gaston, the local hearth-throb.One day, after yet again spurning the affections of Gaston, an unusual set of circumstances finds Belle imprisoned in the castle of a (seemingly) fearsome beast.  With the help of the castle's delightful staff, a teapot named Mrs Potts, her teacup son Chip, a candelabra named Lumiere, and a clock named Cogsworth, romance blossoms between these two unlikely friends and Belle soon sees beyond the beast's ugly appearance to the gentle and kind soul that he possesses and learns the most important lesson of all - that true beauty lies within the heart and the soul and not the skin.  Indeed, that is a lesson that the viewer learns as well.Embraced, beloved, and celebrated by moviegoers worldwide when it was released theatrically in the early 1990's, &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; will enchant you, delight you, and captivate both young and old viewers alike with it's Oscar winning music (Best Score and Best Original Song), awesome animation, and a cast of the most lovable and memorable Disney characters the screen has ever seen (except of course, for those seven little men!)	5.0	True as it can be	2003-01-09	6	5	1

One of Disney's best and there's a reason it was the first animated movie nominated for Best Picture. As for the transfer, let's get right to it-It's great. I was excited by all the various rave reviews of the picture on Blu-Ray sites, but then confused when I saw some people complaining on the Amazon review page. I turned the movie on earlier and I know what they're complaining about with the ""white halos."" I found the solution for this to be actually very, very simple. Just turn down the sharpness slightly. And that's it. You lose the halos while retaining the fantastic quality & crispness of every line in the picture. As for complaints about the clarity revealing the minor animation flaws, I just don't see anyone with that complaint being an animation fanatic. Imperfection is perfection.The features are great, particularly the interactive documentary if you're interested in the behind-the-scenes of what was essentially the rise of the Disney Renaissance.So yeah, PQ & AQ are exceptional and if you have the opportunity to get this, do it!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2WDSO1DQZ7J03	behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de	In the late 1980's, the Disney animated feature came back with the  wonderful &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Beauty  and the Beast&quot;, an even better film. I think that no animated Disney  film that has been released since then is on par with this one.For many  people, animated movies are still kid movies. Disney proved that this is  false. The characters in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; are  three-dimensional (with the exception of the comic relief Lefou) and the  picture is very often immensely dramatic. The songs, which became more and  more wearing in the following pictures, fit wonderfully in &quot;Beauty and  the Beast&quot; and the images, like the enchanted castle, are  striking.I cannot think of many films of the 1990's that reach (or even  come close) to &quot;Beauty and the Beast's&quot; sense of wonder and  magic. This is truly a film that Disney will long be proud of and that has  earned the term &quot;classic&quot; that the sudio automatically aplies to  all its films.	5.0	A magical and enchanting classic with terrific music	2000-05-18	3	3	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y	Ben Adam	"Everyone has that special movie about which it is impossible to be objective. This is that movie for me. I saw it first when my son was seven and he brought it home when a schoolmate loaned it to him. It instantly became a favorite in our house. My son, my daughter, and I have a special bond that this film signifies to this day. From the moment Belle sings, ""I want much more than this provincial life,"" you know you are going to have an experience that goes beyond the ordinary, and you get one that goes beyond your wildest dreams. This film goes into superlatives that leave you breathless.It is hard to list all the summa cum laudes in this film. Disney broke new ground in this film by using a UNIX workstation for the ballroom scene that enabled a three-dimensional representation of the dance sequence, showing Belle and the Beast dancing through the ballroom under the chandelier. The movie features the voices of Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumi&egrave;re), David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), Chip (Bradley Pierce), and Wardrobe (Joanne Worley). Alan Menken's musical score is outstanding; the title song won the 1991 Best Song Oscar. The combination of a winning score, superb animation, and an unusually magical depth that the cast manages to create -- the viewer will be too spellbound while watching it to be able to say what it is that captivates so totally -- makes this film one that is not to be missed by young and old alike.The story is a traditional tale of a prince turned into a beast by a spell cast by an enchantress. The spell can be broken only if, by the end of his 21st birthday, he falls in love with someone who will also love him. An enchanted rose blooms as a symbol of the spell, and the last petal will fall at the end of the spell.The beauty is a beautiful woman, Belle, in a small French village, who is very intelligent and reads voraciously. She spends much of her time dreaming of living in the worlds she reads about in the books, any place other than the provincial village life she knows. She lives with her father, Maurice, a rather eccentric inventor, and both of them seem to be regarded as odd and unconventional types by the village residents. Gaston, a handsome but arrogant hunter, hopes to marry Belle for no other reason than to be able to say that he has married the most beautiful woman in the village; it is a matter of ego more than feeling, because he admits to no real feeling for anyone other than himself.Maurice heads out for a fair but goes astray from the path and ends up at a castle. The castle turns out to be enchanted, and the ornaments at the castle turn out to be lifelike beings who welcome him. Cogsworth, the pompous clock, Lumi&egrave;re, the romantic candlelabra, Mrs. Potts, the motherly teapot, and Chip, the boyish teacup, all welcome him. All is well until the master, the surly, growling Beast, enters the room, shouting that Maurice is not welcome and takes him prisoner. At a later time in the film, when Belle comes looking for her father, Belle begs the Beast to let her take her father's place, so she becomes the Beast's prisoner.The clash of the high-spirited Belle and the ill-tempered Beast is inevitable, for when the Beast loses his temper with Belle and frightens her, she tries to flee him. Wolves try to attack her, and the Beast comes to her rescue. Somehow the incident draws them together, and the resistance slowly causes the two to start to relate to one another. Before long, the two have become very close. The Beast allows Belle to look into his enchanted mirror, and she sees her father is quite ill. When the Beast sees how distressed Belle is, he releases her.When Belle goes back to her father, she realizes that her feelings for the Beast have changed. As she and Maurice discover, Gaston, in an attempt to intimidate Belle into marrying him, have plotted to put Maurice into an insane asylum. When Gaston discovers that Belle has developed affections for the Beast, he leads the townspeople on a lynch to destroy the Beast.As the lynch mob approaches the castle, all the objects in the castle prepare for the onslaught. Furniture, kitchen utensils, decorations, virtually every object in the castle, turn on the townspeople, and defeat them in the battle. They rejoice in their victory in the end.The only persons left in the battle are Gaston and the Beast. The Beast is so depressed because he has lost Belle that he does not resist and lets Gaston assault him. Suddenly Belle appears, and the Beast rises up against Gaston, throwing him from the castle roof. The Beast is in Belle's arms, dying, as Belle tells him that she loves him. Suddenly, in those last moments, the last petal of the rose falls and the spell is broken. The Beast is transformed into a man. The objects again become human, and the movie ends happily.Somehow at all the right moments in the film, the songs come in to give the story a push forward. Whether it is the opening song that introduces Belle and explains why she can never be content with the life in her little viilage, the song of the conceited Gaston that tells why he can think of nobody in the world except himself, the song that signals the turning point in the relationship between Belle and the Beast, or the title song itself, the music graces the film in the most miraculous way. The film went on to become a Broadway hit as well, and one of the songs from the Broadway play, ""Human Again,"" that was not in the original movie was added in later versions.Too often when the words ""entertainment for the whole family"" are used, the words mean ""boring and awful."" Many adults also think of animated films as too juvenile to be good. Such prejudices should be cast aside when viewing this film; it is pure pleasure from start to finish."	5.0	Incredibly Beautiful Film. Not to Be Missed	2005-02-18	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3EP80JWZZJBXE	Benjamin R Kneen	"When I bought Disney's Beauty and the Beast ""Special Platinum Edition"" I was expecting just that, a high quality film with added extras not contained on the original.  Instead, what I found myself with was a tampered work of art, a disgraced former masterpiece.  The entire movie looks like it has had it's color stripped from it and repainted with bargain bin paints.  No longer are there rich colors, sharp contrasts, and beautiful sceney, but now the film looks worse than it's straight to video sequel. The cover looks great, that's what the film used to look like, but the actual DVD is no where near that good looking.  Some of the animation looks like it has had some of its detail removed and when I was watching it seemed like some of the frame rate was reduced because of the sluggish movement of the characters mouths when speaking.  It is a completely different movie and I have since returned my copy and stuck with my original release.  Some of the games and extra features are interesting and entertaining, but that's really like saying a TV show was awful, but there was a funny commercial here and there.  I wish Disney would stop messing around with their work and just leave it the way we all saw it and loved it in the theaters.  Walt would have never let something like this leave the studio if he were still running it, and that's the bottom line."	1.0	A Travesty to Disney Heritage	2003-01-14	57	42	15

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1KCI2BWFWSDJV	binyan8r	In a time when CGI movies are taking over the big screens, Disney has brought back the magic of the classic animated movie. Many hailed Beauty and the Beast as the revival of the Disney animation studio when it debuted in theatres some years ago. Similar as it did for the Disney franchise in the theatres, this Special Edition is doing the same for Disney DVD collection.This long awaited release couldn't  have come at a better time. The DVD is packed with features that not only benefit the movie, but Disney in general as well. From the moment the DVD is ran on your DVD player, viewers are immediately brought back to their childhood days. The familiar Magic Kingdom wipes down in a fashion we have long become accustomed to. A commercial for Disney World was even snuck into Disc 2. While I am usually not a fan of commercials on DVDs, I found that this one in particular was appropriately included to remind us that Disney World is not just another tourist attraction, but a part of our generation.But what makes this DVD so great? Is it the option of watching 3 different versions of the movie? Is it the bountiful option of games? It is actually a culmination of these. But the one thing that will mark this DVD as the milestone DVD of Disney movies to come is that it illustrates Disney in the past, present, and future on both discs.On disc 1, viewers can watch the transformation of not only the Beast, but of the movie as well. Viewers can watch the movie in a pre-production format, the original theatrical release, and the featured Special Edition. On Disc 2, Disney goes down their familiar road of including previews for upcoming movies in addition to a wide selection of features for Beauty and the Beast. What will longed be remembered and viewed by owners of this DVD is the look back at past Disney classics such as Cinderella, the Lion King, and Pocahontas. The feature hosted by Celine Dion takes an in-depth look at the roots of Disney classics. This is a welcome treat by Disney to its customers that have been longing to own a look at history.With the Lion King hitting IMAX theatres this winter, it is interesting to see where Disney will go with their DVD lineup. Indeed, this Special Edition will long be seen as a milestone in the Disney Home DVD lineup. It brings back the magic of classic animation unmatched by its CGI counterparts. A tale as old as time, so goes the magic of Disney and its classic animation movies.	5.0	Classic Animation at its best	2002-10-08	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A141HP4LYPWMSR	Brian E. Erland	`Beauty and the Beast' `91 is yet another juggernaut of the  animated Disney classics that were released in the `90's. The list included; `Aladdin' in `92, `Pocahontas' in '95 and `Mulan' in '98. It's a close call, but this one is possibly the best of the four with 'Aladdin' featuring the madcap voice of Robin Williams a close second.`Beauty and the Beast' scores high marks in every category; storyline, character development, animation and cinematography, sound and music that says with you long after the final credits roll by. The only possible negative I can come up with about the release of this particular version is the inclusion of the song `To be Human Again.' It is rather redundant and definitely not equal to the caliber of the rest of the soundtrack. It's inclusion only serves to detract rather than enhance an otherwise perfectly done tale.	5.0	"""Tale As Old As Time, Song As Old As Rhyme"" ~ Belle And The Beast, Another Disney Classic"	2007-04-06	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A139XSJKC5X4A6	Brian Larkins	I'll admit it now, I am a sucker for Disney animated classics, and this is coming from a 26 year old male who refues to watch live musicals. Take it from me, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best movies. The story is fantastic and well told, with the plot moving along at a good pace. It is also an emotional tale of love and redemption, and it is a moving story. The songs (except for one, which I will get to in a moment) are fun and catchy, and you will find yourself humming at least one of them long after the movie is over. The only downside is the added musical number, as it is not of typical Disney quality and really does nothing for the story. You will most likely notice it immediatly. Other than that, there are no complaints with the movie.Technically, the Blu-Ray restoration is amazing. The sound is wonderful, and, as with previous Disney Blu-Ray releases, the visial transfer is stunning. It feels very much like watching for the first time.All in all, if you enjoy Disney movies, musicals, or animation in general, you will love this movie. If those things aren't your cup of tea, the movie is still well worth the price of admission.	5.0	Great Disney Classic	2011-01-05	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1BJ04DTXVHSAN	Brian W. Glenn	"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.  Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.  You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.  The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.  I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one ""Beauty and the Beast"" is worth a thousand ""Akira""s. And ""Shrek""s. And, I'm willing to bet, ""Treasure Planet""s. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - this is the real best picture of 1991."	1.0	One of my all-time favourite movies.	2009-10-01	9	0	9

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AY69ZK7G6CNYJ	"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com"""	"Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Beauty And The Beast is one of Disney's greatest animated achievements. Its massive success reinvigorated the Disney animation juggernaut which had lay dormant for decades, launching the release of smashing blockbusters such as Aladdin, The Lion King, and Finding Nemo. Taking home two Oscars for Best Music (Original Score and Original Song), the film launched a trend in Disney animation by blending musical numbers (with cartoon choreography), an aspect that would become a staple of film after film for the remainder of the decade. In short, Beauty And The Beast is a landmark production just as remarkable today as when it was first released...Following the Disney tradition of transposing well-known fairy tales from the pages of a book to the sparkle of the big screen, Beauty And The Beast follows the life of Belle (Paige O'Hara), a beautiful bookworm maiden who captivates her town's most eligible bachelor, Gaston (Richard White). Dissatisfied with life in her small French villa, Belle grows especially tired of the conceited and self-absorbed Gaston (who is unable to fathom the idea that Belle does not welcome his affections).Meanwhile, The Beast lives in solitude in a long-ago abandoned castle, having had a spell cast upon him because of his inability to love. The spell turned the handsome prince into an ugly beast, and it turned all of his servants into dinnerware, candlesticks, and other inanimate objects. When Belle's father, Maurice (Rex Everhart) makes a wrong turn, he inadvertently unites the lives of Belle and The Beast. After spending much time with Belle, the bitter and hardened Beast begins to soften. He and Belle fall in love, but Gaston and his fellow village marauders arrive at the castle walls and demand the return of Belle, threatening to kill The Beast...The highlight of Beauty And The Beast is the musical number ""Be Our Guest,"" which featured an entire dining hall filled with dancing teacups, plates, and eating utensils. The sequence forged the way for similar scenes in Aladdin (with ""A Whole New World"") and The Lion King (with ""Hakuna Matata""). Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise not only create a perfect transition from song to story, but they also manage to introduce innumerable humorous lines into musical sequences, especially with the early song bandied about by the rival for Belle's hand, Gaston.One of the top films of all-time (from any genre, not just animation), Beauty And The Beast remains one of Disney's most heralded creations. It tells the classic love story of the beast with a good heart and does so with vivid characters, a world-class musical score, and animated visual images that would make Walt proud. Critically acclaimed and extremely successful at the box office, Beauty And The Beast is a true blockbuster in the traditional sense of the word. An awe-inspiring film that launched a new generation of animated Disney masterpieces, Beauty And The Beast is the quintessential must-see film...The DVD Report"	5.0	A true Disney masterpiece!	2005-04-19	7	4	3

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ABH4G7TVI6G2T	Byron Kolln	"Just when we thought nothing could top last year's deluxe edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Disney have outdone themselves.  This sparkling new 2-disc of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been well worth the wait, and features an impressive print.The first disc features three (count 'em) three versions of the film; the original theatrical release, the new IMAX version (featuring the restored ""Human Again"" musical sequence) and the work-in-progress version that was shown to standing ovations at the New York Film Festival in 1991.The story is well-known by now; A selfish Prince has been put under a dreadful curse after angering an Enchantress disguised as an old crone.  The Enchantress changes the selfish Prince into a Beast for until he learns how to love and be loved in return .Belle (voiced by Broadway veteran Paige O'Hara) is the odd girl in her small French provincial town.  She is unwittingly being romanced by the boorish, self-absorbed Gaston (Richard White), when her father gets lost in the woods on his way to the invention fair.  Discovering that he has been held a captive by an evil Beast (Robby Benson), she offers herself in his place.  Slowly but surely, Belle and the Beast fall in love, and the enchanted objects (Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, Wardrobe and Chip) hope that the spell will soon be broken...Other stand-outs in the voice cast are Angela Lansbury (Mrs Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere) and JoAnne Worley (Wardrobe).The now-classic score by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman includes  three Oscar-nominated songs (""Belle"", ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"") as well as ""Gaston"", ""Something There"" and ""The Mob Song"".Extra features are plentiful and include making-of featurettes, extensive galleries and interviews as well as info and footage on the Broadway musical ""Beauty and the Beast"" which opened in 1994.  There are some galleries of posters and stills from the show.  However, most posters only feature later Belles's like Andrea McArdle and Toni Braxton.  I would have liked more stills of Susan Egan and Deborah Gibson.There is also the ""Break the Spell"" game which actually starts on Disc 1 but comes over onto Disc 2.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a true Disney classic that everyone should have in their collection."	5.0	Disney have outdone themselves	2002-10-30	7	5	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2B8O4VOUC1Y5B	"Carla B ""TheDomestichick"""	"I have loved this movie since it was first released. How could I not love a heroine that was so devoted to books and loves to read as much as I do? And a REAL hero is the beast, who gives her an enormous library.The music is just lovely, and in my opinion this is one of the best song set in all of the Disney musicals. I can easily see why this went to Broadway - the songs were that quality. The story is simple yet heart warming, and the value of not judging someone solely by their looks is one sorely needed in today's society. The message is a valuable one, and the love story that goes along with it has meaning as well. We see all types of love in this story - which makes it a true love story and not just a romance. There is the selfless love that Belle has for her father - taking his place. There is the parental love of her father - going back for her, and worrying for her. There is the self-love of Gaston, who loves his image above all else. It's not just that he loves himself - his image is what he wishes to protect and what drives his urge to ""win"" when he makes that final, fatal attack on the beast which results in his plummeting to his death. That strong imagery of him falling from grace physically as well as socially is appropriate. Finally, there is the true love that Belle has for the Beast - loving him for who he is and not how he looks, loving him for how he treats her and not just the castle he has. The Beast echoes that same true love when he is willing to let her go when he realizes she must be with her family, and trusting she might return. The old saying goes, ""If you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, it is meant to be. If it doesn't, it never was."" This is exemplified in the Beast's actions at that critical moment.I had loved this movie for years, and I owned the soundtrack long before I had children. I now have a four year old daughter, and this is her favorite movie. We watch it many times over, and yet I never tire of the story nor the songs. It is a timeless classic, and the Blu-Ray version brings it to life in a crisp, clear, colorful form that my entrances my daughter every time."	5.0	Fabulous Edition of Fabulous Movie	2011-01-01	3	3	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1CMJ9W4RTESD0	C. Benjamin	The movie is one of the best Walt Disney movies created in my opinion. I was very excited to purchase this movie for my 2 year old daughter, only to be disappointed. The quality of the DVD I received was awful. The DVD came in a blank sleeve not even the right movie casing (no movie casing). I paid full price for a poorly burned DVD. Also, the entire movie has captions on the bottom of the screen that are permanently there for the entire movie taking up most of the screen. I am very unsatisfied with the seller of this product.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A13TZ9JBGCTMBH	C. Fawcett	One of the best Disney movies, Beauty and the Beast (based on the fairytale of the same name) came during the golden years of the 90s where Disney could do no wrong. Along with the classic movie, you can watch the special edition (with a whole new animated song sequence thrown in almost seamlessly) or the in-progress edition which is self explanatory. My favorite extras were the character development sketches. It was amazing to see how much characters like the Beast, Gaston and LaFoo evolved from their original incarnations!	5.0	A Classic	2008-11-18	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A35Z5BLHL9CI8P	"Charlene ""divercity@interia.pl"""	"""Beauty and the Beast"" is a fanomenal film, loved by both adults and children. You may find yourself wonder how can a movie (especially an animated one) get so many positive reviews, as B&B; has. Name at least two titles this critically acclaimed! You can't think of any? No wonder, ""Beauty and The Beast"" was the first animated feature to be nominated to the Academy Award for the Best Picture. Everything about the movie is just perfect - Alan Menken's breathtaking music, the animators' solid work, stunning backgrounds and, what's the most notable, the wonderful voice actors. The leading duo Belle and the Beast, was voiced by the wonderful Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson. Thanks to Paige, Belle has the most adorable and enchanting voice of all the Disney heroines, and Robby makes the Beast a multi-dimensional character, either scary and majestic or sensitive and caring. All the side-kicks are also highly entertaining and original.What more can I say? Don't hestitate for a second and get this amazing masterpiece now.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1ZJJL01LVZQGU	ChiefSanch	"This is the second best animated motion picture ever, second only the other Disney classic, Fantasia.  This is perfect for everyone who loves romance, adventure, excitement, drama comedy and just having a good time watching a movie.The animation is beautiful, but then again, every Disney movie is.  The colors are vibrant and you just can't take your eyes off of the screen.The voices are perfect.  Close your eyes and listen to Gaston and you can't help but imagine a big hairy hunter with a bad attitude and a chest the size of a football field.  Paige O'Hara is the only person I would ever want to hear as Belle.  She has a beautiful voice, so innocent yet so daring when she needs to be.  She has the most glorious singing voice.  Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury are cast so perfectly.  I mean, I can't think of any other word but perfect for the voice casting in this movie.  I would love to go into more detail, but I can't think of anything beside perfect.  Chip is called Chip and he has a chip taken out of his cup.  How much better can you get?The music, oh, the music is glorious.  It begins with a song and you're hooked.  It is a sweeping chorus number, both great music and lyrics.  The movie is a book and each song highlights a chapter.  Robbie Benson, whew, what a voice.  ""Be Our Guest"" is a rousing crowd pleaser that'll have you tapping your toes and hitting the rewind button to listen to it again and again so you can learn the words for the next time you sing along.  Broadway staple Angela Lansbury shines when she sings ""Beauty And The Beast,"" far better than Celine Dion and that other guys version.This movie teaches you how love conquers all and that if it's worth doing for love, then it's worth doing at all.  Don't give up on your dreams, but then the Beast lets Belle leave.  But he coes it because he loves her and he knows what she has to do.  Then she comes back because she loves him and they live happily ever after.This is the best animated movie since Fantasia and every animated movie that follows is going to have a big shadow to crawl out of.  It was more than worthy of its Academy Award nomination and I'm not ashamed to say that it could have very well benn, and probably should have been, the upset winner of the year.  Alas, it wasn't.  But to no avail.  It's on Broadway and it has a glorious and long overdue deluxe edition coming out on DVD and you can take it to the bank, I'm buying this on the first day of release.Buy this movie.  Let your kids watch it.  Watch it yourself.  Watch it with your kids.  This is a classic story and is told as beautifully as ever before.  It is plain and simple the one movie that you just can't go wrong with.  Buy this movie, I give it my highest recommendation."	5.0	Can you say second best animated motion picture ever???	2002-09-24	15	11	4

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3N8RZSXKN1OR2	Chrijeff	"Having been an underappreciated bookworm and a loner-by-necessity during my own youth, I identify strongly with heroine Belle, exiled to life in a provincial French town where her inventor father struggles to create that one indispensable Thing and make his fortune, and yearning for ""so much more than they've got planned.""  And who would have thought that Robby Benson would deliver so effective a performance as the voice of the Beast?  His castle full of animated furnishings (I wish they'd given more space to his valet, a hatrack, and the master cook, a stove) is splendidly imagined and animated, and, as always, there are animals--Belle's father's big draft horse and a pack of sinister wolves.  The one disappointment this movie has for me is its ""villain""--Gaston may be arrogant, loutish, chauvinistic, and even cruel, but he doesn't seem evil enough to deserve the fate that befalls him.  Still, the movie has immense charm and definitely deserves the accolades heaped upon it when it was first released.  And like many Disney films, it has a subtle moral to offer: that even those who don't ""quite fit in"" can, with persistence, courage, and a knowledge of who they are, find the place in the world where they truly belong."	5.0	Two outcasts find each other	2003-04-09	4	3	1

But a gorgeous movie is a gorgeous movie. Before this film's release, I was convinced that nothing could hold a candle to Disney's version of ""Sleeping Beauty."" And his production team virtually abandoned fairy stories from 1960 on, concentrating on a much more slapstick, comic avenue of films. But this movie mirrors everything that was in style with his classic fairy tales-- from a musical score as sophisticated as anything on the Broadway stage, to a stunning adaptation of the book (which enhances the will and affection of the heroine 100%), to graceful, genteel, and just plain beautiful animation. I remember being in the theater and hearing the ""oohs"" at the scene of Belle and the Beast in formal dress, as they dance to the title song (seen from the wonderful chandelier crane shot). This was the moment I knew I was watching something stellar. When it received a best picture Oscar nomination, I cheered right in front of the TV."	5.0	Beauteous.	2002-08-23	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2XI1UXB1YKWCI	chrisd	Grainy picture with plenty of distortion even in slow moving and still scenes (particularly around lines and edges). Far worse than any other Disney DVD I own, but not as bad as the pitiful Land Before Time DVD transfer. I have a nice Samsung 1080p TV and a new Sony Blu-ray player which does a fine enough job upsampling DVDs, so it's not my setup that's the problem. Hard to believe Disney did such a hack job on one of the best movies they've ever made -- maybe they were already looking ahead to the future Blu-ray release? Hopefully they used better machinery for that...And no, not everyone is going to notice or care, just like not everyone would notice or care about the difference between a 128kbps MP3 and the original CD. Clearly the bulk of these reviews demonstrate that. But for those that do, heed the warning that you'll probably be disappointed in the video quality here.	2.0	Very poor DVD transfer...	2014-02-15	0	0	0

""Beginner Teacher"""	"I was eight years old when Beauty and the Beast first came out, and I must say, I prefer the old video version to this new DVD. I watched the DVD the other night while I was babysitting. There's a song in it called ""Human Again"" that wasn't in the first release. I could see why they cut it. Except for the kind of touching little scene with Belle and the Beast reading, that corny song was unnecessary. Also, I dunno if this was due to the TV or not, but the colors seemed too rich, too bright (i tried adjusting the TV, but the colors still didn't look right). I remember the colors being much softer, not so intense. The DVD version of the movie looked too much like a TV cartoon rather than feature film animation. I did like the sound, though. Unless you're a huge fan of the movie and want to see the extras included in the DVD, I suggest searching for the old release of the video (that is in good condition) in a used video store."	3.0	call me biased, but...	2002-11-03	5	3	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A82JF1PZ2W40O	Christopher Carpenter	Every time I am confronted with this film I try to resist it, and yet every time I end up falling completely under its spell. No, it is not the ne plus ultra of animated film as some insist, nor is it as good as the classic French live action version that it borrows from so liberally. For what it is, though, a sentimental, Broadway-style romantic musical comedy, it can't be beat. Good fun for the whole family, even if you don't have kids.A new musical number available on the DVD does nothing to advance the plot, but is nevertheless a charming addition to the the film. A &quot;Work In Progress&quot; version provides fascinating insight into the animation process.	5.0	Why resist? A wonderful movie.	2002-10-19	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2KGCK3Q4VARC8	Christopher Greffin	Beauty and the Beast is my personal all-time favorite animated film. It has my favorite Disney heroine ever, the independent strong willed Belle, along with the complex Beast and a host of great supporting characters, some of the best songs ever in an animated musical (or maybe in any musical period), and is wildly entertaining, enchanting, and emotionally riveting from beginning to end. It's a classic romance tale beautiful, epic, and without a major flaw I can see.Well the blu-ray transition is another homerun from Disney. It is unbelievably good. It's an enhancement which respects the original masterpiece and gives a whole new life to both previous fans and first time viewers with picture and sound quality unlike few blu-rays I have seen before. There are a lot of great extras including deleted scenes and a brand new documentary that lets you choose what path you want to take, quite unlike anything I've seen before.If you have a blu-ray player you have to get this movie. And if you don't have a blu-ray player this is perhaps the movie you buy one for. It's that good.	5.0	Blu-ray is superb.	2010-12-28	1	1	0

And even now this is a movie can watch over and over again. The new dvd version gives better sound and visual quality, especialy in comparison to it's VHS counterpart. However i do have one small complaint.When watching, if you want to watch your favorite classic version without the crappy new song 'human again' you have to go and select the original theatrical version from the main menu.It is horrible mostly when you are showing this movie to one of your younger cousins or siblings who haven't seen the mvie yet, and you want them to get the good experience, with all the songs you love. Not the okay experience with MOST of the songs you loved but that one near the end which was not nearly as good as the others.over-all, i love this movie, but just make sure to select the theatrical version from the main menu for the best experience	4.0	Loved it, but..	2008-08-01	2	1	1

I wasn't disappointed either. The classic came back to life because the picture was so amazing and the sound that much better. I also enjoyed all the special features that came with this DVD, namely being able to watch the entire DVD in French.  That was quite amusing.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	I must've been about 10 when I first saw the Lion King and I was practically floored. Those catchy-for-their-own-good songs, the animation(well, me now talking) and that wildebeast stampede. The other one is Beauty and the Beast which for the life of me I can't remember seeing when I was young yet loved every minute of it. Revisiting it now I still love it and on one hand seeing it as a landmark in Disney's catalogue but also one in a series of films that marked a brief creative comeback.Belle is a beautiful bookworm girl living in a small village. Nose deep in books while having a kooky inventor for a father, many find her odd. However, she does attract the attention of seriously full of himself Gaston, a hunter who can probably single-handedly take women back a few hundred years. Meanwhile, in a distant castle, a Beast lurks; transformed because of a spell unless he gets true love before a magical rose loses its last petal. Eventually these 2 will meet but can they fall in love?After a decidedly less than perfect 80's period, the Little Mermaid brought the House of Mouse back and showed they can still pull it off. Then came this which was extremely successful and even garnered a Best Picture nod, the only animated film to do so. Also it's one of the few it seems that seems entirely built on a love story and character development. Unlike Ariel who instantly fell in love just by looking at the guy, Belle in fact hates him then grows to love him. This focus allows the film a different atmosphere than others.The one problem, a really minor nitpick, is that the songs aren't as fantastic. Yes we have Be Our Guest or the hilarious Gaston but I'm not the biggest fan of There May Be Something...and Angela Lansbury's rendition of the title track ruins what's a great cinematic moment. I do have a particular liking for the opening track Belle though. Where the film also excels is the animation. Certain scenes aren't as eye-popping but the opening title has a beautiful background, Belle is a gorgeous design and Beast is a great animated character.Thanks to Disney, the film has been put back into the Vault so you can't find it now unless you're willing to drain your paycheck on Ebay. If you can even find it, it's definately worth a recommendation.	5.0	Tied for first for best Disney feature	2006-10-10	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A45DMDHO56OK6	Colin	1991's Beauty and the Beast, is of course, one of the greats in the history of Disney animation, thus the designation as the second in a ten-line &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; collection. However, I felt the DVD extras were not up to par with those of Snow White's, the first Platinum title. My major problem is with the &quot;West Wing&quot; interactive game area. The idea is that you must follow Chip through the West Wing, playing several games, in order to restore those in the castle to human form. The games were quite difficult to master, and I found them hard to understand. The candle game and the bouncing ball game had me stymied - the narration said when the rose blinks you can move, and yet the rose never blinked. Also I found I had to click twice to move in the candle game, something that was never stated. The bouncing ball game is hard to figure out, as the direction you are supposed to move in makes no sense. I also had trouble getting to the games - I did not know you had to click twice to actually get INTO the games menu. I feel the games would go quicker if there was some sort of instructions printed.I also have to ask why there are two versions of the same documentary on the disc? &quot;The Making of Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;A Tale as Old as Time&quot; are the same thing, one is just lengthier than the other. Oh well. It's a great documentary, however, and I thought it was a nice look at the making-of the film. The Howard Ashman memorium, as he died before the film was released, was a very nice touch.The film, however, is one of the best Disney did, and I would have been happy just to have the film on DVD, with or without any extras, so I guess it's just a moot point.	4.0	Movie good, DVD extras not so good	2003-01-06	0	0	0

The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little ""teacup"" is the cutest of the characters. The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies."	5.0	A Winner This Time For Disney	2007-09-18	4	4	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"In this Oscar season for Toy Story 3, it is well to remember that Beauty and the Beast (as is repeatedly mentioned in the extra features) was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (and it won the Golden Globe for musical/comedy).  It was well deserving!  There are no weaknesses in this movie: The songs are the best in any Disney film (and who'dve thunk, considering the two most important songs are sung by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach....), the voice acting is great, the animation is astonishing (especially for its time).  Sure there are occasional weird, off-model moments, but not nearly as in Little Mermaid (and you get the feeling they may even be deliberate, e.g. when Gaston is flexing in the pub).  Certainly, this is the best pre-Pixar Disney film for animation, and although I have a soft spot in my heart for Ariel, Mulan, Aurora, et al., Belle is clearly the greatest of the Disney Princesses - plucky, great voice, brave, and looks better in a ballroom than even Cinderella in her Fairy-Godmother-enhanced dress.  Granted, Cinderella had to stand next to Prince Charming, whereas Belle's comparison is the ""horrible, hideous Beast!""The story, in short (spoiler alert! - but as in most musicals, the plot is not really the point) - Belle's father (Maurice) seeks shelter from a wolf attack in a strange castle, inhabited by enchanted objects - Lumiere the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, etc.  The castle had been enchanted because the master of the castle, now an enormous, angry beast, was unkind and treated a disguised enchantress badly.  Belle finds Maurice in the castle, sick and dying in the dungeon, and trades her life for her father's.  Through the help of the servants (the enchanted objects), Beast and Belle learn to live together and even to enjoy each others' company.  Meanwhile, Gaston, the local narcisistic bully has decided he will do anything to marry Belle (""In town there's only she/Who is beautiful as me/So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle"").  Ultimately Gaston and the Beast do battle, and Belle's love redeems the Beast and breaks the enchantment.Thus, on the surface, this is a standard Disney adventure, good vs. evil, seen in everything before it from Snow White to The Little Mermaid.  However, there are a few key points that make this film rise above all the others.  First is the quality of the songs, and their integration in the plot.  They are catchy tunes but also efficient storytellers, especially the ""Something There"" montage that shows Beast and Belle turning from a state of mutual dislike to one of friendship.  There is also a clear redemption story parallelling the good-vs.-evil story, which is rare in Disney films (only Ratatouille, the Lion King, and Cars have such an integration of a redemption story, and of those only Lion King can compete with Beauty and the Beast for sheer emotional effectiveness).  The third key is Belle herself - she is a true hero and makes her own happy ending.  Let us compare her to the other classic Disney Princesses: Aurora is never given the opportunity for heroism and is simply rescued by Prince Philip, Cinderella suffers much but has given up to dispair when the Fairy Godmother finally appears to rescue her, Ariel selfishly and foolishly jeopardizes her own life and her father's kingdom, etc.  Snow White does bravely pull herself together and rescues herself when cast out by the Queen, but she then naively allows herself to get poisoned (and again a Prince needs to rescue her).  Only Mulan shows a degree of moral fortitude similar to Belle when she, too, saves her incapacitated father's life by taking his place (but, as pointed out in another Amazon review, who remembers any of the songs in Mulan?).So, given that you simply MUST buy this film, the question becomes Blu-ray or DVD-only?  (in these Diamond editions, the Blu-ray also comes with the DVD)  I'm not sure which of these extras are included in the DVD-only version, but the full suite of Blu-ray extras are impressive (second only to the greatest Blu-ray I've ever seen, which is Snow White).  There are many many extras detailing the making of the film (and of the spin-off Broadway musical).  Of particular interest to me is the degree to which this is actually Howard Ashman's film.  Sure, he is listed as Executive Producer, but that could mean anything.  In this case, it appears he exterted the kind of control that, say, George Lucas did in Return of the Jedi.  He even ruthlessly cut one of his own songs when it wasn't working and replaced it with ""Something More"".  The excised song - ""Human Again"" - is seamlessly re-integrated into this Blu-ray (you can watch the ""Original Theatrical Version"" or the ""Extended Version"" which includes the new song).  It's fully animated and (since it was recorded before it was cut) contains the original voice actors' singing.  There is the original 20-minute ""treatment"" that was shown to Katzenberger and the other Disney executives (which led to a change in the creative leadership of the film)  Finally, like in Snow White, several extra animated shorts from Walt Disney himself are included - two Silly Symphonies and four Laugh-o-Gram fairytales (including a 7-minute Cinderella).  Unfortunately, it is difficult to find some of these special features as they are buried under multiple menus of non-intuitive location.  Even more frustrating (indeed, almost enraging) are the Blu-ray technical issues that have plagued every Disney Blu-ray yet produced: there is no ""resume play"" feature - if you stop half-way through you can't re-start from where you stopped, you even have to watch the anti-piracy warnings again.  You cannot even fast-search through the special features!  Are you telling me that my $30 Walmart DVD player has these features but my $400 Sony-built PS3 does not?  Even my old VCR  from 1980 could fast-search....  Exactly when will Blu-ray technology manage to be able to do the same technical things that were common 30 years ago?"	5.0	Impeccable film, nifty extras, same-old iodiotic Disney Blu-ray technical issues	2011-02-13	4	3	1

Or is Disney hoping to release yet another disc in a year or two incorporating the scene into the 3D format?This is triple dipping of the worst kind.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3FXT4UPI30K7S	"Cynthia Sue Larson ""best-selling author"""	"BEAUTY & THE BEAST is truly a classic film. The story is timeless, yet relevant (recognizing love & inner beauty, and learning to love unconditionally with ""no strings attached""). The musical score is superb, and as this special edition DVD describes, it's launched an excellent Broadway musical. The characters are adorable and interesting, and the villains are despicable.  When Belle falls in love with the Beast, it's fun to see how they help each other grow -- Belle gains courage as the Beast gains compassion.This platinum edition DVD continues Disney's recent trend of including everything you could ever ask for along with the film, which in this case is truly amazing. There are three versions of the movie included on this 2 disc set; one is the original theatrical release, another is the version which was first shown at the 1991 New York Film Festival (the work-in-progress edition), and the third is the amazing special edition which includes an all-new yet perfectly integrated ""Human Again"" scene.  There are also several games and activities for children on this disc, including a really fun one in which you answer questions and are matched up with which character you are most similar to. I also loved the musical game with Chip, which is good fun even for small children (it just involves matching musical notes). Grown-ups will love the Broadway musical featurette, the video with Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson, and all kinds of great ""making of"" shorts and documentaries which are simply too numerous to mention here!I was very pleased to see a special section of seven Disney stories which describes the ""story behind the story"" of things like Cinderella and the Lion King.  I really love seeing the historical summary of these ancient tales, which also include a fresh and fun film summary of the story that children enjoy, too!I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of musicals, Disney animation movies, or children at heart. It's truly a tale as old as time, which warms the heart and brightens one's day!-- Cynthia Sue Larsonauthor of ""Karen Kimball & the Dream Weaver's Web"""	5.0	Hours of Enchanted Fun	2002-10-29	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AYTTBFL34EVAD	"D. Allen ""meeko_2003"""	Of all of the Disney films created in the past quarter century, Beauty and the Beast would have to be my favorite. The story revolves around the romance between Belle, a beautiful bookworm who was thought of as odd in her provincial French village, and a self-centered Prince-turned-Beast who could only be lifted from his spell by learning to love another and earn her love in return. Along the way, there are dozens of wonderful characters including the Beast's lovable servants-turned household objects and Belle's brutish suitor Gaston who will do anything to make her his wife. The film's score and music and both beautiful and deserving of the Academy Awards they won. The film is truly a classic, so it's surprising that it can be improved for this Special Edition DVD. Three versions of the film including the fascinating Work in Progress edition and 10th anniversary edition with a wonderful new sequence added into the film. Along with the film, the DVD also includes behind the scenes documentaries, galleries of art used in the film, alternate versions of &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; and the Transformation scenes, a couple of wonderful music videos including a new version of the title song by pop group Jump5, and a number of games among other extras. This DVD is truly a must-own for Disney fans and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.	5.0	Tale as Old As Time	2003-02-20	3	2	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2PDC6SESC021Q	Daniel	"Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney film in awhile. In my opinion Disney is the best American animators but since this movie(with the exception of the Lion King of course)there has been a wave of horrid Disney movies(such as Lilo and Stich).  But this movie is really good.  It's simply mezmorizing.  It's beautiful and has the best music in a disney film.  It's dazzling and cute, beautiful and sad.  The story of the film is: A young girl named Belle, who thinks she knows everything she wants, goes on a magical adventure.  The prologue of the movie is, a greedy prince many years ago lived in a beautiful castle.  One day an old lady knocked on her door and asked if she could stay in the castle one day for the rose.  The prince turned it down and the old lady transformed herself into a beautiful women, transformed the prince into a beast, and said ""you must love someone and earn there love back before the pedals of the rose fall off, then the spell would be broken.  Now back to Belle, Her father got lost in the woods.  Belle went to find him and she saw a castle.  When she went in there she eventually met her father and mada an exchange.  She said if she would let her father free, she would stay there, thus begins the movie.The effects are wonderful.  Especially in this remastered version.  The animation is just plain and simpley BEAUTIFUL.  The music like I said is top notch, and this new version will have a brand new sog, Human again.  But fom the mesmorizing song Tale as old as time, well that song is not only beautiful but it has meanig and values like a nother poster said. Tale as old as time it means since Adam and Eve men have ruled our society.  Song as old as rhyme Barely even Friends then somebody bendss unexpectedly: that means love needs the two to make changes.  And finally Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast.  This is a great scycological tool also.  For a couple who are facing horrible hardships.  This is one of the best Disney films."	5.0	Beauty and the Beast	2002-09-03	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2NW98J57XM2LF	Darren Ziegner	It seems that Disney loves to bring a wonderful movie out and then take it back and revamp it and bring it out again just to see if they can make it better.  Well, with Beauty and the Beast they have done just that.  When this film was first released in 1991 was a instint classic to the crowd of young and old.  Then as time expired and technology grew and DVD players arrived.  Disney decided to take Beauty and the Beast of the market and recreate it a little and re-release it.This timeless classic about a beast that lives in a castle where he has been living ever since he was cast under a spell by a old women and a young women named Annabelle who is the girl of any guy's wildest dream collide together.  Annabell runs into the forest in the late evening and is hunted down by wild dogs who try to hurt her and yet the beast comes and helps her out and takes her to his castle.  The beast who has no behavior qualities to him has help from the servants who are suffering under the same spell as the beast and were turned into different types of either china or piece of furniture.  As the story progrosses...Anabelles father finds out that she is in the castle and wants to save her.  The father knows of only one person who will help him and that is this guy who is in love with Annabelle and yet knows that she doesn't like him.  The story moves on to the point that there is a romance growing between Annabelle and the Beast and yet the Beast needs to find true love before the spell ends or else he will end up a beast for good.  Watch this funny, romantic, and cute animated movie together as a family and relive a classic over and over again. It is worth watching.Also with DVD comes comentaries and games.	5.0	Disney delivers on a timless classic....	2002-11-04	4	4	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A27FR2C67JPDRS	Daryl B	"This is my favorite Disney film and I'm so pleased to own it on dvd. Made during Disney's ""rebirth"" in the late 80's and early nineties, this film was released to both critical and popular acclaim. After receiving 6 Oscar nominations and winning for best song, the film continued to be a favorite among many. Last year, Disney re-released the film on IMAX, a visual treat and now they are giving us three editions in this edition! This dvd is filled with lots of goodies, including games, commentaries, videos as well as the special edition shown in IMAX, the original edition and the ""work in progress"" that was shown at the New York film festival before the premiere of the film. The story of Belle, a young woman who dreams of adventure in her life is beautifully animated and filled with great songs that stay with you long after you've seen the film. All the characters are lots of fun and the film pretty well embodies all you could ask in a film---romance, adventure, musical numbers, and a good villain! This is a guaranteed good time for little ones and those of us adults who love a great animated film. A great gift for a friend, a little one, or yourself! This is a great two dvd set.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1CK4J7YRAUQ53	"David Foughty ""DLF"""	"The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while ""Home Alone 2"" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.And now it's finally arrived on bluray and looks better than I remember when I first saw it everyone who loves and treasures this movie should buy this before it goes back into the vault."	5.0	Finally On Bluray!!	2010-10-18	4	3	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1Q8WW227QVM4H	"David Smith ""smithdav"""	My memory of Beauty and Beast are from several viewings of the 70 mm release at the Academy Theater on New York City.  The image of my memory was solid, luminous and almost three dimensional.  The sound had depth and an impressive frequency range.  One was immersed in the film; one was carried into Bell's world.  The Blu-Ray edition does not duplicate that experience.  However it is excellent with good color rendition and a very solid sound stage.  I compared this Blu - Ray edition side by side with the Platinum Special Edition.  I synced  two DVDs to within a few frames of each other and was able to rapidly switch back and forth between two the DVD players using an HDMI switch.  On my 53 inch Sony SXRD I found the following: the color on the Blu - Ray disk was more intense and there was some better definition in background objects compared to the Platinum Special Edition in which the colors looked pale and to a degree washed out.  Sound was also better on the Blu - Ray disk - fuller with better channel separation.  If you already have earlier editions of this film and you are not obsessed with it then the Blu - Ray disk does not add that much.  However, if you are buying this film for the first time or have a VHS version the Blu - Ray will give you a significantly improved experience compared to the earlier DVD releases.	4.0	good but not great	2010-12-11	4	4	0

While you can notice some flickering of the outlines on characters, they're never distracting to me. I feel the picture quality is really good on my 23"" 1920x1080p e-IPS monitor (Dell u2311h). I haven't bothered to compare with the DVD version, so it's possible they played with the saturation/brightness but if they did, it was for the better. I only listen to it on my headphones, so I'm limited in soundstage separation, but I can still clearly note different placements of the instruments during the musical numbers.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2FRKEXDXDN1KI	Dennis A. Amith (kndy)	"The story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was born as a fairy tale back in the 1740's by Madame Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and then revised in 1757 by French novelist Jeanne Marie Le Prince de Beaumont received its animated adaptation courtesy of Walt Disney  in 1991.The film is directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (both worked on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"") and the screenplay adaptation by Linda Woolverton (""The Lion King"", ""Mulan"" , ""Arctic Tale"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"").""Beauty and the Beast"" is the 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics line and is considered one of the greatest Disney animated films of all time.  The film was an amazing success as the film which cost $25 million to make had made over $377 million dollars worldwide and the film was also the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture (note: The second was 2009's ""Up"") and was successful in blending traditional animation with CG.And now the popular animated film receives its first release on Disney Blu-ray and receives a ""Diamond Edition"" release.  In this release, we get more special features than its previous 2002 DVD release but also three different versions of the film which includes a special extended edition, the original theatrical release and the original theatrical release with storyreel picture in picture (watching the film with the original storyboards in picture in picture format).VIDEO:Everything about ""Beauty and Beast"" screams gorgeous, vibrant and magnificent with the release of ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"".  In my 2002 DVD review, I talked about how beautiful the animation was and how well-painted the backgrounds were but after watching this on Blu-ray, I'm going to focus on how vibrant the colors are, how well-defined the lines are, how  detailed the backgrounds to the simplest of objects such as wood, leaves and objects are.  How every character and object and its shadowing are well-done.""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  From the daylight scenes that showcase the amber oranges to the winter scenes that show the whites and blues, to the night-time and more ominous and darker scenes, blacks are nice and deep but yet you can still see detail where shadows are present on objects.  You can see the stains on the roof of the background and can easily make out the different color bricks on the chimneys, the pattern of wood on the home and well.  And of course, the animation and how free flowing the characters are, especially in the dance scene.  For a film that was created in 1991, you can't tell this animated film is nearly 20-years-old.  This film still looks incredible and it looks wonderful in HD.  I detected no banding, edge enhancement, haloing, combing or compression artifacting.This is the definitive version to own of this title yet and if you have a Blu-ray player and love Disney animated classics, picture quality-wise, this is a title that simply is a must-own.As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 1:78:1 aspect ration-enhanced for 169 televisions.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is not only fantastic in picture quality, the film is absolutely fantastic via lossless as well.  Presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz.24-bit) as well as 5.1 DEHT French and Spanish language tracks, ""Beauty and the Beast"" does not disappoint.If anything, I wished that everything Disney releases were in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and fortunately, the animated classics have received this attention.  Audio literally envelops the soundscape with immersive audio coming from the front and center channels, the surround channels, the rear surround channels.  Dialogue and music is crisp and clear, the slight sounds of leaves, horse galloping, the leaves rustling, the Beast growling, the sound of flame flickering, pots and tea cups clinkering, these are all well-done.  And it doesn't stop there, there is also LFE present as well.But if anything, one thing that ""Beauty and the Beast"" is known for is its music.  Alan Menkin's music for the film is wonderful.  You will find yourself singing to songs such as ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Belle"" and the truth is, the music captivated many people in 1991, so much that it won an Academy Award for ""Best Music, Original Score"" and ""Best Music, Original Song"" and also won two Golden Globe Awards as well for its score and for ""Best Original Song - Beauty and the Beast"".As for subtitles, ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" is presented in English SDH, English ESL, French and Spanish.As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 5.1DEHT English and Spanish Language Tracks with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" comes with the following special features presented in HD (note: original DVD features that are on the Blu-ray are presented in standard definition):DISC 1:* Audio Commentary - Audio Commentary for the special extended edition is included.  Featuring commentary by directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise plus producer Don Hahn.  The three go into look and feel of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and what they wanted to achieve.

The animation, the painted backgrounds, the music, the characters, the movement... everything about the film is a pleasant reminder of the classic Disney films that I have loved and ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I still love.Similar to the ""Snow White"" Blu-ray release, how can ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" improve upon the original 2002 release?  Easy...by adding a ton of special features and three different versions of the film.  This is what I love about Disney, they know what their customers want and what they expect and that is simply getting quality releases each time but raising the bar higher and higher of what a release should be.  And for Disney, there classic animated films are expected to be fantastic releases and fans expect nothing lower.I expected something incredible and to tell you the truth, I was pretty much expecting better picture quality in HD and lossless audio quality with the same special features and maybe a new audio commentary and possibly a retrospective featurette, but Disney has surpassed my expectations by giving us way more than what we would have expected for this film and I'm impressed and also very grateful.The film has everything you want.  Great characters, adventure, drama, action, memorable music and more!  And 20-years later, ""Beauty and the Beast"" looks and sounds phenomenal on Blu-ray.Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment have once again achieved perfection and if you are a Disney fan, a ""Beauty and the Beast"" fan and pretty much any person or fan who respects the quality of the Walt Disney animated classics on HD thus far, ""Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition"" receives my highest recommendation!"	5.0	Blu-ray: Disney once against achieves perfection with this true Disney classic on Blu-ray!	2010-10-21	5	4	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A233BX8N5692C6	Derek Hofmann	The opening monologue has changed. The new voice is not as dramatic as the old voice, and sounds a little pretentious, so it's a bit of a letdown. The wording has also changed slightly. So be aware that, despite how this is being advertised, the original theatrical release version of the movie is not 100% faithful to the original.Also, the DVD has some glitches, right out of the packaging.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1HYGEDA3GUQX	Desiree Koh	This is possibly one of the best Disney cartoon musicals ever made, and the last of its kind to merit any value at all. If not because of the plot and usual Disney stunt crutches, then it is the the music and old-style animation that make this cartoon real. The singing voices are amazing, and help transform the film from mere cartoon to a bona fide musical. The French setting especially allows for glorious accents and can-can song and dance numbers.It's good enough to allow me to ignore the usual Disney cliches, although I cringe trying to imagine this on Broadway, or worse, on ice.	4.0	The Last Disney Frontier	2002-12-01	2	1	1

Boys and girls alike grew up begging to hear the story at bed time, over and over and over...Of all the fairy tales out there ""Beauty & the Beast"" is the favorite of most kids, especially the girls. I am no exception. I was already in my twenties when I found out that the Disney Studio was creating this, my favorite tale, in animated magic as only Disney can do! It was torture to wait for the movie to hit the theater. I took my little boy to see it on opening weekend. I was as enthralled with the magic as he was.Today, I still feel this way about the movie. Of course I purchased the VHS on the day it was released to the public. However, getting this tale in DVD was a ""no brainer"". DVD lasts so much longer than VHS and is not quite so fragile or wear out so quickly. On birthdays and special occassions, this would be a wonderful gift!And let us not forget that unlike the VHS, this DVD set has so many extras! The movie may be 90 mins to two hours long, but the extras are even longer! You get behind the scene glances and see the wonder of how it was created. I had no idea that there was so much involved!

Friend	"This review isn't guaging the quality of the movie it's (It's my favorite Disney film as a matter of fact) this is about the apparantly large amount of bootlegs that seem to be going around for this movie. This will probably sound like a broken record to those who have read the other reviews, but I want to caution you to use descretion when making your purchase. Upon excitedly recieving this item in the mail earlier today, I noticed that something seemed off about the packaging. I tested it with my DVD player, and found that the first disk didn't work properly (but did work for others. I instantly suspected bootlegging, and I went online in order to confirm my suspicians. Indeed, my copy fit all of the specifications of a bootlegged copy.For your conveniance, heres a list of common features in bootleg copies of this film:-Fuzzy or indistinguished art on cover, insert, and discs with unusally washed or light coloring (as if it were cheaply printed off). All artwork should be clean and crisp (as is to be expected from Disney)-Discs only selectivly play, may work for some players, may not for others.-Actual content on DVD's has similar qualities to packaging, with washed or overly light coloring and fuzzy picture.-Movie may frequently skip or glitch.-Inner ring of the discs underside (the side without the design) reads ""Beaut and the Beast SPECIALEDITION disc 1"" or ""2"" (Intentionally mispelled as printed on the disc). Disney has explicitly stated that they do not print the DVD's name in this location, and only have a barcode. This is the best way of confirming the legality of the product.I have sent a message to the seller complaining about this, but I doubt I will get a reply. One thing I would advise though is to extensivly check the seller before buying, esspecially how many positive service reviews they have. Looking at this persons account I see he only has 4 positive reviews of four reviews. That should have been a bit a of a giveaway, but I didn't pay attention. I'm lucky though, I only payed $20 for this, some people got ripped off for as much as $50. Overall, very disappointed, and pretty miffed. I guess i'll just wait for the new addition coming out later this year."	1.0	Once again, another bootlegged copy.	2010-06-16	10	2	8

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	Disney's animated version of the classic tale, &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; is every bit as enchanting as the &quot;tale as old as time&quot; that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before.Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told &quot;if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.&quot;This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him.Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation.The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a long time. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal.The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio.&quot; It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something.This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind.&quot; Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels. This is the best picture of 1991.	5.0	One of the best films ever made!	2001-05-08	216	173	43

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A11C43I615R52G	"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker"""	Beauty and the Beast is my favorite Disney film and one of my all time favorite films. Disney really did an excellent job with this film. With great animation, a great story with humor and heart, a timeless message, fantastic songs and score and an outstanding array of characters, this film became an instant masterpiece and no Disney film (and many others) has ever topped it. Beauty and the Beast is a film for all ages and although it's only 19 years old, it will be an eternal classic for years to come. This new Diamond Edition makes Beauty and the Beast better than ever.Beauty and the Beast comes to Blu-Ray looking fantastic. I think no traditional-animated film has looked better. It looks brand-new with no dirt, no edge enhancement, no grain and no artifacts to be found in the print. You will be surpriused with the rich color palette that the film has and the huge amount of detail of the drawings. This Blu-Ray transfer does justice to the animators work in te film. The sound is equally impressive with a 7.1 HD sound that will rock your house. Dialogue is clear, the songs sound beautiful and the score is magnificent. This film presentation is absolutely like the movie itself. Simply astounding.As with the previous platinum DVD release, you have three versions of the film to choose: the theatrical 1991 version, the extended 2002 version (which is the version I prefer because Human Again is a fantastic number) and the Work in Progress version. Aside from the three presentations, you have a lot of bonus material (and I mean a lot!!).In disc one you have an audio-commentary, a conversation with legend compososer Alan Menken and a feature that's called Broadway Beginnings which features different stage actors that have been part of the Beauty and the Beast musical on Broadway. Rounding up Disc one is an alternate opening and a deleted scene (which are a little long but great to see).If you are still thirsty for more (and you should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty. Just like the Hyperion Studios documentary in Snow White, this feaure covers everything that concerns the making of the film. You need a lot of your time to see everything here but is pelnty of fun and very informative. You also have some games and the Classic DVD Bonus Features ported from the Platinum DVD.A DVD copy is also offered. It also has the three versions of the film plus the audiocommentary and looks great for SD (better than the platinum) but it's a far cry from the quality of the Blu-Ray.Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film and a must-own for everyone. This Diamond Edition is a no-brainer purchase or upgrade and you should buy it. An excellent edition for an Exellent film. Completely recommended.Note: You should know that this Diamond Edition as the Diamond for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, comes in two presentations: one in a Blu-Ray case and the other in a DVD case. However, both editions have the same content: Two BDs and 1 DVD. If you want the 2-Disc DVD-only edition you'll have to wait until Nov. 23. The DVD-only edition won't have the same amount of bonus features as the BD.PD: Some ads promoting Disney new releases look very exciting including:Tangled (in theaters Nov. 24)Toy Story 3(On DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 2)Fantasia and Fantasia 2000: 2-movie Collection Special Edition (On DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 30)A Christmas Carol (on DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 16)Bambi: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Spring 2011)The Lion KIng: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Fall 2011)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD Feb. 2011)Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD 2011)	5.0	Disney Animated Classic #30: Disney Greatest Looking Better than Ever!!!	2010-10-17	10	9	1

It's a great joy to see the three different versions of the film on one DVD.  The Special Edition, with it's restored musical number is wonderful, as is the director's commentary.  Who knew that Regis Philbin had auditioned for the Beast???  The Theatrical Release and NY Film Festival versions are both wonderful in their own right. The Film Festival version is interesting because of the look of the unfinished animation mixed in with the finished animation.  Very, very interesting.  The DVD of extras has some very interesting looks at the art of putting together an animated film and all the work that it takes.  I was also surprised to learn that the Disney folks were rushed in finishing the film, because they only worked on it for two years, as opposed to the 3-4 that they usually take now for an animated film.Anyway, get this disc as soon as possible. It's irresistable look, sound and extras make it a must have for any library of DVD's.	5.0	Splendid DVD of a marvelous film.	2002-10-10	1	0	1

The new added scenes are sometimes annoying since I remember the original, but my daughter still loves them.  To each their own.What makes me mad is that the movie came with a promise of a charm something or other.  My daughter was really excited about it, but when we went online to get it they were sold out.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A35YWA2V4QHOJ3	"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12"""	This is one of the hallmark videos in Disney history.  It takes the motif of the damsel in distress and gives it a twist.  As is typical, she is far away from home, in a dark castle &amp; imprisoned by a monster.However, the tale does not find its nucleus in her imprisonment, but in her being set free.  The monster sets about to coerce her to love him naturally for what he is, rather than forcing her to find favour with him.  This is perhaps one of the most poignant of all Disney's fairy-tale messages, both for our children as well as the overgrown children (AKA: adults).As is usually the case, the animation is fantastic.  Disney takes us into the fantasy world of make-believe and makes it almost believable.  I liked the songs on this film more than most Disney films, too.All in all, this makes for a big-time addition to the family-friendly section of your DVD collection.  The beauty of life and the beast of existing;  this one covers it all.	5.0	The wonder of Disney	2003-01-15	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	Disney Studios 30th full length animated feature film. Beauty and the Beast is another popular favorite from Disney's 3rd golden era. Filled with memorable songs, characters and beautiful animation. One of their most musical animated films The Beast comes to Blu Ray with one of the best transfers of any of their animated films. While not one of my personal favorites, it is a fantastic entry in Disney's impressive film cannon.The transfer to Blu Ray looks gorgeous with deep blacks and mind blowing color. A few minor quibbles, one the aspect ratio (while close) isn't quite correct, but it doesn't hurt the film, there may be some color hues that are questionable, though I'm not going to even try to remember what this film looked like over 20 years ago. Regardless of these tiny concerns the film looks amazing and is just a sight to behold.The sound track is also bold and a huge improvement over previous editions. Plus we get three versions of the film itself. The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies to keep you busy for a while. If you don't own the film, then the Blu Ray is the way to go.	5.0	ONE OF DISNEY'S BEST BLU RAY RELEASES!	2014-01-02	2	2	0

This was the first time I've ever really watched a blu ray disc, and the first time I've done so on my nearly 3 year old LCD TV.  I haven't seen B&TB since it first came out on VHS back in 1992, but it looked and sounded like it was just drawn and recorded yesterday.  The images were so vivid and clear that at times it almost seemed as though it was 3-D.  The sound was also updated with great care (very important for a musical), and with our new 5.1 system, the movie was just as much theatrical experience as it must have been in the theater.  For anyone looking to show just how gorgeous animation looks on blu ray, this is a must-own!	5.0	WOW	2011-02-07	1	1	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ	"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"""	"""Beauty and the Beast"" has rarely been retold in a manner that breaks the mold and gives the leads dimension. But Disney's production of the classic fairy tale, one of the last truly great Disney movies, was an outstanding feature that attracted the attention of adults and kids alike. And now the movie has been rereleased with a second DVD and some deleted material that viewers have never seen before.Bookish Belle (Paige O'Hara) is something of an oddity in her village -- viewed as a dreamy weirdo by the villagers, and viewed with possessive intent by the arrogant hunk Gaston (Richard White). Belle is, unsurprisingly, completely uninterested in Gaston -- something that makes him even more determined to marry her. But Belle's life changes when her inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart) becomes lost in a sinister forest on his way to a fair. He finds shelter in a giant, seemingly abandoned castle -- only to be dragged off to a cell by an enormous, shadowy figure.Belle finds her way to the castle, and locates Maurice. But the enormous, savage Beast that rules the castle will only release Maurice if Belle agrees to stay in the castle -- forever. (We learn at the beginning that a spell of true love will turn the Beast back into a human being -- but the time limit is approaching) Belle agrees, and Maurice is sent back to the village. He frantically tries to gain help from the other villagers, but they laugh and dismiss him as crazy.At the castle, which is populated by intelligent furniture such as lovesick candlelabra Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), teapot Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), and fretful clock Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Belle is growing to love the Beast, and the Beast is becoming more gentle. But Gaston's jealousy and the village's fear threatens Belle and the Beast both...The additions to this DVD make it worth buying even if you already have a copy. A musical sequence never before seen has been picked up from the cutting-room floor and pasted back where it originally was: ""Human Again,"" a charming upbeat song and dance number (if what the animate object characters do can be called ""dancing"") that will rank up with ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Belle"" as a favorite. Moreover, the film has been digitally remastered, giving it a fresh, bright look -- most noticeable during the dance scene.The second DVD contains plenty of good stuff. In the ""Mrs. Potts"" section there is a personality checker, where viewers can see who they most resemble; also intriguing interviews with several Disney voice-actors, including Celine Dion, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara, Angela Lansbury and more. Behind everyone's favorite clock-and-candle duo is a virtual gallery; behind Chip is some behind-the-scenes revelations about how the movie was made and a cute music game. Music videos (Celine Dion-haters better steer clear) and a very difficult ""Spell Adventure Game,"" that may challenge even die-hard fans who thought they could do it all. And for more insights into the movie, there is an ""audio commentary"" that can be switched on as the film plays. Be sure to check out the extras on the first disc, as the hardest game on the second hinges on information in the first.Qualitywise, the film is outstandingly charming. There's romance, presented in a charmingly realistic manner; humor, ranging from the Beast's new hairstyle (""You look so... so..."" ""Stupid."") to Cogsworth's hysterical blathering. Character development is at its best here: Belle is a gal with a brain and her own mind, who isn't afraid to dream while keeping her feet on the ground when she needs to. The Beast initially will get no sympathy, but his gradual transformation from a blustering bully to a vulnerable sweetie. Gaston will elicit nothing but scorn; bumbling but good-hearted Maurice will charm viewers. And the ""animate objects"" are equally entertaining, bickering and conspiring and frantically trying to pair Belle and the Beast so that they can be ""Human Again.""This ""tale as old as time"" is perhaps even more entrancing than before, seen at a more-than-full length with plenty of extras. A delightful story and a great movie."	5.0	Tale as old as time	2002-10-29	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A138826JMC0J3T	E. Batica	Easily one of Disney's new classics and one of the most fun as well. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been brought back in a new 2 Disc set that has the original movie with the new song &quot;Human Again&quot; and also a lot of fun extras.This is one of my all time favorite Disney movies and this is a great one for the kids and the whole family. The storty starts with a young Prince who was very selfish. One night a poor old woman came to his castle and asked for shelter from the rain and she offered him a single rose in return. The Prince turned her away and the old woman's appearance melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. To show him that he had to learn how to love inner beauty, she turned into a hideous Beast. Now he must learn to love and have someone love him in teturn or he would remain a Beast for the rest of his life.This is really a favorite of mine because it's seriously very good all around. The music and musical numbers are very fun and entertaining and the new song &quot;Human Again&quot; is also very fun as well. The story is very good and the characters are fun as well. I don't think anyone could not enjoy this movie.This gets a big thumbs up, 5 stars of fun! Check out BEAUTY AND THE BEST PLATINUM and if you're looking for other great Disney classics, check out DUMBO, SLEEPING BEAUTY, SNOW WHITE and even some of the new Disney/Pixar movies like MONSTERS INC, TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE.	5.0	Beauty and The Beast	2003-01-22	1	1	0

Great bluray disc, despite the tiresome problem of not being able to skip all the warnings and so forth before getting to the film itself. The transfer and sound are amazing.But Disney still seems to get a pass from everyone on one point--none of these versions is the uncut theatrical print. The Gaston song has been trimmed--at the end of the reprise, as part of the song, LaFou spells out Gaston's name and makes a mistake, causing Gaston to clobber him. This sequence was in when it was first released to theaters (and really was funny), but it has been edited out of every home video version, and sadly this one is no exception. Why? Is this some politically correct thing where they are worried about offending people who make spelling mistakes?  Deduct one star from what is otherwise a great package.	4.0	Why is this film still in edited form?	2011-02-18	4	3	1

The movie is a marvellous plot, beautiful music and remarkable art cinematography.My two young daughters are enchanted by Belle, who they see as a role model. She is exceptionally brave, very intelligent, unselfish and pretty and cannot be pushed around by anyone. She refused to marry the most eligible man in the village because of his despicable character and she falls in love with the beast because of its beauty within, not outside appearance. (The beast risks his life to rescue Belle from a pack of wild animals and he frees her so that she can be re-united with her sick father.)This is a moving film that has won an Oscar.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AXFI7TAWD6H6X	Erica Anderson	"""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of those rare films (animated or live action) that never seems dated despite the fact that it was released just a decade ago. The premise of the whole film is timeless and can always be told over and over to impressionable viewers. The message that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance is an excellent message, especially today when people are being scrutinized simply because they are of a particular ethic group and/or religion. I think ""Beauty and the Beast"" succeeded in achieving that goal that you should not judge a person by his or her appearance and that beauty is only skin deep.As a film, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is my personal favorite Disney film and all around film of all time. This movie isn't just for kids but for everyone of all ages. I loved the animation when the movie first came out in the movie theaters, and I still love it in the special edition format. Although I really didn't notice a terribly huge difference in the remastering in the quality of the film, I didn't care. The movie still manages to engage me for all 90 minutes. I did notice though that in the introduction just as the narrator was explaining how the prince became the Beast, I swore I never saw that shot of the stained glass window with the prince just standing there. I also noticed during the introduction that the rose was brighter than in the original format. I may be just imagining things though. I must admit that I was a bit suspicious of the inclusion of ""Almost Human"" but now that I have seen it. I just adore that segment. It was one of the funnier moments in the movie. I thought it flowed real well with the rest of the movie.""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of the rare movies that I can never tire of watching. It is my personal favorite Disney movie (next to ""The Lion King"" and both ""Toy Story"" movies), and one of my all time favorite movies. Although it has been just over ten years since it was first released in the theaters, the movie still sounds fresh as ever."	5.0	A timeless classic	2002-10-19	0	0	0

You get not only the theatrical version, which pays for itself, the new IMAX version with commentary and an extra deleted music sequence (""Human Again,"" which doesn't simply feel tacked on), and a third version called a ""Work in progress edition"" that combines the original pencil sketches, animation layouts, storyboards, computer demonstrations, and the final product to create an amazing filmmaking experience. This was first shown in New York in 1992 in front of critics who gave it a standing ovation. Before the film, the director gives a brief video commentary describing it. I'm amazed by the restoration job done on the normal film; colors are very vibrant. The film was restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1. Plus, it was given a super high definition transfer. Now you have dvd quality with surround sound and three different versions of the film, all with there own unique style with commentary, artwork on the disc, and brilliant animated windows for mere pennies, or even cheaper than the vhs. If you want to buy this and you have a dvd player, I strongly urge you to by the dvd. If you only have a vcr, the vhs looks much better than the older version, and has some features to make it worth your while. Getting back to the dvd, there are also (on disc 2) trailers, The Story Sehind the Story, a Character Profile Game, ""Disney's Enchanted Environments,"" The Broadway Musical (portions only, of course), Disney's Animation Magic, Chip's Musical Challenge Game, the Beauty and the Beast Music Video by Jump 5, a Break the Spell Adventure Game (pretty neat), short documentaries on the story, the art, the characters, and the music (I recommend these), penicil version: transformation, animation tests (very cool), setting the stage, camera move test (really neat), a layout and background gallery, ""tricks of the trade,"" and a segment of trailers, re-release trailers, tv spots, poster and ad designs, and release and reaction (this is another good feature), and last, but certainly not least, widescreen!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AZ1PS5SHWHE0U	Erka16	When &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; came out in theaters over 10 yrs ago, I thought this movie was the best animation feature that Disney had released, and since that time none have come close.So when Disney released this film classic on DVD, I had to buy it, even though I already own the VHS version.Boy! I am very happy with my purchase, the additional scene goes very good with the flow of the original version, and it is hard to tell that a scene was added.For those who haven't seen the Broadway production might wonder where on earth did they come up with this?  The music was original, but I guess for time, they(producers/director) decided to scrap it.  However, it was incorporated in to the Broadway production.The DVD version is fabulous, the animation is much clearer and the music crisp.  One of the many bonuses of having DVD is the menu options...they even have a sing-along option!	5.0	The Best Disney Animation by Far	2002-11-05	0	0	0

I've only seen one of the 5 discs (blu ray NON 3D) and it worked fine. My only complaint is the fact that it said this product was brand new, and it was obvious that it was NOT sealed the way it is when originally bought. The DVD had been open and then rewrapped. I have yet to enter the disney rewards code into my account, but assuming that it will work, then it wasn't a big deal that the dvd was opened and rewrapped, because everything appears new regardless	4.0	Content	2011-11-27	0	0	0

The image is flawless, the colors are stunning, and the sound is superb.  Anyone who says otherwise is inventing flaws in their mind.  You can see every handrawn line with crystl clear clarity and can almost feel the layers of animation cells laying on top of each other.  The computer gernerated sequences are as good as any Pixar movie has ever been and the movie as a whole has stood the test of time.  This is THE first animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture and it deserves the countless glowing reviews professional Blu-ray sites have given it.  Watching Belle singing on the hillside at sunset gave me goosebumps it was so awe inspiring.  When is crying over the fallen Beast and the first sparks of magic start to fall from the sky, I was in tears at the beauty (no pun intended) of the momment.

For the greatest love story that was ever told is nothing but Beauty and the Beast.  The story of Beauty and the Beast has been told from generation to generations, it is indeed true that it is a tale as old as time.  Love does not found on appearance, but love is found within, that is what Beauty and the Beast all about.It comes with 2 discs.  Disc one (main disc).  Disc two (Supplemental Features)When Disc 1 is inserted, it automatically plays the sneek peeks:- Jungle Book 2- The Lion King (Imax version)- Beauty and the Beast (Enchanted Christmas Special Edition)- Lilo & Stich (Beauty and the Beast) &- Sleeping Beauty (Special Edition)After that, an eye popping and jaw dropping of 3D rendered intro bringing you to the interactive DVD menu:The film features 3 version:Special EditionOriginal Theatrical EditionWork-In-Progress EditionSpecial Edition: Figuring a never-seen-before musical footage known as ""Human Again"".  This song was taken out from normal edition because it causes timing error that sadly the song as to take out.  At January 1st 2002,  This special edition was shown on Imax Theatre as well as other giant screen theatres.  It was shown in Singapore Science Center from January 2002 to June 2002 as well.  Since there are no giant screen theatre in Malaysia, My girlfriend and I went to Singapore, purposely to catch this wonderful show.  It comes with 3 audio channel:- English- French &- Audio CommentarySince the story is on France background, French is definately can not be excluded.  Audio Commentary is another interesting audio, the director commented every moments in the film with interesting stories happened during production.It also comes with 2 subtitles:-  Sing-along track-  EnglishThe Sing-along track is sub-title only on musical sequences.Work-In-Progress Edition:  It is shown in 1991 New York Film Festival.  You can see many of the sketches, pencil drawing, concept arts are playing on this version.Disc 1 also features a small interactive game called ""Break The Spell"".  A kiddie game, nothing much worth to mention here.Disc 2 features a lot of information and fun staffs.  I can't list them one by one, it is just too many of it.  However, I would like to highlight the main interesting ones on Disc 2.-  The Making of Beauty and the Beast-  The Story Behind The Story (hosted by Celine Dion)-  MTV of Beauty and the Beasto Sung by Celine Dion & Peabo Brysono Pop version, sung by Jump 5 (not too bad actually)It comes with a nice full coloured booklet covering:-  Introduction by the Producer Don Hahn-  Sitemaps of Disc 1 and Disc 2.

After all, Snow White was the 1st PLATINUM EDITION DVD set giving us the background information about this full length TECHNICOLOR Animation film released in 1938 receiving worldwide recognition and immortalizing Walt Disney's animation.  Walt Disney & Company received honorary Oscars (presented by Shirley Temple). The songs from this classic movie are still sung by us all.  This animation feature changed Disney and our lives forever.Now we have ""BEAUTY and the BEAST - PLATINUM EDITION a 2 DVD set with extensive background information.  What is truly amazing about this movie is;  it has the best story ever,  it was converted into a successful Broadway play which has over 3000 performances and is still running,  the music & songs are or more widely known than ""Snow Whites""!,  it was the first animation picture to ever be nominated for a ""BEST PICTURE - OSCAR"".Some interesting facts about ""Beauty & the Beast"".  After the success of Snow White, Walt Disney bought the film rights to ""Beauty and the Beast"".  He felt this story was a perfect encore feature.  Unfortunately, Disney & his staff could not deliver believable interpretation on this French Classic Tale in the 1930's.  Again in the 1950's Disney attempted to bring ""Beauty and the Beast"" to the screen with no success.The 1980's came and the new Disney Studios with the success of the ""Little Mermaid"" assembled the most talented cast, animators, scriptwriters & company to give us maestro Disneys vision to the screen!!BEAUTY and the BEAST is the 1st animation feature ever to produce two equal characters who find each other through the most unusual circumstances.  This feature is the best paced, acted, animated and emotional ride since ""SNOW WHITE""!!Summary - The story is amazing, the characters enchanting, the music extraordinary.  Belle our leading lady must free her captured father Maurice from the Beast castle.  She bargains with the him and agrees to exchange positons with her father & remain a prisoner forever.  She learns that the Beast has been cursed by an enchantress because of his mean & selfishness.  The Beast has one hope and that is to find true love before the enchanted rose loses all of its petals or remain a Beast forever.  The rose has begun to die & the petals have begun to shed.This movie is the best Disney Entertainment.  The entire family will enjoy this because the story effects all of our emotions.  The music is so delightful, the cast is outstanding and the Disney Creators have brought the essence of Walts vision to life once again.  Don't miss this Special Edition classic with the animation sequence & song ""Human Again"" meticulously reproduced & added to the film.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1VU8D2148AKAG	Francisco Pizarro	"Everyone has a favorite Disney film. You know, the one you saw at one point in your life and stuck with you forever. Not to mention that there so many classics to choose from. For me that film is Beauty and the Beast. I start with that because if while reading this, I wax poetic about how this is the best of the Disney films and a work of genius while the reader is thinking ""Well, its not Fantasia (or insert your favorite here) but its not bad."" Please understand that the film is very close to my heart so it is hard for me to be objective.The first and only hand animated film to be nominated for a best picture Academy Award, Beauty and the Beast is a major departure from the classic Disney formula, at least where the Disney Princesses are concerned. Belle is not your run of the mill damsel in distress, waiting to be saved by Prince Charming. While the setting of the film seems from a long time ago, this is a firmly modern main character, especially for a woman. Everything is turned on its head. Belle reads and thinks (a bad thing according to the villain in the film) and in her notion of marriage the relationship should be emotionally and intellectually stimulating. Not to mention equality. Not 20 minutes into the film our heroine makes a very hard act of self sacrifice to save her father (as opposed to fathers helping their daughters in other films, if they are there at all) and not long after that gets in trouble for her curiosity rather than her beauty (which is usually what gets princesses into trouble).Her relationship with the Beast doesn't exactly ""click"" from the get go. They argue and fight (some of the best moments in the film)and while Beast does save her life at one point. It is Belle who saves him in the end, again turning a stereotype on its head. Of course, you can't get away with all these changes in tradition without something ""Disney"" to anchor the film and all this drama. The Fantasy element is very much present. Every secondary character that lives in the Beast's castle is some sort of stationary object. And you can't talk about a film like this and not mention the score and music that goes with it. The songs are all memorable in the best Disney tradition but the score, in my opinion, is one of the best ever by Disney. It perfectly complements the darkness of film. (Who would ever think you could use darkness and Disney in the same anything.)Disney has so far done an outstanding job releasing its back catalog into Blu-Ray. The transfers so far have been pretty much perfect and this film is no exception. The colors look amazing and the detail is so remarkable that if you look closely you can see the pencil strokes in the drawn characters beneath the ink. It is that good. The only thing missing from this release is a digital copy. I'm having a hard time understanding the logic behind Disney's combo packs. Some include the digital copy, some don't. A little bit of consistency (preferably in the ""included digital copy"" department) would be greatly appreciated.In closing, this is a must have release if you are a fan of Disney films. It is an incredible film. The transfer is awesome. The bonus features are plentiful. Despite lacking the digital copy, I highly recommend this release."	5.0	The Pinnacle of Classic Animation Arrives on Blu-Ray	2011-08-19	2	1	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2C7BOQVFH1HLE	Frederick Baptist	"Not only is this my favourite Disney feature film ever but it is also one of my top-10 favourite ever films.  It never fails to touch me whenever I watch it and it never gets old for me; especially now that this version has included a whole new previously excluded segment, ""Human Again"", and after watching it I can't imagine why they didn't include it in the first place as for me it actually improves the overall film by letting us have a glimpse at how Beauty and the Beast's relationship blossomed over time and I especially liked the scene where Beauty helps the Beast to learn how to read again.  Of course the musical number is also another brilliant Ashman/Mencken composition as well.No matter what your feelings of Disney you cannot accuse them of non-quality output and so you get an excellent value proposition that fully utilises the scope and capabilities of the standard dvd format medium.  We get 3 versions of the movie here and I enjoyed watching each one for various reasons: the special edition for the ""new"" footage, the original version to remind me of what I first saw at the cinema and the work-in-progress version to educate me on how such animation is put together.  The second special features disc has hours of material from documentaries to interviews and even games if you are inclined to play them.As for the main content i.e. the movie itself, the sound quality is excellent and so is the picture quality.  Ashman and Mencken's music and especially the lyrics are so good that they alone are responsible for at least 70% of what makes this film work so well.  I remember I actually bought the cassette tape of the soundtrack years ago and I wore out the tape just listening to the brilliant music.  Also the excellent voice talents that were perfectly cast and especially Angela Lansbury who ironically acted so well as one of my most despised film villains in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and has now become my favourite character as the kind Mrs Potts here.  In fact, one of the more touching scenes for me and also one of my favourites is the part where romance first starts to blossom for Beauty and the Beast and she is singing ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the famous one-take sequence.  Having recorded a number of times before on other people's cds as a guitarist I can tell you just how hard it is to do anything on a first take and so I only have great admiration for Lansbury in being able to do this.  It's a timeless rendition and a version that ages well and will continue to do so and I'm left feeling that the 90s dated sounding Peabo Bryson/Celine Dion version of the tune at the end is a poor sounding imitation that certainly doesn't touch me as much as Lansbury's version does.This dvd is already so good that I really can't think of anything to complain about or to suggest improvements on except perhaps that I'd like to see a Blu-ray version come out soon.Disney's best and a timeless classic makes this very, very highly recommended!"	5.0	Disney's Best Has Just Gotten Even Better!	2009-07-25	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2MRZPTMYFADUV	Frodo	"It's become a bit of a cliche term when referring to Disney films, but I truly and honestly believe that this film is a timeless, spellbinding and magical classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was just one film in a string of masterpieces that Disney produced in 6 or so years. ""The Little Mermaid,"" started, followed by this film, then ""Aladdin,"" and the ""The Lion King."" It's much like what Pixar is experiencing now with THEIR beautiful films, from Toy Story to their latest Cars. However, as much as I love Pixar's films (and believe me when I say I'm a BIG fan of them) they simply don't have the sheer electricity that Disney animation have... or USED to have. It makes me slightly sad, now that computer animation has become the primary way of animation, that the next generation will never be able to FULLY grasp the delight of these particular Disney films, and let's not forget ""Snow White,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""Peter Pan,""... need I go on? My point is, Disney had such a great thing going with these masterpieces... then they just stopped. And THAT is why it's slightly sad.Despite this, it IS so wonderful to know that these Disney films ARE still so joyfully remembered. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is certainly no exception. With everything from beautiful, colourful animation, a delightful set of characters and simply amazing music and songs, this film replenishes our imagination with the wonders and hopes of any great love story.Belle is an intelligent young woman living in her modest French town when a twist of fate draws her to an enchanted and somewhat haunted castle in the woods. What she discovers is an array of talking objects, from candlesticks to feather dusters of whom are servents to the master of the castle - a great beast. As sour first impressions fade, Belle and the beast form a close bond. Unbeknown to Belle, the beast is in fact a prince, burdened by a spell that requires the kiss of love to break it. The story is about looking past outer appearences and loving the person underneath the skin.Despite the universal and important theme, true to Disney form, this film is not preachy, but subtly conveys these ideas through the beautiful characters and music combined. The music, as I mentioned before is simply outstanding. A deeply moving and powerful score, teamed with charming songs gives this film its timeless aura, which still hasn't faded fifteen years on.You can obviously tell by now that I am a Disney fan through and through. These films, particularly this one, have been a part of my childhood, my education, and my shaping as a person. Words really cannot describe the joy these films give me time and time again, and I can quite garantee that many people, young and old feel the same way. These aren't just films, their building blocks that build the soul."	5.0	Why don't they make films like this anymore?	2006-06-13	4	4	0

It's too bad this transfer is not. This is exactly the reason Amazon needs a two-rating system. One for the movie & the other for the actual product. Nobody is getting their movie reviews from Amazon, believe me. What we need to know is if the DVD or Blu-ray is good.So, let me start by pointing out the good. You get all 3 versions of the movie. The sound is excellent. Very level, deep when it need to be & the music sounds clear & full. Colors in the movie are bright, while the darks are perfect, with no sign of artifacts in them.Now we get to the bad stuff. Let's face it, when we're buying any kind of video product, the picture is the most important thing. If the picture stinks, the whole think stinks. And although the picture on this Blu-ray doesn't stink, it's not perfect. Far from perfect in fact.Let's start with the first problem, the lines. In hand-drawn animation, the lines are everything. If they are not constant & clear, the characters lose some of their realism. The lines in Beauty & the Beast are very thin, which is great for details. However, digital media is just not able to handle thin lines correctly. Several times pieces of a line will disappear into the color behind it. Most noticeably on Cogworth's face. His clock face will come through & ""bloom"" over most of the lines on his face, losing most of the detail. But the main problem with the lines in this transfer are the white ""halos"" around them. It seems like they used edge enhancements on the characters. But I'm not 100% sure this is what they did, as this halo never appears on any of the backgrounds. All I know is that at certain times, characters will have these halos surrounding their lines. The Beast takes the brunt of this & looks terrible in every shot. Just check out the sharp ends of his fur to see what I mean. Gaston also suffers from this, especially his face. What I did notice is that for the first half of the film, the lines seem to have been drawn with a dark brown color. Later on, the lines are black & this halo problem lessens. So I'm thinking that the problem is the digital media of Blu-Ray, even though it's high-def is not able to handle the dark brown lines against any brown-based back (flesh, brown fur, tan). When I saw this film at an IMAX theater, I did notice some of the same problems with the lines. So maybe the problem isn't even the transfer, but the actual film itself. Maybe the transfer is just so high-detail it's showing the film's flaws. In any case, these line problems can be distracting at times & I found myself noticing them & focusing on them, rather than the movie itself. Which is not a good thing.Other video problems include graininess within certain colors, especially yellows or gold, like Lumiere. There is also an annoying strobe like problem, when the action seems to be going fast. This was most noticeable when Maurice is escaping the wolves.To finish up, we all know the movie is great. Unfortunately, this film just doesn't look as good as let's say Pinocchio or Snow White. Which is kind of amazing, considering those movies are 50+ years older than this one."	3.0	Disappointing transfer	2010-10-10	272	230	42
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2KSRJFZ2R9JK3	Fuwwyfootpaws	Beauty And The Beast is a Disney animated film from 1991. It is known as one of the best animated films of all time, and it is one of the only animated films to be nominated for the ''Best Picture'' Oscar.The film is about a beautiful young woman named Belle who lives in France. She loves to read, and the townspeople find her beautiful, but strange. Her father is an inventor, and when he manages to make his new machine work, he sets off to a fair, only to get lost and become attacked by wolves. He comes across a big castle where a beast lives. The beast confronts him, and keeps him prisoner.While this is happening, a cruel man in the town named Gaston wants Belle to marry him, only for him to get refused and humiliated in public. When Belle finds out her father is in trouble, she sets off to find him. When she reaches the castle, she begs the beast to free him, but the beast only will if she promises to stay in the castle forever. She gives him her word, and he lets her father go back to the village.Beast is a hothead and a bully, but he is also really shy and sad. We learn that he was transformed into a beast by an enchantress, and he must learn to love someone before his 21st birthday, otherwise he will remain a beast forever.This is a really amazing movie. The animation is beautiful, dark, and scary. When I was a kid, I actually had nightmares because of some scenes from the film. It's a really good and mature film, and the songs are extremely catchy and really funny. A superb animated film.	5.0	An amazing animated film	2013-07-16	0	0	0

The only problem is if you watch your old VHS and the new ""mastered"" DVD you'll see that they over simplified the colors on the new DVD. Where there once was shadow and texture and dark colors. It is now replaced with overly bright, no shadows, and flatness. Its kinda strange that something so old was better looking old. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see old clips that are on the DVD (see the Celine video on the DVD or the clips on some of the gmaes). Its kinda sad to see them make this movie look like some of those cheap straight to video movies Disney makes.

If you miss buying a certain movie, you have to wait until Disney releases it again.  I bought the previous version of Beauty and the Beast on DVD.  It was very good, although it didn't have a Spanish soundtrack.  I actually prefer watching these movies in Spanish, because these were the versions that played on the movie theaters when I was little.  This version might have a slightly better image, I'm not sure, but I can choose a Spanish soundtrack now.  Since I am pretending BluRay does not exist (I don't want to buy all my movies again), I will stick with this version for a while.	4.0	It has a Spanish sountrack	2013-04-02	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2UBSGFCP2QFNV	"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'"""	Disney's Beauty and the Beast has become the quintessential animated musical, chock full of moments that have become iconic -- even to the point of parody -- since its smash debut in 1991. It was the ultimate connection of consummate talents, some who were already legendary and many of which who have become industry giants.This is the first time in seven years that Beauty and the Beast has been issued on home video, this time in a DVD/Blu-Ray combo that kindly for DVD owners, still offers the superb audio commentary by producer Don Hahn, composer Alan Menken and directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and three versions of the film, as they appeared on the Platinum Edition.Once again, this Diamond Edition offers yet another reason to get a Blu-Ray Player if you want to see how great the digital restoration is in all its glory. (As far as I can tell, you can't buy the DVD without getting the Blu-ray discs as well.) If you want to see some new features such as an Alternate Opening, a Deleted Scene, new games, new documentary features and a new music video. You might want to hang onto your Platinum DVD because there are a few features, including some games, that do not appear on the new edition.Beauty and the Beast is one of those Disney classics that transcends its release date, the age of its audience and the tinge of its lesser imitators. Somehow it all works, and as the artists say themselves, even they didn't know whether it would all work but somehow it did. That's the fascinating, elusive nature of great artistry.	5.0	5 for movie, 5 for Blu-Ray, 4 for DVD because it doesn't have all the features of the Blu-Ray	2010-10-05	9	7	2
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ACKDSX71VI5HY	"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader"""	"SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Walt Disney Company's 1991 animated film ""Beauty and the Beast"" is remarkable for the way it balances the demands of the classic story with its own stated aims of providing family-friendly entertainment.  This film has very little in common with the classic Jean Cocteau film of 1946, but in certain key scenes it also does not disregard the mature angles of the tale.With the voice talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson and Angela Lansbury, it opens its story in an ideal French village following a short prologue detailing the origins of the Beast.  In the village, the heroine Belle is a bit of an odd duck, always reading books and avoiding the advances of Gaston, the local brawny sportsman who rudely courts her.  She is much more interested in looking after her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice.  When Maurice gets sidetracked on his way to a tradeshow, his and Belle's lives will change forever.The differentiating factor which marks this adaptation as Disney's own is its supreme narrative balance.  While it is very clear the Beast can be dangerous, he is much more tormented than evil.  By contrast, Gaston, who is beautiful in the eyes of the village, is a vain, soulless greedy man.With excellent songs like ""Poor Provincial Town,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" and the stirringly romantic title song, Walt Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" will continue to be applauded for a long time."	5.0	Fine modern Disney film balances tough story with company trademarks	2010-05-12	1	1	0

It features, of course, the original edition of the movie, PLUS the Special Edition (featuring an original, never before seen musical sequence) and the Work In Progress Edition, a Disney first. The best parts of the film are:when the Enchanted Objects sing ""Be Our Guest"" (one of three Oscar-nominated songs, the other two being ""Belle"" and of course, ""Beauty And The Beast"" [which won Best Song, beating out the other two, but ALL the songs in this movie are excellent]) and when Belle and The Beast are dancing in the ballroom as Mrs. Potts (voiced by a spectacular and talented Angela Lansbury) sings the title song. The bonus features on Disc 2 are equally enchanting as the movie itself.Paige O'Hara is WONDERFUL as the voice of Belle, Robby Benson is equally good as the voice of The Beast, arrogant and loving as the film progresses, Angela Lansbury is PERFECT as the voice of Mrs. Potts, Jerry Orbach is hilarious as the voice of Lumiere, the French candelabra, David Odgen Stiers (voice of the villainous Ratcliff in ""Pocahontas"" and ""Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World, opposite Irene Berard, reprising her role from the first movie and Billy Zane as John Rolfe) is just as comical in his fights with Lumiere.

The colors are so bright and beautiful, and there is no grain; none whatsoever. And the sound is BOOMING. It's truly magical. Beauty and the Beast really is a complete winner on Blu-Ray, and although admittedly not my *top* favorite Disney classic (that would be The Little Mermaid :D), it always has been my solid third favorite. I actually hadn't even watched this in awhile, because I never got the Platinum Edition of it because I was too young at the time to even know about it, but now that I am older, I am very glad I at least have the Diamond Edition. I haven't yet watched any of the special features yet or anything, but I am very excited to, and I know that I will make it a point to watch this more often! And, if this is just what Beauty and the Beast looks like, I am even more excited and impatient for The Little Mermaid to come out; truly, it is a marvel. IT REALLY IS WORTH THE MONEY.The story is just as beautiful as ever, the wonderful happy ending we all know and love is truly awesome, and the characters are just as fantastic and great too. Belle is still wonderful, Beast is still charming and amazing, Chip the teacup is still cute, and (yeah) Gaston is still just as horrible as ever, but still incredibly hot. Buy this!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1FGW91JTKS0NS	"Hayven ""Hayven"""	"This story is something much different than most other ""princess"" movies. Belle comes from a humble home and is seen as an outcast because she is not conventional like most girls. She avoids Gaston's (most eligible bachelor in town) flirtations and marriage offers. She instead chooses to read and help her father with his inventions instead of preparing herself for marriage, but it understandable the latter part is difficult for her to do without the presence of a maternal figure.However, her relationship with her father is strong, so strong that she is willing to brave haunted and dark woods to find her father. Belle seeks refuge in the castle of a prince who was cursed into being a beast. They have a rough time trying to get along, but over time they begin to get to know each other better based on each other's personality and not looks.The animation and characters in this film are pleasant and delightful; I loved the dining entertainment dance number with Lumier and Cogsworth because of the arrangements and the welcome feeling that radiated in the dining hall. The dance hall scene made me catch my breath at how graceful the couple could be despite the Beast depicted as a hulking menacing figure. Of course Disney had to have the ""happily ever after ending"", but through all the struggles that the Beast had to go through with the curse and Gaston's attacks, he deserved that happy ending."	5.0	Beauty and the Beast	2005-10-04	3	1	2

I'm not reviewing the film, but rather, the product.The colors have been drastically altered from their original versions, and it's really horrible. They made the colors so over-saturated that I had to dim my screen by half- and they still were too bright.The reds are no longer the rich rusts they were- but rather a glaring fire-engine red. I got out my old VHS tape, and the colors are so much better than this. I don't know who was in charge of remastering the colors of this glorious film, but they were so heavy handed that they really ruined some scenes visually. 'Belle's Song' (the opening where they all sing bonjour!) was impossible to look at in some instances because of how bright the reds were.It's a shame that they did this to such a great film.	3.0	Remastering the colors was a mistake	2010-11-28	8	6	2

I wish I was getting paid for saying that but unfortunately, I'm not.Disney's recent release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST on BD looks so good that it has the appearance of 3D. As I watched this blu-ray, the colors seemed to jump out and have a three dimensional space. The sound is flawless. Even though B&TB; isn't my favorite Disney film, I find myself amazed at this BD version. I only hope that their Fantasia set coming soon will be just as good.If you like this picture and have blu-ray in your home, this is definitely worth your money!	5.0	DISNEY KNOWS BLU-RAY (BD? 3D!!)	2010-11-05	0	0	0

Belle was a great heroine, she was smart, cute, and followed the old saying, &#34;You can't judge a book by it's cover.&#34; I especially loved how the Beast started to mature through the film and begin to care for Belle, unlike Gaston, the pig-headed monster taught us all that just because a guy is good-looking and talented in every way possible doesn't mean he's the guy to get the girl, he's more like the spoiled creep who pushes people around! There's a lesson to be learned in true love, and this movie taught it perfectly!PS: I kinda wish Gaston appeared in a Kingdom Hearts game as a boss.	5.0	I've always wanted this movie!	2014-04-28	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3R9KRIO25CKZV	"I. Gross Georg ""imgeorg"""	I wanted to investigate this movie, first of all, because I simply heard somuch about this animated movie that had been nominated for an Oscar, and because I have a friend who has played the role of the Beast onstage.What I like about the DVD was that it lets me experience the movie three ways.The first is the Special Edition which, if youre like me and never saw the original, makes you wonder whats so special about it. Enter the second option, the original movie! The last option, the replay of the Special Edition with narration throughout by the actual animators, was the most satisfying to me.These are two very engaging guys whose play-by-play of the production processes and the decisions they had to make allowed me to see the movie with a new appreciation of the work involved without runing the films magic. I thoroughly enjoyed this presentation, although I wished that they could have captioned the narration.By the way, the closed captioning, as done by my TV set, was reasonably well done with few mistakes.Tip: if you have CC turned on, turn OFF the subtitles on your DVD player, else you get captions on top of captions. Messy.As far as the movie itself, well. The story is everything, and its a wonderful story. The animation, keeping in mind that this was originally done before the age of Pixar, I found the backdrops absolutely stunning, especially the ballroom scenes. The colors were bright and vibrant even when seen on my 20&Oacute; JVC TV. Of course, there isnt the nearly three-dimensional quality of, say, a &Ograve;Snow White&Oacute;, but at least the characters didnt appear to have the stilted &Ograve;Clutch Cargo&Oacute; movements typically seen in animation produced in Korea. I could tell the animators knew a little something about human anatomy.There are really good special effects scenes. Realistic rain scenes and lightning. Being a lover of stage production, the songs were tailor-made for Broadway and I understand  that it became one after the 1991 release.Paige OHara has a wonderful voice, and Im going to seek out more of her recordings. She makes you forget that Belle is an animated character. Robbie Bensons Beast is so convincing, I wish they could have used him to be the adult Simba in &Ograve;The Lion King&Oacute; rather than Matthew Broderick. David Ogden Stiers, from &Ograve;M*A*S*H*&Oacute;, is Cogsworth the clock and also narrates the beginning and end &Ograve;stained glass&Oacute; pieces. JoAnn Worley from the old &Ograve;Laugh-In&Oacute; show was the armoire cabinet. I was impressed by the use of top-drawer, albeit relatively unknown talent.In all, I found Beauty and the Beast&Oacute; a very well done movie. I wouldnt mind buying it. The Special Editions new scenes helped the story make more sense. The only thing I didnt enjoy was the hit song at the end of the movie, but I had that same reaction to the end of &Ograve;The Lion King&Oacute; as well.	5.0	A Complete Package	2003-07-13	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ANVFMW4G470WR	"""jackalanhyde"""	The biggest flaw in this story ... is that it makes a 45-year-old man cry like a child every time I watch it.  My opinions on Disney movies vary -- some are good, some are almost unwatchable -- but &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is the best work the studio has ever done.Why do I love this movie so much?  I think it's the music.  In some musicals (animated or live), as soon as a song begins, the story comes to a grinding halt.  (Can anyone remember one tune from &quot;Mulan&quot;?)  But in this film, the music by Ashman and Menken advances the story marvellously.  Animation and voice acting combine in a near-flawless performance, and the use of computer animation in the ballroom dance sequence was ground-breaking in its time.As for the added features, the added song &quot;Human Again&quot; is a wonderful fun number.  I can understand why it was left out of the original version, but its inclusion really doesn't detract from the story (it's another big production number like &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, not really essential to the plot, but helps us get to know the supporting characters).The &quot;making of&quot; features are fairly interesting; the on-disk games I can take or leave.  But the film itself is still the gem, worth the purchase price all by itself; the standard by which all other Disney movies are measured.	5.0	What's wrong with this movie?	2002-10-11	309	275	34

And this movie has taught me to be careful how I treat people with ugliness that shows outwardly,because all of us have ugliness in us and it takes a special person to show us how to let go of our selfish and ugly ways.

Then turn down the lights and be prepared to be swept away in wonderment at just how good a film can be when everyone involved does everything just right.It is going to be a Christmas present for a couple of relatives.	5.0	Just get it.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1EQ7UTXNHSQK1	James Cabello	When I found out that beauty and the beast was to be released on blu-ray, I was excited. My children were excited as well, even though they are teenagers, they remember watching this film as toddlers and loving it. We bought it, and watched it that weekend.I was in awe of the beauty of the restoration. If your blu-ray player is set up right, with HDMI cables and an HDTV, there is no reason this edition should not look absolutely stunning. The picture quality is perfect, the colors are vibrant, yet natural, and it's hard to pay attention to the film when the beauty of the restoration is immaculate! But, by the time the family had finished the film, we knew we had a great time.No matter what version you watch this in, you are bound to have a great movie time as a family. But watching it on blu-ray was beyond my greatest expectations. It made a remarkable story even more beautiful, which I always thought impossible.Overall, 5 stars for an excellent film and version of the film in blu-ray.	5.0	Timeless Classic, Impossibly More Beautiful this Time Around.	2010-10-15	2	2	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	"Since this is my 100th review I've written since I started doing this a couple years ago, I decided to choose to review a movie very near and dear to me. With the rerelease of ""Beauty and the Beast"" on DVD, it seems fitting and appropriate that this is the one I choose!So many years ago, when Beauty and the Beast first was released, I hesitated going. After all, how could Disney possibly top its tremendous achievement with ""The Little Mermaid"". I ended up having to go, for the entire school where I was teaching at the time went. From the opening scene that takes us through the forest to the stained glass windows, I was totally awed.If you don't know the story (who doesn't?), Belle is an intelligent, beautiful girl smart enough to know that what society deems her life to be isn't right for her. She yearns for something more out there, something she's only read about in her books.. She heroically saves her father from an unjust prison sentence by taking his place in the Beast's delapidated castle. There, through her honesty of heart, she sees through his gruff exterior, into his honest heart. The rest, as they say, is history.Everything about this film worked back then, and it works just as magically now. The animation is crisp and daring. The songs simply spin powerfully and gently at the same time. The characters are real and realized, from the enchanted objects in the castle to the buffoon-turned-evil guy Gaston. The infamous ballroom scene, which 10 years so stunned me, still today stuns me, not for its techinical merit (after all, we've been exposed to Pixar's incredible work) but for its honesty and high emotional punch.The DVD offers many treats for ""Beauty and the Beast"" fans. On disk A, they've offered three different versions of the movie: ""Special Edition"", ""Original Release"", and a ""Work in Progress"" version that mixed some animated parts with sketches and drawings. I particulary enjoyed the commentary done by the producers and song writer Alan Menken during the ""Special Edition"". Disk B comes with several interviews on making the movies, as well as games for the kids. It seems that Disney has struggled with making their DVD's worthy of the medium, but with this release, they've finally started to learn what they can do with it!This is my third most favorite movie of all time. Perhaps it was the animation. Perhaps it was the music. Or perhaps it was being able to relate to the longing of a girl who wanted so much more for herself. Or even perhaps, it was the longing of the Beast, who only wanted something that he at first couldn't do himself; for someone to look beyond his appearance to see the beauty within. Perhaps they all work together, perfectly, in ""Beauty and the Beast""."	5.0	100 Stars for my 100th Review!	2002-10-13	2	0	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AC1U7PPQJKA9D	"James Sparks ""Hawkeye"""	"This certainly is not the first time Disney has taken a known Fairy tale or fable and put a little ""Disney"" twist on it and turned it into a feature movie, but this has to be the best adaptation of a fair tale Disney has ever done.The story is known by all, but Disney adds such a great twist to it, that it will seem to the person watching like a fresh story they had never heard before.  When Belle goes to the castle of the Beast she finds that the whole castle is enchanted, with living inanimate objects (like candlesticks, clocks, and such).  The story, plot, is so good that it rivals any movie EVER made animated or live action.Another hi-point to this movie is the music.  The songs by Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Belle, and Gaston are fun, and you'll probably be humming the music longer after the movie is over.This is the first time that Beauty and the Beast has made it onto DVD in the Platinum Edition, and it is well deserved.  One thing that makes this movie edition so good is the bonus features found in all the platinum editions from Disney.This movie truly is a classic even though it's less than twenty years old.For the movie lover and certainly for the Disney lover ""Beauty and the Beast"" should be a part of your DVD collection"	5.0	Animation at it's best	2006-04-19	4	3	1

And it continues to be great today while some other Disney blockbusters have sort of gone by the wayside. It's the music- you don't have to know the movie to be familiar with the wonderful songs that came out of this. Some of the early CGI seems a little hokey now but it's a terrific adapation of the fairy tale. A few pretty intense scenes early on with the beast and when he's attacked later that may be a bit much for the smaller guys.	5.0	Another Disney Classic	2010-12-03	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2RQZG0FUSSMPJ	Jamy Shaffer	The animated feature which revolutionalized all future animated features has finally been given the royal treatment.  The movie itself truely deserved all of its accolades.  I do feel that it was the best picture of 1991, despite what the academy said. What did win the BP Oscar in '91?  Ten years later, the masterpiece was shown in large screen/IMAX format; however, not everyone lives within close proximity to one.  The DVD is pristine in quality.  The movie has never looked better.  The work-in-progress version was fascinating to see as it was seen at the New York film festival of '91.  And the Special Edition adds so much without taking anything away from the original.  The extras are extraordinary.  The games are fun for everyone.  The behind the scenes features add detail to the pains taken in making both editons.  The inclusion of the Celine Dion/Peabo Bryson video is a nice touch.  However, did we really need a new teeny-bopper version of the title song?  My only complaint is that more could have been done with the Broadway stage production material.  Was it not possible for Mr. Eisner and the other big shots to include actual scenes from the show instead of only snap shots?  One can only hope that Eisner's vision of turning the musical into a grand, gothic, cinematic masterpiece comes to fruition.  Can't wait for The Lion King in 2003!!!!	5.0	Surpasses the Snow White Treatment	2002-10-16	0	0	0

The fact that it lost the Best Picture Oscar to Silence of the Lambs (a sick, disturbing mess) still convinces me of the imbecility of the Academy.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A28ERDII8FZQQ9	J. Daniel	"Disney's animated version of the classic tale, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" is every bit as enchanting as the ""tale as old as time"" that it tells, making its way into our hearts as well as motion picture history. Being the first film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six nominations altogether, Disney proves that it has what it takes to make an animated feature enjoyable for adults and children. I remember watching the film as a small child, and now, as an adult, is hasn't lost its luster, and everything is just as I enjoyed it before.Through brilliant animation and song, as well as some terrific voice talents, the story of unexpected love comes to new and exciting life. Small-town girl Belle is forced to head into the woods once her father turns up missing, bringing her to a gloomy, secluded castle where she finds him and his captor, a vicious-looking beast. Of course, the beginning of the movie explains the beast's origins: he was once a selfish prince who, after turning out an old beggar woman, was transformed, given an enchanted rose, and told ""if he could learn to love another, and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time.""This begins their rocky-turned-romantic relationship, as they begin to warm to one another. Meanwhile, the town brute, Gaston, has plans of his own, involving some sinister maneuvers involving Belle's father in hopes that she will agree to marry him.Many have hailed this as the best of Disney's films, and they wouldn't be wrong in saying so, either. It's easy to see why the movie has become such a success: there are elements at work in this film, just as in every other Disney film, only they seem to have taken on a small degree of maturity with this film's creation.The animation is some of the best and most believable I've seen for an animated film in a long time. Most of the scenes involving solely characters is the same as most of Disney's works, but there are scenes of pure life-like reality that have a special flare to them. The ballroom scene is one such scene: the camera angles sweep across a room filled with high-arched glass windows and a chandelier which looks as real as the words you're reading on this page. Some nice effects go into the creation of the castle as well, especially in the end once everything returns to normal.The is one of the most moving Disney soundtracks to come along since that of ""Cinderella"" and ""Pinocchio."" It is clear that composers were striving to capture the feeling and influence of their previous score for ""The Little Mermaid,"" and they truly succeed in doing so. The songs are delightful and will have kids and adults alike smiling and singing along. The score is the perfect underlining for scenes of romance as well as tension and suspense. In case you were wondering, three of the originally written songs were nominated for Academy Awards; that should say something.This is one of Disney's most ambitious and successful projects, ranking alongside such cinematic achievements as the successes of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Gone With The Wind."" Winner of the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture, as well as its Oscar nominations, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a hallmark of a time when movies were something that everyone, young and old alike, could enjoy on the same levels.Be my guest, and see this movie."	5.0	One of the Best (Disney) Movies Ever!	2002-04-16	15	12	3

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2CEX7784M8YSU	Jeffery Bauman	"Let me start by saying that I have seen ""Beauty And The Beast"" more times than any other film. It was by far my favorite when I was a little kid. I was six years old, and getting the VHS for Christmas in 1992 was one of the best presents I have ever received. I was so enthralled by this movie. The animation, the songs, and most of all the story enraptured me. And I had so much ""Beauty And The Beast"" merchandise, it's insane. Pizza Hut dolls, a Beast stuffed animal, a board game, and Velcro shoes with Belle and The Beast on them. Yes, they were technically for girls, but I didn't understand that. (I was 6 years old.) They were ""Beauty And The Beast"" shoes, and I wanted them! Anyway, I have a long 18 year history with ""Beauty And The Beast,"" and it may just be my all-time favorite film. I have absolutely no criticism for this film. In my eyes, it's perfect. When I got the Platinum Edition DVD in 2002, I realized what a truly great film ""Beauty And The Beast"" is. The animation in the ballroom sequence is groundbreaking, Alan Menken's score is fantastic, and Howard Ashman's lyrics are brilliant. Take the song ""Belle,"" for example. You learn all about Belle, her relation to the townspeople, the town itself, and Gaston's desire to marry Belle. ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Something There,"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"" are musical and lyrical works of art.The voice talent is incredible. Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Richard White (Gaston) are all perfectly cast. Paige O'Hara brings a wonderful intelligence to Belle, and Robby Benson is superb at vocalizing the Beast's inner torment. In fact, I have an autographed picture from the film signed by Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson that I got as a gift from Walt Disney World that I just cherish The animation is also wondrous to behold. There is something about hand-drawn animation that computer animation can't quite match, in my opinion. The characters in ""Beauty And The Beast"" feel so alive. The film is perfect. It was perfect in 1992 when I was 6 years old, and it's perfect now. (100/5) (Yes, I love the film that much.)Blu-Ray Review:Picture Quality: The film is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. To put it simply, the picture quality is flawless. The colors are wondrous, and  the image is razor sharp. This is by far superior to the 2002 Platinum Edition DVD version which looked more pastelish. The darker more bold colors from the original release have been restored, and it's perfection. (5/5)Sound: The DTS-HDMA 7.1 track is positively thunderous. The music fills the soundstage wonderfully. Also, when the Beast roars, it is LOUD. The 2002 DVD Dolby Digital 5.1 mix was pretty lifeless, but the Blu-Ray track has so much life to it. Perfection. (5/5)Extras: There are tons of extras here. First, there are three different versions  of the film. There's the original theatrical version (which I prefer, since it's the verison I fell in love with 18 years ago), the 2002 Special Edition which integrated the song ""Human Again"" into the movie, and a PIP version of the Work In Progress Version which was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991. There are deleted scenes, art galleries, original trailers and TV spots, and kid games which I have no interest in. Then comes the amazing ""Beyond Beauty"" documentary. This is an interactive documentary which allows you to branch off to different subjects of interest throughout. In all, the documentary runs about 2 and a half hours. This is one of the best and most interesting  documentaries on filmmaking I have ever seen. It's informative, but also highly entertaining. (5/5)Overall: (5/5) The movie and Blu-Ray are both perfection. Buy it!"	5.0	Tale As Old As Time....	2002-11-01	0	0	0

If she did, she would have went down to dinner when the Beast ordered her to. Belle has to be the most courageous Disney heroine out there. It's not until the Beast saves her from the wolves does Belle begin to start a friendship with him. And, she doesn't realize her love for the Beast until the end of the film. So, how could she possibly love the Beast to change him? The Beast changing himself in order for Belle to love him is more accurate. If I had a daughter, I would be proud if she patterened her life after Belle. She's a devoted and loving daughter to her father, she loves to read, she is independant, strong, brave and intelligent.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AOR4GK6YKDZEX	"Jennifer ""reader"""	This movie is fantastic!  Disney did a wonderful job retelling the story and animating it!  Here, Belle (Beauty) is the only daughter of Maurice (an inventor - not a merchant!).  Besides being beautiful and kind, Belle is smart and thoughtful.  She makes an ideal heroine and has set a standard ever since.  The plot is just so original and intriguing!  It's kinda hard to discribe though - but if you haven't seen this movie yet, do!  It is definitely the best Disney movie (and other Disney works follow closely behind)!  The cast is lively and fresh.  The songs are terrific (I love Belle's voice!  Paige O'hara did a really good job!), the drawings are gorgeous, and it's just . . . wonderful!  (Why did you think it made it to Broadway?)  I can't wait until it comes out again!  I need to replace my copy, which has been watched SO many times!	5.0	Disney at its absolute BEST!	2001-03-21	0	0	0

It's got everything anyone would want in a movie: Adventure, action, love, mystery, special effects, comedy and a great message: That everyone should be judged by who they are rather than what they look like. The DVD specials are also amazing and very entertaining, altough Chip's Challenge Game has been difficult at times. Overall, excellent!	5.0	My Favorite Disney Movie	2002-11-19	0	0	0

Many studios have botched blu-ray releases pretty bad.  So I scrolled down to look at the comments of others.  This product will not be released until October 2010.  Instead of a discussion of the pros and cons of blu-ray I find 8-9 year old reviews of the DVD and totally inappropriate (for this product) reviews of Amazon Marketplace orders for the DVD.  All of this needs to be removed.It is good to see that Disney is not only offering this fan favorite on blu-ray with DVD, but is including extras.  I give this 5 stars based on the writeup for the  3-disc blu-ray combo pack and my love of this movie.  I will update my review in October with an actual description of the product once I have it.	5.0	Amazon needs to fix their product reviews...	2010-07-09	6	6	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A35U2FY3ZWLGDH	"Jerrod Maruyama ""mediaboy"""	While &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; more than resotred an interest in the Disney animated musical feature, &quot;Beauty and The Beast&quot; perfected it. This is truly one of Disney's finest moments. It is the perfect combination of story, music, and character animation. And now the company has decided to re-release the Oscar nominated film on, not only the big screen but, the really big screen. January 1 2002 Disney will celebrate the tenth anniversary of this classis in Imax theaters around the world. The animation team has cleaned up some of the animated scense, improved some of the special effects and, for the first time ever in a Disney re-issue, animated a new scene to be incorporated into the film. &quot;Human Again&quot; was recorded for the initial release but the song was cut before it went to final animation. While the song has appeared in the Broadway version of the film, it has never been seen completely animated. This is an unprecedented move in the studio's long history of re-issuing their classics. Check out the Disney website to see the new trailer and read more about the resotration project. I would imagine the studio will also release the newly resotred edition on DVD soon after its limited theatrical run. With or without the extras, Beauty and the Beast is truly a masterpiece that deserves a place in everyone's home movie collections. Till this day it is the only animated feature to ever be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.	5.0	Celebrating Ten Years of Beauty and The Beast	2001-08-29	0	0	0

Disney sure knows how to do DVD.  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is considered by many to be the best animated film of all-time and Disney definitely gives it an in-depth treatment on DVD.  Both the original and the expanded IMAX edition of the film are included on the fist disc and the movie looks amazing.  The colors are so vivid and they almost jump right off the screen.  The sound is amazing too, especially on the big musical numbers like &quot;Be Our Guest.&quot;  The special features on disc 2 are pretty good too, with several small documentaries about the life of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; from fairy tale to pre-production to the actual movie and even on to the Broadway version now playing in New York City.Fans of Disney movies, cartoons, musicals, and just very good movies in general should without a doubt check this special edition out!	5.0	An enchanting movie for all ages	2003-05-27	2	2	0

Disney has finally released Beauty and the Beast on DVD, and they appear as if they've outdone themselves. We not only get a restored version of the film, but 3(!) different versions, including the work-in-progress and the IMAX re-release all in glorious widescreen. However, everything is not quite what it seems.Let's start with the presentation of the film itself. They've done a fabulous restoration as the film has never looked cleaner or brighter. The new song patched into the special edition is quite catchy and is good for variety's sake. It's wonderful to have the inclusion of the work-in-progress version, and it really displays the film's artistry. What's disappointing is that all 3 versions are on the same disc, and the quality suffers from it. The compression used has essentially created low-resolution images that often display ""jaggies"" throughout, which can be distracting. Also, the aspect ratio is different than on the original laserdisc release, effectively cropping off the top and bottom of the film so that we actually see less than what we saw in the theater. Is it any different than making the film full-screen and losing the left and right edges? Interestingly enough, the work-in-progress differs from the laserdisc release in that the title card has been replaced with the final card, a production credit has been removed from the intro, and some of the edits and transitions are rougher. The disc claims that this version is ""as shown"" at the 1991 New York Film Festival, but somehow I doubt it. It's a shame that this version wasn't put on the 2nd disc as a supplement, leaving the other two versions with a better visual quality.Nonetheless, disc 2 contains a ton of great supplemental features. Most of the good stuff documents the genesis of the film up to the Special Edition theatrical release in one form or another. Some of the other items (games, music videos) are kind of lame and are worth viewing only once. There is a very challenging ""West Wing"" game (NOT about Martin Sheen and company), but that took only a couple of times to master and the payoff is lousy. An awful lot of work for basically nothing, but my 4 year-old loves it.Still, this is the only DVD release being offered and you can't go wrong with it, despite my complaints. It's just too bad that in Disney's haste to cram as much stuff on this set as possible, they've damaged the release. 'Twas beauty that killed this ""Beast.""

I've played it many times on both computer AND DVD player and there were never any problems with sound, picture quality, or anything like that.I'd review B&B; for you, but you already know what it's about! There are 3 versions of the movie on this DVD -- the original, the extended (that played in IMAX theaters last year) and the Animator's Roughs that was shown in 1992 at an Expo.  They're all 3 great!  The extended just includes one scene extra, ""Home Again"" which is a big song and dance production.  If you like those in Disney (your kids will) movies, watch this version.  Otherwise you're not missing much by watching the regular version.  The Rough version was just fascinating to watch, and I'm so glad they included it.On top of the movie, there's a ton of DVD extras, especially for the kids. There's 4 games and a sing along, and they are extremely cute! My niece and nephew both love them to the point that I'm sick of seeing Chip!The second disk of extras seemed to me primarily alot of animation 'behind the scenes' extras, which pleased me. Animated films seem to always be a bit mysterious, and this sheds alot of light on the process while making it interesting as well.This was the best DVD purchase I've made in a long time. It's also extremely hard to find in most video stores and retailers, so I suggest you buy it here at Amazon.  Disney is going to stop making this DVD in January 2003 (next month) so I urge you to buy it while you can! You won't regret it."	5.0	Bravo Disney!

Larsen"""	"After twenty-years, this timeless Disney classic is still a beautiful film to watch and the special features on the two-disc DVD set make it even better.  Just like Bambi, I really enjoy watching the behind the scenes documentaries and learning about the creative process that goes on with the masters of Walt Disney magic: from the collaboration of a gifted writer and team of animators, to the award winning voice talents of legendary actors like Angela Lansbury, along with the innocent and soothing voices of Paige O'Hara who plays Belle and Robby Benson, best known for his voice over work on the animated TV series The Legend of Prince Valiant whom of course lends his talents to the heart and soul of the Beast.  One of my favorite behind the scenes segments on the DVD was ""Composing a Classic"" which involves a meeting with the film's composer Alan Menken taking a memorable look back at the process of creating a fitting musical score for the film while working alongside executive producer, the late Howard Ashman, whom was intensely involved in monitoring songs among other aspects of the project.  Sadly, Howard Ashman passed away just shy of the film's groundbreaking release, Beauty and the Beast would forever be remembered as his last film.The special edition DVD also has an alternate beginning that was originally scrapped early during pre production.  Looking at it now in comparison to the finished product, I can see why the folks at Disney decided to go against the writer's original film plot and redo everything from scratch.  All kidding aside, it was the best decision they could have made at that time.  Watching the movie on DVD with digitally re-mastered picture and sound adds to the magical experience.  I can remember seeing it for the first time with my twin brother and my Dad in the theatre when I was a kid.  Even now after so many years, it's still an absolute joy to watch.  Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that people of all ages will enjoy.  The film brings to light an important message about love and acceptance.  There are those few moments in life where people have to realize that it's okay to let someone into your heart even if they're completely different from the rest of us."	5.0	A Disney Classic That's Still A Joy to Watch	2012-06-26	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A356HRZZFCEGL1	"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos"""	"***This review may contain spoilers.***Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" (hereafter B&B;) is an uncontested masterpiece (and anyone who dares contest its greatness is, in my opinion, a brainless, heartless fool). Every criterion by which we judge movies (cinematography, score, characterization, plot, etc.) is flawless.  B&B; is a supreme illustration of what I like to call ""The Hamlet Syndrome"", where a work has been analyzed so frequently and so favorably, one despairs of finding something new to say about it.  What I wish to concentrate upon is certainly not new either, but I believe is the central theme of B&B; - true happiness and love can only come from overcoming selfishness and thinking of others.The Prince was a beast long before the crone placed him under her monstrous spell (why she placed the Prince's entourage and household servants under a similar spell seems a bit unclear to me; perhaps their unquestioning devotion to him deserved punishment as well).  The Prince's handsome demeanor hid a haughty selfish soul. In any event, only if the Beast exchanges and receives true love will the spell be dissolved, AND before a rose (the traditional symbol of love) loses all its petals.This task will not be easy.  The Beast wrathfully imprisons the inventor Maurice merely for seeking shelter without permission in his rococo, gloomy castle.  He reveals a trace of mercy when he agrees to free Maurice provided his beautiful bibliophile daughter Belle agrees to take his place.  Belle (the name means beauty) consents UNCONDITIONALLY, which makes her unselfish choice more noble and sets a good example for the Beast.  Subsequent events do not go smoothly, of course, as Belle is repelled, not so much by the Beast's appearance as by his domineering, crass, uncouth manner.  At length, Belle has had enough and flees into the wintry wilderness, where she is set upon by a ravenous pack of wolves.  The Beast arrives in time to save Belle but is grievously wounded in the attempt.  Belle nurses him back to health and thanks him for saving his life.  The Beast has performed a self-serving act, to be sure, but he is certainly becoming less selfish than before.  His prospects improve.Little by little, friendship grows between Belle and the Beast.  He becomes more caring, solicitous, and gentlemanly.  The friendship culminates in their spectacular waltz in the central hall rotunda.  Could this be it?  Ah, but Belle asks to view the Beast's magic mirror, which can show the viewer anyone they wish to see.  The mirror shows her father Maurice on his sickbed.  She implores the Beast to let her see him.  Sorrowfully, but gallantly, the Beast agrees.  Feeling that she might not return, the Beast gives her the mirror so that she can always see and remember him whenever she wishes.  This is the Beast third act of mercy, and his best act because he sacrifices his own happiness for that of another.Bell nurses her father back to health.  Unfortunately, Maurice has informed the townsfolk about the Beast, and Gaston, the dashing but boastful and unsuccessful suitor for Belle's affections, becomes dangerously jealous.  Lividly eager to locate the Beast's whereabouts, he finds out by wresting the mirror away from Belle, and organizes the townsfolk for an assault on the Beast's castle.  Belle races back to the castle to warn the Beast, but is too late.  Gaston finds the Beast, who is too despondent to fight back.  Gaston is about to deliver the coup de grace, but the Beast sees that Belle has come back to him.  He seizes Gaston and is about to fling him from the battlements, but his newly-awaken better nature spares Gaston's life - a fourth selfless gesture.  Treacherous ingrate Gaston stabs him in the side but the villain loses his balance and falls anyway.The Beast is dying, but Belle tearfully declares her true love for him, before the last petal falls.  The Beast gloriously transforms into his human self.  Belle, who knows better than to be fooled by superficial appearance, peers into the Prince's eyes, the traditional window to the soul.  They are the same as the Beast's, and they eventually have a triumphant wedding.The end credits of B&B; state that the Beast finds his soul.  As the movie incrementally demonstrates, he did so by following the Christian tenet - to find your soul, you must lose your soul in service towards the greater good of helping others."	5.0	The Beast's Real Curse Was Selfishness	2012-01-26	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2MR4488XNESP0	John R. Wantiez	"Did you hear that, everyone? Disney just opened their vault again! We better run out and buy, buy, buy before it's too late!!! I'm stunned Disney's tried and true marketing ploy continues to snag consumers (sheep) into making such impulsive decisions. Then again, ""go out and buy this combo pack which includes a disc you don't need"" would go over like a lead balloon, and we certainly don't want to put a crimp in Disney's bottom line.The review is supposed to be about the movie, right? Yes and no. The movie is top notch, the product Disney is cramming down the consumer's throats is not. It's all a means to keep the price of the DVD just below the $25.00 mark. I don't own a Blu-Ray player, so the Blu-Ray disc is of no use to me. If you own a Blu-Ray player, why would you want the regular DVD especially since it reportedly has less features? I'm being forced into buying a $24.99 product of which only a portion is usable by me, and vice versa for Blu-Ray owners.We've got to wake up and stop treating Disney as the sacred cow it thinks it is and realize their marketing department is a bunch of bull. I want to own this movie, I really do - but not on Disney's terms. If Disney decides to show its consumers some respect and release the DVD and Blu-Ray separately, then I'll buy their product."	1.0	Where's the value, Disney?	2010-10-05	27	6	21
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AIUX1X3GRRBFK	John Waters	The DVD release of this film was for me the most anticipated of any movie I have been waiting for, and I am an avid Star Wars fan, with a DVD collection of 300+.  The DVD couldn't have been done better in my opinion.  Great for adults and kids alike.  I don't mind telling you that watching this movie on October 8th brought me to tears, with all the emotion I felt in 1991 coming back like a wave.  The special features are very interesting (unlike some DVD's that you never even watch the special features).  I never knew so much went into an animated film.  It was particularly fun to watch the Disney Exec's talk about their feelings when the film was so widely accepted and praised. Do yourself and your kids a favor, and buy this DVD!! I bought 5 of them, this will be a hard to find item some day as a lot of Disney's work is, I will be prepared.	5.0	Disney's most AMAZING work ever!!!!!	2002-10-14	2	2	0

Saw it so many times in the theater that I'm surprised my wife of then six years didn't dump me.  As many have said, the colors are beautiful; there is depth to the multi-layered scenery; the sound is great.  However, I'm having an issue with the picture quality on the animation.  When there is a long shot, everything is fine, but when there is a close-up of any character it seems there is a amall white ""outline"" around any ink-line within the character's figure.  We have a 50"" plasma 1080, so it's distracting.  Is it just me and my set-up?  Anyone else notice this?"	3.0	Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this edition . . . .	2010-10-09	8	7	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A36KS1IQTNH10M	Joseph A. Jenkins Jr.	What can I say that others have not?  After it was nominated, Michael Medvid and others thought that it should have won for BEST PICTURE at the Academy Awards.  Instead the Academy gave the honor to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Never were there two films as diametrically opposed.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was family fare with charming music, skillful animation, and a happy ending.  Hannibal the Cannibal, on the other hand, gave us a lurid R-rated tale with gross violence, nudity, and the partial triumph of evil.  The word leaked out that while the Disney production was the better film, the Academy felt compelled to give the award to a film with live-action human actors.Disney was unprepared for the subsequent backlash against their film from celebrities in the acting field.  Not mentioned on the DVD was the fact that the subsequent Broadway production was, in large part, an attempt at appeasement to the acting community that publicly lamented the use of cartoons over live actors in the musical.We all know the story.  An inhospitable young man is punished by an enchantress by being transformed into a hairy monster.  His servants are changed into various household items.  They are reduced from persons into things or objects-- always the price of inhospitality.  The Beast has until his 21st birthday to find someone to love who will love him in return.  If he does not, the last petal on a mystical rose will fall and he will remain a monster forever.  When all seems lost, a beautiful girl comes into his life who softens his heart of stone.  A rival suitor will try to kill him, but her love for him will win the day.The story has always been a wonderful metaphor, a parable so to speak.  Without love, we are all monsters.  With love, life is given its meaning and we are changed.>No nudity.>No vulgar language or blasphemy.>Plot violence.>Some female characters are top heavy and revealing.>A few characters are obvious womanizers and flirtatious.	5.0	Beauty and the Beast BITES!	2002-11-25	2	1	1

For all of you that can speak both languages (English-Spanish), I really recommend this version. I was surprised to enjoy the great translation/adaptation that Disney made of the main songs.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A13KXWTN0DT878	"Josh ""Josh"""	Disney's great. Supplying the fans with such detailed releases of the most beloved Disney movies. Beauty & the Beast is high on almost every Disney lover's list, and I'm certain that this dvd will satisfy them. Satisfied me.Three versions of the film are available. The original theatrical version, the special edition, and the unfinished version. The new musical number included in the special edition is a fun one, and to see simple artwork throughout the unfinished version is a fun watch. The tons of supplemental material is too much to actually review. But it shows that Disney cares.The film was the first animated picture to be nominated for Best Picture, and rightfully so. The combination of romance, humor, adventure, and even a bit of fright make the film one to reach almost every person's heart. Forever memorable characters were introduced in the film, and the morale of the story is great.Uberinstant Disney fun all-time favorite major classic! In my once again 7 year old mind, that's how I would describe Beauty and the Beast. Wait no, actually, that's how I describe it now. Eleven years later and this movie has not changed (Except for the new musical number), and neither has the magic it has given changed.	5.0	Disney's Spectacular	2003-05-20	1	1	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2L4I94MZRYL4M	Joshua C. Steffey	I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast and know the story by heart. I love the story. I love the characters. And I love how the movie is just so damn good after over 20 years of it's release date. Honestly, what's not to like or love about this movie.As for the blu-ray, the color saturation is sharper and more crisp, but it's still the same film. You have the option to watch the theatrical version (which I prefer, personally) or the extended edition that's about roughly 10 extra minutes of new scenes. The extended edition is... okay. In that version, there was a new musical scene added called &#34;I Can't Wait to be Human Again&#34;. I remember seeing that in I-MAX theaters in Charleston back when I was in 7th grade. I understood the directors and other crew members of the film wanted to add that scene long ago when the movie was in production, but couldn't. Don't know why, but I still feel like the original version still holds up. I felt like the theatrical version was so perfect in its own way it didn't need anything. If added anything it would have ruined the film overall. This is my opinion, obviously, but for those who love the extended version that's fine. I just like this original piece just as it is. There's tons of new video commentaries about the making of the film, which I'm deeply fascinated to know more about the animators, directors, etc...I also have to add this to my comment. My biggest and highest praised criticism I give to this film is the musical score of Beauty and the Beast. Alan Menken is incredibly gifted for making original musical pieces for most of the '90's disney films, like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pochahontas, and most recently Tangled. His gift in music writing and orchestration delivers an atmostphere that brings the kid in a lot of us. Whichever movie you like that had Menken's score done to it, Beauty and the Beast not only had a great score, but also some of the most memorable, and delivering songs still adored by audiences today.It's a great movie with great songs. What can I say except I love Beauty and the Beast and it'll forever be a movie that I'll cherish and treasure years to come.	5.0	'90's Nostalgia Reborn	2013-05-02	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A75FAUW3VXNKL	Joshua M. Clark	This is Disney's best movie. Unlike their more recent films with distorted super-heroines, Belle was a real lady in this film. And the beast's viciousness was so clearly portrayed in the beginning, only to be balanced by the utterly gentle demeanor he had in the end. This is a film that depicts proper love between a man and a woman, with each person eventually fulfilling their roles with sacrifice and kindness. The end result is a smashing of evil, and a glorious triumph of good.	5.0	Beautiful	2002-09-09	4	2	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AFJSIYD8FXZEE	Kaitlyn	I have loved everything Disney since birth...I can remember watching my sister's VHS copy of 'The Little Mermaid' over and over, every day as a toddler. I was so excited when I became a teenager and began building my own dvd collection, I spent a lot of time obtaining all my favorite disney classics, and now I'm going to do the same for blu-ray. I just purchased the beauty and the beast blu ray diamond edition, and received it this past monday. It's amazing, beauty and the beast is (tied with the little mermaid) for my favorite disney movie. I know it word for word, every song, even the dialogue...Belle also happens to be (and always has been) my favorite disney princess. She's intelligent, and self-less when it comes to others, finds the good in others that isn't apparent to everyone else. She enjoys reading..ever since I was little my mom has told me I look exactly like Belle, and that I remind her of this beloved disney princess because I'm not the type to sit up in my tower and wait for prince charming, I'm an adventurer, a bit of a rebel, quiet and low-key. All in all...this movie is amazing, and it felt like I was little again watching it for the first time. It never fails to make me cry. Disney did a beautiful job, and i'm so glad to see it remastered	5.0	Amazing	2011-02-12	1	1	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1Y1WUGSOGM2OX	Kaitlyn	This is one of Disney's classics!  Great soundtrack, great characters, and great plot.A young French girl named Belle goes looking for her father who got lost on his way to an inventions fair.  She ends up at this castle in the middle of the forest where she meets a prince who is actually this monstrous beast who had been transformed into this creature by a fairy princess long ago for being heartless.  Belle bargains herself for her father's release, and the story between Belle and the Beast begins to unfold.Other characters in the movie include Chip and his mother Mrs. Potts (voiced by Angela Lansbury), Lumiere (voiced by Jerry Orbach...from Law and Order!), Cogsworth, and Gaston.  Typical to the Disney movie, it pits the good versus the bad in a somewhat more lighthearted way with great songs that everyone sings along with.This new edition of the DVD I honestly don't think is much better than the original.  They have lots of added goodies yes, but the famous new scene added into the movie with the new song &quot;To Be Human Again&quot; while a cute song, just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie after you've become accustomed to the original.  I think they should've left it alone, but I wouldn't mind buying a soundtrack that included the new song.Classic, great, been one of my favorites since it was originally released.

I'm hoping to get this tear-jerker again for my birthday in November, the same month this movie came out. Recently, I found my old platinum edition (which is 12 years old) before I had a babysitting job and was dissapointed when it started skipping 15 minutes into the movie, because I wanted to bring it with me. I seriously can recite monolouge from the movie and know all the songs. If you have a small child, buy this movie, and maybe 12 years from now they'll be buying a replacement copy after falling in love and watching it so many times to the point it's fried, like I did.	5.0	favorite:)	2013-08-31	0	0	0

I didn't want to get the Diamond Edition at first, thinking it was silly to have two copies of the same thing, but I changed my mind when I watched my mom's copy of the Diamond Edition. The colors are much crisper and cleaner, making the picture more vibrant than the DVD version. I also liked the menu, which was easier to navigate than the DVD menu as far as choosing the theatrical version over the version with the added scene. I haven't watched any of the extras on this version, so I can't comment on those, but the improved picture quality of the movie itself makes this a worthwhile purchase.	5.0	Disney classic makes it to Blu-Ray	2011-02-21	1	1	0

I use to watch it all the time as a child, so much so that at 3 my mother accidentally-on-purpose smashed the VHS so she wouldn't have to watch it again, and had to repurchase it when I wouldn't stop crying.Of all the Disney Princesses, Belle is my favorite because she is brave, and strong, and she didn't need someone to save her. Belle was okay with who she was and didn't want to fit in, and I think her personality is inspiring to women across the world. She is also kind, and compassionate, who else could love a beast and give up her freedom to save her father?Usually, I love the original stories by the Grimms or Anderson more than Disney, but based on the graphic horrors of the original, I actually prefer the Disney version.This is a much watch movie!	5.0	I Love This Movie SO Much!	2013-12-17	1	0	1

Belle is witty, curious, and fun with a bold edge that makes you root for her throughout the film. This story, a classic, retells how a bold, bookworm beauty managed to tame the cruel heart of a prince enchanted into a beast. Colorful animation sequences and wonderful songs bring the story to life on the screen. The backgrounds are stunning, each hand painted with oils and each holding that special detail only a brush can capture. All of the characters are fun to follow, especially the blond triplets that adore Gaston, and even Gaston's sidekick is a riot that takes a bit away from the serious tone of the tale.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2RN05UDH183AV	"K. Bourn ""bohemiangirlpdx"""	When I saw &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in the theater, I had a rare and magical experience:  I felt like a child again watching an enchanting Disney movie.  In fact, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; seemed even better than the Disney classics like &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; that were such a wonderful part of my childhood.  The animation is absolutely gorgeous--particularly the waltz scene, which feels incredibly three-dimensional.  The songs are beautiful, singable instant classics.Despite the animated characters, I felt like I was watching an old musical.  The movie opens with a scene reminiscent of &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; with our heroine, Belle, singing on a hilltop about wanting more out of life.  The &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; scene, featuring a Lumiere (the Maurice Chevalier-inspired singing candlestick), dancing dishes and champagne corks popping like fireworks, reminded me of the Busby Berkely musical extravaganzas of the '30s.A big appeal for me is that Belle is a much different heroine than the Disney princesses of my childhood.  Belle isn't looking for a man to rescue her from her life of drudgery.  She loves to read and longs for a more interesting life.  She already has the &quot;town catch,&quot; Gaston, wanting to court her, but she's having none of it.Belle's escape from &quot;her provincial life&quot; begins when her father, a kooky inventor, doesn't return from his travels.  (He has sought shelter from a snow storm in a spooky enchanted castle and is being held prisoner by the Beast.)  Belle tracks down her father and, out of concern for his ailing health, takes his place in captivity.  The Beast, who has been placed under a spell, wonders if Belle might be &quot;the one&quot;--the young woman whose love will return him to his original human form.The enchanted furniture, candlestick, clock and dishes added lots of fun characters to the traditional story.  Cogsworth, a stuffy clock, and Lumiere, the match-making candlestick are a great comic duo.  Cogsworth's romantic advice to Beast about wooing Belle is especially funny:  Give her &quot;flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.&quot;Gaston, meanwhile, wants to woo and wed Belle himself.  He sings about his he-man attributes in one of the funniest ode to a redneck that I've ever heard:  &quot;I use antlers in all of my decorating,&quot; Gaston sings about himself.When Gaston realizes that Belle loves the Beast instead of him, he stirs up an angry mob to head to the castle.  In another twist on the traditional fairy tale ending, Belle ultimately rescues the Beast--not the other way around.&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a delightful classic whether you are a child or a grownup who knows how to feel like a child at times.	5.0	A thinking girl's heroine	2002-11-26	5	4	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A11MGPEYU3VO1U	Keith Niemeyer	My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 17 around 25%. Most are short duration with the exception of rain drops/streaks falling up to 25% for an extended period. Almost no flaws in the 3D made it pleasant to watch, BUT...THE BIG BUT:  Simplistic shading of most objects and characters, create an effect, where even though the scenes have a 3D layering, individual objects usually look like flat cardboard cutouts standing at different depths.Children should dismiss the flat objects in a depth-field and love this film but adult viewers have come to expect more from 3D.MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.

We need to see past the outside and see other people's insides.  C. S. Lewis wrote a novel called ""Till We Have Faces.""  When we see other people's faces, we begin to love them.  The key is seeing past the beast and seeing the image of God engraven on other's countenances.  That is the pure love of Christ!This film has everything that you want in a tale: a good heroine, an antagonist that becomes the protagonist, hilarious buffoons, and a villain you can really hate.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2MH0QDRZFWF2S	Kenton Larsen	"Widely regarded as a modern-day classic, Beauty and the Beast boasts action, danger, romance comedy, and fantastic musical numbers. It's also the only ""cartoon"" to be nominated for the best-picture Oscar.The film takes place in an animated France (and when aren't theFrench animated?) and opens with the introduction of ""Belle"", the beauty who loves reading so much that she fails to notice most everything around her, including the advances of boorish stud, Gaston.One day, Belle's father, a crackpot inventor, ventures out into a strange forest and encounters a cursed castle. When he is taken prisoner by the castle's beastly inhabitant, Belle must come to his rescue.First and foremost, Beauty and the Beast proves that not all cartoons are for kids. In many ways, the characters in Beauty and the Beast are more real than other films with flesh and blood actors. In fact, most actors would kill for roles like these.My personal favorite of the film's many great characters is Gaston, the best Disney villain of all time, a conceited buffoon and deadly enemy. Gaston's theme song is one of the funniest scenes from any film -- probably ever. ""No one's slick as Gaston/No one's quick as Gaston/No one's neck is incredibly thick as Gaston,"" sing the boozers at the local watering hole to Gaston, who proudly displays his antler collection and chest hair.Where other films pander to select audiences, Beauty and the Beast truly has something for everyone."	5.0	A modern-day classic	2002-01-25	1	0	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2WO89WQPZ8S1Y	KerinSM	"As we all know, Beauty and the Beast is one of the best Disney classics, otherwise why would you be looking for this dvd?  This collection is great for the spcial features as well as the feature film itself.The extended edition includes a new song ""When We're Human Again"".  This song is a great addition to the movie.  It doesn't add any substantial substance to the plot, but it's a great fun number that doesn't throw the plot off so it's a nice addition.  I was a little susprised to see it in the film, but it was definitely a good surprise.  It dives into the secondary characters a bit more and the lives in the castle so it adds another layer to the story that has gone unseen until now.As an arts student learning maya, I loved the animated and storyboard feature.  The feature screen is located in the upper left portion of the screen so it's not distracting if you want to focus on the regular film.  The images vary between the storyboard, animated drawings, and regular film (as it fills in the gaps when needed).  I noticed that the colors in the blu-ray version are much brighter than what I was used to from the VHS version, and I think this can be seen in the storyboard version as the colors seem to be darker in that version.The interviews with the cast of the Broadway version are also really interesting.  I like the fact that they had commentary for many different Beauties.  Hearing their various perspectives was very insightful along with hearing from different members of the cast as well.  I wish they would have showed film from an actual show, but this was also a fresh alternative.What a great movie!  Almost as great as the features!"	5.0	The extended features are great	2011-03-07	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"I don't know why I've waited so long to review this film.  It is simply one of the greatest animated features of all time.  From the wonderful songs to the wonderful cast to the lovely animation, this film hits on all cylinders.  It's a moral story as old as time itself:  Beauty lies not upon the face, but within the heart.  If you haven't seen this movie, please consider renting or buying it soon.  It doesn't matter what age you are because this movie appeals to all age groups.Our heroine is, of course, the lovely Belle, who gives her freedom up so that her father can be released from Beast's castle.  Beast's servants, especially Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts, devise a plan for Belle to fall in love with Beast in order to break the curse that all of them suffer from.  Of course, much like in ""Frankenstein,"" that which is misunderstood is considered a monster and Belle's arrogant would-be suitor, Gaston, sets out to free his damsel-in-distress.The voice cast is wonderful.  It includes Robby Benson (Beast), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Jerry Orbach (my favorite, Lumiere), David Ogden Steirs (Cogsworth/Narrator), and Paige O'Hara as Belle.  Richard White portrays the selfish oaf, Gaston, and does a wonderful job.The music is top notch.  Composed by Alan Menken and given lyrics by Howard Ashman, the songs are some of the best and most memorable in Disney's catalogue.  From ""Be Our Guest"" to ""Gaston,"" they are all winners here.The animation is classic and contemporary at the same time.The DVD is nice.  It comes complete with the original and special editions of the film and a plethora of wonderful documentaries on the making of the film, it's music, and many other things as well.You would be wise to add this masterpiece to your collection.  I highly recommend it."	5.0	A Modern Disney Masterpiece	2007-02-07	2	2	0

The Blu-ray/DVD combo gives you the flexibility to use it on different machines, even if currently you only have one. The best part about it is that you can choose between watching the extended edition and the original theatrical edition. The difference is mainly in the inclusion of a song called &#34;Human Again.&#34; For those of us who grew up watching the VHS and want what we love, it's great that we can choose the original version. The previous DVD release included the extended version only. So this one is definitely the one to buy if you want the flexibility of having multiple formats and multiple versions.	5.0	This is the version to buy!!!!!!!!!!!	2013-08-07	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR	"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl"""	"Beauty and the Beast is not your typical fairytale love story. Rather, it is a substantially more complex story that deals with issues of prejudice, xenophobia and equality. To some extent this is one of the main reasons for its phenomenal success over the years and why it truly deserves the title ""story as old as time"". It not only manages to appeal to children, effectively teaching them some important life morals, but it also manages to touch a deeper level with adults, highlighting issues that as a society we would prefer to pretend do not exist. The main characters portrayed here of Belle (Paige O'Hara), the Beast (Robby Benson) and Gaston (Richard White) are quite complex when compared to the fairytale characters one typically encounters; and in many respects they are even the polar opposites. Belle for instance, is immediately distinguished from the other villagers as being ""quite odd"" due to her interest in reading and adventure. Likewise as the story unfolds, Gaston progressively shifts from being the epitome of man to becoming the monster as the Beast slowly becomes more human.This presentation is also perfectly suitable for children and several amusing characters are available to provide comic relief throughout the feature. These include such wonderful characters as Lumiere (Jerry Orbach) the French candlestick, Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) the pompous clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) the very personable teapot and Chip (Bradley Pierce) the little boy as a teacup. In addition there are several others including Belle's father Maurice (Rex Everhart), her horse Philippe (Hal Smith) and the ever-lovable ottoman dog (Frank Welker). These are wonderful characters that never overly distract from the main story, as so many useless animated characters have a tendency to do in other animated features.In closing, this adaptation of the ageless story of Beauty and the Beast is a magnificent effort, by a magnificent team, and it definitely deserves the fine reputation it has as one of the best animated films of all time. The presentation on DVD is also amongst the very best available and is certainly worth adding to any collection!"	5.0	The best Disney movie ever!	2004-12-17	2	2	0

(therefore disney did thier job potraying someone stuck up) maybe it can be said that its thier best film ever.  but its heavily competitive against lion king.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2GPEV42IO41CI	Kona	Disney's musical, animated version of the old fairy tale is truly a thing of beauty. As the story opens, a handsome but proud prince shuns an old woman, thus starting the magic spell that turns him into a hideous Beast.  In the nearby village, the heroine, Belle, is considered quite odd because she likes to read books. She is pursued by Gaston, the town bully, but she'll have nothing to do with the lout. When Belle's eccentric father becomes a prisoner in the Beast's castle, she agrees to take his place. Gradually, she and the Beast fall in love, and as the magic spell that held him is broken, he becomes the handsome prince again, changed by the power of love.The outstanding soundtrack is full of clever, romantic, and fun-to-sing tunes that stay with you. Angela Landsbury plays Mrs. Potts, the enchanted tea pot, bringing warmth and class to the film. This is the stuff little girls' dreams are made of.	5.0	Tale as old as time...	2004-09-25	3	3	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A29R4FCO6RFX4K	"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy"""	The Little Mermaid saw Disney back on from, but Beauty and the Beast cemented the studio's reputation as a major driving force in revolutionary animation. The film would go on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film. A pity that the recent new category of 'Best animated film' wasn't around back in 1991, Beauty and the Beast would have been a shoe in. Regardless, this is a landmark film that deserves all the praise that critics give it, and it is also my No.1 favorite animated movie. The style is particularly intriguing, playing more like live action rather than the cartoony antics of 70s Disney. Intentional no doubt, and it works to a high standard. The voice work is notably impressive, especially in the new song created for the DVD `Human Again'. It is indeed a rare thing to experience a perfect movie, especially in the era of heartless 3D rubbish like Shark Tale and Madagascar. Again Alan Menkin and Howard Ashman's influence in story and songwriting is to the fore, and the fantastically detailed animation is a treat to the eye. So much love and care has been put into this movie, and unlike previous offerings, Beast has a perfect blend of catchy songs, unforgettable characters and surprisingly emotionally driven drama. This is a true masterpiece.	5.0	Another great Disney movie	2005-07-09	1	1	0

The beginning of the movie does have some dark scenes that could scare children. It also has strong magic overtones if that is something that bothers you. That being said Beauty and the Beast is the only movie with a set strong-willed princess (Mulan & Pocohantas & Enchanted ladies excluded).

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2X3M0LWJX96VL	Laura Bellamy	This is Disney in top form...which, unfortunately, you just don't see anymore.  This particular movie is the crown jewel in Disney's repertoire.  They should have done more movies like this one.As was always the case, the music is beautiful, the story is sound, the writing is clever, and the animation is simply astounding.This Platinum Edition features a new song that was not in the original theatrical release, a funny little number called &quot;Human Again.&quot;  I was fairy trepidatious going into this film, worrying that the added scene was going to kind of ruin it for me, but lo and behold, Disney pulled it off beautifully!  That is something I did not expect.  The transition was seamless, you would never have guessed, if you didn't already know, that this scene was not in the original.And, for those who are total purists and don't care to see the added song, they also give you the option of watching the original without anything extra.They ALSO put in an option to watch the &quot;Work-In-Progress&quot; -- which shows the movie in its entirety, moving back and forth from sketches to midway to finished product.  It's quite interesting to see the transitions!And of course, on top of all that, they have the making-of, and the special documentay features, which are worth watching if you, like myself, are fascinated by the makings of movies of any kind.  I never cease to be amazed at how a traditional cartoon is put together, it's phenomenal!All in all, this special DVD is well worth the money you pay for it!  Disney may be losing its image these days, but movies like this one will forever remain priceless.	5.0	Still the best Disney	2003-12-15	1	1	0

Burchett ""KPED"""	"I just bought the Beauty and the Beast Diamond edition and first thing I did was race home to watch it and what a disappointment! The blu ray edition looks terrible on both a plasma and LCD tv. The animation doesn't look hand drawn anymore its like DIsney is trying to convert the magic of the old disney films into the crappy animation of newer kids movies. The coloring wasn't bad and neither was the sound, its simply that it seems like the artistry of the original movie isn't in the new release. Luckily the DVD version looks good on a LCD tv but still not on a plasma. My parents have the original VHS release of this movie and I would rather watch it a million times over this ""newer edition"". I wish Disney would just leave their classic movies alone they were amazing in their original production. If it isn't broke, DON'T fix it!"	1.0	Woe to those who have Plasma Tvs	2010-10-13	9	2	7

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A19RAJY6R7USN0	"Lee Neville ""emotionboy"""	So much can be said about the magic of &quot;Beauty and The Beast&quot;, the only animated feature to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, but for this review I'm gonna stick with talking about the special features on the DVD.This Disney Platinum DVD is a 2 Disc set.Disc 1 features 3 versions of &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast&quot;, and it is all done via a High-Definition Transfer using Digital Technology. The first version is what the DVD packaging is promoting and that is the Special Edition version. This features some minor animation changes which you probably won't notice and an additional musical sequence called &quot;Human Again&quot;. This song was used in the Broadway version of &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast&quot; and proved very popular. And so composer Alan Menken re-worked the song for the Special Edition, and the Disney animators brought it to life in animation. It is all done seamlessly to blend in with the original version as if it was meant to be there in the first place. The second version on this DVD is the Original Theatrical Edition. The third version is the Work In Progress Edition and for true afficianados this is a real find, and here is why- When Beauty &amp; The Beast was first shown to an audience it wasn't quite finished. Some of the animation was incomplete and so parts were in pencil test form. However, despite that being the case, audiences were still moved by &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast&quot;. Now with this version you can see many of the rare pencil tests that made up the movie.Disc 1 also has an Audio Commentary from the filmmakers and a sing along track. In other words, you can watch the whole film, and when the songs are performed the lyrics appear on screen. Also on this Disc 1 is the first part of a game calledMaurice's Invention Workshop Game whcih continues on Disc 2.And so onto Disc 2. Here we have a preety pointless Disney's Enchanted Environments. Here you can watch moving pictures of things like a fireplace. Great huh? Anyhoo there is also a Character Profile Game, Chip's Musical Challenge Game, the continuance of the game from Disc 1, &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; Music Video By Jump 5 and theatrical trailers.There are also various documentaries which you can visit at different locations on the DVD. The problem here is that you will realize that certain apparently different directions will lead to the same place. In other words you could go one way and find various short documentaries, whereas if you went another way you might find those same small documentaries, just edited together as one big documentary. It's a bit of a cheat really, and greatly affects my opinion of this DVD. Anyway, the headed small documentaries include The Story Behind The Story; The Broadway Musical; Disney's Animation Magic; The Story-Bringing The Story To The Screen; Early Presentation Reel; The Music-Alternate Score: The Transformation, Alternate Version: &quot;Be Our Guest,&quot; Deleted Song: &quot;Human Again,&quot; Beauty And The Beast Music Video, Original Demo Recordings With Introduction By Alan Menken.There are also lots of animation galleries, animation tests and much more.Disney have managed to fit a lot onto this DVD set, but the big disppoinment is thinking there were more documentaries than there were. Still, the movie is simply the best animated feature, and worth a proud place among your DVD collection. Oh and also, take a look at the thin side of the DVD packaging and you find the letter I. This is because this is the beginning of a 3 part collection. II is &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&quot;, and III is &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast: Belle's Magical World&quot;.	5.0	Best Animated Feature	2003-03-26	3	3	0

How could kids even find the games let alone play them. And why do Blu Ray discs take FIVE MINUTES to start. Even pushing buttons to hurry it up, it takes forever staring at blank screen. No wonder blu ray is struggling in the market place. It just aint worth the hassles and now it seems it is becoming hard to return to a scene, turn off the disc for five minutes and you need to go back to square one. Nuts. !!!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1EEG7YJIYN60B	Lesley Aeschliman	"Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) is a two disc set; the first disc contains several versions of the film and some bonus features, while the second disc is comprised entirely of bonus features.The menu for the first disc is in a street sign motif (the street sign is designed to be like one from the little village where Belle and her father lived). From here, you can choose to play the movie (which will automatically default to the Special Edition version), setup (choose the spoken language and whether or not you want English for the hearing impaired captions), scene selection (the scene selection was done in a storybook setting, and there are 22 scene selections in all), see the bonus material, see an intro for a game that appears on disc two, and see ""sneek peaks"" of upcoming Disney releases (there are a total of seven ""sneak peeks"").If you go into the bonus features, you can choose to see the Special Edition version of the film (with or without audio commentary), the original theatrical film, the ""work in progress"" version of the film that was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991, or you can see the film with a ""Sing-Along"" track to sing along with the songs in the film. The only thing different about the Special Edition is that a song originally cut from the film (""Human Again"") is put back in; personally, I thought the new sequence helped to enhance the story. You get to see the enchanted objects excited about becoming human again, and you also get to see Belle and the beast getting even closer than you did in the original film. The ""work in progress"" version was interesting to watch, in order to see some of the animatics and storyboards for the sections of the film that were not completed in time for the festival; however, this is not a version of the film that I would watch very often. The audio commentary for the Special Edition was amusing and entertaining, and you learned a lot about what went on behind the scenes.Also included in the bonus material is ""Maurice's Invention Workshop Game,"" where a player helps Chip finish building Maurice's machine to get a code to open the castle door for the ""Break the Spell"" game on disc two. In order to play this game, the viewer needs to answer questions about the film by choosing one of the objects on the side of the screen that answers the question; the interface for this is to choose the answer by using the arrow keys on the player's remote. I thought the interface was a little cumbersome, and, overall the questions were rather simple (I assume this was done in order to make it easier for young kids to play the game).The second disc's menu has a stained glass window motif. There are four stained glass windows: Cogsworth and Lumiere, Chip, Mrs. Potts, and the rose (which is an entrance to the forbidden ""west wing""). The first time you click on the rose window, the beast growls about that being the west wing, and that it is forbidden to go there. If you click on it a second time, it takes you to the ""Break the Spell"" game. You use the code you got from the game on disc one and enter the castle. You and Chip see in the magic mirror that the glass case has blown off the rose during the storm. You must follow Chip and complete tasks on the way. For each mistake you make, one petal falls off the rose. When five petals have fallen, the game is over, and no one becomes human again. I can't say much about the actual game itself, because I never made it past the first task (trying to avoid hitting candles on the dining table).If you choose Cogsworth and Lumiere's window, you get a lot of the background information about the film and musical (documentary-type pieces, artwork, etc.). Included here are ""Origins of Beauty and the Beast,"" development (which includes an early presentation reel), story (which includes an alternate version of ""Be Our Guest"" and the deleted song ""Human Again"" with storyboards), music (which includes an alternate score for the beast's transformation and the deleted song ""Human Again"" with storyboards), production design (including galleries for concept art, design and layouts, and backgrounds), animation (including animation tests, roughs, clean ups, and a pencil version of the beast's transformation), tricks of the trade (including a camera move test), release and reaction (including awards, Howard Ashman: In Memoriam, two theatrical trailers and four TV spots, original release and large format publicity galleries, and the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song), and the Broadway musical (musical publicity gallery and costume design gallery).If you choose Chip's window, you get ""Disney's Animation Magic"" (a documentary hosted by the young stars of ""Even Stevens,"" which is designed to show kids how animation is done), the video for Jump 5's version of the theme song, and ""Chip's Musical Challenge Game."" In the game, the player watches what objects are chosen for making the music, then the player must choose the items in the exact same order; again, this game utilizes the arrow buttons on the remote. This game was definitely intended for kids; as an adult, I found it to be rather tedious.If you choose Mrs. Potts' window, you get some documentaries, the music video for Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's version of the theme song (which opens with Celine Dion talking about the song, and closes with an ad for soundtracks featuring Beauty and the Beast music), and ""Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game"" (after choosing your gender, Mrs. Potts asks you multiple choice questions; from your answers, she determines which Beauty and the Beast character you are most like). The main documentary, ""Tales as Old as Time: The Making of Beauty and the Beast,"" runs about 28 minutes long, is bookended by an opening and a closing by Celine Dion, and includes interviews with a number of people involved with the film. The other ""documentaries"" are ""The Story Behind the Story,"" where celebrity hosts reveal the stories behind seven other Disney films; this includes an introduction hosted by Celine Dion. Personally, I wonder why ""The Story Behind the Story"" section was included, since it has nothing to do with Beauty and the Beast (and the DVD already has quite a few extras on it).The magic mirror, which is also part of the interface of disc two, shows everything available.Despite the few faults I think the Beauty and the Beast (Platinum Edition) has, I feel that this DVD is a must-have for any DVD library."	4.0	A pretty decent DVD release of an excellent Disney film	2007-11-15	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AFOK05KDCHSHL	Libretio	BEAUTY AND THE BEAST(USA - 1991)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track Dolby StereoTo save her father from a fate worse than death, an unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) agrees to be imprisoned inside an enchanted castle where the furniture is made up of living, breathing characters and the master of the house (Robby Benson) has been condemned by a witch to live in the form of a monstrous Beast. Only love can lift the curse...Sheer cinematic joy! Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest classics of Disney's 'golden age'.Returning to the European folk tales which had inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves, the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury), and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. Sadly, the film is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who passed away shortly before the movie opened in 1991.PS. A musical number cut from the narrative was restored for a subsequent IMAX version, and the entire film will be reworked in 3-D for its 2010 re-release.PSS. The movie was subsequently adapted - to great acclaim - for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of video-only sequels. Stick with the original.	4.0	Timeless classic for the modern era	2003-03-21	7	6	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A38RO46GVRD56P	"Linda ""Mom of 5"""	"I know this can be considered a book review but please humor me.  I just finished reading a beautiful book by Robin McKinley entitled ""Beauty - a retelling of the story of Beauty and the Beast.""  It is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. The imagery is so imaginative and vivid, I could swear I'd read it before. Then I realized that, though I hadn't read this book before, I had seen it. Disney's beautiful version of Beauty and the Beast uses much of the imagery McKinley utilizes in her book. I'm not saying that the stories are by any means identical. For example McKinley's story is quite a bit different than Disney's tale in that Beauty has two sisters (who aren't ugly or wicked) who figure prominently in the story. It is the imagery that is similar. The candles and lamps that light themselves, a magical teapot, a magical and self-serving feast that dances across a very long dining table, a huge and friendly Clydesdale-like horse, a walking footstool, a magic rose that signals the end of the beast's chance at love, a magical wardrobe in Beauty's room, birds that eat from her hand, the beast's inability to manage silverware when eating, a stained glass window that describes the downfall of a privileged young man, a mirror-like table through which Beauty can view her family's activities, and much more - right up to the bells, chimes, fireworks and wind that accompany the Beast's metamorphosis. Also, Disney's Beast is a nearly identical physical match for the Beast described by McKinley. The similarities were so uncanny that I popped in my old VHS copy of Disney's movie to view the credits. So much of Disney's animated imagery is lifted directly from McKinley's novel - which was written in 1978 - that I could not believe McKinley's name did not appear in the story credits! How unfair! I wonder if McKinley consulted a lawyer. Be that as it may, if you love this movie, you will love reading this book."	5.0	I hope Disney gave author Robin McKinley some credit on this DVD	2007-10-11	1	0	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"There a lot of Disney films based off of fairy tales; Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid to name a few.  While, Cinderella and Snow White remain favorites to this day, Beauty and the Beast is probably the only one that is consistently funny, has good songs, and a great cast of characters.If one has not seen ""Beauty and the Beast"", the basic story goes: Belle is a bookish woman who doesn't fit in, but as her name suggest, her beauty is unparalleled.  Her father is an eccentric inventor and is trying to become a famous inventor.  When he stumbles across the Beast's castle, he is on the way to an inventor's contest, and then he is imprisoned by the Beats who is incapable of love.  This is a very touching film because the Beast is a man who has never learned to love, and Belle has a hard time loving someone who would imprison her or her father, but eventually as time goes by, she begins to see that he is not as bad as he seemed.  It gives wonderful message that you cannot always judge someone based upon their looks, and sometimes you just need to really know a person before you can decide whether or not they are worth knowing - despite first impressions.Admittedly I had not watched ""Beauty and the Beast"" since it came out, until recently, and I had forgotten that it is more than a children's film.  The story is very predictable, but is filled with so much fabulous music, characters with actual depth, and beautiful animation it overshadows the story.  This movie has the perennial heroine that all the other Fairy Tale Disney movies have.  Yet, this is the only Disney movie that gets the female lead right.  She's smart, sassy (not bratty), beautiful, and can take care of herself.  She doesn't desire the best looking man which is why Gaston holds no interest for her.  She is the kind of woman that I would feel comfortable letting my kids watch in a movie.The only caution I would give, is that there is mild sexual innuendo most of it is from ""Lumiere"" (A character reminiscent of Honore Lachaille in 'Gigi') the candlestick. :)  However, it is mild, and not blatant or bad enough to deter you from letting your children watch it.  It is after all based in France, you have to expect a little bit of that.Overall, this is one of Disney's crowning achievements, and should be in any one's movie collection!God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy"	5.0	For Once, Disney Did a Fairy Tale Right.	2007-09-14	0	0	0

I still have my video from when it came out the first time and the animation on it looks great, but I was incredibly disappointed with the DVD.  I thought it would look better and clearer than the video, but I was wrong.  It looks like a cheap cartoon instead of the masterpiece it was.	2.0	The Remastered Edition looks different	2003-05-01	5	2	3
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A38GAPP74FWWFZ	littlepirate	After I purchased this version, and viewed it for the first time on DVD instead of VHS... I immediately realized the colour differences.  It was disapointing to me, that a once appropriately dark film was now brightened, taking away from the more serious mood they once had.  I suppose parents would argue that children prefer bright colours, which may be true, but it definitely takes away from the origonal classic look.	4.0	Too bright	2005-07-04	3	2	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1XYADEC7TLTSP	"Liz ""LoftyKitten"""	Bringing this classic fairy tail to life is one of the best things that Disney has ever done.  Every second of this film is full to the brim with wonder and magic.  More than ten years after first seeing it, there are still some scenes that make me gasp at their beauty.The movie provides all of the usual Disney elements of gorgeous animation, skilled voice actors, awesome original songs, and non-stop entertainment, but there's something special in the mix.  We get one of the most believable and heart felt romances to ever grace the animated world.  As a child every time I read a picture book of this Fairy Tail I found it impossible to believe that a woman could love a beast, but Disney found a way to make it happen.  You truly believe that it's possible, and feel her pain when she thinks she's lost him.In the classic Disney fashion, Beauty and the Beast brings along a message for the kids to learn.  We see the value of intelligence and compassion, learn to look beyond the superficial, and discover that love knows no boundaries.	5.0	Pure Magic!	2004-07-09	2	2	0

Everyone knows the story, so I won't talk about that, but seeing it again after about  4 years reminds me of how much fun it is.The music is a glorius mixture of operetta and broadway -  and the DVD format brings it into your home in remastered digital sound. The animation is very smooth and the backgrounds are truly impressive.The three versions are all worthwhile viewing. I can't even imagine how New York audiences felt seeing the animated pencil sketches and finished scenes of the &quot;Work-in-progess&quot; version, they must have been stunned.The commentary is a bit chatty, but very entertaining and informative. And the special features which talk about the animation process are enlightening.Best of all - sing along words for a special feature of the decision, I just wish they appeared off screen and were a bit more legible.All in all, a great family DVD... buy it - get a version for the kids, and keep one for you.	5.0	A new Classic - and a great DVD	2002-10-17	1	1	0

I expected this to be a great blu-ray. It didn't meet my expectations...it surpassed my expectations. From the second it started, I was blown away by the picture quality. I think that animated movies are the best looking blu-ray's, and this is one of the best. I would honestly out this in my top 3 favorite blu-ray movies of all-time. It is a brilliant movie and a brilliant transfer, and it is worth the investment of a blu-ray player. 10/10 on both the movie and the blu-ray quality.	5.0	This is incredible	2010-10-06	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2OYT6UXIH4WSS	Lucy	"Out of all the Disney princesses, Belle is the one I identify with the most while Cinderella may come as a close second. I love her. She loves books just like me and we both try to find the goodness in someone. I'm pretty sure the Beast had gotten on her nerves on few occasions. Lord knows I could really feel that. The story is not like the other princess stories where there's always love at first sight or evil villains with superpowers. It's quite different. And not all princes appeared to be very ""charming"". I don't think a villain necessarily has to have any special powers to be more effective. I think it's pretty cliche and redundant to have every villain made to be that way, but as long as there is a special motive behind it that makes them what they are in character. I think the story doesn't have to apply to just someone who tries to look inside their heart rather than their ugly exterior, but it can also applies to falling for someone who has an ugly past or has a mean streak and you are trying to see past all those things. The more I look into this story, the more I see it that way. I tend to favor movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame that have a more insightful approach rather than a superficial appeal. Everything about this movie is so iconic, heartwarming, and magical. From the iconic dancing scene with Belle and the Beast to the music, the movie just wins my heart by default. Beauty and the Beast theme is one of my all time, top favorite Disney songs. The song really gets to me each time. It really gives me tingles. No other Disney princess film...before and after will ever top Beauty and The Beast!!!"	5.0	My favorite Disney princess film EVER!	2014-01-22	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2SGR7LE899LGG	Luigi	This story is very touching and true if you understand it at it's core. Essentially this film shows the true meaning of what is the most and perhaps the only real important thing in everybody's life. Althought it seems to be a children movie, there is a lot to be learned from the adult viewer as well. As far as video quality goes, the picture is sharper, brighter and cleaner than the original tape but the colors tend to be less vivid and toward the brown/red spectrum. The picture in the original vhs edition is not as sharp but it has more depth and better color fidelity which gives it a more filmlike appearance. The audio quality of the new version is disappointing. The overall soundtrack is less bright and not as loud as the original version. Overall I am keeping both versions, the new one for the extra footage and the old one for better quality sound and somewhat better video. This comparisons are based on vhs vs. vhs version of the movie.	5.0	Excellent movie.	2002-11-05	0	0	0

It's a nice looking film to begin with but it really presents wonderfully on bluray. The dance scene is stunningly beautiful, just like when we saw the film for the first time at the theater. The discs all played without issue. There's 3 discs total, 2 are BD, the film on one and bonus materials on the other and 1 DVD version of the feature. The DVD is great if you don't have a bluray in your car or if you have kids because your bd copy will be handled less and won't get scratched. There are 2 ""never-before-seen"" items, an alternate opening & a new deleted scene, as well as a sing along mode. Of course the songs are great and the ""tale as old as time"" is nicely told. Love all the characters too! And if you ever want to see Beast's library in real life you can always go to DCA and get a glimpse! The rose is awesome!

"I'm a Disney nut anyway but this film along with The Lion King and The Little Mermaid are there greatest masterpieces!The score is breathtaking,the songs a mixture of fun(Belle,Be Our Guest,etc.),malice(The Mob Song),and grand emotion (Beauty and the Beast).This wonderful score quality has disappeared in recent years at Disney and sadly will probably never be seen again.But then,this type of movie,the Disney Musical,will probably never be seen again.Along with the spectacular score is the exquisite animation.This so-called ""outdated""style,the 2-D style,is infinitely superior to the cold,unimaginative,3-D style that is now the rage.With the exception of the Pixar films and the first shrek,these movies are generally atrocious.They have none of the warmth and astounding emotional quality that this film posseses in abundance.Also,the voices in this film are perfect,and being a M*A*S*H fan,I get quite a kick out of hearing David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth,the stuffy clock.This movie is a true classic from start to finish,and with this spectacular 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD,the film can be viewed in all it's glory.The extras are perfect and should not be missed.Also,the picture is restored to crystal clear perfection,and there is a new song incorporated to complete the experience!Get this along with the special edition soundtrack.You wont regret it!"	5.0	One of my Top Favorite Films Ever !!!	2006-10-25	6	6	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1IANEBSMVGHS9	"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny"""	The legendary story of the Beauty and the Beast never looked better than on this lovely Disney animated feature. In a time (1991, after the Little Mermaid) when the classic Disney appeal had long passed (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc.), the entertainment powerhouse for all ages came back with a film that resurrected the fairy tale story concept, giving it a much deserved technical make-up with animation that was up to the best of its time, in fact setting new standards for the genre. As an example, take the scene where Beauty and the Beast are in a dance hall and the virtual camera does a pan from the top of the room to the height of the characters: it has more depth (physical depth, I mean) than most if not all animated features I've seen.As for music, it's tough to run into a contemporary animated flic with so many musical pieces so perfectly integrated into the story, and actually aiding it in a way that leaves you humming the songs for days at a time, after seeing the movie. The least that can be said about the role of music in the story is that the title song that won it an Oscar in 1991 is just a bit of what the music does for the movie: it moves you, makes you smile, and takes you in a thousand different directions.As for a story and their characters, this movie has them all:-The classic &quot;villain&quot; concept was beginning to evolve into more of a character getting in the way, but almost in a funny way, such as the case of Gaston in this movie. This concept would later become the norm in most Disney movies with soft &quot;villains&quot; that are not such, and at times with no villains at all.-Hilarious big and small characters in disguise of teapots, chandeliers (Lumiere is my personal favorite, hands down!) and all sorts of furniture pieces.-A Beast that can scare you with his initial anger or win your heart with the tenderness it exudes as his character evolves in the movie.-Finally, a Beauty (Belle) that can be paired with some of the most beautiful animated characters, portraying a woman ahead of her time, wanting to read and travel in a stagnant peasant environment that would not relate to her 'crazy' dreams of exploration, much less coming from a woman whose place -in their minds- was &quot;back at home,&quot; raising kids, caring after her husband, etc.All in all Beauty and the Beast is a storytelling, musical and animation accomplishment of sorts. It totally deserves all the praise.	5.0	A storytelling. musical and animation accomplishment!	2003-10-20	1	1	0

The time it would take to explain a character's persona, such as Belle or Gaston, is condensed into a three or four minute song. Also, this re-release is great. The colors are more vivid either on blu-ray or DVD.	5.0	First Animated Film to Be Nominated for Academy Award for Best Picture for a Reason	2012-01-15	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A90E77D1OIYRK	"Marie L. Fontana ""marie"""	Previous purchases of DVD's through goHastings have been sent via first class mail, arriving in Hawaii in 4 or 5 days, but this one came via MEDIA MAIL.  It arrived in Hawaii 38 days after it was first shipped from Texas. An inquiry with USPS revealed that it came by boat.  A complaint sent to goHastings was not answered, so all I can assume is that in order to save a few pennies on postage, they are now using media mail. They will not get repeat business from me.This was the 2-disc edition with 3 versions of the film, and the film is worth every penny, and also worth the wait. Just listening to the music (without the image) is magical.	4.0	Good movie, lousy shipping	2011-03-23	1	0	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"Belle is bored with life in her village.  Her only escape is her books, and she longs to have an adventure of her own.  When her father heads out to a fair, he gets lots, and Belle finds him in an enchanted castle.  The objects are thrilled, because if she and their master, the Beast, fall in love, they will all be freed from the enchantment.  But will Belle be able to see past the outward appearance?  And what about the handsome bore back home who wants to marry Belle?I feel in love with this movie the first time I saw it, and that love has only grown over the years.  The story is the right mix of fun and uncertainty.  Gaston was a wonderful addition to the mix because his story was the part I was most uncertain about the first time around.  The artwork on the film catches your eye from the first shot of the castle, and doesn't let go.  Beside the incredible background shots are wonderful drawings of the characters.  I especially love the boyish excitement they manage to give the Beast in several scenes.  Finally, there's the music.  Every song adds to the story and is memorable in its own right.This DVD is perfect for any fan of this movie.  Disc 1 includes three versions of the film.  The first is the ""in progress"" version shown to the New York film festival 6 weeks before the premier of the movie in 1991.  While it's fun to have, I won't be watching it regularly.  The second version is the original release.  And finally comes the special edition, with the added scene and ""Human Again.""  Ironically, this is probably my least favorite of the songs added to the Broadway version, but it does advance the story.  And, there's always the option of watching the original version.  Obviously, the version that you are supposed to watch is the special edition, as the audio commentary and sing along bonus features only work with this option.  All three come in Dolby 5.1 sound, which sounds great.The second disc features hours of bonus material.  Most of it focuses on the making of this movie.  Everything is covered, from original idea through characters and the Broadway version and special edition.  Galleries show character designs over the course of the project.  Also featured is the original treatments for ""Human Again"" and ""Be Our Guest.""  Celebrity voices give background on the original story and Disney versions of classic tales.  And there's a fun documentary as the stars of ""Even Stevens"" take a backstage look at all the work that goes into making a feature animated film.This is the first annimated film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture.  Watching the film, the reason is clear.  This is something the entire family can enjoy.  Don't miss your opportunity to catch this classic film."	5.0	My Favorite Disney Classic	2003-09-04	130	114	16

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ADPDMLUDAMML0	Mark R. Wietstock	"The one star is for bootlegs, not for the genuine article, which rates a five in my book.  I've seen quite a few complaints about bootlegged copies in this thread, and thought I'd throw in my two cents on the subject.  People interested in buying this item need to know that Amazon and Ebay are awash in bootlegged copies of this and other popular DVD and CD audio titles.  It's very difficult, if not impossible, for huge online sellers like Amazon and Ebay to police such activities, so it's largely up to us fans to hold the sellers' feet to the fire.  Do not buy from ANY vendor who will not guarantee, in writing, that his or her product is a 100% authentic Disney media product.  There are undoubtedly some vendors who are so brazen that they will make this guarantee even though they know it's totally false.  I received a counterfeit copy of this DVD set from an Ebay vendor, and the people who sell this trash depend on their buyers not being able to tell the difference.  Some people don't care, but for those of you who do, look for the following:The authentic US release of this particular DVD set came inside an immaculately printed cardboard sleeve.  I believe the DVD case inside the sleeve was then encased in shrink-wrap plastic, with Disney or Buena Vista security markings printed on the wrapper.  The DVD case inside the wrapping also had separate adhesive seals on it, that had to be broken/removed in order to open the case.Look carefully at the printing on the outer case liner.  It should be sharp and clear, with no fuzzy edges or wavy type, especially around the proof of purchase and UPC code blocks on the reverse side.  If you see any such indications of second-generation printing, it's a counterfeit.The original DVD set included several items of printed material, placed inside the case with the disks.  If your set doesn't include this material, it's a knockoff.  If the printing on the material has the same indicia of second-generation printing as that seen on the outer case liner, it's a knockoff.Look carefully at the disks themselves ... the printing on the face of the disks should also be immaculate.  The colors and lines where they intersect should be bright and distinct, not blotchy.  The copyright and trademark information printed around the outer edge of the disk should be fine, but very legible, and not bleeding into the underlying colors, with no misspellings or weird gaps in the type.The playing surface of the disks should be glossy and spotless, with no nicks, marks or smudges of any kind.  If the title of the movie appears on the inner ring of the playing surface (e.g., ""Beauty and the Beast, Disc 1""), it's a knockoff.  Disney never puts such verbal markings on its authentic discs ... only code numbers.  Disc titles are laser etched into knockoff discs so that the little scumbags who are assembling the counterfeit products by hand in China and Taiwan (or wherever the counterfeits are being mass-produced) can easily identify what disks they're putting into the package.Hope this helps, and please ... don't knowingly support people who traffic in pirated copies of copyrighted materials.  Think of the millions and millions of dollars, and incalculable number of labor hours invested by the lawful owners of products like this.  Don't help someone deprive them of the financial rewards that are rightfully theirs for the massive risk they take in bringing brilliant creative work like this to the world.In short, demand the authentic product, and then proudly ENJOY IT!"	1.0	Beware of bootlegged copies!	2010-03-02	92	70	22
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A30Q8X8B1S3GGT	"Mark Savary ""moon_city"""	"This film was one of the first in a series of what I call the ""New Disneys"". Beginning with ""The Little Mermaid"", the New Disneys were made to be more accessible to grown-up viewers. The New Disneys are designed with more than kids in mind, taking into account that parents are bringing the kids to the theater and have to sit through whatever the kids are watching. Another factor the New Disneys consider is the changing moral and social tastes of the public (Heaven forbid we ever have an Eminem-inspired rapper Mickey!).One manifestation of a New Disney is a sexier character design than previously seen in the Classic Disneys. Here we see three buxom blondes mooning over the arrogant bad-boy, Gaston. Beauty herself is drawn in a somewhat full-figured, realistic style. The key, of course, is to add these kind of elements seamlessly. Too little, the effect will not work. Too much, and the audience will notice and react negatively (these are supposed to be kids' movies, after all).New Disneys are also more politically correct, which can be grating when they push it to the Nth degree.In this film, we have an interesting story that, in the best/worst Disney traditions, does not always follow the original source material faithfully. However, the animation and songs (Be Our Guest), more than make up for any deficiencies in the lack of fairy tale accuracy. We are even treated to some experimental computer animation, most notably in the famous ballroom dance sequence.A great cast offers up good voice characterizations, too. It sure is nice to know that Jo Anne Worley is still working!While ""The Lion King"" is (so far) the high water mark of the New Disneys, ""Beauty & the Beast"" is still an excellent work. The extras offered on the Platinum Edition are absolutely stellar, and any fan of this animated feature will be enthralled for hours just going through the bonus material."	4.0	"Dawn of the ""New Disney""..."	2002-11-21	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	Martin Asiner	It is quite rare for any animated film to be treated with the same respect as any other honored non-animated one.  In BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale take the time-worn fairy tale of the outwardly loathsome beast who impossibly enough allows his inner nobility to shine forth sufficiently to cause the beauty to fall in love with him.  Robby Benson is the voice of the Beast and Paige O'Hara is Beauty.  Even for those readers familiar with the spoken tale or the revamped music video with Meatloaf as the Beast cannot help but allow themselves to be entranced with the seamless melding of sight to sound.  The plot is simplicity itself with the Beast as the archetypal symbol of the rebirth of nobility long hidden by the evil spell of a unnamed wizard.  There is nothing childish is the unfolding of the tale of Belle the Beauty who chooses to sacrifice herself in marriage to save the life of her doddering inventor father. Enter the Beast who is initially presented as the roaring brute that his tormenting wizard clearly intended him to be.  Yet, as Belle ministers to his psychic wounds of self-loathing and his physical wounds incurred in defending her against a pack of wolves, the viewer can see a competing spell at work, one that is older than time itself--the power of love that the film's many songs allude to and function as as subtext that imbues it with timeless energy.  There is, of course, some needed plot complications of unwanted attention heaped on Belle by the handsome but warped Gaston, who plots to snare Belle in marriage as firmly as he would stalk a reindeer for its antlers.  As Gaston leads the villagers in an assault on the Beast's manor, one is reminded in reverse of the cliched villagers pounding at the walls of Doctor Frankenstein's castle, but in this case the attack in presented in comic tones that keep the real world of harm at bay.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has no down moments, with each fresh plot advancement heralded by stunningly effective animation and song.  This film was a deserved nominee for Best Picture in 1991, and with repeated viewings, one may rest assured that the alternately gloomy and resplendent halls of the Beast will eternally resonate with the same cachet that gives Tara, Oz, or Rick's Cafe a ticket that allows the bearer to see just how awesome the human spirit can be.	5.0	After A While One Doesn't Notice It Is Animated	2004-06-17	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AN7JDZOXH1WC4	"Matthew Easterbrook ""silverscreenjunkie"""	"This is definitely one of Disney's great feature films.  You all know the story, I'm sure, so I won't bore you with the details.  It's amazing how human the characters really seemed.  They were all wonderfully drawn by the animators and voiced by the actors; I think my favorite scene has to be during the song ""There's Something There,"" when Belle and the Beast begin to realize they have feelings for each other.  Just watch the body language and looks on their faces; you really feel what they're feeling -- and these are cartoons!!!Right from the opening scene we know we're in for something special, when the camera pans down from a crowded street scene onto Belle.  Things only get better from there, as there's nary a dull spot to be found in the story.  The musical numbers are some of the best from a Disney feature, especially ""Belle,"" ""Gaston,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""There's Something There,"" -- oh, who am I kidding?  They're all fantastic.As for the special features, brace yourself, there's a ton of them.  The main disc houses not one, not two, but three different versions of the film!  We have the theatrical version, a special edition version which adds a new song from the Broadway show, ""Human Again,"" and finally a work-in-progress version, which was shown at the New York Film Festival in September 1991, three months before its final release.  There's an audio commentary by the directors, a sing-along track, and part one of a two-part game (the second part is on disc two).Disc two is divided into four areas: The first area is called The Secret West Wing, and it houses the second part of said game.  The second area is called Chip's Fun And Games, and is aimed at the little kiddies in the audience.  There's a little featurette on Disney animation, a create-your-own-song game, and a video for a horrendous pop version of ""Beauty And The Beast"" by some group called Jump 5.The third area is called Cogsworth & Lumiere's library, which is basically an hour-long making of special which details the origins, development, story, music, characters, production design, animation, visual effects, marketing, and awards of the film, and finally talks about the Broadway musical.  The final area is called Mrs Potts' Engaging Treats, and is for the average film watcher.  It has a half-hour making of special which is just a truncated version of the one in C&L;'s library.  There's also a little feature called ""Story Behind The Story,"" which talks about the differences between the original stories and film versions of seven Disney films.  We end off with a cool personality profile game, in which you find out which BEAUTY AND THE BEAST character you're most like (apparently I'm most like Belle), and finally, the Celine Dion-Peabo Bryson version of the title song (which isn't nearly as good as Angela Lansbury's version in the movie).  All in all, a near perfect DVD.The film:  5 stars.The extras:  5 stars."	5.0	Tale as old as time	2004-08-07	2	2	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A13TO1ZFAH9SVN	Matthew Edmundson	When I look at the Disney corporation the last 15 years I have to sit and think. Would Walt Disney be happy with what has been done with what he started. Sometimes I think he'd cry in shame except for when I see a movie like Beauty and the Beast and say to myself no, Walt would have loved this.Disney has always been the standard for animated movies. Beauty and the Beast is the only to ever get a nomination for &quot;Best Picture&quot; by the academy awards and Disney has called it one of top three best they've ever done. Those are some pretty good credentials.Beauty and the Beast tells the story of the beauty bookworm Belle. She has moved to a new town in France and doesn't fit it to well. Her father is a crack pot inventor is looked to be a madman from the local town folk. On a way to the fair to show off his newest invention Marious gets lost and ends up at a castle. It is at that castle he is imprisoned by a Beast. Belle who has complete compassionate love for her father finds him and takes his place. It's there that she teaches the Beast to love. Back in town though one of the towns men is angry. The conceited and wicked hearted Gaston wants Belle for himself and no one else, and he'll stop at nothing to get her.There are so many reasons this movie is great. It has some of the most loveable characters ever. Belle and the Beast are both fantastic. In the castle all the workers were imprisoned into different animate objects. There's Cogsworth the Clock and Lemuix the Candlestick. There is Mrs. Potts the Teapot and many other loveable characters that leave you feeling good inside.The music is fantastic. It did win the best score and best song Oscars. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is an awesome song sung by award winning artists Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. Other notable songs are &quot;Gaston,&quot; &quot;Be Our Guest,&quot; and Many Many more. I'd watch the movie just to see the music.Beauty and the Beast is one of the best movies you will ever see. It's easily up there with the Wizard of Oz as the best family movie ever made. If you don't have this DVD you can't seriously have a DVD collection. It's one of the best of all time and will be forever. So be there guest and sit down for a ride you'll never regret.	5.0	One of Disney's Best Ever	2003-11-03	1	0	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2F8R40Z2OMIJM	"Matt Howe ""outloud98"""	Like the sumptuous DVD of &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot;, Disney has produced another gloriously packaged keepsake for its Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.The DVD has enough contents to keep the viewer busy for days!  There are three versions of the movie here!  The &quot;work in progress&quot; version (all line drawings, black and white, and rough) is a little hard to watch after a while, but very interesting, nonetheless.The menues are adorable and Disneyesque.  I find the disks to be very easy to navigate.  Although, on disk 2 the voices tell you not to choose the &quot;rose window&quot; -- that leads to the west wing of the castle and is forbidden!!  Of course, the first thing I wanted to do was click on the rose window.  So there is a sense of fun on the disk.I found the documentaries to be especially informative.  The art of animation is explained.  The use of computers is shown.  The process of developing the story is fascinating: A powdered wig fop was the original villain.  &quot;Be My Guest&quot; was sung to Belle's father, not Belle.  There are lots of these stories. There are galleries that show the film's early artwork and the &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; look that the artists were going for.The movie itself is very entertaining.  I'm a huge admirer of the opening musical number (&quot;this small provential town...&quot;) - it sets the mood and tone for the film so wonderfully.&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; proved that Disney can sometimes achieve greatness with the animated film like Uncle Walt used to in the old days.  It's right up there with &quot;Lion King&quot; as one of the best films in the new Michael Eisner/Disney regime.	5.0	Beauty is the Best	2002-10-25	3	0	3

I think it was from most people labeling this film as a girl's movie.  As I've gotten older I've really come to love it, and it's definitely my favorite Disney film of all time.  Does the film transition well to blu-ray?  It's become even more beautiful.  Unlike the Lion King blu-ray, this set comes with an entire disc devoted to the special features of the film.  If it hasn't already, this movie should be returning to the Disney vault soon, so I would suggest buying a copy before they're gone!	5.0	One of the best Disney animated films of all time!	2013-03-05	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1VQT6AEKAX4CI	Maxcranfan	Disney has beautiful, fun and great movies. But Beauty and The Beast is by far my favorite of all. I grew with this classic and now with this total new restoration on Blu-ray is a total new experience. I was looking for this movie since its release. The artwork is beautiful, very shining. The movie of course, Excellent! and is loaded with many, many interesting bonus features. Really this is a must own for any Hi-Def collection.	5.0	Beauty & the Beast in Blu-ray is a total new experience!	2011-02-22	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A32P36SU1MYO7M	Max Parker	There is NO doubt about it, Disney is truly without a doubt THE master of taking delightful stories from ones childhood and turning them into amazing musicals.  I grew up with ALL sorts of Disney flicks, including The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc.  Even THIS piece of forever great classic nostalgia.  The special features are just amazing, the story hits all bulls eyes, and everything else is just done incredibly.  If you grew up with this film and/or you have kids, then THIS is a great Disney film for kids and adults of ALL ages.  It's a tale as old as time, and song as old as rhyme&#8230;  Beauty and the Beast: The best Disney fairytale out of all their works, in my opinion.PS: For those of you who're wondering the Beast's real name as the prince though it's never revealed in the film, it's Adam.

This could be a very disturbing movie for children because of the dark theme and magic. Most kids appear to handle the story fine because, in the end, good triumphs over evil and there is a happy ending.

However, instead of talking animals, we have talking objects, formerly the staff of the Beast before the enchantress cursed him and his entire household along with him.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3RYIN4KHLR3Y1	Melissa	This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. The animation is breathtaking as it is a sweet & tender story. This Disney movie stands out above all of the other's. It takes a classic fairy tale and makes it a whole new story. The musical numbers such as: Beauty and The Beast, Be Our Guest, Belle, & much more will make you feel like your at a Broadway Musical, which in addition it's no wonder it did very well on Broadway itself. The voices are extremely talented and make you take a loving interest in the characters even the villains. Everyone knows this story already; however, everyone needs to see and experience this Disney classic. It's again my favorite among them all.The DVD is truly amazing of course. My favorites include: Beauty and the Beast music video with an introduction from my favorite singer Celine Dion, all of the games which the kids will enjoy, & the behind the scene's. The most enjoyable was the new addition to the movie Human Again which was put on the cutting room floor in the original theatrical version.This is an instantly beautiful treasure to add to your Disney collection or DVD collection. It's also a film that the entire family will enjoy in it's timeless masterpiece.	5.0	Enchantingly a Favorite Masterpiece	2004-12-21	4	3	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1Y6KW8HYJWFZC	"M. Gonya ""rawker"""	"I can see why this movie made it so big when it hit the box office in 1990. It is a good family movie that is entertaining for parents and children. Most of the characters were interesting, especially the Beast, Gaston,and LaFlour(SP?). The plot is handled well and flows well. Most of the songs are memerable as well.I can see why this brought Disney back of their slump of the 1980's. It brought back the traditional Disney story book Romance that we found in Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. The animation, story, and character finally all came together.The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that I noticed that the Beast and Belle seem to be off model in a few scenes, if only for a little while. It is most obviouse in the little dinner scene when the Beast tries to eat with a spoon. It just looks like the posture and the body and facial proportions are awkward to me for some reason. I know this is picky, and some may not even notice, care, or even think that its drawn funny. I just thought some scenes could have been looked at with a more carefull Disney eye.On the DVD commentary they say that they didn't have much time to make the movie so I guess that is a good enough excuse.Other than the above picky comments the DVD is great. At least on my TV set the color and picture is good. The sound seems to be good too. It has an entertaining and informative commentary and 3 versions of the film. The Original Version is probably the one I like the most since the story flows better with out the ""Special Edition"" scene thrown in. A cool little thing that Disney wouldn't normally do is throw in the complete ""work in progress"" version which shows the interesting rough pencil tests of the unfinished movie. The second disc has some nice art galleries and pretty interesting making-of features. Of course Disney had to throw in some useless games for the kiddies; which I haven't even looked into yet. All in all its a real good DVD, although not as good as the Snow White DVD."	4.0	Very good, but not great.	2002-12-02	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A38ZTUNQJVGP6S	Michael Patrick Boyd	"Beauty and the Beast was released in theaters on November 13, 1991. Beauty and the Beast mainly tell the story of a Prince who became a hideous beast because he scorned an old peasant who becomes a beautiful enchantress. The enchantress realizes that the Prince selfish, coldhearted and unkind and put a spell on the castle and the residents who live their as well. Several years have past and Belle enters his life when he takes her father captive. Belle agrees to live in the castle as the Beast prisoner in exchange for the release of her father. Over several months there grow to like each other and that is where I am going to end so I don't give away the rest of the story. Unlike other reviews I have written I have given the time length on each one; this DVD is the exception to the rule. This DVD comes with three different versions of Beauty and the Beast: Work In Progress which was released at the New York Film Festival in September of 1991, Original Theatrical Release, and the Special Edition which has the song Human Again in it. My biggest beef with this 2 Disc DVD collection is Disc 2. There is so much repetitive and overlap it is way bother a second disc. The Pencil Version of Human again is play four times. When you get to Mrs. Potts section of the DVD where you The Making of Beauty and the Beast is just and edited version of Origins of Beauty and the Beast in Cogsworth & Lumiere's Library section. Whoever put Disc 2 together must not have had it all there. The movie (all three) Beauty and the Beast is great for the whole family and gets and AAAAA+++++.Disc 1Scene SelectionSet Up1.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AQYTMDK8GTD87	Michele J. Raffaele	"*****WARNING!****** There maybe spoilers in this review for those who haven't seen the movie yet!*******Beauty And The Beast happens to be my all time favorite Disney animated movie. I saw it in the theater at least 4 times when it was first released in 1991 and I must have watched it a dozen or so times since then. There are several reasons why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite Disney movie. For one, Belle is a heroine that many young women today can definitely relate to. Her love of reading, the fact that a man being handsome alone doesn't impress her (Gaston) and her curiousity about things makes her personality very realistic and endearing.Another reason why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite is the music. I've never enjoyed the music in a Disney movie as much as I have this one. The clever and sometimes touching lyrics draw you in and make one caught up in the story. Songs such as ""Belle"", ""Gaston"", ""Something There""  ""Be Our Guest"" and of course the title track add so much to the overall story and give the viewer a deeper understanding of the characters.Yet another reason is the animation. True, there are many Disney movies where the animation is dazzling, however, I'm just so drawn to (no pun intended) the animation in this movie. The scene that impresses me the most is the one where Belle and The Beast dance while Mrs. Potts sings the title song. The combination of tradiditional and computer animation has the end result being such a stunning and beautiful scene. Probably from an artistic point of view (not to mention an emotional point of view), my favorite scene from the movie.Finally, lets not forget the story itself. I think the meaning of it is beautiful. It's about looking at the person's inside and finding the true beauty of someone's soul, which is Belle's POV.  I think we all forget sometimes about that, and this movie is a lovely reminder of that. Another lesson is how people can change, can learn and grow, which is the Beast's POV. It also demonstrates how love conquers all things, even when you think all hope is lost (the last petal of the rose falling after Belle tells the Beast that she loves him). That is a profound message."	5.0	A entertaining movie with profound messages of love and inner beauty.	2009-01-05	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A29KUXU6Q4QF3U	Midnight_PhoenixFlames	"I would've been about 5 when I first saw this movie and was unable to make up my mind about it until, nearly 10 years later, I was given the chance to see it again, so I took that chance.What I saw was a beautiful, artistic and flawless animated film with well-written and surprisingly complex and different characters (which is something I normally don't see in Disney).THE MAIN CHARACTERS:BELLE:Belle has definately become my favourite female Disney character as she differs so much from the typical Disney heroine. She is intelligent, slightly eccentric, and instead of sitting around, dreaming about her dream guy, she chooses to look at what is below the surface and to bring happiness into the lives of others with no selfish motives.THE BEAST:Definately the most complex character of them all, the Beast's persona is many differing shades of grey, and his conflicted feelings and emotions are portryed perfectly through his body language and beautifully expressive eyes that you could just fall into. And through Belle's gentle but unwavering kindness, he learns not only to love again, but also that your heart and personality will always outshine your physical appearance.GASTON:The most handsome and arrogant man in Belle's village, Gaston soon proves that he is also a complex character. While he starts off as a rather stupid-yet-amusing muscle-head who cannot take 'no' for an answer, his character soon begins to reveal that while he is stupid, he makes up for it by being cunning,manipulative and posessive. Soon, he becomes the 'ultimate evil' in the story when he realizes that Belle has fallen in love with the Beast and will never want to be with him...Basically, it becomes a case of Gaston being read to destroy anything and anybody that gets in the way of what he wants...The other characters, such as Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogworth and Belle's eccentric-but-caring Father, Maurice, are also surprisingly well-developed, considering they are not main characters. Not only do they add spots of comic relief to prevent the movie from being too dark, they are all also VITAL to the story as they help lead it along. Without them, the story would be much emptier and alot shorter.And finally, we come to the music. I normally hate when the characters break into song in the middle of a movie, but the songs all fit into the movie perfectly without giving it a ""dragged-out"" feel. They, like the minor characters, keep the movie going and help inject even more feeling into what is already a masterpiece.Overall, this was, and will always be THE best Disney film ever created, and, just like the tagline, the most beautiful love story ever told. I would recommend this to absolutely ANYBODY!!!"	5.0	The most beautiful and outstanding movie ever done by Disney	2003-01-22	4	4	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ATV9X3FTXRIM4	Mike Christie	"There are a lot of good things to say about this wonderful movie, but the songs have to be at the top of any list.  Almost every song is among Disney's very best.  The only exception, ""Human Again"", is one that was re-inserted for this edition, having been cut for theatrical release -- it's not a bad song; it's just not up to the amazing standard of the others.  The arrangements are operatic in their complexity and the lyrics are flawless: by turns witty, moving and engaging.  ""Be Our Guest"" has got to be most dazzling single performance in a Disney picture; the title song won an Oscar; and ""Gaston"" would have been the best song in almost any other movie.The story is one of the good old fairy tales, going back beyond Perrault to the 16th century and probably before.  Belle's father is trapped in an enchanted castle by a monstrous beast, who is really a handsome prince cursed by a good sorceress because of his evil temper.  Belle offers herself in her father's place, and you can guess the rest.  The story is well-done; the cast is uniformly excellent, though Angela Lansbury stands out with a terrific characterization of Mrs. Potts, the teapot.  The reproduction is beautiful.There is also a set of extra features on the second DVD.  My seven-year-old daughter went through the ""Mrs. Potts' Personality Test"" in a few minutes and was delighted to discover she resembles Belle more than she does Mrs. Potts or the maid.  She also enjoyed a musical memory game with Chip, the teacup.  There's another game, though, which was a bit of a failure -- ""Maurice's Invention Workshop Game"".  You have to get a code from a game on disk 1, which isn't that hard to do, though it took a bit of fiddling around.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AURZ4YQ270W3T	Mike Freed	If &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; was evidence that Disney was back, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was proof that it was better than ever.What a wonderful, beautiful, romantic film, punctuated by great  animation, and knock-em-dead musical numbers. No wonder this was the first  animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar!Not many animated films  qualify as date movies, but this one is a date flick extraordinaire.If  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; has a flaw, it's that it can be quite  violent for children. It includes a rather violent fistfight to the death,  a knifing, and quite a bit of gunplay to boot. Thankfully, it's easy to see  the scary stuff coming, so you can have your kids turn away before they see  something they shouldn't.Overall, though, what else can I say? This  film is a classic, and a wonderful moviegoing experience. I recommend it  most highly.	5.0	The best Disney film of all time	2000-06-29	2	1	1

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AUSATFDSU2INS	"milss ""Yellow hair warrior"""	Beauty and the Beast has been regarded as one of the best animated features of all times. Without going too far, we can assure it's one of the ten best and now we can have it on a Special Edition DVD, restored with remastered sound.For those who don't know the story: Belle is a beautiful girl living with her father (an inventor) in a XVIII France town. She's a fan of books, and has captured the attention of the town most coveted bachelor, Gaston, but is not willing to become a simple housewife. When her father is being kept in a horrible Beast's castle, Belle decides to save him taking his place as the Beast's prisoner. The Beast is actually a spoiled prince under a spell. Once in the castle, belle makes a few friends (servers under the spell too) and learns that true beauty lies inside people.Wonderful music numbers, a perfect story which balances comedy and drama and exquisite animation makes Beauty and the Beast a true cinematic gift for everyone, regardless of age.Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful experience to relive; capable of giving us so many emotions as no other picture of its time has accomplished (the exception could be The Lion King). The only animated feature to receive a Best Picture Nomination, it has an endless charm.	5.0	Tale as old as time	2005-06-15	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2JGYXRTS4873K	Miriam	Beauty and the Beast could very well be my favorite Disney movie- tied with Tangled.  I watched it as a little child, but would often become too scared to see parts of it.  As a teenager today, I must say I love this movie.  I appreciate that Disney gave time for Belle and the Beast to bond, as it bothered me that many of the Disney princesses would fall in love right from the start, even without knowing anything about the prince.  This movie is heartfelt, and very touching and wonderful for almost any age.  I think some little children might find some scenes (the wolves, for instance) a tad bit frightening (as I know I used to).  I am certainly saving this DVD for my children.  The songs are wonderful and the art in the movies are absolutely stunning.  I've watched this movie a hundred times, and I always find something new that interests me.	5.0	Possibly my Favorite Disney Movie	2013-01-18	0	0	0

In this case, I would rate the movie itself as five stars!But...there are some drawbacks to this edition. I own the Platinum Edition of this film, and after reading the back of the Diamond Edition, I found there were only a few differences.First off, the aspect ratio is NOT 2.35! They have cropped this film to 1.78! The original aspect ratio, as it was seen in the theatre, was 1.85, which the Platinum sports. It might not seem like a lot, but Disney's new fling is with cutting and cropping films to make it ""perfect"" for those with widescreen televisions. I have no problem with seeing black bars at the bottom of my widescreen tv, because at least I know that I'm getting what I hope is the full picture.Most of the special features as exactly the same as the Platinum. I can't tell you what the picture looks like, but I've heard the rumors that the DVD copy of the Diamond Edition is actually much better than the bluray. Once upon a time, when films were not made in high definition digital, there was something called film, which would wear after a time, and not all mistakes could be magically undone.I will say though, the new music video for the love song is much better than Platinum's. Jordin Spark's rendition is much more beautiful, with a hint of mystery and discovery, not to mention the music video itself is quite beautiful. Jump 5's version hinted a little more at friends getting together and singing favourite Disney songs, and rather lacked at the emotional lyrics penned by Howard Ashman.So, the Platinum Edition triumphs over the Diamond DVD copy, and the Diamond DVD copy towers over the cringe-worthy bluray."	4.0	A correction needs to be made for the diamond editon...	2010-12-06	4	4	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1S64NSJMLXXIK	"""mljkb"""	Once in a while, a movie comes along that captures everything moviemaking is about: enthralling stories, beautiful characters and a aura about it that makes throughly unforgettable.  &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is one of those movies.  Based on the European folktale, the movie revolves around Belle, a beautiful but with a suttle eccentricity to her society of the day.  A village where the same thing happens everyday.  But when her father, a struggling inventor, goes missing on a trip to an invention festival, she goes looking for him, and finds him being held prisoner in an ominous castle.  No humans inhabit the dark abode, but those that were once human.  Objects like candlesticks and clocks are living, inhabited by the men and women that once lived in the castle.  Long before Belle found their home, a wandering witch disguised as an old beggar women  asked the master of the castle for shelter from the bitter winter, but he turned her away.  The witch then turned the master into a terrifying beast, and every man, woman and child into everyday objects, until the Master learns to soften his heart and learn to love, and have that person he proclaims love to love him in return.  If the Beast finds that person, the spell on the castle would be lifted.  If not, all those in the caslte are doomed to and eternity as objects and the master is forever a Beast.  Everyone in the castle hopes that Belle is the one to lift the spell.The movie not only delivers the best in the fundamentals of movies, but features stunning animation by being one of the first animated movies to utilize computers with traditional animation.  The ballroom scenes are utterly breathtaking, as is the balconies and buttresses of castles exterior.  And the vocal performances are flawless.  Paige O'Hara is as subtle as her Belle, and Jerry Orbach is surprisingly witty as the fast-talking candlestick Lumiere.  And for Disney villians, the obsessive Gaston is one of the more human, and more compelling.  Not to mention the songs are a delight.  You can't stop singing &quot;Be our Guest&quot; can you?  Go ahead, sing the first verse while you watch one of the best movies (not just animated) ever	5.0	I absolutely Love This	2003-02-16	2	1	1

I was terribly wrong. Beauty and the Beast was the first in a string of absolutely marvelous movies made  by Disney. Aladdin, The Lion King...etc. The characters in this were lovable and compassionate and kind throughout the whole movie. Also, Beauty and the Beast had the old charmingly innocent 'he is good' 'he is bad' mentality. This movie is masterfully done to make it enjoyable for people of all ages to watch. Just recently I saw a toddler watching it. Then later, I noticed a group of 15-year-olds watching it and laughing at the jokes, then an adult or two peeked in and were enjoying it. The subtlties pull the story-line through for adults, and the product in itself makes it one of the best Disney movies for everyone.	5.0	One of Disney's best.	2001-05-11	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3T0OTH5072YRE	"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming"""	"Beauty and the Beast is another one of my favorite Disney movies.  Of course most of the Disney movies from the early nineties timeframe are some of my favorites.  I much prefer them over the Pixar creations we get now (although some of those are good as well).  There's just something about that classic animation.Belle is a bit of a strange girl in her town.  For one, she likes to read.  For another, she's not completely enamored with Gaston, the local huntsmen who's prowess at hunting is only small compared to his overinflated ego.  But Belle is happy with her father, the inventor.  In fact, when her father gets lost on the way to a fair and ends up the prisoner of a beast in an enchanted castle, Belle loves him so much she offers herself in exchange.  She despises the beast at first, but then grows to know his true character as she stays at the castle.The voice actors for this movie were very good.  Belle is young sounding but adventurous, the Beast is somewhat scary and can be smoother and all the servants have their own sound as well.  Which, when you think about it, is actually quite clever considering they were household items and shouldn't have had an appropriate ""sound"" to their voice at all.  So that was kind of neat how they brought out the character in regular items through the use of voice.  Even Gaston had that arrogant way about him.  I will say that I wish Belle was a bit stronger of a character.  Sure she stands up to people, but all her dreams of escaping from the area are kind of thrown away when she agrees to become a prisoner at the castle.  I guess I wanted to see her get out in the world.The plot is a classic one though and Disney did a good job of recreating it through this movie.  The addition of the enchanted castle was a nice touch with all of the different servants doing their job as best they could.  The animation is standard, but I like that about the Disney films.  They didn't need anything fancy to tell a good story.  Although the animation involving the chandelier in the ballroom was exceptionally done, and is one of my favorite parts of the movie.  Pretty impressive for the early nineties.Like most Disney movies, the music in this one was exceptional.  ""Tale as Old as Time"" and a good deal of the other songs are ones that stay with you.  You just can't forget the lyrics to them.  And like most Disney movies, you of course can't help but sing along.  I have some mixed feelings about the first song ""Belle"", at times I liked it because it told a story, and at other times I found it just odd.  And then there's the ""Be Our Guest"" which is just a great number because of the amount of life and fun that's put into the song.A lovely movie that's great for the whole family.  It takes a classic tale and makes it relatable to a large group of people, of all ages.Review by M. Reynard 2012"	5.0	Beauty and the Beast	2012-10-13	0	0	0

By including 3 versions of the film onto a single disc, the result is high video compression. The low quality is noticable on larger tv screens.

I KNOW I AM NOT HAPPYON THE FILMA true classic & beloved film!!Excellent story, characters &music.;The first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.Like many other Disney films, it was such a shame the category of Best Animated Film was not done for this year.Never get tired of watching the film.I do enjoy the DVD version of the film.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2TY467QIEJ1DB	mthegreatone	"Disney Animated Studios outdid themselves making this movie.  Once again truly another classic worth adding to your collection.  In my quest to ""re-experience"" everything from my younger years, I decided to watch every Disney movie I could get my hands on.  Beauty and the Beast truly stands the test of time along with the other animated classics that Disney has made.  A wonderful blend of hand-drawing and compuer animation made for one of the best animated pictures ever to be conceived from the folks at Disney.The great thing about a movie like this is a depiction of a strong character.  In this case, Belle is quite a strong character indeed; specifically sacrificing her own life to save her father from the clutches of the Beast.  Disney does a good job of creating coming-of-age stories.  The evolution of the Beast is a good example of this.  Although the Beast looks the same throughout most of the movie, he truly evolves as a character thanks to the warm and loving nature of Belle's character.  Today's society can easily learn morals coming from this movie, specifically the fact that true beauty lies within.Without a doubt the movie itself deserves 5 stars without question.  Memorable music is also what makes the movie as great as it is.  Alan Menken is a pure genious (sorry, I can't remember the other music geniouses who contributed to the making of Beauty and the Beasts' musical score).Overall this is an excellent movie that's worth putting in anybody's collection.  The special features are a great bonus and you will gain much info on the creation of this great movie."	5.0	Another great classic.  what did you think i was going to say?	2005-09-24	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A4C69BVFXIGVC	"M. Tobin ""bookworm"""	After I saw Beauty and the Beast in the theaters back in '91, I remember trying to copy some of the dance moves from 'Be Our Guest'. Then I rediscovered this wonderful movie last summer and fell in love all over again. Gaston is egoistic to the point of hilarity, LeFou tries to be a good little yes-man for Gaston but is too nice, Belle knows what she wants and tries to do it, Beastwants to be nice but really needs some anger management classes at the beginning, and the rest of the characters are all equaly loveable. To be honest, I think the Beast looks better as a beastthan as a human. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies with love stories, fun songs that beg to be memorized, posessed household objects, and a bad guy with a henchman it's hard to hate, all with a Buzby Berkeley-style dance number thrownin.	5.0	My favorite Disney movie	2002-02-27	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2JTF5W7579V4L	musical &#60;3	where to begin!! this is without a doubt the greatest disney film EVER! there are no negative elements to this masterpiece. the story is a clever and well done adaptation of another classic fairy tale. the storyline is well executed because not once does it dumb down it's romantic love story for small children. with strong leading characters and well developed supporting ones, this is truely a great film. the animation is so realistic it is always beautiful in every detail and in every way.now i get to the music. WOW!!! this is a fantastic score, possibly one of the greatest musical scores of all time. the intensity and passion of every song is unbelievable for any movie, let alone a disney film. the songs themselves have a wonderful broadway feel and are all catchy and unique. again they are all powerful and fun.Although i'm just a little biased, this movie deserved to win the oscar for best motion picture, and i don't know why it didnt. as i said, this is a great film in the disney cannon and on it's own. this is truely the best of the best!	5.0	can i give this about 112 stars?!?!	2006-07-27	14	11	3

As the first ever animated film to be nominated for Best Picture, the movie itself doesn't really need me to say how great it is. This disc is top notch, with a truly amazing look at the making of the film. This includes some very indepth material on what the film almost was before it was decided to make it a musical, including storyboards. It's a fascinating look into the process of creating a masterpiece. All of the special features are well produced and well chosen.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1DK5AZMXS1QA3	Newton Ooi	If there is one genre that Disney still dominates, that would be the animated musical.  Dreamworks now rivals Disney when it comes to animated comedies; think Shrek, Over the Hedge and How to Train Your Dragon.  But for animated musicals, nobody can even challenge Disney.  And this classic take on the fairy tale is a good example why.  Clocking in at just under 1.5 hours, this movie is part romance, part drama, part comedy, and all music.  The scores are wonderful, spread out throughout the movie, and appropriately placed such that they do not distract from dialogue or action.  As for this product, the video quality is perfect.  It was also nice to see both the original film, and the intended, longer version with extra music.  All in all, a great movie.	4.0	Wonderful animated musical	2011-01-08	0	0	0

But I got a 3DTV and kind of wanted to have more 3D movies to watch and use when I have people come over. And for those that don't know what its like to have a 3D movie or TV, it really is good. I dropped allot of money for one so its really better than the movie theaters.Anyways, I question how they would do a 3D cartoon that isn't like the movies cars. So, I thought I buy this as well as The Lion King 3D. And I was speechless, it was amazing to watch.I love how if I have to baby sit, I can toss this in the blu ray and have hours to myself cuz they love the 3D.However, I will say I am a total sucker for Aladdin, when they make that in 3D I will have that day its out.	5.0	OMG, I'm in LOVE with this movie.	2011-10-29	2	1	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1M9DQDGE07Q0U	Nix Pix	In 1991 Disney's &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast&quot; became the only film in the history of the Academy Awards to be nominated in the Best Picture catagory.  And although it didn't win (Silence of the Lambs did), the ripple effect that this landmark had on the Disney legacy was felt for nearly a decade afterward.  The story is based on the classic fairytale but given the &quot;Disney touch&quot; with talking furniture and magical moments that really owe more to a Broadway show than the Brothers Grimm.Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were the creative team that penned the Oscar winning score.  But when the film originally premiered one of their best songs &quot;Human Again&quot; was left on the cutting room floor, an artistic liberty that has been rectified with this DVD release.You get not one, not two, but three distinct versions of this film on DVD.  All are presented in anamorphic widescreen.  The special edition includes the restoration of the Ashman/Menken song previously mentioned as well as an all new, newly enhanced IMAX hi-def print that really makes the film sparkle beyond anything seen in theaters.  The original theatrical cut is also included as well as &quot;Beauty &amp; The Beast: Work In Progress&quot; a wonderful version of the film, shown at a New York critic's preview that includes pencil tests of the film's art work, released before a final version of the finished film was completed.  Disc two of this enchanted Platinum Edition is chocked full of extra features that are too many to be believed.  Some seem rather silly - the dance mix of Beauty &amp; The Beast music video falls into this catagory.About the transfer: The opening scene with its stained glass windows is heavy on edge enhancement and pixelization.  However, once these few moments are over, so are both of these distractions.  Overall, the visual quality of either the theatrical cut or special edition is outstanding.  The 5.1 mix is beautifully presented.  On disc two, the menus and some of the documentary footage also suffer from aliasing and shimmering details but nothing that one can't overlook for the sake of getting through the rough spots.  BOTTOM LINE: This tale may be old as time, but it shines like a new penny in this wonderful remastered offering from Disney Inc.

The print of the inserts is amateurish.  As if the originals were printed on a color copier.MISSPELLINGS!  It's as if they used OCR (optical Character Recognition) to obtain the text and didn't bother to do the first spell check.  There are things in the main TITLES of the sections that make absolutely NO SENSE.  Like, ""Be Our Guest To An Al HTS!""  and ""Bonus Feature Highlig L-New DVD Experience!"" and ""Disc 1: Navigntional overview"".These are but a tiny sampling of the mess that is the DVD insert.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ADIDQRLLR4KBQ	"""paradise_found"""	Ah, I can remember seeing this the first time in a dark, cold theater with my mom and grandma. I remember masquerading as Belle two years later for Halloween. I remember all the hours I spent singing along to a cassette I recorded from the film.Good times.Everyone knows the story of Beauty and the Beast. Belle is a beautiful French girl with the big dreams and caring nature. Sought by the macho egotist Gaston, Belle is heralded as one of the most gorgeous women in the town. But does this effect Belle? Of course not. Belle is sweet, caring, and as intelligent as they come. Could Gaston, who looks through her book one day and declares &quot;But there aren't any pictures!&quot; ever be an appropriate match for sensitive Belle?As animated characters go, one must admit she's an inspiration.Belle's father, Maurice, is the slightly odd town inventor. He is on his way to the fair to show off his newest creation, a wood-chopping machine, when he is dragged off to beast's castle.When Belle shows up looking for Beast, it's obvious her stay isn't going to be conventional. There are talking teapots, candlesticks, and even clocks!After agreeing to take her father's place as Beast's prisoner, the viewer is hooked. The beauty of the film is that it's most certainly not a conventional animated love story. Beast isn't much of a gem in comparison to Cinderella's prince, after all.The design is incredibly pleasing. The splendor of the old, spooky, almost completely abandoned castle only adds to the intrigue that is Beauty and the Beast. From armoires jumping around choosing your wardrobe all the way up to the deteriorating fabrics and floors that make up Beast's chambers.It's eye candy, no doubt. The DVD format is slightly less visually appealing because of 'enhancements' made to the film with computer technology. Colors are less true in places.Despite all of the above, what makes the film timeless is the soundtrack. From the opening song through &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; right up until the closing number, the instrumentals are outstanding and the songs are outstanding. They have bearing outside the film, away from Beast's gloomy world.The DVD is an exceptional bet for the B&amp;B enthusiast. It includes a 'personality' test (Ah, I'm officially Belle!), hours of bonus footage, celebrity commentary, the original music video with Celine Dion and a few interactive games. (Two or three, I believe)They wrote &quot;Human Again&quot; into the film. For those of you who've seen the Broadway version, you'll of course know how clever this song is. I was quite disappointed with the animated rendition, however. The animation is choppy, uncreative, and perhaps even cliched. I'll admit I liked hearing it sung by the original film cast, but I wasn't impressed with their attempt to squeeze it into the film. It's worth hearing once or twice, but it's not as good as I'd hoped.Of course, they included the original version Theatrical Release in here for me, so I can't complain.I would VERY HIGHLY recommend buying this. It's a 90s film essential for all ages. Your kids will love it and I have a feeling you'll enjoy it more than you'll let on.	5.0	One of The Last Disney Greats	2002-10-24	7	2	5
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2363NU57MJM6K	Pat Rice	I always miss the chance to purchase this Disney classic everytime it is offered. I don't want to miss it this time. I have been a fan of Disney films forever. I have read some of the reviews warning that the transfer of the film is poorly done i.e color changes. I agree that Disney has always done their films in beautiful bold colors, that is one of the things that makes their films special. Howewer, don't forget the storyline and music. I'll take a chance and buy this version anyway. I can't imagine the film being horrible. Someone gave it a one star rating! WoW!!! Well,I am going to buy it. Now, I am anxiously waiting for the LION KING	4.0	I don't want to miss this opportunity	2010-09-11	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A329U9CDUPKXAC	Patrick	The wait was worth it for 'Beauty and the Beast' to make it's way to DVD. This has got to be the DVD with the best bonus features EVER! You start out with a highly in-depth look at the making of the film and the history of the story all hosted by the delightful Celine Dion. Celine also hosts a HIGHLY entertaining segment called &quot;The Story Behind The Story.&quot; In this segment actors Angela Lansbury, Robby Benson, Jodi Benson, Ming-Na, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara and David Ogden Stiers relive the Disney versions and original stories of 'The Hunchback of Note Dame,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'Mulan,' 'The Lion King,' 'Cinderella, 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Pocahontas.' The DVD also features the music video to the highly successful song &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. For some unknown reason, Disney felt it necessary to include a newer version of the song performed by Jump 5. It's a crime that Disney wasted these talentless youngster's time to record a version of the song that in no way fits into the magic of this film. Celine and Peabo already recorded the song beautifully. Why did Disney hire people who can't sing a note to record the same song? The film itself has been fully resorted and the picture and sound quality has never been better. It even includes a new musical number &quot;Human Again&quot; which I could really do without. Many people like the song but I think it's poorly written and even more poorly performed. But it doesn't take anything away from this being one of the greatest films ever made. I'm really happy with what Disney has come up with this time. This &quot;Special Edition&quot; actually is special. I can only hope Disney continues with these &quot;Special Editions&quot; and bring us 'Aladdin,' 'The Little Mermaid,' and all the other Disney classics. Hopefully they will do this sooner than later.	5.0	Thank You Disney!	2002-10-13	1	0	1

I was hoping to a legitimate copy but this is clearly hacked together. The print quality on the sleeves and covers is like a home printer quality. The box is cheap with cheap hinges like something you would buy in bulk. The movie itself plays OK on my computer but put it in the Blu ray and low and behold the picture is like a home-burned disc. The picture size is tiny (squished into the upper left hand corner) and very poor quality (maybe 480i?).Basically, someone made this at home and sold it as a (admittedly passable at first glance) legitimate copy.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3MRONM9HTUYNT	Pie	It's been over seven years since I saw the movie, and last night I picked it up from my shelf again. I had not forgotten the plot or the music or the script, but I didn't really like it as a kid, but when I saw it this time, I loved it. It was because I understood more and I truly believe that this is the best Disney Classic movie of all times (nominated for six Academy Awards).We follow the tale of Belle, who lives in a quiet village in a normal life. But one day she goes looking for her lost father, an inventor on his way to a fair with his invention, and she finds herself in a large castle with a mysterious beast. She finds out that her father had wandered his way into the castle and she exchanges her freedom to free her father. Soon, we see the beast's love for her and romance sparkle between them as time passes, with a little help of the castle servants, who have become enchanted into house hold items. The beast was a prince who's cruelty and selfishness doomed him to become a beast until he can learn to love and earn the love back, but before a magical rose stored in his bedroom start to wilt and if it does totally, he would be doomed to be a beast for all time. But if succeeds the spell would be broken.The characters are extremly well-thought of and they keep the movie alive. We have the bad guys, one by the name of Caston, the town buff and handsome who initially likes Belle, but his personality is cruel and selfish. We have his idiotic side-kick, LaFoo as well. All this is the normal type of characters he would see nowadays in a Disney cartoon.I'm sure nearly all of us have seen this masterpiece, and it's worth picking it up again!	5.0	It's Beautiful	2002-07-16	1	1	0

Unless someone falls in love with him as a beast, he will remain that way forever) I love how he starts out as seeming like a monster, but he turns out nice and he protects her from wolves and a hunter named Gaston. Will Belle fall in love with the Beast before the last rose petal falls? I highly recommend BEAUTY AND THE BEAST!!!	5.0	Beauty is in the eye of the Beholder!!!	2010-09-29	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A5ZUZ49YRDPCV	Rachel Garret	"On DVD, the Platinum Special Edition of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a refreshing and aesthetic experience. The DVD comes loaded with special features- theatrical trailers, three versions of the film, soundtrack, Broadway musical and interactive games. Beauty and the Beast was released in 1991. It was Disney's most enduring classic, and one of the first to use computer generated effects which would pave the way for later films. The romantic, quasi Gothic tale revolves around a haughty prince, transformed into a hideous Beast, who must love a woman and earn her love in return. ""But who could ever learn to love a beast ?."" That would be Belle, the book-smart, beautiful, courageous and vibrant young heroine and one of the few Disney heroines who is not vain, vapid and helpless. Belle's father becomes imprisoned in the Beast's dungeon and Belle offers to take his place. During her stay in the Beast's castle, she becomes acquianted with the enchanted host of objects and furniture- Lumiere, the candelabra who speaks  French like Maurice Chevalier, Cogsworth the uptight British clock, Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury) as the warm, motherly teapot an Chip the rambunctious tea cup. Belle saves the Beast with her love- and he is transformed into a handsome, human prince.The villain in the film is Gaston, a ruggedly handsome, but self-centered and vainglorious hunter. Gaston is determined to make Belle his trophy wife, but his machinations (including locking up her inventor father, Maurice, in an insane asylum). The special effects are computer enhanced- particularily striking is the ballroom scene. Beauty and the Beast is full of memorable and catchy songs by Alan Menken and Tim Rice- ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Be Our Guest"" ""Belle"", ""Gaston"" ""Something There"" ""Kill the Beast"" and the never before heard song ""Human again"". There is no wonder why the movie was made into a popular and successful Broadway musical."	5.0	DVD Perfection: Beauty And The Beast Is Back	2003-03-07	10	7	3

The good looking guys/girls get everything while the less appealing people, represented in this film by the beast, really don't.  If only it were that easy in real life, but it isn't.  Still, it was great to watch the film and see the way the beast softened his heart and eventually let Belle go, but she came back.

I put off buying this dvd version for months, because I thought that because I already owned it on vhs, I wouldn't be upset if I missed it, but I'm glad I got it. This two disc collection features THREE versions of the film! And tells you all about the making of the picture. It also features music videos, and short bits of information about other disney classic's, so you can hear about where the idea's for the films came from. One of these films is &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. It is the perfect film to add to your collection, and one of the few disney films I will by on dvd. Fun for all ages. Get it before it goes away, cause you know disney, they take movies away for years and years.

Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast..........Disney's Beauty and The Beast is one of the best classics that Disney released in the 90's. It is the only animated movie in history to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It tells the story of Belle, the most beautiful girl in town, dreaming of something more. Belle loves her father, more than anything else in the world. When he gets in trouble, Belle goes to save him and trades her freedom to the Beast in exchange for her father's release, and in here starts the romantic relationship between Belle and The Beast. But Gaston, who has been thinking of marrying Belle has other plans for her...It's wonderful to hear that Disney is releasing Beauty and the Beast as their second movie from their platinum edition series. The Dvd features countless hours of Bonus features, as that of the previously released "" Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs "" , including 3 Enchanted Versions Of Film, Special Edition, Original Theatrical Edition, Work In Progress Edition, Audio Commentary, Sing-Along Track, Character Galleries, The Broadway Musical, Trailers & TV Spots and much much more!!! The movie itself contains a never-before-seen musical sequence, which is worth buying for!All in all, this dvd will be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and if you dont have it, you're missing something."	5.0	Disney at it's best!	2002-05-25	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI	"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan"""	"This is the film which set the high bar of standards for all other animated films to try to meet. After Disney's success with 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"", the studio was quickly on the road to recovery after a dismal record of not-so-great productions (anyone remember ""The Black Cauldron""?). Then came the masterpiece: ""Beauty and the Beast"", a handsomely detailed film that's satisfying on all levels of story, animation and music.How good is it? It's the only animated film (so far) to have received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, so you know that this film lives up to all the hype surrounding it.This quaint period story begins with Belle, a young woman in a close-minded French town whose people label her ""odd"" and ""loony"" for spending her time reading books. Constantly pursued by a swaggering, loutish, narcisstic brute named Gaston to marry him, Belle finds shelter within the pages of her books, expanding her knowledge and imagination. But her life changes forever when her eccentric inventor-father stumbles upon a dark castle while lost in the woods. There, he encounters the hideous, frightening Beast, who imprisons him for trespassing. Belle agrees to remain as a ""guest"" at the castle in exchange for her father's freedom. As the narrator tells us at the beginning of the film, the Beast was once a handsome prince whose uncaring vanity forced a sorceress to place a powerful curse upon him and his castle, which can only be broken by true love. And there begins the heart of the story, as Belle attempts to reveal the ""beauty"" within the Beast and forge love & understanding between them (which, of course, turns out to be not-so-easy!).Robby Benson & Mary Kay Bergman voice the title characters (who would've guessed such a soft-spoken actor as Benson would possess such a powerful lower register?). The supporting cast includes a wide assortment of talking, dancing & singing household items (the Prince's servants transformed under the curse), brought to life by such wonderfully diverse voice talents as Angela Lansbury (Miss Potts), the late Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), and David Odgen Stiers (Cogsworth).The songwriting team of Ashman & Menken compose a musical score for a Disney film that's the most memorable ever. I dare you not to tap your foot while hearing such tunes as ""Be Our Guest"" or fall under the spell of the title song.And the film helped launch Disney into sort of a ""renaissance"" period as they followed with one great film after another: ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"", ""Pocahontas"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Hercules"", ""Mulan"" and ""Tarzan"".Sometimes haunting, sometimes frightening, and often joyous in its imagery & storytelling, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is Disney at its peak of perfection. No Disney collection would be complete without it!"	5.0	"A ""tale as old as time"" breathes new life into Disney"	2007-08-23	1	1	0

I absolutely LOVE this movie and it's one of my all time favorite animated movies.  Let me explain the reason for this review.  I don't know about anyone else, but I'm kind of ticked off at this release.  I just went out and bought this blu-ray last October when it was first released as a ""Diamond Edition"" blu-ray.  Now they're re-releasing it in 3D?  That kind of sucks considering that I'm planning on buying a 3D tv in about a month.  Now it looks like I might have to re-buy this movie.  I hate when studios keep releasing newer versions of their movies.  We, as fans, can't wait forever to buy one of the versions, but we hate to run out and buy the first one knowing that there might be a better version released soon after (this 3D version for example).  So what are we to do?  If they were going to release a 3D version of this film on blu-ray, I wish they would've just waited one more year and only released this one.  I'd love to have this movie in 3D, but I'm really not sure I want to spend another 30 bucks on a second copy of this blu-ray.  Bummer."	1.0	Blu-Ray Now in 3D???	2011-04-24	29	14	15

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who ""seem"" to be ""different.""  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation.The beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything.  Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him:  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed.  The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in ""non"" animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it.  It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as ""The Fisher King,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" ""Thelma and Louise"" and John Singleton's ""Boyz N the Hood"" that year).The talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made:  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic ""moments"" that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why ""Beauty and the Beast"" is one of Disney's all time greatest films.One final note:  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies."	5.0	One of Disney's Best Films	2001-12-11	8	7	1

It offers the theatrical release and the additional extended footage. This is Disney Studios at their best! This story touched many hearts worldwide and promises to do so for years to come!This is what the Studio did best, a classic fairy tale, well planned animation, top notch musical numbers and characters that actually mean something. I guess they lost their touch after Mulan.  I liked Atlantis, but it was a far cry from Beauty and the Beast.I remember in the 1980s when it looked as if it were curtains for my childhood illustrator. Then came The Little Mermaid.

I am KICKING myself for not buying the DVD platinum edition! I got the VHS of the platinum edition just three weeks before my family got a DVD player (a month before I got one in my room)! Just to think that I could have the original ""Black Diamond"" version, the Platinum Version, AND a ""Work-in-progress"" version ALL on one disc is crazy! Too bad this DVD is out of print. I wish that they wouldn't make the platinum editions go out of print. I was lucky enough to find a used verion of the Platinum ""Snow White"" for $16.99 at game stop (2-disc). I really want this DVD version with all 3 versions of the film. By the way, ""Human Again"" has outstanding color and animation, not to mention, it is seamlessly added into the film, which I found amazing! Go buy this DVD NOW (hopefully I'll find it somewhere!)EDIT: AUGUST 4, 2006: I found this on DVD, and I must say, I am very pleased! Disney really did well on this!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2NMXYVQYTWMLD	R. J Metz	"Well, what can I say?  I loved this movie/musical from the first time I saw it in the Theatres.  Based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, this animated musical that later became a Broadway Stage hit, is a true classic.  The music was written by the team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also did Little Mermaid, and Little Shop of Horrors.  Howard Ashman died shortly after this film was released.  This movie is about a young maiden named Belle who loves to read and eventually has to rescue her father from an enchanted castle where an evil prince has been transformed to a beast, and the subjects have been transformed into clocks, candlesticks and other objects.  And if the spell can only be broken if he can fall in love before his 21st year.What I love about this movie, I think is the romance, Jerry Orbach's charisma as the Lumiere, and of course Paige O'Hara's golden voice.  For several years I still had my VHS copy from childhood, but no VCR to play it on anymore.  And for Christmas my Aunt gave it to me for when I have children.  I'm not married yet, but eventually.  I just can't get enough of it.  It brings back so many memories.  I also love ""BE Our Guest.""  Jerry Orbach does a great version of it.  I will alway remember how heartbroken I was when Mr. Orbach died of colon cancer.  Goodness, what a horrible loss!  Also, the scene when the Beast releases Belle to go see her sick father makes me cry every time I watch it.All in all, this is a wonderful movie from ages nothing to not telling.  So add it to your collection before Disney puts it back in the vaults!"	5.0	So Glad to have it back!	2011-02-04	1	1	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A4UGMKUSX9XHI	Robert Stone	"I was delighted to hear that this terrific film was coming to Blu-Ray. I had missed out on the DVD version in the past before the film was put back in ""the vault."" Although I suspect anyone reading this review already is aware that this is a great movie I can't resist putting in my two cents that this is Disney at its best. I always thought Belle served as a wonderful role model for kids with her love of books and learning - it somehow makes her more three-dimentional than some of the other princesses. The story in this film has a nicer arc and just flows better with all the characters growing and developing (well, maybe not Mr. Antlers-In-All-My-Decorating). I must admit that the lack of a major parental figure dying also is quite appealing as that seems to happen so often in Disney films. Anyway, this is a terrific story well told and back in the day I was very much hoping it would be awarded Best Picture.What you are probably reading this for, however, is an assessment of the picture quality / sound quality on the blu-ray and I can tell you it is superb. I was impressed with the detail visible in the animations, it was like seeing the movie in the theatre. Sound is also excellent. My kids (5 and 7) both had only seen part of the movie on a dim-looking laserdisc (yes, I'm one of the few who still has a working laserdisc player in my home) - and this presentation really got their attention. We also watched the interviews with the cast of the Broadway show and that was a fun feature. We haven't ventured to the second 'special features' disc yet. The inclusion of a DVD is a nice touch as it will see service in our car soon.Overall, this is an excellent presentation of what IMHO is Disney's finest work."	5.0	Beauty and the Beast better on Blu-Ray	2010-11-11	2	2	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1WUMTJOASEL5F	"Robert ""Supermandisco"""	"I tried, but my measurement with the Disney animation films yardstick began with the superior Sleeping Beauty, of which this does not compare. Noisy, brash, contemptible, and saddled with a hero who is repulsive. Plus there are positively no characters I care for, and belle looks typical until she enters the ""enchanted castle"" for a much needed makeover. I never cared for the beast, or his situation, one he was cursed with not because he was a victim, but because he deserved it in the first place. When Belle finally announces her love for the beast, I ask myself why. Why, indeed, if not just to give this film a much needed happy ending on cue from the running time since the beginning of the film, because there is no other explanation for her sudden burst of romance after his long bouts of yelling, eating like a pig, and nasty behavior. The hero does not find favor in my eyes, and love doesn't hand out it's hand to every tom, dick, and harry just because they are cast in the right position. At least, not from myself."	2.0	Beastly animated musical	2012-01-10	7	0	7

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2OVR63TMZ8FJJ	Robin McDonald	Jeez I hate to waste my opportunity to review this movie right now but the purpose of these reviews is to be helpful. The most helpful thing I can happily contribute is Disney is releasing Beauty and the Beast on DVD next year and plans to release each subsequent film on a one per year basis. That means Aladdin probably won't be available for two years and Lion King for three. Its very frustrating to have to wait this long for these titles and hopefully public pressure will encourage them to accelerate the pace of the release.  As far as the new Beauty and the Beast disc goes I believe you can expect to see some of the following supplements. Addition of the deleted song &quot;Be Human Again&quot; sung by the enchanted objects in the house after Belle arrives and they begin to have hope the curse will be broken...(This will not be added to the film itself) Pencil animated version of 'Be Our Guest&quot; where the song is sung to Maurice instead of Belle. Belle was swapped in to make the story flow better. Television promotional featurette for the film with interviews with Angela Lansbury Paige O'Hara and other cast members as well as animators Glenn Keane Will Finn and others. I suspect there will be a commentary, concept sketches and storyboard images.  I am one of the few people to have seen this but I would love it if they would include as a hidden easter egg a joke animation from &quot;Gaston.&quot;  When Gaston sings....and every last inch of me's covered with hair&quot; he pulls open his shirt and instead of the hairy chest is a pair of flouncy bosoms in a bra with tassels. I wouldn't count on that one.  Depending if they want to release a two disc version at the same or different price you might also get Beauty and the Beast the Work in Progress reel.  Which is another full version of the film in an unfinished state shown in a limited pre-screening. Inserted throughout the film where it was not yet completed are either rough, cleanup pencil or storyboard sketches to fill in the gaps. Its a fascinating way to see the animation process in its various stages.  As the disc is not finalized yet I can not say for one hundred percent sure what will be included. If it is like the new Snow White DVD there could be a heck of a lot more. I would not expect to see the DVD until next Summer at the very earliest and probably not 'til winter. I know many of you are wondering when? when? when? so I am sacrificing my opportunity to review one of my favorite films to let you know.	5.0	Beauty and the Beast coming next year.....	2001-10-09	33	26	7

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1TTFG1PVGXWIP	Rocky Boat	"My second favorite Disney movie ever (after ""The Little Mermaid""), ""Beauty and the Beast"" has been a favorite of mine since I saw it in theaters in 1991 and later when I bought the VHS in 1992. It's simply a captivating motion picture: from the striking opening shot of a castle deep in the woods, you are riveted to the screen until the closing shot of a stained glass. The songs are some of the best by Disney, particularly ""Belle"" and ""Something There"" (I don't like the newly-added ""Human Again""). The musical score is fittingly haunting and rich, most effective in the prologue, the west wing and the transformation sequences. While Alan Menken's best songs are probably those in ""Mermaid"", the score here is arguably his best.Now, on to this release. Ever since it's 2002 DVD debut, there has been quite a controversy over the restoration the film has gone through. And indeed, anyone even slightly familiar with the original release, easily noticed the difference in colors. Whereas the early 90's version boasted a gothic and dark picture, the 2002 DVD showed a flat and cheap-looking picture with bright and off colors (for example, ""olive green"" turned to neon green). I don't know what the directors were trying to achieve by doing that, maybe experience their classic in a Saturday Morning cartoon style? So imagine how eager Disneyphiles were for the new release, firmly believing they'll nail it this time and that the Diamond Edition would look more like the 1991 film than the 2002 one.So after seeing the new transfer, I can say it's better than the previous release, but still disappointing as it looks nothing like the original. Again, Belle's hair is light brown instead of dark, the ballroom is too yellowish, even the stars in the ballroom sequence don't sparkle as they do in the original. These flaws may look minor to casual viewers but it's irritating to fans of the film.So even though it is a brilliant film, I was disappointed to some degree by its restoration and I wish the directors would finally take notice. As for me, I'm keeping my 1992 VHS tape to enjoy what was ORIGINALLY ""Beauty and the Beast""."	4.0	Disney Classic Marred By Disappointing Colors	2010-12-06	2	2	0

I have read most of them, and ironically, all the old tales tend to get wound up in details that tend to distract one from the story line. But Disney knows what can be left out, how to create believable (if stock) characters, develop tension in the story as well as take artistic license where it adds drama and moves the story along.And of all of Disney animated movies, Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite. Belle seems nearly flesh and blood; smart, curious and headstrong. She knows what she wants and learns to look in the right place. The Beast is wonderful as are the rest.Oh! And the music is the BEST that Disney has ever offered.I only have an old VHS tape but need to buy a DVD....!	5.0	The best of Disney storytelling... animated or otherwise	2008-12-26	1	1	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2RAY4AURHQN99	Sam &#34;Mayday&#34; Malone	"This movie is twisted when you think about it:1. The prince really learns no lesson at all, in the beginning he shuns the old hag (she is ugly) and is cursed to live as a beast and must love someone (presumably for who they are on the inside) but Belle is constantly referred to as the most beautiful girl in the village. The prince learned to fall in love with a beautiful girl, what a challenge.2. The candle is an adulterer. One of the songs has a line stating ""....husbands beware..."" is that really something kids should hear?3. The witch in the beginning turns everyone, even innocent children like Chip into household items and possibly going to let them live like that forever? That is pretty cruel and does not make sense.Overall, its a decent Disney movie, but certainly not the greatest that everyone seems to proclaim it to be."	3.0	Kind of dark and disturbing if you think about it	2010-12-24	19	2	17

So why did they have to add a scene?? The DVD version is weakened by the added scene in which the houseware characters sing, ""Human Again."" The problem with this scene begins with the fact that it is not needed, add to that the color in the animation is different from that of the rest of the film and it just seems so completely out of place. To me the added scene seems uncomfortable. The bottom line is that it is a great movie, but the added scene brings it from a 5 to a 3 star rating!!!"	3.0	here is the problem	2003-07-20	11	9	2
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2UX5BGNNAE7QL	Samantha Rae	I just finished Beauty and the Beast in 3D and it brought me back to my childhood. As far as the 3d conversion process I think overall they did a good job. Originally the movie was hand drawn and some Computer Animation. Some of the 3D look was represented in appearance by that different animation style and took a little away from crisp completely computer animated 3D we have become use to. There was some ghosting involved from what I could tell but most of the time it was not that distracting. Even with a good amount of the background looking reminiscent of old school Disney animation I grew up fondly enjoying, it was made to look like it was in 3d but sometimes I do not always think it worked out spotless.Do not let some those negatives sway you too much, they did have fantastic backgrounds that added depth to what was one 2D, and made the castle look much bigger then I remember it was. As she walked through the streets in the beginning of the movie the rooftops were given dimension making the town seem a little more real. What were once just beautiful backdrops of the castle the added dimension brought out the size and scope of west-wing, library, and the great hall making them feel bigger, and a more warming or dreary place.What can be said for the Ballroom but wow. it was a masterpiece then, and it was equally as stunning now. Being how the Beauty and the Beast waltz scene was fully done in computer animation int he past, it really was able to shine with the added 3d process added.Overall I enjoyed the movie in 3d and brought a new depth to an already beautiful story. If this was going to be one of the harder 3D conversions Disney was doing, I can not wait to see Aladdin, or Little Mermaid. Finding Nemo will be amazing, along with monster's inc. Looking forward to them.Score wise has to be a high 3  to a low 4 due to the limitations it was under because of the old animation styling, but it still came out pretty well.(though Little Mermaid will be along the same limitations B&B; was under due to most of it was not computer animated either, but still looking forward to seeing Mermaid as well)	4.0	The 3d Viewer: Beauty and the Beast	2011-10-11	2	0	2

It has a little romance, some adventure, lots of singing, and a happy ending. There are some dark moments and scary parts.. so for kids that get scared easily, maybe wait to show this video or have the remote ready to fast-forward.

What I do not like is the whole Disney idea of being ""in the vault.""

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ASYY7Q8KEIT4Q	Sarah Watson	There are many Disney movies that are claimed to be masterpieces, and I'm sure they all have a worthy stature to be referred to by that position.  However, Beauty and the Beast is the top billing amongst all of Disney's masterpieces.This movie was incredible not only in the way that it captured a classic love story known throughout all ages and presented it in a way that appeals to the masses, but it also combined incredible animation techniques of simple pencil animation and state-of-the-art computer animation (which is shown in the infamous ballroom scene).I feel that this film opened many doors in animation with the animation, the presentation of the story, and the music that moves and supplements the picture.Besides, the fact that this was the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar just goes to show that this is truly a beauty of a masterpiece.	5.0	A Beauty of a Masterpiece	2002-07-15	0	0	0

For me, a Disney film is not meant to be just a &quot;film&quot; - rather an experience. While the animation is almost as good as ever (though the faces are a little too sharp), I think Disney just tried to make a &quot;film&quot; here. At the end of it, while I could applaud the slick animation and technology, I could not realize any sort of that &quot;bubbling happiness&quot; that I expect from Disney. The music is good (though nowhere near Snowwhite and Sleeping beauty). What I miss most is the lack of sufficient *characters*. For example, in Snowwhite, every animal was given a part - the tortoise, the squirrels, the rats, the birds, the deers, the fly etc. Here, the focus is only on the lead characters.Anyway, it suffers only in comparison - overall a good watch.	3.0	Good.. but not great..	2003-12-12	9	2	7

Like ""The Little Mermaid"" before it, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a beautiful and morally important fable. From Belle's perspective, it tells us that you can't always judge someone on first meeting them...no matter how gruff they might appear. The Beast learns that love will only come to you when you treat others as you'd have them treat you. And don't forget all those fantastic songs!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AX52ULYSK82AF	scifiman5	Beauty and the Beast is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie of the past 15 years.  It harkens back to days of Snow White, Fantasia, and Pinocchio in its charming story and its timeless morals.  As for the songs, the Menken-Ashman team's masterpiece contains the very best of Disney songs in all of its history, including &quot;Belle&quot; and, of course, the title song.And now with this glorious 2-DVD set we can truly appreciate this film.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ	Sean Pasek	"For me, ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the best Disney film, and it is my favorite.  ""Wall-E"" is right up there for me, but for simple animation, it will always be ""Beauty and the Beast.""  I love how Disney has taken some of the most simple stories and made them so palpable for both children and adults.  Such life-lessons include, dealing with the loss of a parent, learning to be yourself, and the most profound of all, for me: seeing the beauty of yourself and others from the inside.While these may seem like simple morality tales, I venture that most people would find such obstacles extremely challenging.  This is one reason why Disney films, such as this one, can easily be viewed over and over again, because like reading a good spiritual book, the lessons are always applicable.The movie sets the tone from the start, with David Ogden Stiers as the narrator, using that great voice of his, to give us the prologue of the story; that a young prince has been transformed into a beast due to his lack of love and insight.Beauty and the Beast has one of the best heroines, in my opinion, in Disney animation.  Belle (brilliantly voiced by Paige O'Hara) is a simple girl from a small town.  She goes against the norm for the other young women of the town, because she loves to read, and she is not afraid to speak her mind.  These are several personality traits that frequently frustrate the town's handsome suitor, Gaston; a person who all of the other young women find absolutely appealing, but for Belle, Gaston is the antithesis of the qualities she looks for in a man.  Belle is pure-hearted, and she is looking for someone who shares the same qualities.  She isn't necessarily picky.  She simply knows what she wants, and strangely enough, she finds him in the most unlikely of guises.*You'll note that one of interesting ways that the animators make Belle stand out, is that she is the only person in town wearing blue.The Beast is a man consumed with anger and self-loathment.  He can't even stand to look at how he used to be, as we see him rip a portrait of himself to pieces.  The first meeting between Belle and the Beast is not a happy one at all.  The Beast is unable to see his own cruelty (perhaps because this is how he has always been, and he doesn't know how to be any different) as he drags Belle's father away from her, not even thinking about her feelings at all.Belle is able to soften the Beast, as she is able to keep up with him and his own sense of logic, which is beautifully demonstrated as the two argue back and forth after the wolf attack.  Ironically, it often takes someone else to show us what others see.  I find it interesting that the Beast's only link to the outside world is a mirror, since the mirror is his greatest asset to remind him to look within himself.  In many ways, Belle is the Beast's true mirror.  She finally begins to see something hidden beneath the anger and despair, and she helps him to see what she already sees.The dance sequence across the ballroom floor is probably my favorite scene.  The attention to detail by the animation department is incredible...from shadows to reflections, to the embroidery of the marble pillars, and the detail of the tapestries.  This is also the climactic scene in which is becomes apparent that both Belle and the Beast love each other.  Both the animation and lighting are at their pinnacle peak during this sequence.  There is such attention to detail.  I love the way Belle is continuously moving a strand of hair from her face.Beast demonstrates his love for Belle in the purest and noblest of ways: he lets her go.  We have all heard about how if you truly someone, you must let it go.  Love is to be given, and the Beast, despite his feelings, lets Belle go to find and be with her ill father.There is a host of terrific characters in this film.  Gaston epitomizes the conceited, manly man who thinks of no one but himself.  I like Gaston's character because he isn't the ""evil prototype"" that we've seen in the past.  He's simply a man whose ego is larger than life, and he will never risk losing out to anyone, let alone a hairy Beast!Jerry Orbach is terrific as Lumiere, and provides one of the best songs in the film, ""Be Our Guest"" in which every item in the kitchen is involved in an elaborate musical and dance number, with little reminders of the follies done during the 20s and 30s.Angela Lansbury is perfectly cast as the teapot, Mrs. Potts, playing the proverbial, wise housekeeper.Overall, the film has true charm, and anyone of any age will enjoy it.  Beauty and the Beast is a timeless classic, and the only animated film to ever be nominated for Best Picture.  The film was even converted into a Broadway show that was an instant hit.Beauty and the Beast teaches us to leave our prejudicial judgments at the door.  It is often challenging to look within ourselves and others to see the true beauty that lies within each one of us.  Aside from being an exquisite romantic film, Beauty and the Beast serves as a reminder that there is beauty in everyone.  Are we brave enough to find it within?"	5.0	Classic, Vintage Disney Film is My All-Time Favorite!	2009-10-12	1	1	0

This has been my favorite Disney movie since it came out. I don't know what it is about it, the characters, the music, the magic, all classic examples of what makes it pure Disney. I was there when Susan Egan did her wonderful version of 'Belle' on Broadway (and I must say she did a terrific job!). And when it went to IMAX, I was first in line to see it (I believe 'WOW' was the only word I could say for the rest of the night.).  When DVDs came out, I was afraid I'd have to transfer my VHS Disney collection to DVD. But now since Disney has taken it's finest classics to a greater level, 'platinum edition', I just decided I'd buy those. Of course I got 'Snow White' for christmas from my Uncle (Thanks!). I wasn't really a huge 'Snow White' fan, but I wanted to get it to show how big of a Disney fan I am. I adored all the special features on it! I had a blast! It took me acouple of hours just to take a tour of the special features on both discs! When I found out 'Beauty and the Beast' would be Disney's next platinum edition, I was siked! I was so incrredibly happy I couldn't sleep. I just can't wait to fall in love with 'Beauty and the Beast' all over again...	5.0	There are no words...	2002-06-18	7	4	3

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3UJW7N2WVT5UR	"""shrek102683"""	"While this DVD falls short of the amazement that is last year's DVD release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, my review will not concentrate on that. Also, this has something over Snow White: there are three presentations of the film. I will go over these and some of my favorite features in this review.First, the three versions: Special Edition, Original Theatrical Release, and Work In Progress Edition.The first version is the Special Edition, which was restored and remastered and re-shot with enhanced animation for IMAX and large-screen theaters with the ""Human Again"" sequence added in as well.The second version is the original theatrical version. You know, the same film we've seen for the last 11 years. Perfect for those who think the Special Edition sucks.The third, and possibly, my favorite version is the Work In Progress Edition. This was shown in October 1991 @ the New York Film Festival because they had requested a showing, yet the film was unfinished. There's a lot of scenes that are mostly or ALL in pencil animation, some parts are put together with storyboards, some with a mix of fully inked and painted animation, storyboard sketches, and/or rough/cleaned up pencil animation. It's really cool, you get to see some of the work involved in the creative process of the film. My only fault is that they added the finished score to it and replaced the colored scenes in the actual film with ones from the restored version. The score was not finished at the time, as is told in the ""A High-Profile Review"" featurette on Disc 2. I would have really liked to see it the way it was shown, dull colors, incomplete score, and all. But it's still satisfying.Some of my favorite features on Disc 2 include the virtual galleries, which I was glad to see as those were my favorite features from the Snow White DVD. I also enjoyed all the trailers and TV spots and promotional galleries as well. Mrs. Potts Personality Test is a winner for all ages. *I got Lumiere.* I also enjoyed seeing the camera tests, Early Presentation Reel, the alternate version of Be Our Guest sung to Maurice instead of Belle, (And let's thank God they decided to go with Belle.) and the demo of Human Again set to storyboard sketches.All in all, it may fall just a bit short of Snow White's amazement, but BATB still has a uniqueness of its own. It's still my favorite Disney movie of all time, and I love it now more than when I first saw it 10 years ago, as I now have a finer appreciation of the animated picture, everything that goes into it, the styles each film has, and the deeper meaning of the story. This DVD is a MUST have for any DVD collection, if only for the 3 versions of the film. I suggest you view all 3. Even if you HAVE the 1992 video release with the original theatrical version, I still suggest you see it in its newly restored glory, the Special Edition, also restored with the Human Again sequence, and the Work In Progress version for serious film buffs who like to see what kind of work goes into making a film."	5.0	Almost as good a DVD as Snow White.	2002-10-11	0	0	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A6UGTB17P5BX8	Simon Gifford	"I`ll be honest with you here - I went out and bought this DVD because I remember loving the film at the cinema in Britain a decade ago (well, I was around nine years old then, cut me some slack), and I wanted to re-aquaint myself with it.So how does this film hold up? Was it a sane purchase, or has nostalgia messed up my brain, exposing this reviewer as a sad and lonely individual? Read on to find out....You probably all know the story backwards, but I`m going to tell you anyway. Set in and around a quaint little village in France in the 18th Century, we follow the adventures of Belle (Paige O`Hara) a bright and beautiful young girl who finds escape from her everyday life - and the advances of a boorish, somewhat foppish suitor named Gaston - by reading books. Meanwhile, off in a castle, a cruel prince is turned into a tormented beast by an enchantress, also transforming his servants into household objects. In order to remove the curse, the Beast (Robby Benson) must discover a true love who will return his affection before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. With the help of the castle`s enchanted staff, Belle sees beneath the Beast`s exterior and discovers the heart and soul of a human prince.Beauty And The Beast came in the middle of a Disney renaissance (starting off with 1989`s The Little Mermaid). To this day, BATB remains the only animated movie in the history of the Academy to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture - something the likes of Shrek (2001) and the Toy Story films couldn`t match.Disc 1 houses 3 versions of the movie (Original 1991 Theatrical release, Special Edition and rarely seen ""Work In Progress""). I started with the 1991 release as thats` the one I remember.The film looks brilliant, with a High Definition, anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer meaning I could pick out little details I`d never noticed before - and an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 track too, the best I`ve heard this film sound. I`m no expert but I don`t think DD sound was invented back in 1991...This is just simply a lovely, charming film - even though its` a story which has been told and spoofed countless times (most recently in Shrek in 2001). I also felt for the characters (its` rare when an animated film does that) especially the Beast`s ""death"" scene - that is emotional.The animation is excellent - the famous ballroom dancing scene (because of its` use of computers) was groundbreaking at the time.The songs are great - giving the film an almost Broadway/West End like feel, as if it was meant to be performed on stage, from the operetta like opener Belle, to comedy character song Gaston (funny!) to the superb Busby Berkely like, showstopping Be Our Guest (this song even inspired a ""Simpsons"" parody - See My Vest).Be Our Guest in particular is a testament to the composing genius of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, as it sounds like a classic musical song like you`ve heard before, yet it is also very fresh at the same time. 3 songs - Belle, Be Our Guest and the title song Beauty And The Beast - sung by Angela Lansbury in the film and Celine Dion and Paebo Bryson over the end credits, were Oscar nominated. The title song ended up with the gong.Marvellous.In the Special Edition version, listen out for an extra song called Human Again.Disc 2 is full of extras - Making Ofs, Trailers, TV spots, Conceptual Art... the list goes on. I haven`t been through all of these yet but they`re very well presented indeed - if you have patience check out the Break The Spell game in The West Wing (navigate falling objects with complex button presses, and match character`s shadows to their human equivalents).Some people may sneer at Disney for their curious paractices concerning Asian cinema, but the fact remains they have made some classic animated features - see this as a reminder of what Disney was capable of before ""traditional"" animated films fell out of fashion - and prepare to smile with joy, sniffle, and go ""awwww"" all over again."	5.0	A reminder of how it used to be....	2003-01-06	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	2010 Update: Buy this now! If you wait you may end up writing a review that mirrors the following review that I wrote below in 2006....It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic just last week for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Beauty and the Beast by the time Disney released it again.Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Beauty and the Beast, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.There are plenty of other reviews here to discuss the movie's contents, so I won't go on about that. I will say that you should take advantage of purchasing Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.And indeed, you will enjoy Beauty and the Beast as thoroughly as your young one.Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.	5.0	For Your Princess	2006-08-22	11	10	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ	Skywalker	"Although ""Beauty and the Beast"" is and has been my absolute favourite film since I first saw it and I have watched it by now more than twenty times and in four different languages (I already knew I would adore it after I had seen a few screenshots and heard the soundtrack), I cannot deny that it contains some inconsistencies and inadvertences which I thought a new edition could at least have moderated a bit.For instance I immediately fell in love with the song ""Human Again"" when I heard it on the CD recording of the stage edition; but for some reason it never seems to get full credit. When I saw the play in Vienna nobody danced to this beautiful waltz melody, which I found missed a wonderful opportunity; in this edition's version there is more than enough dancing during the musical number, but the pictures and gags implemented are not quite as original as the rest, less classical and more ""childlike"" - the animation not so detailed, the colours more faded and the whole scene seems to address itself more to the children than to all viewers. The gags are for the most part silly, that the whole scene is set in spring when only shortly before the whole castle was deep in snow is illogical, and that the castle already has its ""rosy"" look, as if the spell had already been broken does not make sense either. (I would add that I never quite liked its ""rosy"" look at the end of the film - I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romantic.)More than that, the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belle's and the Beast's relationship, e.g. when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider, too; this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them, but again, it was missed.As I said, a pity! But nevertheless it is still an enchanting film and not one of the many films, Disney or other, which I have watched in the meantime has managed to even get the slightest chance to replace it as my favourite."	4.0	What a pity...	2014-02-09	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2I468GDNP94PS	"S. Lin ""SL"""	The first time I watched this, it scared me...the beast scared me. And so I really didn't feel like watching the rest. However...The second time I watched it...it still scared me, but it was a much more pleasing movie. I paid the story more attention and realized a lot of misconceptions I previously had about this movie (e.g. - Maurice got the beast in trouble, Gaston was badly done, prince is ugly, etc.). There was much chemistry between Belle and the Beast. There were very entertaining scenes where the Beast tries to please Belle by acting like a gentleman...you can almost feel the changes in him after Belle nurses his wounds after he saves her from the wolves.I can't rave about it more. It would have been the perfect tale if they hadn't made the Gaston sequences so long, as I really disliked him (this might be the pt. since we are supposed to hate the villains) and I really wish they would make a sequel to it instead of doing short pieces that belong in the middle.And the songs...what can I say?? They're skillfully made and put-together. Paige O'Hara's voice is a delight. All the songs were entertaining, the tunes were catchy. And it all melded into the story perfectly.Overall, it's a heartwarming, tear-jerking Disney classic for the whole family...even the guys!	5.0	Perfect...	2003-10-15	0	0	0

The 3D adds obvious dimension to an already ""3D"" story and animation.  Is it needed?  Absolutely not!

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3SAU1A0IEYDNX	Soaring Heart	"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, is a magical film about Belle, ""a beauty but a funny girl"" who loves books and wonders ""there must be more than this provincial life!"" Belle wants ADVENTURE! She is a marvelous protagonist because so many can relate to her. Yes, Belle is a dreamer but also has a strong, courageous heart to make her dreams come true. She is inspiring because she maintains a balance of her desires for a better life by finding  some joy in every day, no matter what the circumstances are.One day, through an unexpected turn of events, she finds herself locked in a dungeon for the sake and love of her elderly father.  I like how she thinks of him before herself.  That is love.  Only when the Beast, a cruel and hideous monster who once was a prince, (and still is but must find a way to bring out the good in his heart for all to see to break the spell) sends her father away and she doesn't get to say goodbye, does she realize the permanence of her decision.  She has lost ""her father, her freedom and her dreams in one day."" However, dreams have a way of never dying.  As long as they are alive in our hearts there is always Hope.  I love the way throughout this movie this theme of hope and patience is repeated over and over.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has it all--fantastic characters (I love them all, even the bad ones, but must say, besides Belle and the Beast, I love Lumiere the best) and the voices, lively entertainment, a beautiful soundtrack (along with a new song ""Human Again"",) a new full sequence of ""Be Our Guest"" (well done!) and the rainbow of emotions conveyed: longing, fear, anger, sadness, smiles, laughter, loyalty, looking on the bright side, being courageous and having hope and patience. Also, I love to witness the contrast between the good and bad characters in Disney movies. What a great character study, always! But the transition of the Beast into a true prince at heart, is my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast!I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:1.) Don't judge a person solely by their outward appearance but by their heart. The inner person of the heart--that is who one really is. The heart can not be hidden, it WILL be revealed, but we must have patience to wait for this.2.) Trust your heart and listen to it--Always.3.) With patience and love, your dreams can come true.4.) Never stop believing in yourself first. Because then no matter how things turn out, you are strong and proud of yourself.5.) Remember that showing kindness and compassion to others is the key to inner peace and true happiness. Life isn't about receiving but about giving--of ourselves.I applaud Disney on this excellent movie about following your heart even when it is difficult, because with enough heart and patience, everything in your life can turn around. 10/10 stars.  Thank you, Amazon. Red roses for everyone involved in this awesome, inspiring movie that won the Golden Globe for Best Picture.Soar!"	5.0	"""IT'LL ALL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT IN THE END, YOU'LL SEE."""	2002-12-07	3	2	1

A plush film of brilliant colours and animation. An enchanted story of love and acceptance, with the staple clich&eacute;' of happily ever after. Disney is notorious for its sweetly glazed sexist and racist generalizations. But this conscious mind still enjoys most of the Walt Disney Animations, and Beauty & The Beast is one of my personal favorites (behind The Lion King and the Little Mermaid).Without a doubt, the movie deserves a 5-Star rating - but the DVD .... well, [stinks]. Without a surround sound system or an SS option on your TV/DVD - you'll be missing 50 percent of the dialogue...But as the opening tune of ""Belle/Bonjour"" played, Belle's voice beautifully sings,  ""there goes the baker with his tray like always....""

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3R8PXSFGY9MC2	Spider Monkey	`Beauty and the Beast' is one of those films that has stood the test of time and it still feels as well made and delightful as when it was first released. Now it is re-released in blu-ray splendour you can relive it's magic again and again.Belle lives in a French village and loves nothing more than a good book and when the local Casanova Gaston (who is odious and vain) tries to take her hand in marriage she can think of nothing worse. Her father stumbles across a deserted castle inhabited by a gruesome beast, who is really a prince under a spell, and when Belle goes to rescue him she ends up being held prisoner herself. Over time Belle and the beast develop a love for one another and when Gaston comes to kill the beast the story is brought to a head.Of course there is slightly more to the story than that, but that is the rough outline and gives an idea of what you can expect here. The animation is very well done in this film, as it's Oscar will attest to, and the backgrounds are rendered with a level of detail Disney films have lacked in recent years. The use of light is very good as well, especially in the castle where the shadows and pools of light are very well done.This has decent enough music and isn't too twee and the voiceover work is also very good. I especially enjoyed Angela Lansbury as the teapot and thought she matched the character perfectly.This has become a classic in the Disney stable for a reason and if you haven't watched this yet you should be pleased with the story and animation on offer. This has plenty of extras, most of which are aimed at kids, but the commentaries and `making of' featurette are of special interest to adults and give a deeper insight into the film. Overall this is a great package with excellent remastering and is another wonderful film to add to your Disney collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	4.0	Beauty and the Beast	2011-01-08	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A30A5I8FG82M2E	SpookyChick	"This is of course the only animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards (aka Oscars).  At the time, it was rather exciting.  Now most people agree that the movie isn't worthy of such an honor.  Many Disney (and other studios) have issued movies that work better on many different levels.  Is this classic Disney?  Not by a long shot.Part of the reason I was displeased with the DVD is how junked up it is with ""Special Features"".  Regular readers of my reviews (Thank you, Ladies!) will note that I am opposed to the inclusion of such supplementary material.  If the movie can't stand on it's own, then what good is it?  I mean, please, a 'work in progress' version of the movie??  How many times is someone going to watch that?The songs in this movie will never be regarded as standards the way many older Disney film songs have.  And I have always had a problem with the subject matter, which involves human and beast falling in non-platonic love.  It is a bit of a weird situation, even in a cartoon, to force upon children who are just learning about ""how things work"" (if you know what I mean).  On a positive note, I happen to love Angela Lansbury, so her exquisite vocal talents are much appreciated.  I hope to age as gracefully as her."	1.0	A real Stinkeroo	2003-04-14	62	5	57
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1XFNWGTPMG1AE	S. Quinto	Disney Studios will always be the pioneer in animation movies. The studios hold more classics in the art than any other.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the culmination of years and years of expirience.  This movie enbodies all the elements that a classic movie should have, great music, great plot, great art cinematography.  This would stay in the mind of many to come. The story of a brave young woman facing the beast and making him tame and loving, is just clever.  And the fantasy portrait here is meticulous and well crafted. *****FIVE STARS to this classic.	5.0	TALE AS OLD AS TIME	2005-03-11	1	1	0

Most of the special features are a welcome addition, except for the scene ""Human Again"" in the SE version of the film. All of a sudden, the Prince/Beast can't read??!! Why does he have such an extensive library? Pathetic addition. The animation/song for the scene itself is also poor. It does not fit it as well as Disney would like you to believe. The animation for certain things is different (see through curtains, loads of animated nonsense, etc which are not present in such a strong way in the rest of the film). The animation is somewhat different, and ""characters"" added don't seem to fit in-- their faces are somewhat goofy/generic. 4/5 for the rest of everything else, but no 5/5.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3498YAKAKW7AQ	Stephanie Vargas	"Beauty and the Beast is a most own classic in my humble opinion.  As someone who watched the oringal movie tons of times I must say I was disappointed with the DVD.  First of all, when you place the DVD and hit ""play"" it automatically plays the ""Special Edition"" which is an extended version with a new musical number (and cheesy animation).  It's not a huge deal because you can change the DVD setting to play the original feature film but I feel the original should have been the default option.  Second thing that bothered me about the DVD is that some of the AUDIO WAS CUT OUT from the opening song!  Maybe it's just my DVD but I noticed two gaps in audio (since I know all the words).  The first gap is after the two old ladies say ""that girl is strange, no question"" and the second break in audio is after she goes to the bookstore.  The lyric ""Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar, I wonder if she's feeling well"" is cut out.Aside from that, the movie is great for all ages.  The cut out audio makes me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my VHS version."	4.0	5 stars for the movie, 4 for the DVD	2008-03-05	0	0	0

Because of something that is going to happen later on in the film.This is a great movie fo kids but maybe the younger children may be scared of the beast.

Gaston and Belle's father are also well drawn and memorable as are the comic relief bearing ""enchanted"" servants at the castle.  There's something for everyone as the story is so romantic it leaves a lot of grown up ladies sighing, the bad guys are not too scary for the little ones and for the rest it is just a great tale.

I've decided to update the whole collection on DVD as they became available (we don't even own a VCR anymore), so I purchased this as soon as it was on sale. Got to watch it with my (now 21-year-old) son just 3 weeks ago and we both found it even more enchanting than we remembered it; the color is spectacular and the blue-ray really does make a huge difference--everything has an almost-3d effect that added immensely to our experience. What a special, timeless story this is; the characters come to life and are even more charming than ever; it's a triumph of human spirit and the power of love to see real beauty within.  The extra interviews with the composer really gave insight into the creative process of the film, and gives a beautiful tribute to its late lyricist (the real force behind the whole production), Howard Ashman.  Worth every penny, and a delight to treasure for years to come (maybe--if I'm lucky--I'll get to watch it with my grandchildren one day!).	5.0	Beatiful Edition of a Charming Classic	2010-11-07	0	0	0

So, I'll get to my greatest points. Moms, Dads, and whoever is buying this product for you sweet little angel stick with the tape. Yes the colors are beautiful when they should be bright. But the dimmer lights of the romantic evening should not have bells gown glowing brighter than a harvest moon. I felt like I needed sun glasses while watching the dance. Digital brightens and it's doesn't really darken correctly. This is because computers can only really recognize the bright colors with barely any shade in-between. You see this in digital photography. Your kid's shirt is not neon green but the image shows it such. Another thing key to animations is the lines and the fade away do to the brightness. Belle's dress just glows. There really isn't any lines to speak of.Seriously,get out the VCR and buy the tape. The colors are so much better and real. You can see the lines and enjoy the movie as a piece of art instead of what looks like at time sloppy art work.	3.0	Cells are just better	2011-03-13	4	0	4

However, I have a few problems that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars.By now, we all know the story of this beautiful film. We know the songs by heart, and it doesn't need to be mentioned that this is still the only animated movie to recieve an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. However, this DVD offers THREE versions - the ""original theatrical version"" which is the ""Special Edition"" but without the Human Again song that's in the ""Special Edition"" and a new version of the Work-In-Progress edition, previously available only on laserdisc and VHS in the deluxe box set Disney released in 1992. If you get a chance, please watch the Work-In-Progress edition.This DVD also includes a plethora of bonus features for kids and adults alike. Games for the kids, and serious behind-the-scenes materials, trailers, TV spots, galleries, etc. for the adults.However, I have some gripes about the transfer - namely edge enhancement. Cramming three versions of the movie onto one disc was a bad idea. In my opinion, the Work-In-Progress edition should have been on disc two. Also, I'm not too happy with how the film has been lightened up. The film was intended to have dark, muted colors. However, despite these flaws, the movie still retains all the beauty and charm I fell in love with nearly 15 years ago. And I love the newly added song, Human Again. Now, the original theatrical version feels empty to me.I'm also not too happy with how the bonus features sometimes appear in more than one spot, such as the Celine Dion music video appearing in two spots and having two versions of the making-of docu...one substantially longer, having more material, etc. It makes it look as if Disney padded this disc so it'd look like there were more bonuses than there are.However, I can't NOT recommend this DVD, but that's only because I'm absolutely biased. Unfortunately, it is now out of print, and copies tend to be expensive on eBay and Amazon Marketplace. However, it's definitely worth it, especially if you can get it used for a good price, and if a disc doesn't work, call 1-800-72-DISNEY, and for a fee of about $7, you can have the discs replaced through Disney's Disc Replacement Program.In conclusion, please don't hesitate to get this if you're willing to pay a good amount of money for it or if you're willing to risk buying it used. It's a gorgeous movie, and the bonus features are good. Despite my few gripes, it's worth the price."	4.0	Amazing movie - less-than-perfect DVD treatment.	2005-10-12	19	17	2
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3N7DUPAV984XL	"Talera Ristain ""taleraris"""	Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite fairy tale. I have been enthralled by this movie for close to 15 years now and never get tired of seeing it. Being a fairy tale enthusiast, I don't mind the changes they made. In the original tale, the villains are her family, who try to keep her from going back to the dying beast. Conceited and rude Gaston was a perfect foil against the endearing and kind Beast. The objects were given a much bigger role, but the characterization was solid and the story fit them in very well. Oh, and for a previous poster who mentioned the Disney happy ending-the original fairy tale has her arriving before he dies and telling him she loves him, thus setting him free and giving them a happily ever after. The Disney version is amazingly accurate to the story, also seeing as it was originally a French fairy tale, and I've always felt it was a more than adequate translation of one of the best fairy tales and love stories ever written.	5.0	A Lifetime Classic	2005-12-24	2	2	0

Disney's has lots of hits over the years,but the period from 1989-1995 brought Disney back to their magical height again. Starting from Disney's Little Mermaid all the way to Disney's Pocahontas. But one magical film details this period wonderfully,Disney's Beauty and the Beast.I remember watching this movie in 5th grade in my classroom. And I loved it. From the characters to the dramatic settings,that take place in France. This film is one of the coupe-de-grande films of all time,and the ballroom dancing scene?

I love getting to see the extended version with the song &#8220;Human Again.&#8221;- 1 Star for the Special Features LayoutThe special features are laid out in a very unusual format.  Some of the special features are on the main disc with the film and the rest are on a second disc.  But there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any logical explanation for why it is divided in that way.  You click on a special feature documentary and it tells you to put the other disc in.  I had to switch it back and forth several times to get though all of the special features.  Sometimes the very same menu branch was split.  There is a guide in the case that is supposed to map out the special features on both discs, but I didn&#8217;t find it all that helpful.The special features themselves are very nice, but it would have been much better if all of them (with the exception of commentaries, etc.) were on one disc.	4.0	Great Movie &#8230; Strange Layout for Special Features	2013-02-06	0	0	0
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A31ACI0E88ORDE	The Great White Father	...I think this film deserves two ratings--one good, one bad.  To be fair, though, part of the bad has to do with the original fairy tale rather than merely this particular rendition thereof--and part of the bad, at least for me, has to do with something else external to the film which I'll get into in the review proper, and since it is external to the film, it isn't fair to blame this film, especially as I don't think that this film is responsible for the problem existing in the first place.First, the good: as a movie, this is EXCELLENT.  I can see why it was the first animated feature to be nominated for a &#34;Best Picture&#34; Oscar.  The characters and themes are as deep as I've seen in a Disney animated feature even without being cerebral science fiction that muses on existential questions in the dialogue.  Likewise, the characters and the songs are memorable (and the characters are lovable--and when they're not, they're not supposed to be) and have pervaded the culture--and while I'm not the biggest fan of this particular musical style, the songs in and of themselves could tell the story, and not even every Disney animated musical does this.  And this is unique in terms of its genre, so that Disney was pushing the envelope and taking risks--and one new thing they did here was to have an actual screenplay rather than merely using storyboards.  These elements of the film are so good, in fact, that it honestly hurts me to say something as seriously negative as I am going to say about it.Nevertheless, I feel like I have to mention the bad part because it is present--though fortunately it's subtle here, and doesn't hit us over the head as with several other films, so that it wasn't until just very recently that it even occurred to me to think of it this way.  (Then again, maybe that's not the best thing--best for the audience but perhaps not a good thing to encourage Disney or Hollywood to produce more of.)  And this bad part is that, when you strip it down to the bare nuts and blots, the plot is really the anti-fairy tale.I make no accusations against anyone who made this film because I don't know, but the generic plot here (which I've seen oh so many times since) strikes me as having been made by people who don't understand fairy tales and don't want to bother trying--who, to be blunt, are prejudiced against real fairy tales.  I am glad that this film wasn't propagandistic with that element, but the fact that it's even there is at least a concern for me--I don't think it's going to mess anyone up for having seen or liked this film, but it's something that I, as an audience member, don't want more of.Here's the basic plot outline that I think is the anti-fairy tale and that I don't like, and that has been done a lot more heavy-handed in other films: a young woman is being stifled by a patriarchal society in which literally everyone else accepts their place and values except her, and it doesn't occur to them to question it, but only to question the young woman--and this society is personified in a patriarchal oppressor who wants to marry her, not for love, but for entirely material and selfish reasons; she meets a male whom her society would regard as a villain or monster, as &#34;evil&#34;, and yet he isn't truly evil at all, and if he is not exactly good, it's because of his circumstances--he is a pariah more because he is different in a way that he can't necessarily help--and on the basis of having this in common, they fall in love; this prompts her fianc&eacute; to show himself for the monster he is and the woman to outright reject her society, and rather than being rescued by anyone, including her beloved, she rescues herself and if she rescues anyone else it's a bumbling, useless, comedy relief of a male; after the villain is defeated she is free to marry her beloved and live happily ever after.Even if you don't believe in Catholic Christianity or patriarchy, as I do, I would hope that an open mind and an open heart would recognize that this kind of plot line depends upon people already being familiar with &#34;the way things are&#34;, in order to question the wisdom of their being that way, and so this kind of story depends upon the very thing it's against, in order to make sense.  I don't see how that can be a good plot, especially for a fairy tale--fairy tales and folklore are meant to teach the way things are as well as the way things ought to be, so that we see how the way things are don't measure up, and justice is served thereby where it often isn't in real life.  But this is different: aside from the fact that the villain isn't a wicked stepmother (or even wicked stepsisters, as in the original fairy tale), the fact that the Beast is really a prince is almost incidental.  The reason why the beloved is a prince (even if only in disguise) in traditional fairy tales is because he has the status to be able to defeat the oppressor of his beloved where she does not, and so he rescues her from her predicament--and the prince's love and marriage to him are gifts, not something the female protagonist earned (who can &#34;earn&#34; something like that?).  But the Beast never rescues Belle except once from the wolves, and that isn't the climax, and she doesn't know that this is a prince, but only a horrible Beast.  Worse, Gaston is not a pariah as a villain ought to be--even high-ranking wicked stepmothers are not royalty, and in fact they're often gold-diggers.It's just that I had been thinking about how the hero-victim-villain dynamic has been messed up so much in so much of our modern culture: traditional &#34;heroes&#34; are now &#34;patriarchal oppressors&#34; who have temporal power and have irrational hatred for anyone different, or else they're egotistical, useless, comedy relief--and when they are truly heroic, they start out powerless and put down by society, so that any altruistic heroism really takes a backseat to self-actualization (which, while it can be good, is selfish and not altruistic, and so not truly heroic, or at least not as heroic as heroic can get).  Traditional &#34;villains&#34; are now misunderstood victims, &#34;bad boy&#34; heartthrobs meant to make girls fall in love with them, or if they are truly villainous they are not pariahs but might even be the personal &#34;hero&#34; of the primary protagonist until the primary protagonist learns what he's really like.  And traditional &#34;victims&#34; are not victims but can handle themselves--or if they can't at first, the story is about their becoming able to--and any true &#34;victims&#34; are useless males.Sadly, in thinking about that, I was forced to see this element at play in this film, even if it is subtle and not propagandistic.  Indeed, that is a major part of the point, the theme, of this film.  And while that theme in and of itself is a good one to know (ugly isn't always nasty, pretty isn't always nice--and when the two are in conflict, it's what's on the inside that matters more), I'm not altogether surprised that they went the metafiction route with this film, so that Belle likes to read adventures and fairy tale romances and such (Disney would be more obvious about this kind of thing with The Princess and the Frog).  That is, a fairy tale scenario doesn't necessarily seem to be the right milieu for that kind of story, but a more naturalistic story.Again, none of this changes the excellent quality of the rest of this film.  The Beast is an excellent character, and the love story here is perhaps the most realistic I've seen in a Disney animated fairy tale, and Belle is a good character who is brave, and to whom a promise means something and who tries to be polite even when she thinks very little of someone, and not out of hypocrisy but simply out of not being a jerk.  Likewise, the philosophy behind Gaston makes him a very interesting villain.  And I like pretty much all of the enchanted servants.  And again, while the tunes aren't my cup of tea, I have to give credit for the songs being able to tell the story by themselves.  And the opening &#34;storybook&#34; prologue has not been matched since that I'm aware of--and the musical score there is SUPERB.  The way the mystery unfolds is top-notch, and the animation is excellent quality.  And again, even with regard to the plot, it is not heavy-handed here, and it wasn't until now, so many years later, that it occurred to me that the plot was really an &#34;anti-fairy tale&#34;, something that I've grown to hate.Again, I don't think anyone will suffer serious detriment from seeing this film or liking it (although I have no idea why anyone thinks Belle is an example of Stockholm Syndrome--if anything it's the exact opposite from what we actually see here and the danger is that women might think they're in less danger in these situations in real life than they really would be), but I'm just happy that a movie like &#34;Tangled&#34; exists, because except for the male lead's identity and motivation at the beginning, the plot template for that film is very much a traditional fairy tale, and the main problems otherwise are simply with the execution of that story.  As for &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34;, watch it and enjoy it, but be aware of this flaw, which is more pervasive and therefore more of a problem to me (despite being less obvious) than the &#34;blink and you'll miss it&#34; corrupt priest overseeing Gaston's sham &#34;wedding&#34; to Belle combined with the fact that we don't see Belle and her prince having a church wedding at the end.God bless you all.	3.0	At the risk of earning a lot of hatred....	2014-06-24	0	0	0

If you saw this in the theater you will remember the experience.  The film takes place mostly in a castle that is actually a Fantasia like wonderland. There is so much abstract song and dance in this movie at times you forget about the actual storyline. The premise is simple and everyone knows it: A prince is cursed and becomes a beast. The curse will break only if he falls in love. Enter fair maiden. The rest plays out exactly as it it should with many added surprises. If it has been a while since you have watched this you are guaranteed to be pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was made. It should be noted that Beauty and the Beast was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first time ever an animated film got nominated on the show after more than 65 years, and the last to be nominated until 2009. Check this one out again and you will not be disappointing. It is also short and to the point at 85 minutes. They wasted no time creating this masterpiece.  Apparently during the Disney Renaissance period they subscribed to a time tested practice of success: If it is not ""Baroque"" do not fix it."	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #51	2011-06-24	1	0	1
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1OZ7AUHI1EIJP	"themegster88 ""Meggie"""	Beauty and the Beast is THE best disney. Well it's surely in the top 3. The only way to make this film better is to re-release it and jam pack it with amazing features. I think that Diseny has done a great job with this.The story centers around Belle, the 'crazy inventors' daughter and an outcast in in small french town. She then meets the beast who was transformed beause of his shallowness, and needs to fall in love and win love in return in order to become human again. Unlike any other classic Disney film, this is not love at first sight, and after techincally kidnapping Belle the two become friends. The rest of the story ends with them falling in love despite Gaston's attempts to keep them apart and win Belle as his 'trophy wife'. One of the things I like about this film is that its the most magical film, the spells and enchanted castle help childen to love this film even more. Its a musical at its finest and has many Oscar and Golden Globe nominated songs.The dvd is of course way better quality than the Vhs, but is way more than just different quality. It is restored so that it can be seen in it's original quality, the way it shoud be. The songs are better, so is the colour and the overall proudct. It also features a new sequence, fully restored and animated. I really liked 'Human again' and am really glad that it's on the Dvd. The other special features are various triva, games and making's of, but the real novelty is to have it on the 2-disc special edition. Having only brought a Dvd player 4 months ago, this was the first I brought, and it is now out of print as Disney only keeps the special editions circulating for about 3-4 months. The others (for refrence) are; Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin, The Lion King and very shortly Pocahontas and Mulan.If you like disney and fairytales, then this is your sort of thing. This would appeal to anyone as this film has so many levels. Its a must see no matter who you are.	5.0	Disney at it's finest.	2004-11-18	2	2	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"I missed the recent re-release of ""The Lion King"" in 3-D. So, I made a concerted effort to catch ""Beauty and the Beast"" for it's 3-D re-release. Although both films are great, I like ""Beauty and the Beast"" more, so I made a greater effort.In the late 80s, a new management team at Disney helped lead the venerable studio to a renaissance of animated films. An almost bankrupt institution, Disney found enormous financial and creative success with ""The Little Mermaid"", leading a string of popular animated films. ""Beauty and the Beast"", originally released in 1991, became the first, and so far only, animated film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Film.The film is a magical blend of terrific storytelling, beautiful animation, wonderful music and great voice acting. Watching the film again, I found my foot unconsciously waving in the air during ""Be Our Guest"". The film is a classicA vain prince refuses to provide shelter and air to a haggard old woman on a stormy night. She reveals herself to be a beautiful witch and places a curse on the prince, his castle and everything inside. The prince is turned into a beast and his staff become the household objects they used in their daily chores. Beast (Robby Benson) must find true love by his 21st birthday in order to lift the spell.Belle (Paige O'Hara) is not like the other girls in her small French village. And this is exactly why the muscle bound Gaston (Richard White) wants her so badly. Belle's father, a scatterbrained inventor, gets lost in the woods and becomes the prisoner of the Beast. When Belle realizes this, she offers herself in exchange and what begins as a tormented relationship slowly begins to evolve.Miss Potts (Angela Lansbury), Cogswoth (David Ogden-Stiers) and Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), the Beast's household staff watch with hopeful eyes.From the opening frames, as the camera moves in on Beast's castle, the 3-D is beautiful, bringing the landscapes to life, giving them new beauty. In fact, the 3-D works best on the landscapes.The process is more problematic for the characters. As you watch Belle or Beast move around, it almost seems like the focus of the 3-D effect is moving, as though the filmmakers added a bubble and moved it around to create the effect.This actually began to make my eyes water and get tired very quickly. Pretty soon, I stopped trying to pay attention to the 3-D, to give my eyes some relief, and tried to enjoy the movie. It was difficult, but not impossible.Because ""Beauty and the Beast"", and so many of the other films being re-released soon were not originally made in 3-D, it seems they will experience a similar fate. The process will work sometimes, but not consistently.So, the question becomes ""Is it worth paying $15 plus to see a film in theaters that is already available on DVD?"" This depends on the film. I feel my money was well spent.But next time, I'll go to a 2-D screening so I can experience the classic on the big screen again."	3.0	The 3-D Theater Version Is Not Great...	2012-01-26	3	2	1

The love story is deep, emotional, and just, you know, Disney. I really enjoy Belle, she's just so beautiful. Yes yes, I know, the message is not to judge people by beauty, but she's also beautiful on the inside. She's strong-willed, independent, and does not let people drag her down. The Beast is also an enjoyable character for this love story. The villain, Gaston, matches the movie's style and message. He's handsome yet arrogant. His plot and henchman make him similar to my favorite Disney Villain, Ratigan from ""The Great Mouse Detective"" which I've seen a lot of similarites to. The music is just right for the film, the score AND the songs. The side characters are very memorable; Mrs. Potts the teapot who knows exactly right from wrong, her cute teacup son, and of course Lumiere and Cogsworth. I'm not sure if this movie was also meant to be a comedy, but Lumiere and Cogsworth's time on the screen together is the funniest of this movie. Overall, I understand it's definetly one of Disney's greatest films for good reasons.However, I did not like it as a kid. I thought it was the 2nd scariest Disney movie in my life, behind Aladdin. The prologue was creepy, and the Beast losing his temper scared me, especially when he yells at Belle to get out of the West Wing. That scene scared me the most. And besides, kind of like Little Mermaid, I thought it was too much of a girl's movie with the fairy tale, prince and princess, true love and all that stuff. I just felt more attached to animal- ish Disney films, such as ""Lady and the Tramp"" and ""The Great Mouse Detective"", where there were no ""stereotypic themes"".However, despite ""Beauty and the Beast"" not having the same impact on me the way it impacted everyone else, I am fairly respecting it nowadays, to watch occasionally.

While both earn my utmost respect, there has always been one that stuck with me in both heart and memory- Beauty and the Beast.You see, I'm 19 now, almost 20 and this is one movie I've always cherished since childhood. When the narration begins about the Prince,goes to the title, and on, the movie hooks me into a realm of fantasy and romance.While I'm not too big on romance stories in book form, Disney does it right in this film.

First off, they don't like each other, but the relationship blossoms and grows up to where they fight for each other- this is true love in its purest form.I admit with pride, that I cry at certain scenes, mostly the Transformation scene at the end of the film.

The video itself has what appears to be recording marks that appear in the upper left hand corner and the video quality is not as clear as it should be.

The definition in blu-ray is simply amazing, it's beautiful.  You won't regret buying this because it's a timeless classic that you can enjoy over and over again, with family, or by yourself.  It has a bunch of interesting documentaries, and fun games, and bonus features, you will never get tired of this Blu-ray.

Was it based on a true story??  Of course not!  Most people think it is and it's not.  The idea of a talking beast and the falling in love Belle had for the beast, is almost as good as the mermaid who fell in love with a human.  At least it's not a fish and a human but a beast and a human.  This movie is one of the best Disney movies besides The Little Mermaid.  I give this movie 4 stars cause it's almost as good as The Little Mermaid.  Good job Disney!!  I wish this orignal as still avaible for buys.

When playing ""Beyond Beauty - The Untold Story"", the sound just continuously disappear throughout the whole section! This is so annoying. I have to pause the playback and hit play again, so the sound would come back. At first I thought it was a glitch on my PS3. But after replaying this section again (after rebooting PS3), the sound just disappear at the same spots again and again. Especially in the special section about Howard Ashman, the playback just simply stuck and crashed my PS3. I'm also surprise that the fast/back forward key operation doesn't work while playing the bonus clip. My PS3 has the latest firmware and there's not a single scratch on the disc. I don't think playback on PS3 is a problem here. I mean.. PS3 is a bluray player on steroid, if it can't handle a normal bluray I'd suspect that others with the standalone bluray player should have the same issue.Anybody has the same problem? or I just got a lemon?"	2.0	Does anybody has problem with the bonus disc?	2010-10-11	3	1	2

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2SIGE6Z9DWW3R	TwilightAngel901	I am a huge beauty and the beast fan.  I received this as a present last christmas.  That being said I am so thrilled that I was able to have this item.  It includes five discs, so this means that there is a disc for a regular DVD player for those people that don't own a blu ray player yet.  It also comes with three blu ray discs one of which is a 3D disc.  The only down side to the 3D disc is that if you don't own a 3D TV, 3D glasses, blu ray player, and a 3D enabled HDMI cable you wouldn't be able to watch that version.  If you love this movie as much as I do I would definitely buy this version even if I didn't have all of the technology to watch it.  But that would be the only complaint I believe anyone would ever have with this item.  The colors are amazing compared to when it was first released on DVD.  If you have no interest in the 3D disc though you would be better off saving some extra money and down grading to the three disc version.  This was an amazing purchase and I look forward to more Disney 3D releases.	5.0	Loved it so much!	2012-01-12	1	1	0

I cannot count how many times I've watched Beauty and the Beast, but watching this new HD transfer was like seeing it for the first time.  Actually, it was better than that, because this is an entirely new experience.  If you have any appreciation for the art of animation you'll be watching this movie with your jaw dropped open the whole time.  I never would have guessed how much vivid color and sound quality was lost in the standard definition releases, but it was huge.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A1ULFDXVXS2ALX	Victoria A. Grossack	As everyone says, this is a good movie. Why is it so good? It is because our heroine, Belle, is good. Not selfish, not lying, simply good. Each of her actions show selflessness and bravery: when she goes out to rescue her father, and when she takes his place in the castle. And a particular moment that I adore: Belle has run away from the Beast because he has scared her; he rescues her and fights off the wolves, then collapses in the snow. And Belle, seeing what he has done for her, does what is right: she loads him onto her horse and takes him back to the castle, even though her intention was to leave.The Beast, too, is good in many of his actions as well. He goes after Belle and rescues her, risking his life. He lets her go to save her father, when he is at the point of breaking the spell.And then there are the shared moments, as the two of them fall slowly in love: the yelling through her bedroom door; her tending him in front of the fireplace after he saved her life; the snowball fight, when Belle begins to realize her feelings and woners what she is doing because he is, after all, a Beast; learning to eat together; dancing; and then, at the end, when he is so grateful that she came back. And then when she thinks she has lost him and puts her hands over her mouth in alarm...Besides the sterling character of the characters, there are other reasons this movie was nominated for Best Picture. The opening scene at the village is like being brought into an opera, with Belle, the villagers, and Gaston all singing beautifully as they describe what they want out of life. And what book lover does not sympathize with Belle, as she effuses over a story to be greeted with polite indifference?Good movie. Simply good.	5.0	Simply Good	2005-01-13	3	3	0

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	AQP1VPK16SVWM	"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu..."	You got me at the first song. Along with Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast stands as the pinnacle of Disney animation in the later part of the 20th century. Certainly Disney has produced many great and cherished films, but Beauty And The Beast managed to jump the animation ghetto and win respect from audiences and critics alike. Is it the best? It doesn't really matter what matters is that B&amp;B can hold its own (and then some) with other Disney and other animation masterpieces.The songs are rich, vibrant and as alive as the characters. In fact, they come alive in song much as the characters did during the golden age of the Hollywood musical. The animation is flawless and the story well constructed and without the artiface of other Disney films. As much as I like The Lion King (and I do like it alot!), B&amp;B isn't as calculated as that film nor as topical as Aladdin (which is both a strong and weak point for that classic film--one of my Disney favs). I was never much of a fan of early Disney (although I recognize the value of those films) as I was raised on Warner Brother cartoons. Beauty And The Beast manages to meld the slapstick style of the Warner cartoons (much like Aladdin) with the storytelling wizardry of Disney.The casting is perfect. I'm not much of a Robby Benson fan (I've always found him to be an annoying performer in films--too aware of himself and his &quot;talent&quot; to ever be lost in a role). In B&amp;B Benson shines managing to lose himself in the role of the dark and brooding Beast. The female lead is just as captivating and powerful (I can't recall her name).The DVD comes packed with extras some essential and some dispensable. The three different versions of B&amp;B included aren't essential expect for collectors but it is fun to compare and contrast them. The added song and sequence isn't essential to the action (it's really more of a marketing ploy although it does add a freshness for those who've seen the film upteen times). Ashman's lyrics and Menken's music are witty and literate as well as fun to sing so this &quot;new&quot; song is a welcome addition.A powerful mixture of pathos, drama, comedy and song Beauty And The Beast marked a new highwater mark for the Mouse Factory. It wasn't just churned out like many of the later animation features were at Disney.	5.0	Singing the praises of B&amp;B	2002-10-10	1	1	0

Instead, you'll have to verify whatis required at a brick & mortar store before purchasing at Amazon. So far, only two documentaries have required active-shutter and I now own eight 3D movies.As for Beauty & The Beast - It's my absolute favorite Disney animated motion picture and the 3D imaging just makes it better.

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A2BZEJNE16W1PK	"""whirlbo"""	Let's face it:Atlantis, Mulan, Hunchback, etc. With the exception of the Lion King and maybe Aladdin, Disney has been a ruthless money grubbing machine who doesn't turn out movies worth a 7 dollar ticket, and would make Walt himself stop from spinning in his grave and wonder what the hell are they attaching his name to.However there was a time when things were different. The words 'Once upon a time' were always concluded with  'Happily ever after' And everything didn't have to have a sequel. Beauty and the Beast was the high point of that renaissance.Classic characters and wonderful music composition make this the best movie disney has ever put out. Perfectly adapted from classic literature and put into big screen form, this movie was the only animated feature ever nominated for best picture; and well worth nominating.Its release on DVD is both a blessing and a curse with Disney holding off on its main titles in order to strike up huge demand. The DVD itself does the movie justice by allowing you to pick the version of the movie you want to see. The one you fell in love with years ago, or the one they obviously tried to make even more money off of earlier in the year at IMAX. (that should tell you which one I watch.)This is one of my favorite movies ever. Partially because of how I first saw it, but its perfect for everyone old and young.	5.0	Disney's Best Ever...	2002-11-04	2	1	1

So is Disney listening yet?  You'd think the ""Diamond Edition"" would be better quality.  Hoping my replacement will be.  By the way, if you're listening Disney - really glad of all the kudos you heaped on the animators, Ashman and Menkin, etc.  Yet the only reference I heard in all the discs about Jerry Orbach was that (paraphrased) before that Law and Order thing he had been a big ""song and dance man"" (not broadway star, not Tony Winner) in the 60's (and none of the staff had heard of him). Fine - but in the Diamond (20th Anniversary) Edition couldn't they have said and ""now his voice is used on everything...the menu's...etc.  I mean, come'on - he actually performed ""Be Our Guest"" at the Oscars.  He's the only one of the main cast that's passed away.  NOTHING?  Did I miss it?"	3.0	Good Movie - Bad Disc	2012-02-17	3	0	3
6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"Some thoughts on the Blu-ray (which I've just watched on a 60"" plasma)...There have been Horrible Arguments here about ""Pinocchio"", as to which (if any) of the various transfers most-accurately reflects the way the film originally looked 70 years ago -- or for that matter, whether one would /want/ a video transfer that looked like the original. (There are valid arguments in favor of ""improvements"".) Oddly, this version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" unquestionably ""looks different"" from the way it looked in the theater, or previous DVD versions.As is typical of many video transfers, there's a notable drop in contrast, which (combined with the high resolution) in this case makes subtleties of coloration and shading more-apparent. It also reduces the seeming ""crudity"" of some of the art and animation (""B&B;"" is far from the best-drawn or best-animated Disney feature), especially in the beast's rendition.One is also aware of changes in /lighting/. In the very opening, as Belle enters the village, we're aware that this is the ""magic hour"" of early morning (which gradually wears off as the sequence proceeds). I don't remember this from either the theatrical version or the DVD.In short... For those reading this in 2060... The Blu-ray /does not/ look exactly like the theatrical version. It is significantly ""better"", and probably closer to what the artists intended.This transfer is at 16:9, rather than the 1.85:1 of the previous DVD. This is an ""overscan"" of less than 7%, which isn't too bad. I would recommend viewing the film using your set's Dot-by-Dot setting.I haven't yet watched all the supplemental material, but the feature about the making of the film is excellent.This is such a handsome transfer that I have no hesitation recommending it, especially if you have a 50"" or larger display.----------There's no point in discussing the film itself, which made the People magazine list of 100 Greatest Films (winning over the Cocteau version after what was apparently a near-violent office fracas), other than to say it beats the Cocteau to a bloody pulp in every category (other than B&W; cinematography!), and it's the only G-rated film with a song about homophobia. (It's interesting that the auteurs of both films were gay.)Serious movie viewers will be a bit surprised at the changes. Disney has widened the format from 1.66 to 1.85 by selective cropping. Although this provides enhanced vertical resolution on monitors with variable vertical scan, some of the scenes become a bit claustrophobic.ALL THREE versions have been reformatted to 1.85. This means the ""original theatrical version"" is _not_ the original. If you have the CAV LV, don't toss it.The color rendition (as in the case of the platinum ""Snow White"") is noticeably different. In some cases it comes closer to the artist's intentions (eg, Belle's blue dress versus the earth tones of the town), while in others it's more garish.The supplemental material is not up to that provided with ""Snow White."" Too much of it is typical ""Disney gush.""Nevertheless... I've been going to the movies for over 50 years, and this is still one of the very best films I've seen. It demonstrated that a Disney film could treat its subject matter in a serious fashion, yet still be ""entertaining"" -- something that Disney himself was unable (or, more likely, didn't want) to achieve.PS: Music lovers...

6302526574	Beauty and the Beast (A Walt Disney Classic)  [VHS]	A295P2KZIWUAWI	"W. Langan ""take403"""	"The 1990's was a great decade for animation. We had old classics like Fantasia, Pinnochio, Snow White and Jungle Book brought back to the theatre with the addition of Toy Story 1 and 2, Aladdin, Anastasia, The Iron Giant and The Lion King (and the late 1980's helped put animated films back on the market with American Tale, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little Mermaid). I think one movie that set the standards for quality in animation in the 1990's was Beauty and the Beast.The music (composed by Alan Menken, with songs like ""Be Our Guest""), the voices (Paige O'Hara, Angela Landsbury and others), the story and the animation bring it to life. The movie also brings home the old adage that you can't judge a book by its cover. The extra features are nice, too (I'll get to them later). I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about the ""Human Again"" sequence, but I think it flows wonderfully with the rest of the film (basically, it's a song the prince's subjects sing in hopes of being human again).It all starts out when a spoiled and selfish prince is punished for his bad attitude, along with the rest of the castle. He's transformed into a beast, since he acted no better than a beast. His only hope is an enchanted rose, which will wilt on his 21st birthday and the ability to love and be loved before the last petal falls (but he's given up hope on that happening). Meanwhile not too far from the castle, a beautiful, introverted bookworm named Belle (played by Paige O'Hara) is the talk of the village. The pompous Gaston has a big crush on her but alas, the feeling is unrequited. Her father Maurice is a slightly eccentric but lovable inventor. He accidentally stumbles upon the castle and is taken prisoner by the grumpy Beast. Belle comes to save her father and takes her father's place as prisoner. Though his quick temper turns her off, Belle is eventually able to see his true nature and the Beast makes a new friend.For those of you who prefer the original the way it was shown in 1991, this is also available on this edition. There are interviews with many of the different cast members, animators and other people behind the scenes. Also, a spoken commentary throughout the film is available. I haven't really bothered with the extra games (those are probably more geared for kids anyways).To wrap this up, you have until January 31, 2003 to add this classic to your collection. Otherwise, you'll have to wait another 10 years for its release or pay big bucks at auctions for it!"	5.0	"""But she's being so..... DIFFICULT!"""	2003-01-09	1	1	0

I normally don't review movies i purchase on amazon but i could not get over this transfer.  This is now my gem of all my Blu Ray 3D movies, period.  The beautiful forest opening scene that was created by the multiplane camera grabs your attenttion like never before with the 3D effect.  And from then on you can see the amount of effort that was put into transfering the original classic in to a full 3D feature.  This is in no way a cheesy transfer like some of the movies that have been coming out recently.  I was so blown away by this transfer that i showed my parents some of the scenes and they from the start just said ""WoW"" and were hooked to watch the film to its end.  The beautiful animation just stands out in this 3D feature and is truly gorgeous.  Truely this is the best way to watch this film, but of course this is just my opinion but i cannot say it enough that you should give it a chance.

I have only watched the Blu-ray version so far but I am very impressed with how this movie looks in all its 1080P splender.  If you like Beauty and the Beast and want to see it in HD, it is definitely worth it.The only complaint I have is that I had to return the first one I received.  For the first time ever, I received a bad disc.  When it would get to about the 10th chapter it would start skipping chapters.  I inspected the disc and cleaned it even though there were no apparent dirty spots.  I even power cycled my PS3 and played it and it would consistently start skipping chapters in the same spot.  The second one I received played perfectly in my PS3 so I can only assume the disc was bad.	4.0	Blu-ray Version is Awesome	2011-01-07	0	0	0
