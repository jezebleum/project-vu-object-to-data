1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3APL6ZGP40QU9	"Adventure Reader ""Don"""	Mr D'Souza was extremely fair, I thought, in this movie to Obama.  He was simply trying to tell us (warn us) what he discovered about who Obama was, is and possibly will be.  It was very good and a job that should have been done by many others in the major media that didn't do it because they were ideologically biased.  In other words, he tried to warn us . . . and all the major media tried to cover up Obama's history.	5.0	He tried to do the job the media never did do, tell us who Obama is	2012-12-23	3	2	1
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1IJL3WBS8Z6WM	A. E. Tanner	"The filmmaker, Dinesh D'Souza, is a known liar, propagating blatant outright falsehoods against President Obama for his own personal gain. Don't believe me? Read the facts for yourself:[...]WASHINGTON (AP) -- ""2016: Obama's America,"" a new conservative film exploring the roots of President Barack Obama's political views, took in $6.2 million to make it one of the highest-grossing movies of last weekend. The film, written and narrated by conservative scholar Dinesh D'Souza, argues that Obama was heavily influenced by what D'Souza calls the ""anti-colonial"" beliefs of his father, Barack Obama Sr., a Kenyan academic who was largely absent from the president's life.To document that claim, D'Souza travels to Kenya to interview members of Obama's extended family as well as to Hawaii and Indonesia, where Obama grew up. He also cites several actions and policy positions Obama has taken to support the thesis that Obama is ideologically rooted in the Third World and harbors contempt for the country that elected him its first black president.The assertion that Obama's presidency is an expression of his father's political beliefs, which D'Souza first made in 2010 in his book ""The Roots of Obama's Rage,"" is almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best.It's true that Obama's father lived most of his life in Kenya, an African nation once colonized by the British, and that Obama's reverence for his absent father frames his best-selling memoir. D'Souza even sees clues in the book's title: ""Notice it says 'Dreams From My Father,' not 'of' my father,"" D'Souza says.But it's difficult to see how Obama's political leanings could have been so directly shaped by his father, as D'Souza claims. The elder Obama left his wife and young son, the future president, when Obama was 2 and visited his son only once, when Obama was 10. But D'Souza portrays that loss as an event that reinforced rather than weakened the president's ties to his father, who died in an automobile accident when Obama was in college.D'Souza interviews Paul Vitz, a New York University psychologist who has studied the impact of absent fathers on children. In Obama's case, Vitz says, the abandonment meant ""he has the tension between the Americanism and his Africanism. He himself is an intersection of major political forces in his own psychology.""From there, the evidence D'Souza uses to support his assertion starts to grow thin.D'Souza says Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, shared his father's left-leaning views. After living in Indonesia for several years, D'Souza said, Dunham sent the younger Obama to live with his grandparents in Hawaii so he would not be influenced by her second husband, Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian who worked for American oil companies and fought communists as a member of the Indonesian army.""Ann separates Barry from Lolo's growing pro-Western influence,"" D'Souza says in the film. Obama has said his mother had sent him back to Hawaii so he would be educated in the United States.In Hawaii, D'Souza asserts with no evidence that Obama sympathized with native Hawaiians who felt they had been marginalized by the American government when Hawaii was becoming a state. D'Souza also asserts -- again with no evidence -- that Obama had been coached to hold those views at Punahou, the prestigious prep school he attended.""Oppression studies, if you will. Obama got plenty of that when he was here in Punahou,"" D'Souza says, standing on the campus in Honolulu.In Kenya, D'Souza interviews Philip Ochieng, a lifelong friend of the president's father, who claims the elder Obama was ""totally anti-colonial."" Ochieng also discloses some of his own political views, complaining about U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Iraq and saying the U.S. refuses to ""tame"" Israel, which he calls a ""Trojan horse in the Middle East."" D'Souza seems to suggest that if a onetime friend of Obama's late father holds those opinions, so, too, must the president himself.D'Souza then goes through a list of actions Obama has taken as president to support his thesis. Many of them don't hold water:-- D'Souza rightly argues that the national debt has risen to $16 trillion under Obama. But the film makes a passing reference to the growth of debt that occurred under Obama's predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, and does not address the 2008 global financial crisis that provoked a shock to the U.S. economy.-- D'Souza says Obama is ""weirdly sympathetic to Muslim jihadists"" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He does not mention that Obama ordered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and the drone strikes that have killed dozens of other terrorists in the region.--D'Souza wrongly claims that Obama wants to return control of the Falkland Islands from Britain to Argentina. The U.S. refused in April to endorse a final declaration on Argentina's claim to the islands at the Summit of the Americas, provoking criticism from other Latin American nations.--D'Souza says Obama has ""done nothing"" to impede Iran's nuclear ambitions, despite the severe trade and economic sanctions his administration has imposed on that country to halt its suspected nuclear program. Obama opposes a near-term military strike on Iran, either by the U.S. or Israel, although he says the U.S. will never tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran.-- D'Souza says Obama removed a bust of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill from the Oval Office because Churchill represented British colonialism. White House curator William Allman said the bust, which had been on loan, was already scheduled to be returned before Obama took office. Another bust of Churchill is on display in the president's private residence, the White House says.Correction: 2016: Obama's America-Fact Check story(AP) - Sep 20, 2012WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an Aug. 28 story about the film ""2016: Obama's America,"" The Associated Press erroneously suggested the film did not address the increase in the national debt under President George W. Bush. The film includes an interview with economist David Walker, who does mention the increase in the debt under Bush.A corrected version of the story is below:FACT CHECK: ""Anti-colonial"" Obama not plausibleFACT CHECK: ""2016: Obama's America"" documentary takes liberties with factsEDITOR'S NOTE -- An occasional look at campaign arguments and how well they adhere to the facts.By BETH FOUHYAssociated PressFollow Beth Fouhy on Twitter: [...]Copyright  2012 The Associated Press.

I am purchasing a copy for my kids.  It is incredible how very little the American people know about the history of the current president.  He has to be one of the least investigated and vetted presidents we have ever had.  When you think about what our country could look like in 4 years when he achieves the dreams of his father it should make you shudder with fear. He is driven with his anti-colonial beliefs that his mother fed with the stories she told him of the man he met only one time.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3A6UFUVOFHVAU	Always Right	I honestly believe that everyone should see this video first of all because it was very well done and, it gives everyone a chance to think through what has truly happened to the United States during the short 3+ years Obama has been in office.  DeSouza tells a story of why Obama makes the decisions he makes today based upon a great amount of research on Obama's book, Dreams from My Father, and by using Obama's actual voice and words.  DeSouza can identify with Obama in many ways because he also grew up in a country that was affected by colonialism.  DeSouza takes you through several countries and conversations with various people that he visited and spoke with to gather information about Obama's past and the people that were most influential in his life. The movie is based upon facts and shows in real time some of the actual results of the decisions Obama has made. The movie really gives one pause to reflect on just what has happened under the noses of the unsuspecting, trusting American Citizens. Everyone should temporarily stow away partisan beliefs and take a chance with an open mind to discover what some will disbelieve but isn't it better to say thank God this never happened rather than why didn't we take the time to listen to what others were trying to tell us?	5.0	2016 Obama's America	2012-10-17	32	23	9
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	ATDE9JYCPI0L1	Alyssa A. Lappen	"I don't always agree with Dinesh D'Souza, but this film is truly masterful. It takes on a very controversial, indeed, hollow, president, and puts some flesh on the skeleton.Who shaped Obama's thinking, where do his ideas come from, what does he really hope to accomplish, what are his goals, and are those goals in sync with the needs of America and its people, or its democratic ideals?I never liked Obama. I never trusted him, and I did not vote for him in 2008.But for all the reasons I had before, this film added new ones, without a single mean-spirited or unkind word (as another reviewer noted). What viewers get here are facts, pure and simple, most of them taken straight out of the President's ""own"" memoir, albeit one that we now know was ghost written by his friend, former Weather Underground bomber Bill Ayers.What D'Souza brings to the discussion is the unique perspective of an Indian-born, naturalized American, one who loves America for everything that it has given to the world, precisely because it is developed, and wealthy, and strives to educate all men and women fairly, and because its capitalist economic model is the one that has finally given promise to India, and China, and all other former ""third world"" countries that have understood that socialism simply does not work.Die hard Obama fans will not like this movie. But they ought to watch it anyway: There is a great deal of calm, collected thinking given here, along with interviews of people who knew Obama's father, his grandfather, his mother, his communist mentor Frank Marshall Davis --- and Obama himself during his university years.This film is food for serious thought. Do we want a nation invested in a growing and expanding economy that can support everyone willing to support himself, or do we want a basket case welfare state bankrupted by its monumental and fast-accelerated accumulation of $15 to $20 trillion dollar debts?In the laws of physics, gravity always pulls us back to earth.When it comes to finance, no household can long survive that outspends its earnings ten times over. No nation is exempt from economic law, either.People who love, and think they know Obama may be very surprised by what they see here. But none of us can afford to ignore it."	5.0	Insightful and important	2012-10-23	24	17	7

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2FLH1T7ZU6Q86	amaivia	Dinesh argues that Obama's worldview is grounded on anti-colonialism. He cites several of Obama's policies as support, such as his foreign policy and oil subsidies to other countries (while blocking drilling initiatives at home). He includes interviews with George Obama (the President's half-brother) and an expert on Israel (among others) for their take on Obama. I felt that he led the interviewee on some of the questions, rather than taking a more netural approach in how he phrased them. This was disappointing. I read the book first and found it powerful and compelling. After seeing his interviewing method, I feel it weakens the integrity of his case.Overall, I appreciate Dinesh's work for illuminating certain aspects of Obama's policies (which I find worrying) that I hadn't heard/read about in the mainstream media.	3.0	Leading questions in Dinesh's interviews?	2012-10-16	13	5	8

Though it does attempt to present itself as fact seeking, you find yourself circling the same ""drain"" for the entire movie.D'Souza seems to try to present himself as one seeking facts, but fails to accomplish this and by the end of the film I found myself frustrated for sitting through the whole thing. A film made up of poor sound mixing and bad editing that seems to expect folks to know who the hell Dinesh D'Souza is. I now know he isn't worth the price of his works.In the attempts to sound credible there were interviews with people who ""knew"" Obama. D'Souza might as well have interviewed me, since I know how to spell Obama as well. One can't claim to have any insight one a person they might have might once or have the same last name.Yes, low information voters may flock to this film and even claim it is better than it really is, but only those with low expectations of anything will find it worth seeing more than once.

United States as a country is on a brink of massive changes that will effect everybody.Dinesh DiSouza, who openly displays his republican connections, tries to convince viewers that Obama is a marxist, leftist and destructor of american welth (see his reference to housing prices etc.) while totaly ignoring the facts that republicans decided to enter into multitrillion dollars wars, were many lives of young american men were lost; Mr. DiSouza conviniently forgets about housing bubble which also was created under republican watch, and where many billions of $$ were pocketed by banks and uscrupulous individuals; he simply blames Obama for destruction of wealth.Obama is also blamed for suggesting to increase government revenue by raising taxes on wealthy. Mr. DiSouza suggestion that this is a wrong approach is just preposterous. Even Warren Buffett, who is a classical american capitalist, fully supports it and believes that it is not only fair, it is necessary. That is why is it called a ""Buffett Tax"".Blaming Obama for reducing american nuclear arcenal also is not smart. Mr. DiSouza does not clarifies on how many nuclear warheads are needed to annihilate that whole world, but he suggests that US should pile up nuclear warheads.Overall, this movie is a very poorly mascarated attacks on a man whom american people choose to lead the Country into the future, and who is facing very difficult economical and political environments.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A33RN6G8ZEXDDD	AnnsAppraisal	"This movie should have you, at the very least, asking questions. Who is Dinesh D'Souza? Did this movie and his prior book contain facts or are these conspiracy theories? Have you fact checked his stuff or just taking his word, or conservative talk show host's word that this is factual? Did you know Obama was also raised by his grandparents, his grandfather served under Patton? He had a great relationship with them, so why don't people think they influenced him? Maybe because it wouldn't promote the radical rights agenda? I have researched Mr. D'Souza and he is not using facts. I believe the GOP and Tea Party like to paint a picture of President Obama as ""different"" and people like to feed into this to further the cause and fatten their wallets. Mr. D'Souza also attacks the President's mother basically calling her a fat slut. Ask yourself what type of person does this when the woman isn't even here to defend herself. Then you find out he has to step down from his job because a Christian magazine reported that he stayed in a hotel with a woman who wasn't his wife. After bashing everyone else on Christian values, he claims he didn't know it was against the church to get engaged before you were divorced. You can watch the movie but do some research on who the filmmaker is and ask yourself does he have true integrity. Don't just think it's true because it has nice photography, scary sounding music, interviews and the filmmaker claims to be a Christian... Here are some facts to get you started.

Quotes from Obama's own book ""Dream's From My Father"" and interviews many people who had influence on Obama's life which would have impacted his worldview. In my opinion this film is really only for those who asked themselves 'what is Obama's worldview?' and would like to know. This film is not as rewarding for those who do not study politics or thought of worldviews. This film is also good in the sense it gives just enough information so one can do more research on their own such as anti-colonialism or the names of the people Obama was closely affiliated with.

The media wouldn't research his background because they were too busy being his personal cheerleader.

Watching over the years, how many of these ideals have become reality today in our modern world has been very sobering. So when O came on the scene, I was very wary of his past associations. I knew a lot about his mentor and sponsor Bill Ayres, the former domestic terrorist. Though this material has been available from day one, no one has put it together quite like Gerald Molen, Dinesh D'Souza and John Sullivan. It makes the reading of O's mindset clear as a bell. This is for people who have a brain and understand a little world history, so it won't appeal to the ""one star people"" posting, who probably wouldn't have the attention span to sit through the film. Reason for four stars, not five is because it could have been a little more dramatic at some points, and had some moments it was a bit dry, though never boring.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1DZU4AQR7KD9R	Axton Blessendon, Jr.	"---------------------------------------------------------------""2016: Obama's America""(Lionsgate, 2012)---------------------------------------------------------------Released in theatrical distribution during the 2012 presidential primary season, ""Obama's America"" was touted as a surprise ""hit"" movie, making several million dollars at the box office, a success that for some was taken as proof of the validity of the film's somewhat questionable political assertions.The film is an adaptation and update of author Dinesh D'Souza's partisan tract of the same name, and it follows the same lazy, disjointed pseudo-intellectualism as the book, arguing that Obama's ""colonial"" heritage (his African ancestry) predetermined his supposed reflexive anti-Americanism and supposed relentless efforts of undermine American global interests. D'Souza propagates various Fox News/Tea Party myths about Obama's presidency, such as the mythical ""apology tour"" to the Middle East, etc. etc. and attempts to bolster this with a penny-ante pop-psychology character profile which posits that Obama's (made-up) daddy issues have led him to be some sort of covert dashiki-wearing Third World militant Mau-Mauist who somehow snookered his way into the White House and is now leading us to ruin... on purpose.D'Souza attempts to project a well-measured intellectual veneer over what is clearly a bunch of partisan twaddle. But whereas the book seemed insidious and slightly seditious, the movie just feels muddled and poorly produced, in many parts bafflingly amateurish. For example, the sound mix is terrible -- in some scenes the incidental music competes with and even drowns out D'Souza's narration: is this on purpose, to distract from the intellectual paucity of his arguments, or was it just poorly mixed?Likewise, the visual imagery is revealing, particularly in clumsy scenes such as the sequence in which D'Souza argues that racism in America is a thing of the past, merely a vestigial paranoia of activists such as Rev. Jesse Jackson: while D'Souza struggles to keep the smirking tone out of his voice, onscreen we see a beer-ad scenario in which a black guy sits down at the bar next to some white guys, and they get up and walk away, leaving the sad man to sulk alone on his stool, rejected by the dominant culture. But, surprise! Really they were just going to the other room so they could get the cake for Black Guy's surprise party: the whole bar bursts into song and smiles: they love him! There's no racial barrier at all. Subtle, huh?The rest of the cinematography is more or less loosely-assembled stock footage: the producers seem to feel that pointing a camera in front of something, anything at all, will lend credibility to the narrative. If D'Souza is ""exploring"" Obama's childhood sojourn into anticolonialism, it is sufficient to shoot a bunch of street scenes of traffic in Indonesia; the visuals don't have to prove anything, they're just placeholders that don't interrupt the flow of D'Souza's laughably thin narrative.This film will have a very, very short shelf life, and indeed is probably outlived its expiration date. To the extent that it has historical value, it is a very revealing document of the far-right's xenophobic fear of otherness and inability to reconcile America's relationship to the rest of the world. Asians, Africans -- even Hawaiians -- give D'Souza the willies, or at least he is willing to use their ""otherness"" as a way to stir up distrust for the President among his nativist American audience. I won't presume to psychoanalyze D'Souza's own issues as an immigrant American (he continually attempts to draw false analogies between his experiences and Obama's) since that seems like a red herring to me.  Because he is a neocon political propagandist, it's hard to tell how much of what he writes and says is something he actually cares about, and how much is just him trying to find some meager foothold to propagandize against ""the other side."" Perhaps a better tack to follow is the technical weakness in his arguments: there's just no ""there"" there.The film is more useful than the book because of the sad visual imagery of the bookish D'Souza, clearly uneasy in his body and in his role as an interviewer, as he sits down with a series of largely inconsequential people: a guy in Kenya, some people who vaguely knew Obama in Hawaii, a pinch-faced phony expert who claims Obama is a communist, etc. D'Souza clearly thinks there are a lot of ""gotcha moments"" in these interviews, but there just aren't. There's nothing substantive to any of them, just a bunch of hearsay and unsupported though strident assertions about Obama and his supposed motivations. Hyper-partisans will find comfort and self-contained intellectual reinforcement in this film; people who have never heard of or considered the history of colonialism might believe that the footage of some guy in Africa calmly discussing how Europeans exploited his homeland as proof of some crazy radicalism that's beyond the pale of reason, but anyone who's been paying attention since 1945 will find this all pretty ho-hum. It is, however, a window into the insecurities and obsessions of the current-day American Right.Still, it's depressing that the neocons are trying to re-litigate history, and reverse commonsense understanding of how the balance of global power has shifted since the breakup of the British and continental empires, and equally depressing that such loose, facile, pseudo-intellectual partisan hackery has found traction with so many Americans. Perhaps more dispiriting is the sight of a vigorous, energetic person such as D'Souza devoting himself to a project which at its core is hollow and false. Like fellow media figures such as Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, D'Souza surely knows what he's saying isn't true, but he says it because it serves a raw, blunt political purpose, to further the goals of his ideology. It's an age-old debate, whether the ends should be consistent with the means: can you achieve a good, honorable victory using deceptive, unfair tactics? The American Right clearly no longer cares: they just want to win, and perhaps more importantly they want to defeat their foes. They relish combat and yearn for complete, absolute victory, and this seems to matter more to them than actual problem solving, comity or a shared American identity. This film, and now Dinesh D'Souza's entire personal legacy, is emblematic of this divisive, winner-take-all philosophy, and it is to my way of thinking, very very sad.

Everything in this documentary comes from public speeches, Obama's books or other public sources. Other than D'Souza's own conclusions this is simply putting everything that is available about and from Obama together in one source. Seeing what his influences were and who his mentors are will change the opinions of many Americans or what Obama's true intentions for this country are.But, warning!  There is another ""film"" out there now, and its intentions are very suspect.The European faerie tales contain chilling stories about Changelings and Doppelgangers, maleficent spirits usurping the place of a human child. As over the summer the success of ""2016: Obama's America"" rose at the box office another so-called documentary was being rushed into production:""Dreams of my real father""Never intended to be shown in theaters, priced cheap and sold on Amazon.com and other online locations, and now supposedly being mailed to voters in several states. This film, which I gagged my way partway through, is an appalling hack-job, the unproven and unprovable assertions of parentage and the truly embarrassing nude/fetish photos and film clips supposed to be Obama's mother, Ann. It is so irritating in it's music, repetitive reiteration of the phrase ""my real father, Frank Davis"" mouthed by the worst voice-over actor in the world, this ""film"" can only be intended to discourage interest in the real documentary, D'Souza's greatly superior effort. And irritate voters who receive this POS in the mail.By concentrating on the slander of Obama's family and associates, back to his grandparents, is this film putting out the theory that Communism and bad behavior can be inherited?

Anyone who has read Baracks book - ""Dreams FROM my Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance"" - will come to the same conclusion if they are asking themselves ""why is Obama making policies that hurt America?""If you aren't afraid of asking tough questions and pondering them, you'll enjoy this film. Although it's nearly impossible to have no bias in a political documentary at all, this film gets as close as you can get to ""fair"". There is no attempt to get viewers to vote for Romney and 2016 gets most of it's information firsthand from quotes and interviews from Barack's family and from Quoting Obama himself.I wish all American's cared about the the country and world enough to view this with an open mind, but sadly, as D'Souza points out in the documentary, most Americans don't want to know Obama.P.S. Please don't write a review if you haven't seen the movie.

They could not hear the words out of Mr. Obama's mouth, explaining how and why America needed to be reduced to a third world country. Dinesh D'Souza puts a magnifying glass in front of Obama, and asks us what we see, hopefully NOW. Sadly, the racists who voted for the man to be our president only because of the color of his skin, did not likely watch Mr. D'Souza's extraordinary biography. They did not need facts about Obama's philosophy of the free world &#34;to be&#34;, or his foreign policy, or his economic theory, all of which are sadly underdeveloped, in a job for which he is ill-prepared.

This movie is a excellent insight into where Obama got his societal philosophies and what direction his policies are leading and will lead U.S. by the completion of a second term in 2016.

It parallels what is happening today and what the country and its citizens may face in 2016. What I found most interesting about the film, was delving into Obama's past and his agenda for America.  The film was well produced with Dinesh D'Zousa as narrator. D'Zousa is a brilliant taskmaster who delivers razor sharp clarity about Obama's America without harsh judgment or controversy. Facts are presented and the viewer is well informed by the Documentary conclusion.In view of what is happening at this moment in American History, it is not only relevant, but one of the most important films to date with repercussions of where we are headed in the remaining years of Obama's Term.	5.0	Obama's America 2013	2013-10-13	7	5	2

With that in mind, EVERY US citizen should watch this movie. NO media outlet is reporting this information on Obama that is readily available for them. The Media is seriously guilty of cover up and failure to expose this guy Obama. This movie does a great job presenting who and what Obama is all about. Hitler was a real living human being, who went to school, grew up with family and friends, and appeared on the political scen in Germany at a vulnerable point in the country's history. I say this, because US citizens NEED to and have a RIGHT to know this information, for their own information and for the good of our beloved country. Obama may seem like a normal guy, but what he says in public is either outright deceit or veiled language, while what he does behind the scenes is truly shocking and NOT what the US citizens think he is all about.	4.0	A MUST see for those who want to be in the know!	2012-11-21	4	2	2

Dinesh hit on several negative things Obama has done but left out his real agenda and that is to destroy America one piece at a time. He is a socialist and most of the people he has put into key positions of the White House are also socialist. Once he has taken the guns from the people (he will try) than the genocide will begin as was in Germany, China, Russian. This man and his administration should have been exposed with all their attempts to destroy the constitution and the bill of rights. The film should have covered who is behind Obama and actually pulling the strings or giving him orders to carry out their agenda while they hide behind the curtain of darkness like cowards they are. He was too nice to someone who is trying to be a dictator and kills children in other countries with drones while he professes to be moral (sic). He needs to expose the whole corrupt system from Obama down.

It starts from the premise that Obama's worldview was imparted to him by his father, who he only met once. Then it reveals how he hid his true hatred of capitalism and America so white people would vote for him. Since Obama has 'hidden' these views, it's all complete speculation. Obama's views are well within the mainstream of his party. He gave hundreds of millions of $$ to the big banks to save our economy, and there is no evidence he's a commie. ObamaCare leaves insurance companies in charge and is based on Republican ideas. As for the rest of this absurd thesis, no one likes colonialism. There's a vague suggestion he hates white people. This movie peddles in the same obsession with anti-racism as Limbaugh, who thinks white kids are now going to be beaten by black kids.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2IDTND0B44U4J	Birds of Fire	"Dinesh is obviously a scholar and a gentleman. He gently, but accurately, tells the story of the bastard child of an airhead liberal mother and a polygamist drunk driving murderer who became the leader of the free world. His theory that Barack Jr. became an anti-colonialist BEFORE he became a communist was a revelation to me. I can't fault a single one of Dinesh's premises. Dinesh's treatment of Barack as someone his Kenyan family cannot identify with, nor in some cases even understand, was poignant almost to the point of bringing tears to my eyes. Dinesh makes it absolutely clear that he does NOT believe that Barack Jr. was born in Kenya. It is a key to his thesis. Because Barack Jr. was born of an American mother, subject to U.S. law, there can be no excuses made about Barack Sr. being unlawfully married to Barack Jr. mother. And there can be no excuses made that his vehicular manslaughter murder of an innocent Kenyan woman was ""not a crime according to Kenyan Law"". Liberal Democrats seem to always want to have their cake; and eat it too. They want America to believe that Barack Jr. was a native born U.S. Citizen, but they also want you to believe that his family was a normal Kenyan family that must be evaluated according to Kenyan Law. Rubbish. Either Barack Jr. is an American; which makes him the illegitimate son of a polygamist drunk driving murderer. Or he's a Kenyan whose father never broke a Kenyan Law.

I am not totally sold on President Obama, but this movie is so bad I could not hold my laughter in. The four (not kidding: FOUR) other people in the theater didn't seem too impressed either. There is so much sucking going on in this film that I can only hit a few highlights: here goes.1). Not one person D'Souza interviews has expertise on the subject matter. D'Souza does this bait-and-switch thing where he cites some ""expert"" or reads a quote from someone, but then inexplicably interviews someone else. Did you pay attention to the credentials of the media-starved morons he interviews? I did. They have none. These people don't know the President, they don't know government, they don't know anything about running a country. They are just a few pathetic right-wing morons who seem like they would do or say anything to get their mugs in front of a camera, even if it meant being filmed while talking on a phone (see #3 below).2). The thing D'Souza accuses Obama of, WE ALL ARE. His big accusation? Obama is an (insert gasping sound here), ANTI-COLONIALIST!!! Well, hate to tell you this, Dinesh (but I DO have to tell you because, unlike the President, you are not American-born), ALL AMERICANS ARE ANTI-COLONIALISTS. We had this war, see....back in the late 1700's, where we threw out the British. ""Why"", you ask??? Because we did not like being BRITISH COLONIES, you ferret-brained idiot. I personally would never vote for a president who was not an anti-colonialist. I rather prefer being a whole and independent country. Read some of my country's history before you criticize my President, Dinesh.3). Extremely poor production quality. This film looks like it was put together by high-school students with a $150 budget. Half the interviews are done OVER THE PHONE. Films are....um....sort of visual, dude. Doing interviews in person is generally taken for granted. But nope, D'Souza could not be bothered with that crap: he did about half the interviews over the f-ing phone. Seriously.4). Techniques your 8-year old would find cheesy. The rolling black clouds: seriously? The shot, repeated ad nauseum, of an unidentified person picking up handfuls of dirt and pouring it over Obama's father's grave. I don't even know what that was supposed to mean, but D'Souza sure must have loved it because he rolls that footage what seems like 100 times.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AVL3LS9X6TSEB	Brent Chastain	Being an overtly political documentary, 2016 clearly divides review perspectives.  This divide is obvious to see in the Amazon ratings - if you are pro-Obama ratings can be on the extreme low end.  If you dislike Obama you will see Amazon user ratings on the extreme high end.  As a film fan who's seen thousands of films and documentaries I will be as objective as possible.  Overall the documentary is merely competent.  It does what it intends to do with little drama or flourish.  It is not particularly compelling, but rather mildly interesting.  It does provide a fairly persuasive case that exemplifies Obama's life influences and therefore his Socialist leanings.  However keep in mind the conclusions are largely conjecture and speculation.  2016 does not for example include all of Obama's associations with people who are not anti-Capitalist or anti-Colonialists, so unlike this review, is not a fair and balanced film.  It intends to get to the roots of Obama's Socialistic leanings and focuses in mostly on that.  When you step back and look at the film from an objective perspective it's not particularly revealing.  Yet it does present some pieces of the puzzle that certainly in part define our 44th president.  Brent Chastain, top3films.com	3.0	Fair & Balanced Review	2012-10-24	14	7	7

Certainly this isn't flattering to President Obama but much of it is in his own words or those by people who know him or his father personally.  I was intrigued by the idea that he sent the bust back from the White House and wouldn't think he'd have the right to do that.  I don't understand why he isn't helping out his very poor half brother yet is speaking often of helping the poor, help begins at home. It seems Obama was elected because of a ""perfect storm"" and slogans of hope and change were like medicine to a sick nation.  Unfortunately, it's four years later and the results promised were not delivered.  Whether you agree or not with this movie certainly there is something to be learned from it.  I am certain people who love Obama will hate the movie and people who hate Obama will love the movie.  It's those in the middle, unbiased to begin with that will be the best test to watch this.  I voted for Obama in 2008 but I am greatly disappointed in him now.  I learned a lot from this movie, particularly about his father and the estrangement that seemed to haunt Obama.  I found it sad and moving. Yet haunting.  Obama is an unlikely president in a center right nation.  Running on ideals was perfect in 2008 however running on a wretched record in 2012 is a different story.

For the most part (for me), the first hour and fifteen minutes of this film has been covered over and over in several other productions and was nothing new.

I cannot recall ever seeing an interview with the former comptroller general in this film and I think there could be a big story there.

Best researched was the relationship with brother George and his views of the anti-colonialist mindsets of Barrack's father and Barack himself, which George does not share.The study of the influences of his relatives and the anti-Western views of his schooling in Indonesa made this study important in understanding the Presiden's policies and why they conflict with those of our Founders.The only shortcoming, in my opinion, was the speech audio.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3EXIZUDLT9YZE	Bryan	This movie is just plain fun to watch. You could turn off the sound and listen to some music while watching and it would be great. The content is not the hit piece that I expected. It is an exposition of the president's life and explains a bit what makes him tick, while dismantling the birther notion completely. As timely now as it was before the election.My only gripe is the little gimmick when phone conversations are taking place, where when the person speaking is not on camera, their voice is overly distorted to simulate listening to the phone. That became tiresome. But that is a small thing and I hope they'll correct it in future editions.	5.0	Superb in content and just good old cinematography and editing	2012-11-07	7	2	5

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AQ23JU38JG65G	B. Speaks	I was intrigued by this movie when it was first relased.  I don't know much about our President as a person and was interested to learn more about him.  I think this film did a good job of detailing President Obama's upbringing and the life experiences that have shaped his &#34;world view&#34;.  While the President was never directly interviewed, many of the points made were taken directly from his autobiography.  A friend asked me if I thought the film was made to shed a negative or positive light on the President.  I think the filmmaker did a good job of giving details and allowing the viewer to decide whether those details cast a negative or positive light.I must say that I was disturbed by the beliefs of our President portrayed in this movie.  While his beliefs would not concern me if he were an average man, they certainly concern me as he the leader of our country.	4.0	Informative and Disturbing	2012-12-05	5	2	3

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AF8O8KQBADSIM	Buff Perez	I listen to a lot of news sources from NBC to Rush to BBC; however, this movie did more than any of those media outlets to help me understand why Mr. Obama makes what I consider controversial decisions that will lead America to a more socialistic state than what we've already become.  I still believe that if I work for a grade of A in school, that it is mine to keep and thus enjoy the benefits of what good grades will do for my life.  I shouldn't have to share my A with someone who didn't try, so that we both wind up with a a passing score of 70 or a D-.  And if someone who tries, but is unable to obtain an A, I still shouldn't be required to share that grade.  Now, if I want to donate points, that's different... then it is my choice, but the real question remains, did that person receiving the points demonstrate that they learned anything?  Will GPA's that are gifted be identified as such?  This leads me to worry about corporate America and who gets hired... is it based on a skill set or just because it is someones turn?  I could go on and on, but I'll stop here.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone who either loves or hates the changes Mr. Obama is bringing to this country.	5.0	Thoughts from Buff	2012-11-23	5	3	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1P8JNHB87ER3K	Cardwellent	This was incredible. Ever since Obama took office, I couldn't understand the motives behind certain policies and actions taken by him. I raked it up to extreme socialism and as progressive anti-capitalist point of view. After seeing the presidential debates and listening to what Obama has to say, I can actually see where his points of view do come from. I agree with the author that we are at a critical point in our history where we must decide if we want a country that is based on the complete socialist nanny state where government decides who gets what and when or a country where every individual has the chance to shape their own lives into want they want and dream of.I am neither a Republican nor a Democrat. I do believe that we should have safety nets to fall back on if we can't succeed, but I don't believe that the successful should have to pay for the mistakes I make or that they should be punished for their success. This film shows how Obama's agenda does just this and for the first time why he does this.This film serves its purpose as far as giving us an insight into the true Obama. It explains the reasons why America would ignore it's own founding principles to elect him into office. It was such a great moment in history to have our first black president. It showed that we could rise above racism but, we were so concerned about this (me included) that we didn't look beyond it to see the hidden agenda behind Obama. I and the rest of America were so blinded by race that we were deceived into giving up our fundamental right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The movie was right in the fact that we were blinded and feel for the biggest scam in the world.In closing, I hope that everyone takes a look at this film and are able to take off the fascination of the Obama fad to look at the truth and the real facts before they vote in this election. Look at the definition of the change that is preached from the Obama strategy rooms and wake up to what is really happening. Research what he says and you will see how deep the real web of deception goes. You will find out why the blame game, race cards, name calling, and flat out rejection of the truth is so important to keep the real motives and objectives hidden from the American people.	5.0	What a wake up call	2012-10-22	24	18	6

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AH4CRI9B9JIME	Carlos Laflauta	"First, for the record, I have seen the documentary.This movie is an attack on Obama based on guilt by association, armchair psychoanalysis, and character assassination. There is no serious discussion of Obama's actual policies - only speculations about what he would do under the assumption that he shares the most radical views of all the sordid characters in D'Souza's Rogues Gallery.D'Souza does provide quick and facile dismissals of some Obama policies, but they fail to hold up on close inspection:1. OBAMA REFUSES TO STOP THE GENOCIDE IN SYRIA. Well, what is he supposed to do, get us involved in another war in another Muslim country? That is what Romney might very well do, if he thinks we should be stronger on Syria than Obama has been. Even if Romney just sends heavy arms to the rebels they will likely end up in the hands of jihadists, who are the most dominant rebel faction - a good reason why Obama has shown more restraint. So whether Romney actively joins the war or just sends arms, the likely result will be to strengthen Al Qaeda. Romney shows every sign of being a dilettante bungler in foreign policy like his forebear George Bush.2. OBAMA REFUSES TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY PROTESTERS IN IRAN. The reason for this restraint was to avoid making Iranian dissent look like an American project, which would lose the protesters credibility in the Muslim world. It is the same reason Israel does not publicly comment on internal distress in Muslim countries. It was NOT because Obama doesn't support true democracy in Iran.3. OBAMA REFUSES TO TAKE ""MEANINGFUL ACTION"" TO STOP IRAN FROM GETTING NUKES. This is one of the phoniest Republican criticisms. Republicans are big talk about this, but NONE of them, not even Romney, say what they would do to stop Iran that Obama isn't already doing. What do they want Obama to do? Start another war that would bankrupt our economy? If so, they should come right out and say it. Meanwhile Obama has toughened sanctions on Iran to unprecedented levels. Delays in imposing tough sanctions were not Obama's doing; they were due to resistance from Russia and China.4. OBAMA SIDES WITH THE PALESTINIANS AGAINST ISRAEL. In his first year Obama leaned too far towards the Palestinians, but has moderated his views since then. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is immensely complicated, and Romney does not appear to grasp the subtleties. The Palestinians have obstructed peace by rejecting numerous compromises, continuing their genocidal rhetoric, and even firing on Israeli population centers. But Israel is not blameless, currently led by a self-destructive regime controlled by settlerist extremists and religious fanatics. Neither side has been serious about making peace, and right now Obama seems to be the only candidate who comes close to grasping that, avoiding the temptation to champion one side and demonize the other.5. OBAMA GREATLY INCREASED THE DEFICIT. Unlike his Republican predecessor, who blew out our economy on a costly war that was not only unproductive but that strengthened our enemies, Obama spent to stimulate our economy and to save it from depression. Any other policy would have been irresponsible. Those who don't like the deficit should blame the Republicans who created it. To blame Obama for not cleaning up their mess fast enough is gross hypocrisy.6. OBAMA WANTS TO RAISE TAXES. The fact is that our tax rates are the lowest they've been in decades. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit, but they want to pour two trillion dollars more into defense without even raising any revenue to pay for it. The only way to pay for Republican budget extravagances is to cut services to the poor and middle class, and even that won't be enough. But Republicans don't care as long as those who already possess more wealth than they need acquire even more. This is fiscal conservatism?7. OBAMA REDUCED OIL DRILLING AND IS ANTI-OIL. This is part exaggeration, part untruth. Drilling permits were cut temporarily after the BP oil spill in 2010. The Department of the Interior issued a moratorium on new permits to allow time to review safety procedures. Production rates picked up in 2012 and under Obama oil and natural gas production have increased.8. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. An object of irrational hatred by Republicans, even though it's based on largely Republican ideas. Hypocrite Romney defends his record in Massachusetts, including his own version of ""Obamacare,"" while condemning Obama's plan which is virtually identical.  Romney still has not explained why what was good enough for his own state is too good for the rest of us. In Massachusetts  Romney criticized emergency room care as the most expensive and inefficient. Now he offers it as a solution for the uninsured. Emergency care will also not help you if you have a serious chronic condition - just try relying on the ER if you have cancer. If the Republicans get their way, millions of people will be forced off the insurance rolls. WHY doesn't this afflict the conscience of every American? It should.9. And last but not least, let's not forget: OBAMA RETURNED THE BUST OF CHURCHILL TO BRITAIN. D'Souza conveniently leaves out that this bust was part of an art collection on loan to the Bush administration, and Obama returned the whole collection because the loan came to an end. What an anti-Western, socialist thing to do!The rest of the movie is innuendo and speculation about Obama's psyche that borders on the ridiculous. We should be afraid of Obama because his father was a drunken womanizer and he, Obama, never took care of his brother, someone he hardly knew and was little more than a stranger to him. And who doesn't even want his help! How awful.Here is where the movie really starts to get vicious. Obama's father wrote an article in 1965 in which he proposed:1. Use the power of the state to control and regulate private industry.2. Tax income at 100% and give it back to the people as benefits.From this flimsy evidence, which has nothing to do with President Barack Obama, D'Souza concludes that this is what the President means when he says he wants everyone to ""pay their fair share"" and when he opposes deregulation. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS REALLY TRYING TO TURN THE UNITED STATES INTO A SOCIALIST COUNTRY!This is pure demagoguery, especially the assumption that just because his father said something - a father who didn't even raise him! - the son must believe it too and make it his policy. If D'Souza hates Obama's tax policy so much, he should quote from Obama and not Obama's dad. The fact is that deregulation, courtesy of the Republicans, is what nearly destroyed our economy (see the far superior film ""Inside Job""). But Romney wants to roll back regulation. He wants to repeal Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank. He wants to bring back the very conditions that nearly destroyed our country. And because of crass fear-mongering, of which this movie is an example, the American people seem ready to let him do it.NEVER did Obama ever say he wanted to tax 100%. This country has always had progressive tax rates, with higher brackets for higher income. We had that under Republican administrations. Nobody ever called that socialist before. Tax rates were higher under Reagan than they are under Obama. Nobody ever called Reagan a socialist redistributor of wealth. Only now because Obama is president are taxes a reason for the terrors of socialist revolution.THEREFORE D'SOUZA'S CONCLUSION THAT OBAMA IS SOME KIND OF COVERT FOREIGN AGENT, A TRAITOR IN THE WHITE HOUSE SEEKING TO DESTROY AMERICA AND NEUTRALIZE ITS POWER, IS TOTALLY WITHOUT FOUNDATION. D'Souza attributes views to Obama that Obama never espoused. He takes legitimate policies, such as financial regulation and progressive taxation, and exaggerates them to look like some socialist agenda. He makes speculations about Obama's character with no factual foundation, to scare people into voting Republican. This is dangerous, anti-intellectual demagoguery, and I cannot understand how anyone can take this crass film as a serious argument for deciding their vote in November.Are you really worried about 2016? Here is what we can expect under Romney:1. Dismantling Medicare and turning it into a voucher program that won't keep pace with rising health costs and will put insurance out of reach of many poor and middle class seniors.2. Draconian cuts to Medicaid, reducing it by 1/3 and turning it into block grants to states that will be totally inadequate to meet the needs of those whom Medicaid serves. But since mainly poor people are affected, who cares? According to the Republican Calvinist ethic, poor people are to blame for being poor so they deserve it - no matter how hard they work at jobs that pay very little and provide few benefits. Blame the poor for being poor - except when that poor person happens to be you or someone in your family.3. Repealing Obamacare, leaving tens of millions without health insurance. But who cares, as long as it isn't me, right?4. Rolling back the regulations intended to save us from another Republican-engineered financial crisis, and returning to the very same conditions that came close to wrecking this country - until Obama started us on the road to climbing out of it. And this in spite of Republican obstructionism almost every step of the way. And we're surprised and impatient because, even though we ARE on a better track now, we haven't undone all of the damage in just four years.5. As to foreign policy, killing America's image abroad with bellicose rhetoric, ""American exceptionalism,"" and Bush-style adventurism based on a very shallow understanding of foreign affairs.In short, under a Republican administration, given the current extreme tilt of that party, the real agenda of wealth redistribution, from the poor and middle class to the rich, will continue. Income disparity may well reach the point of causing social unrest. Yet even while they support slashing social services to the bone and beyond, shrinking government so that it can no longer pay for those services, throwing millions out of health care while lowering their own taxes, the wealthy whose interests the Republicans serve still outrageously accuse the Democrats of ""class warfare.""D'Souza might have reached a more rational conclusion had he looked at actual policy, instead of psychobiography and innuendo. But this is what Republicans do. They don't have the facts, so they engage in character assassination and innuendo and demagoguery. Say, which candidate was it who said ""Attacking me is no agenda""?This movie is a piece of trash. Its purpose is to frighten us silly, appealing to our basest emotions with no rational foundation. And that is, historically, how nations end up destroying themselves."	1.0	Fear-mongering garbage	2012-10-24	88	38	50

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AQXXRRTTUL2AX	C.F.G.	The main guy behind this film has questionable moral, intellectual and ethical problems, but that doesn't by itself make the film a joke. Any person educated to the level of a Harvard law professor such as Obama is going to be exposed to the facts about U.S. imperialism, colonialism, militarism, and hegemony worldwide. Why do you think we have the world's largest military, with us butting in to occupy, invade and otherwise anger citizens in more than 100 countries worldwide? But Obama is in no way a leftist, progressive or radical. If he was the anti-colonialist, socialist radical that this movie paints him to be,when he came into office he would have done almost everything differently. He is just a neoconservative Dem, in the mold of Clinton. The policies of the Democrats and GOP are pretty much the same on almost all issues other than the fact that the GOP wants women to be forced to carry the babies of rapists. This is a good propaganda film. I would like to see Michael Moore make on on Dinesh, Romney and the corporate rulers such as the Koch Brothers. It would be less propaganda, and more on the side of regular Americans, than this well-crafted hit piece.	1.0	Obama is owned by corporations, just like Romney	2012-10-19	42	7	35

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2ZAJTVLGOEBS	"C. Gwin ""college girl"""	"If this were a news piece, I would say that it was poorly done as it is taking a few facts and spinning them into a prediction of the future. But it's not a news piece- it's a documentary which should be designed to make a person think. I believe that it does this and it does it well.The documentary shows several people in Obama's life and examines the effect of not having his father around might have caused on him. There is another documentary on Netflix about the influence of a father figure in our lives and as a person who has a distant father and tends to pay attention to people's actions in relation to this failed relationship, I can tell you, this father figure documentary is right in probably 90% of the cases. That being said, the psychology lesson given in ""2016"" is not a bad guess at the truth. It may not be the truth, but it is a possibility and holds at least some element of the real truth most likely. Having our fathers around makes us stronger people. Without them, most people wind up confused and searching to fill a hole they can't fill.Whether the people interviewed are trustworthy sources or crazy people who sound sane is up to you, but they are providing you with a point of view which you can interpret however you may choose.Our documentary host is right about one thing at least and that is the unknown factor of Barrack Obama in the election in 2008. Without that quality, concerns about his character would hold much less space in our synapses. The birther claims and the socialist claims are all based upon the unknowns of our President. This documentary, however, claims a much more possible viewpoint. And that is that Barrack Obama may be trying to level the playing field for the entire world- not just America. The documentary seems to believe that Obama is mostly a new wave of anti-colonialism. In this form of anti-colonialism, its supporters believe that the United States and Britain are the colonizers and that they should be leveled to the countries who they have suppressed. While this is suspect information, it does fit and makes a person stop to think and wonder. Therefore, this documentary has done its job."	5.0	Excellent Speculation- exactly what a documentary should be	2012-10-19	15	11	4

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2HTAW8R7A7MJB	Chancellor C. Roberts, II	Contrary to the criticisms by people who have clearly not watched the documentary, D'Souza posits a possible motivation for Obama's approach to public policy.  He affirms that Obama was born in Hawaii (which should put the birther issue to rest).  Ultimately, he suggests that Obama's motivation comes from a decidedly third world, anti-colonial liberation theology (its American version of the social justice gospel common in black and liberal Protestant churches) world view.  I only gave it four stars because I don't think that his speculation about what America will be like in 2016 is just speculation and it doesn't necessarily follow that America will become what D'Souza suggests if Obama gets what he wants.  Congress (even the Democrat-controlled Senate) is going to thwart Obama as much as possible.	4.0	Good documentary	2012-11-21	4	2	2

I was following Nate Silver and by then it was obvious OIbama was going to win. Dinesh D'Souza's critique comes down to: Obama misses his daddy and grieving for him, gets elected President to inflict a Kenyan Anti-Colonial world-view over the US. Who said this first, D'Sousa or newt Gingrich? According to D'Sousa Obama failed because of Obama Care, Iran and the audacity of returning a bust of Winston Churchill to England. The last is easily fact checked, the first two are matters of difference over policy.These two DVD's were distributed free to households in the nine swing states in the last days of the election season, and we can see by the results what effect they had. Too bad, they would have been catnip for the Republican base, but they didn't get a free copy because they were already whipped into a froth to vote against Obama, no need to anger them even more.Karl Rove once observed that Democrats lived in a ""reality based"" world, whereas Republicans made ""Our own reality."" D'Sousa's piece and Dreams From my Real Father prove this, but not to worry. The election is over.  D'Sousa, Jerome Corsi and others like them have been switched off and put on the shelf, but you can be sure that they will be back with scandals for pea-brained come 2016, against _______________ just write in the Democratic Candidate's name. Right now, the election is over, my Republican friends who were telling me that I  needed to watch Fox News in order to avoid a nasty surprise on Election night are now gnashing their teeth, maybe they can drive to the swing states and fish these DVDs out of the garbage cans and salve their wounded hearts by watching them.Charles BlandNiagara Falls NY"	1.0	Election is Over	2012-11-15	93	45	48

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A5UQAS0EYI85G	cheesefilms	"Note how the cover of this DVD depicts a police mug shot of Obama which entails a journey to arrest and prosecute the president of the United States. A popular icon and admission of America's conservative racism in itself, but I'll get to that later. Interesting title as well, ""2016: Obama's America"" intrudes the senses that Obama has a secret country somewhere that equals Stalin or The Peoples Temple.In posing the question of racism in America that stumps Jesse Jackson, Dinesh D'souza and Mr. Jackson both forget that there is a population of Americans that do live by limited freedoms and representation politically and economically, hindered by racism and systematic barriers to opportunities open to the rest of America, and that is the American Indian. It is obvious both Jesse Jackson and Dinesh D'souza have never heard of tribal sovereignty or the multitude of organizations, laws and politicians across the nation bent on keeping reservations, indigenous peoples from prospering by blocking native advancements. Beginning with the acosting of children into boarding schools where molestation, suicide and abuse were the norm into the Bureau of Indian Affairs today that filters native landowners royalties via energy, land and natural resources. Do non-native landowners and corporations put up with federal intrusions? Since that is another documentary, lets not dampen D'souza and conservatives efforts to demonize President Obama, so on with the show!This film from Dinesh D'souza holds Obama to standards not held to congress, Romney, McCain, Gingrich, Bush, Cheney and the associates these men are photographed with. Bush Jr. holding hands or kissing Arab oil kings, makes this film thin and reek with nothing but the singular voice of a foreign born writer that never grew up in America, never had one parent or grandparents raise him into a lawyer, yet, is given full reins to use the terms ""we"", ""our country"" and ""us"" when Obama himself, has yet to gain full citizenry from many Americans. This propaganda film attempts to define President Obama and his father's kinship, with little, or no definition of his white family's values or careers. Rather, we get Obama and his ""founding fathers"" and their damage to mankind. There are interviews in plush Republican offices, a psychologist thats an expert on father and sons relations and businessmen bent on the continued fearmongoring the right has mastered, only this time, instead of ""weapons of mass destruction"", we have ""debt of mass destruction"". Rather than interview colleagues, family and community partners Obama has spent time with in order to gain some personal knowledge of Obama the man, Dinesh delves deep into the jungles and scary third world poverty to try to bait Obama's estranged brother George into calling the President neglectful of his family duties, but Dinesh gets nowhere here, no matter how hard he comes off like a dirty cop interrogating a criminal. Even Michael Moore interviews more than three people in his documentaries, right wrong or just plain entertainment value, Moore makes Dinesh D'souza's film look like a boring term paper nobody, even a grading professor, would want to read.It is obscene and contradictory how the film ends in the eyes of a non-white child, possibly Eastern Indian or Iraqi, but no doubt similiar to many of the children killed in both Bush wars of Afghanistan and Iraq. I find this racists and disturbing in itself. Do conservatives really relate to this childs plight?This film fails to convince me that President Obama is the anti-American, anti-capitalist demagod conservatives like to label him as. One minute, Obama is not a legitimate leader and critique'd as incompetent or a failure. When this doesn't work, he is labeled an evil genius out for world dominion alongside his army of militant black liberation army with Bill Ayers and Reverend Wright front and center. If Obama's presidency does anything. It gets Americans on their feet, off their gluteus maximus obesitys  and raises their IQ's in the areas of civics, politics and economics, because before Obama, Americans didn't really care if our presidents couldn't speak and stuttered, killed Indians or found an exit from the stage as long as they looked like CEO's or ministers, gave the rest of the globe a middle finger and I think that says alot more about Americans than our first half African American President in Obama.

Granted, some of the history in the film is true (for instance, Obama's childhood family situation), but the main point of the film is all wrong. The author that spawned this ridiculous documentary assumes a theory of President Obama's motives that simply does not make sense.  Though the film will try to convince you that this theory is correct, please think critically.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A36HLH3HSA07J4	Chris	"While I am not a fan of Obama's policies (I do not want health insurance for instance), this video did take the time to trace more of Obama's history than most are willing to tell. I do have a better appreciation for him as an individual, and agree with several of his purported ""anti-colonial"" sentiments.Unfortunately, this video completely ignored any valid points raised by those views, and which were a major focus of the story. D'Souza stated in one place that Hawaii was forced into a union with the United States despite the national and international laws which should have governed the decision. He went on with 'Obama is against America colonizing the world.' &lt;sidenote>Really? Why are the United States the global police force? With troops in more than half of the nations in the world, and with the intentional toppling of governments, I would argue that the ""nation building"" is ""empire building"" and that is not something encouraged by the nation's founders.&lt;/sidenote>D'Souza did not repeat the birther views or the claim that Obama was a Muslim. He actually said Obama was born in Hawaii. Yay for that! At the end of the film he made a play on the anti-Muslim paranoia among many conservatives by saying that by 2016 we could have the ""United States of Islam"" within the middle east. Color me skeptical but I don't see it. The nations that stand right now were carved up by Europe during the middle of the last century and do not represent ethnic groups. Those false divisions play into the national politics which we are seeing play out. They have plenty to work out within their own region, let alone come after the rest of the world as a militant force -- and most Islamic folks are just like anyone else, they want to have a life. (I do not deny that militants do exist.) This was a cheap potshot on D'Souza's part and lowers my opinion of him.There were a few misstatements made. One example is the bust of Churchill, which was supposed to go back after the last presidency was over. You can find more details with a simple Google search.Overall, the film was informational but surprisingly one-sided.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2H9JL9UYIF7S5	Chris_Miller2	Let me get one thing straight before people attempt to yell at my saying I am a diehard liberal. I am no Obama supporter. I support many of his policies, but in no way most. One thing that Dinesh needs to understand is that a lot of his assertions are based on false premises. He claims that Obama is weirdly sympathetic to Muslim Jihadists, get gives no examples of him helping them. The bust of William Churchill was planned, by president Bush, to be returned, as it was only a loan. Another bust of William Churchill is still in the White House to this day. D'Souza's claims that Obama's taxing the rich and cutting the military are all some elaborate scheme to bring down America is ridiculous. The super rich pay less in taxes than the average school teacher, as they have find so many loopholes. The rich should be taxed to help us with the crippling debt we've accumulated. Also, the military rightfully needed to be cut, as we don't fight 18th century type wars anymore.

Two weeks ago we saw on the news a map showing all the countries where our embassies were under siege, and my husband pointed out that looked just like the map at the end of 2016 Obama's America.

It didn't nearly expose all it could to make the man out as a determined Marxist, a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood (a terrorist organization with goals to take over the westernized world, instituting Islamic law) nor the numerous radical communist connections he held through his college and young adult years on into the presidency.  The only goal of this film was to show the accurate story of how Obama was rejected by his father, and later being sent away by his mother from her and from the only father figure he knew  to live with his grandparents who were upper-middle class, and how he thus spent much of his life ""in a daze"" trying to find out who he was, what he should believe in after having heard his mother lifting up the absent-father image as a ""great man"" who had aspirations to fight against capitalism and also no doubt the affect of his later absent mother....again, rejection.  He did not have what presidents describe as a close family who were there for one another through thick and thin. In his college years he seeks out the life of his now dead fathers view of the world.I believe the goal of this film is to show how Obama seeks to finally reconcile himself unto his father by carrying out his father's dream.  It's the typical rejected sons cry; ""maybe NOW he'll think I'm worthy""........and in THIS rejected sons cry, his reconciliation will be realized by radically changing the US by bringing her DOWN and making her weak."	4.0	Content was enlightening, but as a film, the audio seemed off	2012-10-03	37	26	11

It was also a wake up call in general about the overall declining condition of our Country.  It is a must see if we are to turn things around.  Our government is in the disarray it is because ""We, the People"" have not done our duty.  Our founders warned us we would have to be vigilant to keep the Constitutional Republic they blessed us with.  We were not vigilant.  We let elected officials take more and more power.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3L7M326I5H39R	Concerned American	I expected this to be a biased piece but I found it to simply tell Obama's story.  Where he comes from, what he believes and why he believes it.  As others have stated much of it is in Obama's own words from his book and his speeches.  I already knew that I didn't agree with many of Obama's viewpoints but in watching this movie I found out it's much worse than I thought.  I thought he was misguided or simply made some mistakes and had some socialist tendencies.  Truth is he's duped the American people and hijacked the Democratic Party for his own agenda.  His agenda is to degrade this country to the point that we are less than or equal to all other nations.  That may sound incredible but after watching this film I understand why and I truly believe it.  I hope and pray that we don't get the oportunity to see what a second Obama term would bring.It's amusing to read the one star ratings try to discredit this film.  They say it's all lies or if you believe it you don't know Obama.  I guess if you voted for Obama or like him you suddenly are an expert on who he is and his ideals.  I Already knew much of his story but what was new in this film was the perspective D'Souza offers as an immigrant from India. As Americans we just don't think the same as foreigner's do.  He tells you right in the film he worked in the Regan Whitehouse and that he belonged to Conservative Organizations at Dartmouth.  However he is very fair with his facts.  So much so that I believe that if you had the beliefs that he says Obama has and didn't need to hide them from your voters you would be proud of the job D'Souza does at telling your story.  As others have said some of the statements the detractors make show they haven't watched the film.  I think everyone should watch this film and then go vote for the canidate of your choice!

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A10Z64A7HA1EWJ	Concerned	Rented the film this evening.  It is frightening.  The viewer leaves with a firm conviction that the worldview, the priorities, of the current president are completely at odds with those of us who believe in freedom, self-determination, and the greatness of America.Two additional comments:First, among the movie's insightful points is that some of those who denigrate America do so while holding America to a standard much higher than the standards to which they hold other countries (thus arguably implicitly conceding a degree of American exceptionalism).Second, the film sets forth a host of researched facts -- not opinions, but facts, which anyone is free to confirm or disprove.  Although a number of purported negative reviews on this site allege that the film contains something short of actual facts, NONE of those reviews specifies which facts, they allege, are untrue.  They are, of course, free to list them, but they do not.	5.0	Eye-opening and Frightening	2012-11-04	6	4	2
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2SPR5ZC5T19SX	confined mom	Twoscore and seven years ago we as a nation were at the brink of Vietnam, two years into the Bible being banned from classroom use, five years from the 3000+ deaths per day that would occur in our abortion facilities, and hoping Cuba wouldn't again plan to blow us off the map.  There was also no information about Barack Obama out there for anyone to learn about him.  Today, he has been president for four years and while all those other things have shown a degree of change, and public focus, the media is still not aware that Barack Obama had a past and therefore has plans for the future.  This is a very good attempt to help us get to know this man we are to honor as our President, because we are to honor the powers that be, that are ordained of God.  We are a nation under God and indivisible because of it.  This documentary presents concerns and data that help us know how to pray for our country and one another.We can't see America only through our own eyes.  D'Souza, as an immigrant, gives us pause to see it entirely differently, and I appreciate his effort.Reviews of the movie here on Amazon include various accounts of its content: Sam Graham's is one of the more offensive approaches, in my opinion, because he clearly sees it from an entirely different set of life values from mine.  That's why we have both peaches and asparagus: we are not the same, and we benefit from differing choices.  This was a choice I was glad to have made but can't know whether others are going for fruit or vegetables. The media in general shapes the questions and the answers in one direction, while this DVD takes an alternate point of view and uses the same techniques.  That was D'Souza's choice and he took the risk of research and publication.  We critics are merely consumers, doing our best to get at the truths so diligently hidden.	5.0	There is another America	2012-12-26	3	3	0

He postulates that Obama is trying to fulfill the anti-colonial dreams of his father by redistributing the wealth and apologizing for the past abuses of America against the third world countries. My biggest question is why does the media refuse to investigate Obama's history?  Why is so much of his past shrouded in mystery? The American people elected Obama when he had no executive experience and without knowing what Obama really believed and wanted to do with the country besides the trite chants of hope and change.  My question always has been hope in what and what kind of changes?  No one could answer these questions before 2008 and now that we have seen the kind of change that Obama has brought over the last 4 years, it is scary to think what other destructive changes He will try to force upon Americans.	5.0	Insightful research that the media refuses to investigate	2012-11-10	5	2	3

Though the author/producer is conservative,he does not use empty rhetoric or criticism to denigrate Obama's obvious Marxist/socialist/progressive ideals. Dinesh was born into the colonialism of British controlled India.Obama's Kenyan father was raised in the post-colonial,post WWII era of Kenya's growth.Combining these life experiences with Obama's male mentors,in absence of his own father,Dinesh clearly reveals Obama's communistic and socialist goals & desires of changing America from it's very core. The documentary is well researched and includes many one-on-one live interviews with Obama's relatives and Obama's father's living political associates. It is sad that so many Americans would openly endorse and even worship a man that they know so little about and allow that man to rip out the core freedoms of America. 2016 is not long nor is it distasteful in its accomplishments.It truly opens your eyes to Obama's true agenda for ""changing"" America!"	5.0	EXCELLENT POLITICAL DOCUMENTARY!	2013-05-20	4	3	1
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A8DI0COTCMRDV	creatureart	"propagandaviaThe Merriam Webster Dictionary1: the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person2: ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause; also: a public action having such an effect.This Writer/Director/rightwing Reaganite Propagandist displays to the audience a factually historic yet fixed timeline of President Barack Obama's life. To a constantly loud, ominous and foreboding soundtrack, the propagandist narrates throughout the film in an subtle alarmist and almost slick talking voice. As he presents each fact about Obama's past he stamps each one with a presumption and/or idea on how this could be bad for America and it's future. The facts are all stuff most of us already know about Obama's upbringing and the Barack Obama that ""we didn't know"" turns out in the end to be who the Director THINKS he is and where the Director THINKS he's leading the country. In the end it's simply a biased documentary full of fearful presumptions, world economic contradictions and radically extreme rightwing view points based entirely on either a hunch or a wealthy mans agenda or both and brought to you by a ""man"" who served in the White House for good old Ronald Wilson Reagan?This man has given us his opinion on the facts he presented and that's Propaganda!This man sat right next to the Presidents half brother and tried to talk him into admitting that the President betrayed him, as his brother giggles and disagrees with the mans presumptions, the Director set it to dark music to make it seem sarcastic and sad... that is the definition of propaganda.Last but not least, towards the end of the documentary the music gets scarier and the Director then reveals something that to me speaks volumes about himself and OldWorld propagandists like him, he talks about how Obama doesn't want America to be the number one world super power and that it's somehow unAmerican to want to have the same amount of nuclear weapons than Russia(this man thinks we should always have more than everyone???).This is an extremely scary and nationalistic world view of a man telling you not to trust the world view of another man who is far more grounded on the topics of fear and reason. I mean to all you folks that have been moved by this mans presumptions as if his predictions are set in stone, let me ask you one question... don't you think it's kind of fishy that this dvd was released to the American public 3 weeks before election day? For someone who made a documentary about an American presidents foul agenda, you'd think he'd do a little better at hiding his own foul agenda! The propagandist directors glue just isn't sticky enough. No substance just presumptions.This is a film about a mans conspiracy theory about our President... the historic timeline is the only legitimate fact in this film. Everything else is theories, ideas and presumptions... Beware! Not Naive!Believing in this stuff is like believing that their was a missile attached to the bottom of one of the planes that hit the WTC?

Symons	"This is a thoughtful documentary that gives us a different thesis to explain President Obama's choices versus the typical, somewhat rabid, claims that he is a communist or a socialist.The strength of the film is that is presents a comprehensive portrait of Obama's background and roots in a way never before presented. If it has a weakness, it is that in the end the conclusions are essentially based on an essentially psychological evaluation of Obama, based on the opinions of those close to him or on those of people who have analyzed him from a conservative perspective.That said, the film maker makes a concerted, if at times thwarted, effort to get firsthand accounts, and provides secondhand accounts and expert opinions that deserve our consideration. He makes the point that Mr. Obama rose to power in a way no white man ever would have, riding the wave of American guilt over our past racial history.  (A statement which, I fully realize, cannot be said by a white person without drawing attributions of racism.) Indeed, Mr. Obama was virtually unexamined by the mainstream  media, even though he very likely, considering his associations, held views completely antithetical to the beliefs of most Americans.In the end, of course, we all make our decisions about political candidates based on our own observations and ""psychological analyses.""

It is well researchedand Dinesh D'Souza presents a fact-based, unemotional documentary of whoObama is, where he came from, what he stands for and where he will wouldthis country if reelected.  He uses Obama's own words from his book""Dreams From My Father"", which makes this film impossible to dispute.The media failed to vet this man that was plucked from obscurity toascend to the most powerful position in the world.  This documentarycorrects that failure.  There are no ""birther"" theories in this film andthe underlying message to the viewer is that Obama may have been bornin America, but he does NOT have American ideals and does NOT haveAmerica's best interest at heart.  Obama, in fact, despises America andfor all it has stood the past 236 years.  The past 6 years have not beenthe result of a well-meaning novice who's trying the best with what he""inherited"" from his predecessor, but rather a carefully blue-printedand executed plan to change this country from a super power to a nationequal to any in the third world."	5.0	The Truth About Obama is FRIGHTENING!	2014-06-24	7	5	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3M4OJZ3W1VUWJ	D. Alexander	2016 Obama's America is one of the most important movies produced for the election season. The facts are well-documented, often in Obama's voice from the audio version of his books. He is not an African American who is descended from slaves. He was raised in an upper-middle class home in Hawaii, and attended a private, exclusive, predominantly white high school. His education was paid for by his white grandparents, who were members of the Communist Party (this fact is not mentioned in the movie, but is easily found online). His mentors and friends were elitist radicals from his early teens. The movie shows that his values do not reflect those of most Americans.The writer and producer of this movie is not a wild-eyed right-winger. He is a naturalized immigrant. He he presents facts logically and clearly without the mass adulation that has accompanied Obama's campaign from the start.

A few reasons why:1) Maybe when he was young he spouted some so-called radical thoughts, but his actions SHOW that he is not at all radical. At every turn he has screwed normal and poor people and kissed the asses of the rich. (See the phony budget hearings of the summer of 2011.)2) To try to psychoanaylze him, as the rather stupid person who narrated this movie did, based on his supposed relationship with his Dad is at best vague guesswork.Movie was a joke and made by people with racist agendas. Pretty dumb since there are many things that Obama can be ripped apart on (like his phony Gulf swim in an unconnected Florida--St. Andrews Bay--waterway and saying that it was 'now safe to swim in the Gulf and eat its fish products'--this will make the medical bigwigs tens of billions of dollars at the expense of probably millions of people's lives who actually believe this).Can I give this product zero stars??!!	1.0	What a Wasted Piece of Junk	2012-12-24	10	2	8

The media seemingly was so enraptured with the thought of a half-black man as president, they did absolutely no research (or if they did, they kept their findings under wraps). I knew nothing about the man and I knew scant little about Islam and Muslims. I took it upon myself to read and obtain any and all documentaries about these subjects because I was suspicious of how Barack suddenly came into power and why so very many people didn't care one iota about his background or the horrifying aspects of Islam -- which is NOT a religion but actually a hideous ideology transformed by the self-appointed prophet, Muhammad. Now with Islam secretly being promoted by Obama, who himself is a Muslim (he said so himself) and his wish to make America a third-world Marxist-Socialist state, our nation and Republic and Consitution is being destroyed financed by billionaire liberal/progressives who want power for themselves. Nearly half of this country's citizens seem to worship the would-be king, Obama. It's fare beyond time to terminate his regime.	5.0	Americans BEWARE!	2014-04-22	3	2	1

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A37KR8FTWU3399	Dan L.	"The movie is billed as a documentary but based on D'Souza's book titled ""The Roots of Obama's Rage"".Interestingly, his video here:[...]talks about how Obama spent the first 17 years of his life living outside the US mainland.  He identifies superficially with that, saying that he is an immigrant who lived the first 17 years of his life in India.  So... that makes sense right?The harsh reality of the average american mindset is that foreigners are OK so long as they're not making decisions that affect the US.  Identifying Obama as someone who has his roots elsewhere is precisely what I believe constitutes fear mongering - it's like calling someone a communist or a nazi, it just doesn't add value to any discussion.  If it's true though, it panders, but hey, at least it is true.Then I did some digging - I didn't have to go far, Wikipedia has this information pretty easily accessible, though figuring out the timeline was a little more work.  How do those 17 years off the mainland add up?1961 - born in Hawai'i, moved to Seattle for a year (presumably returns to Hawai'i - I'm not 100% clear on this)1967 - moved to Indonesia1971 - moved back to Hawai'i1979 - graduated high school in Hawai'i, moved to Los Angeles for collegeSo, that's about 18 years.  FOUR of those years were spent outside the US.  Oh, wait - that's NOT what he said... He said ""outside of the mainland.  So - he's factually correct, because Hawai'i and Alaska are not a part of the lower 48!  Oh, my, what does that mean for Sarah Palin?  She's spent almost her entire life outside the mainland!What do you think about that?  Do you think it's fair game?  I think he plays on the fears (especially of birthers) of a president who was born in Hawai'i, and ""looks"" like a foreigner, has a funny name - then admits he's a foreigner as well, maybe reinforcing the foreigner issue seemingly trying to ""make it ok"" since he is a foreigner as well - but in reality he's trying to cement the foreigner issue in the minds of people who are listening.Also, on his page promoting his book:""""""In The Roots of Obama's Rage you'll learn:Why Obama's economic policies are actually designed to make America poorer compared to the rest of the worldWhy Obama will welcome a nuclear IranWhy Obama sees America as a rogue nation--worse than North KoreaThe real reason Obama banished a bust of Winston Churchill from the White House and ordered NASA to praise the scientific contributions of MuslimsWhy Obama would like to make America's superpower status a thing of the past""""""Call me a cynic - go ahead - but I am not really trusting he really figured out exactly why Obama did any of this - so I'm not going to learn these things, but rather I'll learn about what D'Souza is speculating about.Also from the book:""""""We are today living out the script for America and the world that was dreamt up not by Obama but by Obama's father. How do I know this? Because Obama says so himself. Reflect for a moment on the title of his book: it's not Dreams of My Father but rather Dreams from My Father. In other words, Obama is not writing a book about his father's dreams; he is writing a book about the dreams that he got from his father.Think about what this means. The most powerful country in the world is being governed according to the dreams of a Luo tribesman of the 1950s--a polygamist who abandoned his wives, drank himself into stupors, and bounced around on two iron legs (after his real legs had to be amputated because of a car crash caused by his drunk driving). This philandering, inebriated African socialist, who raged against the world for denying him the realization of his anti-colonial ambitions, is now setting the nation's agenda through the reincarnation of his dreams in his son. The son is the one who is making it happen, but the son is, as he candidly admits, only living out his father's dream. The invisible father provides the inspiration, and the son dutifully gets the job done. America today is being governed by a ghost.""""""I could write pages about what's wrong here, but I'll summarize:1) Obama in his book (presumably, I haven't read that either) talks about his heritage - the conclusion D'Souza draws about the title of the book might be a little bit too much (and by that, I mean he's off the deep end, and then he bases most of his arguments on this so-called fact).2) He insults Obama Sr. not as a man who was born in the 50s, but a man who *is* the 50s.  By that argument, I'm an old timer, stuck in the 70's, and you *are* the &lt;your decade of birth>s.  But the reality is that you're not a product of WWII or whatever, and I'm not a product of the Vietnam war.  It shapes us, sure, but really, that's another association that stretches really thin.3) A polygamist who abandoned his wives, drank himself into stupors, and bounced around on iron legs [because he's a drunk].  The first one could describe Newt Gingrich, and the drunken stupors could describe George W. Bush.  But D'Souza's pretty selective, he isn't talking about them - the problem is he isn't even talking about the president either!  By that association, my father's authoritarianism shapes me into an authoritarian, and his right-wing politics will make me a right winger as well.  Yup, that's about how well that works. :)4) He's talking about his father's dreams.  I can talk about my father's deems too - and my mother's.  My mom is a staunch left winger, and we disagree on many, many things.  Same with my dad.  Again, he's putting Obama in the same bucket as his father, who may or may not have the views that D'Souza's actually crediting him with. Then he tops it off by calling the president a puppet of his dead father.In the trailer for Obama 2016, he says: ""Obama has a dream.  A dream from his father.

That together we must perfect liberty, and America must grow, so Liberty grows.

In this case, D'Souza says you're either for a wonderful America or you're against it.  Who wants to be against that?That's the sort of fear mongering I'm talking about.  This movie isn't something that furthers rational political discourse in a time when we're really desperately needing it.  It puts together concepts using flawed logic to manipulate viewers and illicit knee-jerk reactions so that the political tide turns against Obama.Ok, I'm sure I could go on further, but I'll wrap up here because I'm starving.PS Does this mean that D'Souza, someone who was born in India, is *pro-colonialism*?"	1.0	Maybe people should actually READ OBAMA'S BOOK rather than take D'Souza's word as gospel, no?	2012-10-16	106	38	68
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AVDRR99H1EH6R	Dan Maynard	"As an undecided voter, I watched this movie in hopes of better educating myself to the agenda of each candidate.  Unfortunately, what I received instead was a blatantly biased propaganda film, which immaturely used dark and grainy film effects and dramatic music to try and make some of the interviews seem as if they were confirming a point that Obama ""wants to see America fail.""  In reality, the interviews of those who knew Obama and his family did not paint him as a extremist, or someone who hates America, which is what the filmmaker wants you to believe.  The interview of his half brother, who lives in Kenya is a case in point.  The filmmaker/ interviewer tries over and over to bait Obama's relative to speak negatively of Barack, but at least 4 or 5 times, the half brother says Barack is doing his job and that the brother has no issue with him.  The interviewer/ filmmaker likes to ask leading questions throughout the film, providing the answer he wants within each question.  This is especially true when he speaks to an old school teacher of Obama, ""Isn't it true that Barack is just acting out his father's own agenda?"" 80 year-old school teacher: Um... sure?  I suppose that could be true?If you are in the camp of right wing conservatives who would rather have a hot needle poked in their eye than vote for Obama, feel free to watch this as it is clearly meant to feed the ""he's a terrorist,"" conspiracy theory frenzy.  If you are undecided and like me, want to base your choice off of facts, proven track records and unbiased presentations, I do not recommend wasting your time with this film."	1.0	Propaganda - not at all scholarly or educational	2012-10-21	172	86	86

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	ASQ8KNNP3A7FP	"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete"""	"Obama supporters (e.g. the mainstream media) want you to believe that ""2016: Obama's America"" is a sensationalistic, white supremacist attack on President Barack Hussein Obama. It isn't. ""2016"" is a fact-based, artistically ambitious documentary, the product of an egghead intellectual, Dinesh D'Souza, who himself is a college president, and who is non-white, Indian-born, the grandson of an anti-white grandfather. D'Souza supports almost every point he makes with original material, including Obama's biography and onscreen experts, including Shelby Steele, the eloquent, African American scholar, George Obama, the president's Kenyan half-brother, Kenyan villagers who knew Obama Sr. intimately, and US Comptroller General David Walker.The film is shot in an artistically ambitious style, with lots of shaky camera work, off-center placement, explanatory animation, and depressing montages of garbage-strewn Kenyan, Indian, and Indonesian slums.In fact, for many viewers this documentary will be entirely too cerebral and level-headed. This is not Michael Moore. It's not funny, it's not shocking, and it's less manipulative than lots of other election-year material. D'Souza never exploits his subjects with the ruthlessness of a Michael Moore. I didn't laugh, I didn't gasp, and I didn't become outraged. I mostly compared what was being said to publicly available information on the subjects discussed and I found the film - dare one say it - reasonably responsible and informative. In fact, the film's one mistake may be that it does not talk down to viewers enough. Anti-colonial theory and action will be new to many viewers. Many will simply not know who Frantz Fanon is, for example, or even Shelby Steele. These scholars could have been introduced to the viewer more slowly, carefully, and thoroughly.Dinesh D'Souza was born in India, famous as the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of the British Empire. India was a hotbed of anti-colonial theorizing and activity. D'Souza inherited this from his grandfather. As such, he sees Barack Hussein Obama, Jr., through the lens of anti-colonialism. D'Souza supports this view of Obama with quotes from Obama's own work, interviews with people who know the Obama family, and scholars like Paul Kengor who has researched Obama's relationship with Frank Marshall Davis.D'Souza argues, using Obama's own words from his memoirs, that Obama wants to fulfill his father's dream of anti-colonial political and economic action. Rich, white, Western people need to be shaken down in order to even the score with poor people of color living in formerly colonized countries like Kenya and Indonesia, and poor, exploited people of color living in Western countries.Interestingly, the lack of economic soundness of this grudge-and-race-based politics is argued by George Obama, the president's half-brother. George makes a very interesting observation. Compare the ""Asian tiger"" countries to formerly colonized countries in Africa. South Korea used to be at the same economic level as Kenya. South Korea has been able to advance in a way that Kenya has not. Why is that, George asks? The unstated but implied answer: not just colonization is to blame for the poverty of some formerly colonized countries. Rather, cultural and economic differences also play a role. Rather than pursuing the kind of race-and-grudge based politics and economics that have destroyed Mugabe's Zimbabwe, exploited people could benefit from learning from countries like South Korea.The documentary veers into speculation toward the end, stating that President Obama wants to see the US in the debt crisis it faces now. That's the film's most outrageous speculation. As the Comptroller General explains, the debt crisis is very real. That Obama desires the debt crisis is mere speculation. The film also criticizes Obama for reducing nuclear warheads and NASA. Again, that Obama has taken these steps is fact. His motivation for doing so, as presented in the film, is mere speculation."	3.0	Fact Based and Artistically Ambitious	2012-09-04	133	75	58

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A236UEPCKIC6QC	Dave	This movie which was released during the run up to the presidential election, paints Obama as a radical anti-colonial, and anti-white.Even if that were true, and Obama wanted to change the fundamental guidlines of our goverment, Obama would have to convince the majority of the congress and senate to go along with him.The president does not have the authority to enact new laws without the consent of both houses.I really do not believe that Obama is anti-people, regardless of how they look, where they're from, who they love, or anything else.Maybe he believes there is a better way to run the country, a way that allows hard working good people to get ahead, and build a comfortable life for themselves. The way things were before the rich and greedy took control of the media.It is adolescent to suggest that he is part of some conspiracy to destroy our way of life, our freedoms, our ability to learn and grow and raise a family, and to someday be able to retire comfortably.It is the kind of fear mongering that we have come to expect from the kind of people who just don't get it. The kind who think that having the most expensive things is what proves their worth.What proves your worth is what's inside you, not what you wear.The way to keep life good for everyone is to allow them to be who they are, as long as they're peaceful, and to defend their right to have a happy life.It's all in the the U.S. Constitution. Our country's founding fathers had the concept right, but it has taken a very long time for most people to understand and embrace the concept.If any president would try to force people to change, it could result in war, because people want to change on their own, not be told to change.That's the reason we should not be pushing for change in any other country. They will resist as a matter of principal, even if they know the change is good.If people won't change for the good of others, then leave them to their own fate.Maybe they'll figure things out on their own.	3.0	The United States is not so easy to take.	2013-03-06	2	1	1
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3N7YXNPM17KV5	Dave	"""2012: Obama's America"" was created by an Indian Immigrant named Dinesh D'Souza. Dinesh is a conservative, Christian writer who was president of the Christian University, King's College in New York. He also served as a policy advisor for Reagan. He thinks colonialism is a good thing, and that all countries that have been exploited by colonialism simply weren't occupied long enough to be saved from their ignorant indigenous ways. His movie paints Obama as a communist as well as an anti-colonialist.Essentially, Dinesh claims that Obama's mother glorified and asserted his father's communist ideals onto Obama, and in order for Obama to reconcile his lost relationship with his father he had to fully and indiscriminately internalize all of his father's racist, communist anti-America and anti-colonialist ideals. His father was also a collectivist, who believed in socialist policy such as 100% taxes and strong government oversight. Dinesh goes on to purport that America only elected Obama because the white majority didn't want to feel racist, and that the only reason why Obama ever got as far as he did was because of white guilt, handouts and people projecting their own unfulfilled hopes onto him. He lists a couple of crazy people that Obama had associated with in the past, such as Frank Marshall Davis, Reverend Wright, Bill Ayres, and two others. He uses these five guys to justify Obama being a secret communist, who is out to destroy America by getting rid of all of our nuclear weapons and throwing us into total economic collapse.Everything in this film regarding Obama's personal family relations is speculation. Dinesh never gets to interview a single person from Obama's nuclear family, just one half brother and a friend of his father's who could barely speak English. Dinesh thinks he's also in the right position to make these assumptions about Obama because he's foreign, and roughly the same age as him. Turns out Dinesh's father was an executive for Johnson and Johnson over in India who was present much of his life, so any connection between him and Obama's past is unsubstantiated.Obama only met his father once, and personally, I find Dinesh's psychoanalytic assertions onto how Obama internalized his father's beliefs to be EXTREMELY offensive. I find it disgusting that Dinesh would assume Obama just absorbed everything he heard about his father's thoughts, and processed it all into some life-long agenda to destroy America. Obama's perception of his father was a human process, with many complex levels of conflict and resolution, and to try to spin that into an absolute explanation into why Obama is secretly a racist communist anti-American is just sickening. No facts within the whole thing. Just lots of Obama dialogue manipulated in a fashion to make it look like his daddy issues are somehow controlling his mind.Don't watch this movie unless you're looking for a flurry of assumptions claiming Obama to be a racist socialist thug out to take away your freedom and turn America into the world's biggest joke. I love the part at the end where he tries to say that Obama's trying to take away all our nukes and let everyone else have nuclear dominance over us, which is the most bizarre and ignorant claim of the whole film. We have been adhering to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for decades now, mutually reducing our nuclear arms at the same level as other countries. He also makes an absurd claim that we are doing ""nothing"" to stop Iran from gaining an nuclear weapon... It's not about America ""losing"", it's about global peace and balance of power. War is not the only solutionThis Dinesh guy is smart though. His movie is making big bucks, and will likely rally more hate and bias against the president. This is easy to do with political rhetoric as tense as it is with the coming election. Dinesh did a bang-up job exploiting the current climate for maximum profit. This movie will surely energize isolated conservative subgroups who already have xenophobic suspicions about Obama, fueling the conspiracy cult that's existed since the 2008 election. It's saddening though, because this kind of speculation is hurtful to America. In an era where truth, compromise and cooperation are so hard to find, people continually push this garbage out, exacerbating our country's inability to collaborate and solve important issues together. Instead we get crap like this that makes millions of dollars and stratifies our country into two disgruntled sects. This man will make great profits from his artful piece of propaganda, but America will continue to bleed, as hate and prejudice stifle America's ability to unify and progress."	2.0	Good Cinematography, Too Presumptuous	2012-10-19	9	7	2

I heard about this movie and caught some of Dinesh D Souza's interviews and eventually saw the movie. While most of it covered what I already knew from my own research he put it together nicely and made it easy to follow.When there is so much love and hate for a person with extreme passion on both sides you need to find out.When the man speaks he says the right things to make you believe he is one of ""us"" or US. But then you see what he is doing with Israel (why Jews vote Democrat, Ill never understand), how he is propping up known enemies to the US. Libya, Eqypt, Iran. Why do Americans think this is ""normal"". Bowing to other countries, apologizing before any ""real"" truth is know.This country is the best in the world (not perfect) but we are always will to help other countries, whether it's boots on the ground or food and water shipments post natural disaster. Where is it in history that a country as young as ours is has risen so fast in such a short time, no where.For 60 years Democrats, Liberals, Progressives (whatever they are using for a name now) have tried to find a way to make us like the rest of the world. I am not sure why when then can live in other parts of the world and test out socialism, communism, facism etc.Now they propped up a man that came our of no where, got him in the White House (thanks media).

How can a man claim to be both Christian and Islamic? According to Jeremiah Wright on TV, Obama can? Would Jesus agree? No, not in my mind. Yet, in the White house there is an appearance of Islamic life. From the press, for example, no jewelry is seen on his body during Ramadan, an Islamic demand. How can a man uphold the Koran and Marx together? Marx would be outraged and insulted most likely.At the end of the film, after all the commentary from his family and familiars, a strangely bizarre and different man emerges far distant from any cultural identity in the US. While the press often complains of his deceit, they overlook the concept in Islam ""hudnah"" that encourages and demands deceit to the infidel (you and me), as stated in the Koran."	5.0	Is it possible to understand Barry Obama?	2014-01-09	5	3	2

What this means is, if there is no middle class, there is no one to sell to, which is why GDP was higher during the Golden age than any other period in history.

Obama and Eric Holder will never find anyone to charge for the felonies committed by his IRS who persecuted and released confidential information on Conservative groups opposing Obama during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.  Obama will never find anyone responsible for the lives lost at Benghazi but he will persecute every opponent.This film explains why.Watch it to understand.	5.0	And now Obama seeks to punish D'Souza for daring to expose him	2014-01-30	6	5	1

Allen	"""2016: Obama's America"" (2012) Not Likely To Hurt President Obama's Re-Election Chances At All....Lightweight (But Interesting) Stuff!,August 28, 2012 -- Lancaster, Pennsylvania USA (Lancaster County PA)""2016: Obama's America"" (2012) created and starring Dinesh D'Souza is styled as an ""anti-Obama"" movie, but it seems unlikely to change minds or be ranked as brilliant documentary political cinema (it has many good points and I recommend seeing it, anyway!).I went to the 12:30 PM early afternoon show at Lancaster City PA's largest movie complex (the Regal Cinema 16 complex), and the large theater was filled with senior citizens, probably mostly Republicans (Lancaster County PA and South Central PA near Harrisburg PA are traditionally Republican and conservative political areas.....likely not many Obama supporters were in the audience).The movie presented isn't likely to change Mr. Obama's very good chances for being re-elected USA President in November 2012. It was interesting, but not likely to change the minds of fence sitters.Here's my report:----------------I just returned from 2016: Obama's America (2012) written, narrated, and starring Dinesh D'Sousa doing a right wing version of Michael Moore's Farenheit 911 (2004) written, narrated, and starring Michael Moore.Michael Moore's 2004 ""Fahrenheit 911"" movie was released the summer before the 2004 election Bush II won anyway (as Obama will likely win again in Nov. 2012 in the tradition of incumbent USA Presidents not plagued by major scandal or a divisive 3rd party candidate which changes the election....Ross Perot in '92 was the last of those...the guy who put Bill Clinton in the White House by dividing the Conservative vote.....one could argue that Ralph Nadar gave the election to Bush II in 2000 since Nadar votes would have gone to Gore, and the tiny margin Gore needed to beat bush would have come to him...one could argue Nadar was another 3rd party candidate pest .....).The movie 2016: Obama's America (2012) was interesting and an important piece of political documentary cinema.......I'm glad I went.D'Souza's mudslinging at Obama and ""guilt by association"" efforts seemed unpersuasive and unimpressive, and Obama came out OK, I thought.Very interesting personal background stuff about Obama I didn't know, and a brief interview with Obama's half-brother in Kenya named ""George Obama"" who has true movie star qualities, as Obama does himself.Obama looks and sounds good in front of a camera! Every moment Obama was shown on the screen was a moment which defeated D'Souza's effort to trivialize, defame, and criticize him.He's the biggest movie star President in looks and demeanor (""star quality"" guy) since Kennedy and Reagan, and unlike Reagan, he's young and handsome......has a movie star's weight control!Slick movie in some ways, and to my thinking, interesting in all ways. I recommend it. Food for thought.The genre of ""opponent"" movie presented the summer an incumbent USA President runs for office a second time could become a permanent thing, and Moore and D'Souza set standards and imitate each other in interesting ways.What they avoid is almost as interesting as what they present! The oversimplification and trivialization of the USA Presidential selection and performance process is almost comic.....movie house owners won't lose a moment's sleep worrying they will get in trouble showing these movies! The money flows in, and the ""message"" of defamation is forgotten quickly.....everybody's happy at the end, eh?----------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG movie actor.See WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for details about Tex Allen, his movie credits and his biog.Email Tex Allen at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com"	2.0	"""2016: Obama's America"" (2012) Not Likely To Hurt President Obama's Re-Election Chances At All....Lightweight (But Interesting)"	2012-10-28	18	4	14

Does this mean I will blindly vote for Obama in 2012 because I fit a certain demographic--no.  Does this film change my opinion--no.  However, I am baffled by the blind support for Obama.  The support does not make sense unless it is a purely emotional response, not a rational response.  I listened to the stump speeches and the debates in 2008 and I asked myself a fundamental question ""where's the math for what you intend?""  Today I ask the same question because the math does not add up financially, politically or morally.  Whether you agree or disagree with Dinesh D'Souza this film raises powerful questions about the man we call President and whether he should be reelected.  In my humble opinion it seems that we as the people of the United States of America are so focused on single issues that we fail to recognize the broader picture.  For example, seniors are worried about Medicare, gays are worried about gay rights, the religious community is worried about religious freedom and families are worried about jobs, but what about the big picture?  Do Obama's policies protect our civil liberties, the right to pursue the American dream, our national security interests or our standing in the world?

Any one with sense who saw this and voted for Obama....didn't.Tells the truth about who Obama is and where he came from. How he was mentored in his teens by an avowed  Communist Pornographer. Why he truly hates America's success.They left out the part where Obama, in a Radio Interview long before his election, said he would allow people to make COAL powered energy plants. But he would change the rules so they went out of business.

Where is the film's integrity to truth? This seems like a tool to seperate people by making them dislike the ""other side"" - it seems to engender fanatical thinking.This great country was founded on clear, critical, independent thinking with a striving for what is right and good for all involved.

The most terrifying part of the film is where he's slowly declining our armed forces while other countries are developing and have no inclination of declining their arsenal. I think Obama is a very charismatic man. A man who can easily convince people with his easy going personality.

However, it draws the wrong conclusions about the influence the Obama family had on his life.  His mother, his grandparents and his mentors (Frank M. Davis) were all commited communists who spent a great deal of time imparting their ideology on ""little Barry"".  Whatever his longing to know his ""biological' father, his real family had much more influence on him.  The book ""Dreams of my Father"", is nothing more than political theater to give the president ""cover"" for his real upbringing.  Any conclusions drawn from it are suspect.  So, movie four stars, conclusions two stars.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1LKQ81O0BP49Q	Dr. Miguel Faria	"The observant reviewers -- who have pointed out the inconsistency of so many trashy one star review ratings about a well-done, artistic, thoroughly documented documentary - show that man can be an unfair, political animal. In the case of the background and performance of President Barack Obama, the unfairness has been taken to extremes by his apologists. Frankly, these ""reviewers"" have not been intellectually honest and have given bad ratings to a masterful documentary they could not have seen, or if they have, they plainly rated it dishonestly. And that is a shame!We can disagree about the ultimate political bent of the film, but not about the documentation of hard, cold facts that can be checked out plainly by those who do not fear facing cold reality. The documentary is in fact very fair to Obama - revealing but not shocking, informing while entertaining. It may be too cerebral for some who have become too used to the Jerry Springer-type of sensationalism or Rousseauian emotionalism. But some intellectual challenge is occasionally needed for something as serious as a presidential contest approaching and an incumbent president who despite a mediocre performance, has been sheltered and shielded by the American press and media.Because of the political polarization of this documentary, this film will be most helpful to those who consider themselves centrists and independents. It is an essential film for those who are still undecided. As I have noted, Democrats are panning these movies not only for what it reveals, but for what they think it reveals. Many Republicans do not think this movie goes far enough in exposing all the revelations, but have nevertheless given it the commendable good ratings it deserves.And because detractors of President Obama have been unfairly labeled in some cases ""Neanderthals"" or racists by partisan Democrats, it should be noted the executive producer, co-director, and co-writer of this film is Dinesh D'Souza, not an ""angry white male,"" but an Indian-born intellectual, an eminent college president.Mr. Dinesh D'Souza and associates should be commended for carrying out a masterful piece of investigative journalism and producing an exemplary documentary, doing the homework that should have been performed by the mainstream media at least since to 2008 and which the American press still refuses to carry out, even as we approach the momentous November 2012 Presidential U.S.elections.Dr. Miguel A.

Unfortunately, the U.S. news media is toothless and unable to produce such an tremendous investigative piece like this film because of partisanship. The writing has been on the wall, but many choose not to read it. Whether they view this film or not. I am sure that future historians will rank Obama as the nation's worst president. A two-term disaster. American patriots will be regretting his two elections for decades to come.

This ""documentary"" contains nothing new. The American right-wingnuts have made a cottage industry out of this kind of crap. Dinesh D'Souza is a true believer who has constructed a slick, yet ultimately empty package. All of his ""facts"" are still as groundless as they were when his printed version was repeatedly proven to be a work of bad fiction. This ""documentary"" is based on his book ""The Roots of Obama's Rage"", which was dismissed by both sides of the political spectrum. The Weekly Standard condemned his ""absence of evidence"" and The American Conservative called his assertions ""ridiculous"".(Google it...you'll be stunned.)

Woods ""skyfish"""	D'Souza is a professed Christian writer who was recently fired from his position at an evangelical college because he shared a room with a woman he called his fiancee at a Christian conference while still married. His account of Obama's life, both book and film, have been debunked by a great many fact-checkers, which is why this review is accompanied by a single star. Readers of his book and viewers of his film should look at the fact-checking of his content along with their examination of D'Souza's work.  D'Souza's works are more revelatory of his mindset and that of those in agreement with him than of his subject, Obama. For that reason alone, his book is worthwhile as a sociological study of a man willing to risk his professional reputation under the scrutiny of factcheckers and wanting to participate in, and enjoy the respect of, a culture whose rules he was willing to break.	1.0	Fact-checkers debunk D'Souza's Obama account	2012-10-31	39	15	24

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AYG1U47VFZ165	"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)"""	"Predicting the future can be a fuzzy business.  Literally, there are dozens (if not hundreds) of variables that come into play.  Predicting the future of a nation?  Well, that's a whole different game altogether, because of the very nature of prognostication.  See, it's all nebulous.  It's all elusive.  Despite the best intentions, there's no effective way to know what tomorrow will look like.  All we can do is what documentary filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza suggests: get to know the person pulling the strings, and, once you understand what makes him (or her) tick, then you can project some reasonable short- and long-term decisions that he (or she) will make.  No, you can't know anything for certain - that is, not until time travel becomes a reality - but you can offer a learned guess, and the best learned guesses could and should be considered by both leaders and followers at large.On the eve of America's next national election, I thought I'd sit down, watch, and respond to something political, so 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA fit the bill perfectly.In short, a look back isn't always the best way to see forward.  Granted, knowing what events have transpired from history serves as the best predictor of future behaviors, but, where politicians are concerned, I think in this day and age it's become increasingly difficult to say who will decide what, when, where, how, and why.  Washington influences - mostly driven by money - always appear to be in flux, certainly from those of us sitting on the sidelines or on the outside.  What one politician says today is usually only to assuage or influence voters to go to the polls and cast a ballot, nothing more, nothing less.  Once political cycles come to a close, THEN the real business of governance and leadership takes place, and Barack Obama - whether he likes it or not - has left a bit of a dubious legacy.  I say this not as a Conservative or a Progressive but as a realist.""Hope"" and ""change"" have no specific meaning other than what the dictionary underscores, and that's why his ascendancy to the American `throne' (my words, not his or D'Souza's) was a heavily calculated move.  In fact, I'd imagine that if you went from person-to-person in a crowded room, you'd be hard pressed to show consensus around whatever they interpreted would come to pass from any of Obama's speeches.  An accomplished speaker, his focus appears entirely inspirational; he lacks specificity to that point that a realist like myself would want ... but, in fairness, ALL politicians do.  That's because they, largely, answer to the `money' and NOT to the `people.'  Any one of them says a wrong word, and their backers then find someone else to do their bidding.  (Again, maybe that's me, but I've yet to meet a politician I'd fully trust to do ANYTHING other than run for office.  Call me a cynic.  I'm comfy with the title.)All I can say after viewing 2016 is that writer/director D'Souza has achieved what any essayist would hope: he's presented a theory, he's backed it up with facts, and he's leaving the audience to make up their minds.As a result, it's hard for me to sink my teeth into all that much that's presented here.  That isn't because I disagree with it; rather, as I've tried to make clear, it's only a working theory.  So little of the picture deals with what America in 2016 would effectively look like beyond the theory.  There's no way to know, but it's all presented with as much pomp and circumstance required.  It's put together quite well.  It raises solid concerns.  And it's all done solely to make you - the viewer - think about it.  That was achieved.If anything, I guess I was left wanting to know more.  I believe I understand perfectly well where D'Souza's coming from - even he appears to underscore to viewers that much of what he's explored is only T-H-E-O-R-Y and that it's entirely based on his pursuit and understanding of the facts.  Despite what many in the mainstream press would tell you, questions persist in the background and ideology of Barack Obama.  From what I've watched of him, he rarely answers anything in the definitive, and, until such a time as a journalist enters the scene who can effectively get a politician to that point, then we're all left with theories.  Dismiss D'Souza or embrace his ideas - much like Obama's followers or detractors do the President - but he makes a cogent argument for accepting that Barack doesn't much care for the country he leads.Is that Obama truly feels?Go ask him, but remember: above all things, Obama's a politician, and no politician's word is golden until AFTER the election.2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA is produced by Obama's America Foundation.  Theatrical and DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  Video quality is very solid, though there are a few moments when I wasn't quite certain what I was looking at; much of this is due to the nature of documentary filmmaking - meaning some folks didn't want the camera to be on them while they were speaking and/or dismissing the filmmaker.  Honestly, I had some minor problems with audio quality; D'Souza narrates some portions of the film - those were largely okay - but there are a few sequences where I suspect a sub-par microphone was being used, and I found it a noticeable drop in quality.  It's a small quibble, but it's an honest one.  There are no special features, but, with documentaries, there really isn't that much call for them, either.RECOMMENDED.  By its very nature, I'm not sure that 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA will win any converts, though I'd encourage folks from any point in the political spectrum to watch it.  Best-selling author Dinesh D'Souza presents a theory surrounding Barack Hussein Obama - the modern man who would be king - whereas others (supporters and detractors) largely present their own respective biases.  Then, D'Souza goes about presenting the evidence supporting his theory.  While it's a convincing package, I think it'll remain a bit elusive until the facts - the cold hard facts of Obama's ideology - are fully exposed.  Then, audiences won't have to deal in theory; instead, they'll be able to make up their own minds - rightly or wrongly - on the reality of today's most loved and most hated politician.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with a DVD screener of 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."	3.0	2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA Ain't Political, Folks, So Calm Down ...

The creator of this film is so desperate to find something negative about President Obama that he becomes a sniveling weasel in his investigation. He despairingly tries to link ANYTHING, including the dirt on the ground around Obama's fathers tomb, to be a ""gotcha"" piece of evidence for his F'd up imagination and hatred towards the POTUS. How any sane person could believe in this hoax is baffling. Bigotry will be the fall of Conservatives for allowing the Tea Party to take them to hell. People who admire this propaganda BS are the lowest America has to offer. People, because Obama is black...if this President had ANY thing wrong about him the CIA, FBI, House, Senate, and every other important institution that matters, would have found it in 2008. They did not and that is why he was on that ballot.

I am an immigrant from Former Soviet Union I can see where O...a is going...but before seeing the movie I thought he is just a narcissistic change-maker with oversized ego and now I know why...I have degree in psychology and this is really really true...there is no tree without  roots, there is no fire without  smoke...Obama does not have roots in America and he has a lot of wealth not to think about gas prices or food prices or electricity prices he has it all covered...he can allow himself to think about HIS WORTH and HIS  IDEALS...he is not a friend of poor or black or Muslim or Christian or women or worrier or ...anybody. He has his personal agenda his personal achievement in this life...i would not be surprised if he secretly adores Adolf Hitler. He is all about his magnificence .  I  personally think that he was surprised when he got elected President because I thought his real card was to not to be elected and play the race card after. That is why he is incompetent and lazy president and not interested in bringing up the high values of America because he never was trying to be a president of USA, but he wanted to be a great revolutionist. He wanted to destroy America from outside but then he suddenly got elected president and his plans changed a little he decided to destroy America from inside...But in reality he is not as smart as he thinks he is..he is a failure...and hopefully leave the white house in 24 days.. .According to psychologists Lenin started whole revolution in Russia just because he had never forgave the czar for killing his older brother  Alexander and Lenin vowed  for revenge and...just in time he was supported and subsidized by Germans.	5.0	Very True	2012-10-13	125	90	35

It didn't seem to have that quality of research, detachment, or profoundity.  Still, i'm glad I saw it, and didn't find it Anti-Obama as some had claimed it to be. The author / narrator of the movie was pursuing the details of &#34;where Obama is coming from&#34;...and concludes that he is not socialist or communist, but also not capitalist, rather an anti-colonialist, in his identifying with the man he supposed his missing father to be. I was glad to learn of the social and psychological forces that may have contributed to shaping obama's politics.

Barrack's speeches were extremely moving. 4 years later, they seem to be empty speeches. Both  of my sister in laws have been laid off. My older sister can't find work even though she's been trying to get a job for 2 years. My pay has been cut by 30 percent. I owe $65,000. More on my house than it's actually worth. I'm paying twice as much for gas since Barrack took office. My 75 year old mother is worried because her doctor told her when Obamacare is fully implemented in January 2013,  he will probably not be allowed to see her as often due to cuts in Madicare mandated by Obamacare.  This is disturbing since she has an extremely serious illness and needs good care.We gave this man over 800 billion dollars in tax-payer dollars to help stimulate the economy.IT DID NOT WORK.

I bought this DVD thinking it would make me irate, because of all the negative things I had heard about him. It did not. It made me very frightened and anxious.I highly reccomend this DVD, as it is more a biopic than a political statement. Like many of you, Obama seemed to come on the scene from out of nowhere, and we as a country didn't know a whole lot about him. This story starts with Obama at an early age, all the way up to his presidency.Whether you voted for him or not, either time, I think you'll find this informative, and enlightening. I surely did.

Every so often I'll turn on Fox News or watch a documentary by a far right pundit just to see how the other half lives.  Most of the time I regret it and can't seem to stomach their foolishness and lies for very long, but with this film I didn't walk away with that reaction.  I did so much laughing that I contemplated giving Dinesh D'Souza's film 2 stars for its entertainment value.  I actually took notes throughout the film, but when I realized how much time I was giving to it, I stopped.There are three important facts that D'Souza either gets wrong, distorts or outright lies about in his film.  The first being the lack of familiarity of Obama's extended Kenyan relatives to him.  ** Fact:  Barack  Obama was raised by his white, American, Midwestern mother and his white, American, Midwestern grandparents. **Just about every bit of social science, psych literature that has been published since Freud has established that the people who are the most influential in shaping character and personality in someone's life are the people who RAISED him/her (e.g. biological parents, step-parents, grandparents, foster parents, Auntie Em, Uncle Jesse, mom's boyfriend, dad's girlfriend... whatever - lol).  Obama Sr. kept in touch with his son... over the phone... half way around the world... how many times?  Oh, yeah - there's some really deep parenting going on there (not).  President Obama's ""long lost brother,"" who D'Souza tracks down and harasses, met him how many times?  I'm pretty sure the film gives the impression he met him once when he was a kid, but for the sake of trying to be somewhat complimentary, let's just say he met President Obama 5 times - lol.  Unless these two have been palling around their whole lives and hanging out, they don't know each other.  This could be said for all of President O's Kenyan relatives and their assorted friends - they don't really know him other than to say hi, how ya doing, the weather is fine over here and I like your hair do, obviously.  As for President O reaching out to them, he's trying to understand part of his heritage.  What reasonably thinking, self-aware person wouldn't do that?  People with Irish, Italian, German, Greek, English, and Scottish DNA (etc.) do it all the time.  So if a Black person does it, there's a problem?  Come on.The second piece of distorted info in this film would be the constant barrage of communist labeling attributed to President Obama.  Obama is not a communist.  If he were, he'd be a card carrying member of the Communist Party.  He is not.  And as for his more left leaning professors and associates, having been born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts myself (he went to school at both Harvard in Cambridge, MA and Columbia in New York, NY), I can say the more politically and socially left leaning way of thinking is normal in that part of the country (hence most Republicans in much of the North East being centrist... Remember Mitt Romney's liberal governorship in Massachusetts?).  Also, in regards to Obama's well rounded college education,  it is not uncommon for college students to be exposed to varying forms of knowledge.  That's why people attend college in the first place (cough).  What college worth their weight in salt would teach only American style capitalism when world history is full of other forms of economic systems?  How dumb do some of you want Americans to be?  While the rest of the civilized world learns a well-rounded array of information about our collective world economic history, we'll elect a dunce who doesn't understand the global community or anything else except greedy, immoral, unregulated capitalism then sit back and watch the train wreck happen.  Oh wait... that already happened... under Dubbya...  Some folks are left leaning and some are right leaning.  If you're left leaning it doesn't automatically make you a communist.Finally, the notion that Obama was elected president simply because of white guilt (asserted by Shelby Steele in the film and by D'Souza indirectly) is funny considering that he lost the white vote.  Yes, I'll repeat that:  President Barack Obama lost the white vote in the 2008 presidential election.  The only two large groups of people who voted for Barack Obama out of the white vote were single, professional white women and white college students (or college age).  Looks like this time around for the 2012 election, that trend will continue - lol.  Barack Obama was in the right place at the right time in history.  He was a fresh face who arrived on the scene with grand ideas, smarts and an authentic, energetic style.  After coming out of 8 disastrous years that saw us weather the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 2 major wars in the middle east (one of which was unnecessary) and the worst financial situation since the Great Depression (all of which were brought on by the Bush Administration), the majority of Americans were in no mood for the establishment (John McCain or Hillary Clinton).  Had the country not been through the above mentioned, I doubt HIGHLY that Barack H. Obama would have been elected president.  The country was weary and needed someone new.""2016 Obama's America"" is ridiculous.  Dinesh D'Souza is literally scrounging for any piece of information he can stretch to scare the ignorant public.  The 5 star reviews for this film almost make me think they are either phantom reviews or friends of Dinesh doing him a favor - lol - because otherwise it is a sad commentary to think that someone would look at this movie and see either fact or importance in it.It cost me $3.99 to rent this film on Amazon, which is about the cost of a medium ice cream sundae at my local ice cream shop.  In reflection, I now see where I made my mistake..."	1.0	1 star for at least establishing Obama born in U.S. - LOL	2012-10-26	92	43	49

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AVUP3E9ELT33O	"Frederick J. Harrison ""Fred Harrison"""	There is so much about Obama that defies logical explanation. Obama's knowledge of economics, for example seems to be at the level of illiteracy. Somehow, he was imbued with Keynesian economics and socialist thought that is at an extraordinarily rudimentary level. Obama's economic policies have been and remain destructive to the national economy.Then there is his conduct of foreign policy which has absolutely no logical explanation for most of what he does.For example, why did he make such an ostentatious effort to insult the British over the bust of Winston Churchill? Why not put it someplace where he did not have to look at it instead of being so upfront insulting? It is a little thing, but a very telling thing.Obama's anti-colonial roots may be the best explanation. Somewhere in the recesses of a rejected little boy, we now have an adult vendetta that threatens the survival of the nation.The only interest that Obama has in running the nation, is his outstanding ability to campaign for the job. Doing the job he is absolutely terrible. In fact, he is worse than terrible he is destructive e.g. health care reform.In a real sense, Obama is much more a prisoner of his past than someone like Churchill. Churchill was not a crippled human being that could not learn to do things differently if necessary to his success. Obama appears to be just that; a crippled human being that does not understand himself and does not understand the place of the country in the scheme of the world that he governs.Obama is in reality the most dangerous man imaginable to the future of America. What he will do when unfettered by reelection campaigning is utterly frightening. What is even worse, we are doing it to ourselves by electing such a person.

My family did not vote for him, but we honor the position of the Presidency appropriately...regardless.Having said that, you might think from what you've heard about this documentary that it's a harsh and unmerited reputation basher....IT'S NOT.  The researcher in this film takes a different approach to explain the various drive and actions of this current Administration (Obama's).  Every person has influences in their lives, and our current President is very verbal about his....he even wrote a book about himself showing these influences.Learn more about your president, and why things are they way they are today.  All of America's problems are NOT Obama's by any means...you can go back several Presidential terms and see the major changes (towards the negative in my opinion) taking place in this country....with it's leaders and with the hearts of the majority of people.  From the 1950's forward, we began to take a certain direction for sure, and one that hasn't contributed to the &#34;greatness&#34; of the country.  So realizing not all &#34;blame&#34; is to be put at President Obama's feet is necessary.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1GCXC0YGMTN55	Freelancer	"This movie is complete fiction, but it's red meat for the conservatives out there that live in the bubble where their strawman President Obama is a secret Muslim that wants to remake America into a socialist country, complete with death panels and the taking of ""god"" off our currency. The premise of the movie is that Obama is trying to remake America in his own image based on some sort of subliminal rage he holds for conservativism and capitalism (something he supposedly got from his father, who he knew for all of two minutes of his life when he met him once he he was 10). Dinesh D'Souza never interviewed Obama nor has he ever met him... but he claims like him, we don't really know him... because if you look REALLY close with Republican bubble glasses there's so many examples of his anti-American rage in action. He gets most of his information from Obama's books to claim that Obama is channeling an agenda based on anti-colonial, anti-capitalist ideals (because of course, what better way to espouse anti-capitalistic ideas than to write NYtimes best selling novels). This interpretation belies the facts that Obama bailed out the Auto industry (pro capitalist move), bailed out Wall Street (pro-capitalist, pro status quo move) and compromised heavily on healthcare reform by including popular Republican principles in the bill (mandate). Nevermind that healthcare reform is something both Democrats AND Republicans Eisenhower and Nixon tried and failed to accomplish. D'Souza goes after Obamacare as proof that Obama hates America. The ""proof"" he offers up is the ""fact"" that not one Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act. While true, D'Souza claims erroneously that Obamacare got no Republican votes because it is some fanatical piece of left wing social engineering. In fact, most of the plan espouses Republican ideas (formerly) such as the mandate to buy healthcare (Republican idea from the Heritage foundation that was formerly supported by Orin Hatch and Chuck Grassley). It also leaves out the other little factoid that the Republican leadership are on record saying that their goal was to make Obama a one term president and not vote for anything he proposes. But, why let the facts get in the way of a good old fashioned conservative story!? 99% of the people who will watch this filth already hate Obama.

The theater was packed. Everyone was silent -- you could hear a pin drop throughout the entire file -- until the end and it got a standing ovations. That was something I had never seen at a movie.The content was extremely well documented. It's not just some right-wing attack on Obama.

If it frightens you, maybe it should. That is not the mark of propaganda, this is a window presented to you which you may choose to look through and choose to complete the picture in your own mind. This is free information and theory for you to dissect at your choosing. I found the documentary powerful, not something that just reconfirms conservatives disdain for the president but shows everyone, from every political standpoint something that we probably didn't know and maybe should put some thought into.

The movie seemed more about D'Souza and how smart he thinks he is for coming up with this Anti-colonialism comparison to the way Obama makes decisions.  Right or not, the movie didn't tell me anything that would make a difference in my opinion of Obama, or any other american politician, democrat or not...He makes these comparisons based on small random snippets from people that have little personal relationship to Obama, they could all be out of context just to satisfy D'Souza's point, or it could be right-on.  However, he doesn't really provide any conclusive evidence, or use any actual examples of Obama's policies while in the White House as they pertain to his theory.It was an interesting look at trying to fit Obama's strategy to some kind of model, from D'Souza who paints himself as somewhat of an (american) outsider.  It just felt like more of a fun exercise in political/philosophical thought using hyperbole throughout the movie, than actually telling us anything about the current President of the United States.	1.0	This movie is about everything BUT Obama...	2012-10-22	68	21	47
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AES6XV4MXKLPL	Garry E. Malone	&#34;2016&#34; is an excellent, well-researched documentary on Obama. This film takes you from the very important early life journey of Barry Soetoro to his college years as a foreign student before he became Barrack Hussein Obama.  Obviously, from his many early childhood years in distant countries, he did not have any sense of being an American.  Much is explained to understand his lack of protocol and sound judgement. This certainly is thought-provoking and makes anyone question on how in heck any rational thinking voter would cast a ballot for him.	5.0	2016 Obama's America, a superb documentary, way over-due!	2012-11-19	5	2	3
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2NY7C72U8WQAY	Gary A. Thurlow	Although the film may be an eye-opener for some people, I found it to be superficial.  It barely scratched the surface of the criminal behavior of the current administration, from the treasure trove of sealed documents related to the President's citizenship status to the official reaction to the Fast and Furious debacle.  Almost everything controversial or questionable was skipped by the author aside from the well known position of the President on the &#34;Dreams from my Father&#34;.To properly cover the prospects for America by the year 2016, all of the questionable relationships of the President should have been explored, evaluated, and exposed.  It seems that the President has been able to get away with spouting some feel-good hope & change message in which the President promised to fundamentally change America.  Of course, he never told us what WOULD change in his vision of an emasculated America, but his association - for virtually all of his life - with known radicals and America haters should have given the author more grist for the mill.I don't think I am much different than my neighbors or my fellow citizens, so I wonder how so many people can ignore the reality of the President's plans.At best, this video offered only one tiny bit of the evidence that explains the plans, beliefs, and policy actions of this president.  For someone who just awoke from a 5 year coma, this video my have helped in a small way to enlighten them.  For the &#34;believers&#34; in the magical President, nothing will change.  They are permanently blind to a factual recitation of the hidden agenda of their messiah.  One thing that can be said for them is that they're consistent in their ignorance and naive in their thinking.  For the remainder of the country, I would like to think that we already knew much more about the President and his policies than this video explored.	3.0	Not Enough Detail	2012-11-13	2	0	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2CM5EE741N9AM	Gary Stradling	"Thoughts about ""Obama's America-2016"" (on Amazon Instant Video for $4). We expected it to be political and partisan, but it was more thoughtful and measured than we expected. Certainly it was not a hatchet job, or an expose' as many partisan presentations seem to be. The movie discussed Barack Obama's origin, history, training, academic work, mentors, guides, and friends, and his world view and philosophy. It relied heavily on Obama's own writings, especially ""Dreams from my Father"", which it quoted heavily and at length (not just snippets out of context).Dinesh D'Souza, the film maker, took the discussion from his own perspective as a third world emigre to the US, and explored the experience of someone who grew up in the post-colonial world. The impact of western colonization on the diverse and now independent countries of Africa and Asia is viewed in various ways, and he explored the anti-Western/anti-colonial/anti-neocolonial view in which Obama was raised, which was held by a variety of articulate and influential mentors to Obama, beginning with his father. This anti-Western view argues that the influence of Western culture on their colonies around the world has been exclusively negative, enslaving the people, stealing their resources, suppressing their growth, destroying their cultures. D'Souza articulates, thru many quotes, interviews, and site visits to Kenya, Indonesia, and Hawaii, the anti-American culture embraced by his father, his mother, and the coterie of friends teachers and mentors who influenced him.This is thought provoking. It is hard to argue that there have not been many shameful exploitations of the poor and less powerful countries of the world by the rich nations, including the kidnapping and enslavement of many of African race to  western plantations, but I think there is a much deeper and richer story. There is another view, that absent the interaction of the West, that Africa and Asia would be undeveloped and un-educated even today.Alex Haley, celebrated author of ""Roots"", exploring the genealogy of his enslaved forbearers, points out after visiting his ancestral villages in Africa, how fortunate he felt to be raised in America and not there, in spite of the sufferings of his forbearers.Throughout history, as great societies ebb and flow, they fertilize and stimulate the nations around them in the process of expanding their influence. How harsh and cruel seems to reflect the cultures of the imperialist nations. The Western colonization on the 1600-1800s was not the ravages of the Huns, the burnings of the Vikings, or the Ottomans, or Ghengis Kahn, Nebuchannezer, or Alexander the Great, or the Romans. There were no pyramids of skulls or systematized rape of the conquered women; no general transportation of the people to exile, though I am sure that there were instances of these kinds of treatment.THis colonization certainly stirred the nations up, spread Western influence, and stimulated education, industry, and commerce. The now-independent colonies have a chance to move forward in the direction they want. So I am not fully bought into the demonization of the West for the economic and cultural influence on the rest of the world. Economic and political expansion and military conquest is a feature of this world through history. The impact and effect of this last round of colonization has had some measurably positive effects, which offset the unavoidable (and avoidable) negatives.A world traveling friend, Emily Lyman, from her experience in Tanzania, in response to someone's criticism of Walmart for using cheap labor in the third world to make inexpensive products, passionately said; `Those poor people desperately need and want these entry level jobs (such as assembling cheap products), because it their first step up out of dire poverty, ignorance, and the cruel character of aboriginal life, with the opportunity of education and a higher standard of living.'  I saw this during my time in Hong Kong.In China, people from rural areas crowd the cities and line up to take jobs assembling electronics, and welcome long hours, if they can trade their time for money to send back home. &#8232;&#8232;My view is that the flood of people from the undeveloped and underdeveloped nations to the West, immigrating by ANY means and with great sacrifice, is evidence that the net effect is positive, because people are willing to make great sacrifices to get their hands on a portion of it.They come not only to the US, but to Canada, Europe, and Australia. These people from the third world find great value in the Western culture and want to be part of it! So I do not sympathize with the absolute demonization of the colonial experience and of the American role in commercialization of the third world. To what extent Barack Obama subscribes to them and uses them to guide his policies is something that can be explored. While ""Dreams from my Father"" has this flavor, he has not published a 'Manifesto' as such, of those views.It is worth noting that the colonial effect of the various Western nations is not the same, particularly when the time comes to make the transition to independence and democratization. The post colonial experience of former British colonies vice those from governed by the French and Belgians and by the Spanish and Portuguese is significantly different. The transition to democratic and stable governments of the former British colonies to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, etc. is remarkable compared to French-ruled Algeria, the central African countries, etc. The efforts of the Brits to develop an educated civil service of stewards seemed to enable a relatively smooth transition. There is more for me to understand on this topic, but I find it interesting."	4.0	Obama's world view and anti-colonialism	2012-10-21	19	10	9

Poor D'Souza could not refute any of the points made by Bill Maher. The fact that this is the fourth highest grossing documentary, with no major studio backing, only proves that there's still a sucker born every minute. D'souza has the opinion that everyone who is not a US citizen sucks and just can't compare to our success at using of tons of the earth's nonrenewable resources. What else can you expect from an evangelical Christian, who renounced his Catholic faith to marry his wife and plans to ""Rapture Out"". This ""documentary"" is filled with the same guesswork about how Obama's real father influenced his political views. If Barack Hussein Obama is a Communist, then I'm Mother Goose. He's the richest Communist I've ever seen and his Cabinet is crowded with bankers and Republicans leftovers from previous administrations. Obama is a politician as is Mitt Romney.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2ARN8U20JB5L	Glen H. Barratt	The facts, mixed among the larger misconceptions, made one truth clear to me: Obama is more interesting than many of our former presidents.It seems like D'Souza grossly misunderstands what the American dream is. Obama's dream for America is most likely only a slight adaptation of the American dream. In a way, this documentary shows where Obama gets SOME of the motivation he has to attempt to keep the American dream a reality.Probably the biggest joke of the documentary is how the information is presented in a way as if it is exposing the best held secret of the century. Take for example the discussion with Dr. Paul Kengor, which appropriately, is acted out in the form of a fake phone discussion as if the fact that Obama was mentored by Frank Marshall Davis is some sort of intensely damning secret.D'Souza made some predictions that most any fool could make, yet he is apparently so impressed with himself he can't help but dedicate a little section of the documentary to gloat. In that segment he further predicts that Obama would look to reduce the deficit by cutting military spending and raising the taxes on the wealthiest Americans... Well, you don't say!?! The air of self-proclaiming-genius coming along with the simplest of observations is enough to make any decently educated individual sick.It is hard to say what is most disturbing about the documentary. If you are not as susceptible, paranoid, and ill-informed as D'Souza might be and/or D'Souza hopes his audience is, then the facts presented in this documentary are definitely NOT what will disturb you. Whether it be the ridiculous dramatization of the significance of the information, the undeniable misrepresentation of realities, or D'Souza's personal obsessions, there is a lot to find disturbing, but it is not the facts (if you can spot them among the misconceptions) on Obama.I highly recommend you avoid paying any money to see it.	1.0	Attacking the diversity that is part of what makes Obama great	2012-09-28	282	89	193
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3HS9IAJG1X3WK	Glenn A. Carleton	"I saw the movie last night with my wife.  Politically we are not of like mind, she asked me to see it.  We paused it many times to discuss the facts presented and conclusions reached. We got on Google and did research, like ""return of Churchill bust"". My view is that this is a movie and not a documentary.  I found the ""therefore"" conclusions to be weak. It would seem a documentary would recognize that views held many years ago (assuming they were held) could not change later.  Is a Romney allowed to change his views (I think he is, ideally explaining it if it changes within a year)?I asked my wife at the end of the movie whether she wonders why so many people in the world who have been around and have access to information we in the public typically do not, why they did not have these same concerns.  Colin Powell for example.  If the assertions were true, are the supporters of BO of like mind, wanting to destroy America with increased debt, or are they just naive or stupid?  How did this president allude so many seemingly smart people, yet the producer of this movie peel the onion back and see the truth others have not?See this movie with someone who is on opposite sides.  Pause, research, and evaluate whether in each step the ""therefore"" conclusions are necessary or even likely to be valid.  If you are convinced, great.  For me, I saw the conclusions as ""wow, that was a big leap from what was just shown"".I did like the movie in terms of the frequent quoting of BO, that was useful.  I found the history of his parents and brother to be very useful.  I did feel the producer badgered the brother to try and force him to say certain things, and because he would not, the conclusion was BO rejected him and would not help him.  That was the only way to discredit his half brother.I give a three star because of the history of the family and pictures and interview with the half brother. One star for objectivity and clear thinking if this was my only criteria.Back to the title of my review.  I did this review if for no other reason to show some of the 5 star reviewers that at least one person critical of the movie actually saw it.  I read some pretty lame reviews, especially the guy who gave it one star so he could give it a 5 star at that rating level - and says the 1 star raters did not see it.

They are in love with America, in their own way, and whole heartedly embrace every aspect of this country without much examination.  Therefore, in their hearts and minds, any leader who questions the paths we have gone down is untrustworthy, and Un-American.  Now, the documentary is careful never to use those words.  Some of the reporting is fair and even handed.  However, there is also the typical Conservative flair for the dramatic...Gasp!  Obama knew some communists!  Gasp...Obama was friends with Bill Ayer, of the former Weather Underground!  The documentary and narrator slip up here and there, though-they refer to the Weather Underground as a ""terrorist"" group.  They were actually, originally, an arm, albeit a violent one, of a democratic student movement of the sixties.  In the day, there weren't many that considered them terrorists.  Their bombings were carefully timed to occur when the buildings were empty.  They did, accidentally, kill one person, I believe, and they expressed great remorse over that death.  You can't define history in the language, objectives, and social desires of today.  The narrator is careful, oh so careful, to appear objective, but in fact this is, in the end, an invitation to doubt, an invitation to speculation, an invitation to a Romney presidency.  Not for this girl.  I kept looking for the ""Koch"" stamp in the end credits...guess they were clever enough to hide that funding.  Entertaining in its attempt to boggle your mind...nothing to be taken too seriously.

Casey ""gcasem"""	"2016: Obama's AmericaOne of the first things we read on the jacket cover of 2016 Obama's America is ""Love him, hate him, you don't know him"".  We found that this was true for us; there were things we didn't know, especially about his founding fathers which are not the founding fathers of the United States of America.Some of the founding fathers of President Obama kept a low profile during the election of 2008 and one was offered $150,000 to keep quiet.  The rabid anti-Semitic, Professor Unger of Harvard, refused interviews in 2008 because he didn't want to hurt Mr. Obama's chances of election to the Presidency.The movie explains very well the meaning of Obama's book ""Dreams from My Father"" for his values are deeply rooted in Kenya.  A friend of his father's said that the ideas of the father and the son are one.  One of his grandfather's five wives said the same thing.The film explains why one of the first things that President Obama did in the White House was to return a bust of Winston Churchill to England.It explains why Obama moved oil drilling out of the Gulf and offshore elsewhere and moved it to third world countries and gave billions of dollars to Brazil to drill for oil (and/or refine it) saying that the United States would buy from Brazil.It  explains why Obama sides with the Palestinians against Israel.It explains why he took one of America's symbols of greatness, NASA, and reduced it more or less to a glorified outreach to the Muslim world.It explains why he has greatly weakend our defenses by reducing out missile strength from 5,000 to about 1500 and why he plans to rid us entirely of them, while other countries, our enemies, are increasing their number.  This he has done besides slashing deeply the funds given to our military.Mr. Obama's values are not the traditional values of most Americans.  They are foreign to most of us.  He was elected the first time because tens of millions of people thought they knew what he was about when he promised ""hope and change"".Now we have no excuse for no longer not knowing Mr. Obama.

As eye opening as the book was, there is something about hearing the words from the lips of the sources for yourself which really drives it all home.  (This is especially true when Obama himself is speaking!)  We wonder why Obama is so soft on terrorists.  It's because he bought into his father's dreams of fighting colonialism rather than buying into the dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  He relates  more to jihadists than he does to the average American which in turn influences all of his decisions.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3KULFIW5DD2TW	Goosta	"To start, I must say that I'm amazed this film made it to the theaters...that's because it barely misses noticing, while trying earnestly to really notice, the inner essence of Obama, his purpose in life.And what is Obama? To make a long story short, Barack Hussein Obama is an anti-white black racial-socialist. He is not merely a black 'nationalist' because his undying allegiance to his black race transcends all nationality, like many black activists before him and along with the black contemporaries that are presently assisting him inside and outside of government, like Eric Holder and Jay-Z with his '5-Percent Nation' medallions, and lets not forget the Reverend Jeremiah Wright and all of 'Religious Liberation Theology', which graphs religious innuendo onto racial animosity as a to make the latter that much more respectable for non-whites.That Obama 'made it' is a testament to the power of the Liberal media, the Universities, the Liberal elite in Government and the collective flabbiness, fecklessness and impotence of the Millennial generation. Obama was domesticated for the liberal white palette. If he came off as what he was, he would have scared the moronic 'independents/libertarians'  and nascent white liberals away with the real stuff. I know of a lilly-white hipster girl, now 26 years old, that eagerly voted for Obama in 2008 and then in 2012 complained about his 'radicalism' and became a Ron Paul supporter. That is the level of obliviousness Obama had to tame to win.All the liberalism surrounding Obama and the liberal rhetoric he exudes is merely a predication of his position as a black in contemporary America's racial spoils system, the system that interprets the races of men as that of black, non-white employment first (Equal Opportunity) and evil white men with their evil history ruining everyone else.This merely proxy liberalism, ""proxy"" because liberalism's neutralizing power is purely a tool used by Obama to further black empowerment, includes all of Obama's overtures to same-sex marriage, all of his allegiances to like-minded non-whites (Leland Yee) in the form of 'immigration' and 'privilege', gun-control, an almost exclusively white issue, and even statements about marijuana, which is a stigma only in Southern/rural white households. In each case Obama supports the issue insofar as it benefits the black race to the detriment of whites, hence the polarized voting racial statistics shoved in our face by the media.Everyone knows the black prison/crime statistics and marijuana's role in those statistics, so Obama supports legalization and supports it only for that reason, not because of the wider context of the bogus 'drug war'.Michael Moore is correct in saying that whites consist of like 90% gun ownership in this country. Guns are of course another leading factor in black/urban crime, the very principle of gun ownership endangers Federal sovereignty and whites are buying them because they're scared of what is coming, since everyone formally despises whiteness, so Obama and Democrats support the outright illegalization of guns.Homosexuality is only really 'accepted' in America and Europe, formally white nations, and the overwhelming majority of homosexual speech comes from white mouths, so much that I see homosexual activism banners at my college explicitly endorsing black men to come out the closet. This is done because of the overwhelming, if not brutal and basic, masculinity in Hip-Hop, a black cultural artifact, and in black males' roles in professional sports, another bastion of a very elementary masculinity. Obama knows that the main acceptance of homosexuality comes in the form of feckless white liberals and he knows that the black community as a whole is so masculinized that it will never budge in its mutual opposition to the issue, regardless that they vote in favor for it when they vote for Obama, and they always will vote for him no matter what, so Obama supports same-sex marriage. The only people who lose in this case are non-reconstructed whites. Same-sex opposition, besides religious invocations, has been directly equated with 'white male patriarchy' and this has been burned in the mind of the masses by Media, Universities, and the Federal Government. So, blacks can approve same-sex marriage while existing outside of it's context as merely 'black', so they escape the corrosive influence the same-sex issue has on family and history. Only whites, and specifically white men have their entire existence equated with the same-sex issue, so they either have to vote 'Democrat' or be evil. That is the power-structure not only of this issue but really of every political issue current in America.And the list goes on. These are 'proxy' issues because they represent a larger struggle that everyone notices but only sporadically evokes, like when Kamau Kambon called for the extermination of white people in 2007, but this usually only occurs in protected environments like Howard University. To actually talk about it in public threatens the underlying success of the plan of which they speak and with which all the Democrats agree; this is essentially why Jeremiah Wright disappeared so quickly in 2008, why the media, Obama's lackeys, dropped him forever and McCain never said anything about him.D'Souza never says anything about any of this, as Republicans cannot say anything about it and this explains the present dysfunction of the Republican part.  Instead D'Souza focuses on a few impartial connections Obama has with 'Marxists', a slogan that is readily digestible for the overwhelmingly white, and might I say stupid, audience of this film. The 'Marxists' are literary influences, Bill Ayers, and similar ilk. Therefore, Obama is a Marxist and wants to socialize Capitalist America. It is the slightest of hints.The reality, as I have said earlier, is that Obama sees everything as a race issue. Obama of course despises Capitalism, not because of the myriad and serious criticisms Capitalism has received since the 19th century, but because blacks are mainly poor in America. That blacks are poor world-wide is because of White Colonialism and Capitalism, which many blacks, perhaps even Obama, consider to be an exclusively white phenomenon and consider it part of the essence of 'whiteness'.Now Obama didn't just think of all this by himself, although simply being black today affords the attention of the many powerful institutions that certainly do think this way, and this explains how Obama went to college. Obama is also a product of the contemporary 'Academy', that is, the 'Humanities and Social Sciences' of Universities. I'm an English major, I know. From Top to Bottom, the Academy is universally anti-white. One only has to read Derrida, Judith Butler, Judith Halberstam, Foucault, and so on down the honor-roll to understand this. People who would formally have been Leftists have completely abandoned Marx's economic determinism, 'vulgar Marxism', and with the assistance of 'Post-Modernism', they have displaced and replaced that Master/Slave relationship onto racial and sexual grounds. Thus, 'Identity Politics' is born. Now everything a white man does is a consequence of his white privilege and racism, and so, in a very religious manner, he has to repent for his evil, go out of his way to love blacks, homosexuals, Rap music, Beats by Dre, and vote for the 'Democratic' party. Obama is really just a product of the Univeristy, a university that sees itself as not just reconfiguring the parameters of American society on economic grounds but, as I said, just as much, if not more so on racial and sexual grounds. So calling them 'Marcists' and 'Socialists', as only the bravest of Republicans will do, is itself meaningless and self-defeating.What we really have here, and what they instinctually recognize, is the logical conclusion of Liberalism."	4.0	Just the tip of the iceberg	2014-04-07	4	3	1

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3GQXLVWTJLARH	Gordo the Gatling Gun	NOTE:  This review was posted on an amazon forum back in 2012, when this movie came out!  The review in question is reposted as it was written (with only one bit marked by an asterisk changed due to context) as a means to gauge it's relevance today.  Keep this in mind.***Spoilers***Now for my second review: 2016: Obama's America. Now, this is the first time I've ever seen a documentary of great significance on the big screen (I've seen a few science and national geography documentaries at the Denver Museum's Imax theater once upon a time), and will thus be the first time I review a documentary here on this site (or anywhere for that matter). And considering the fact that the whole movie is an argument-based documentary on a significanct subject, this review will be a bit different. See, unlike [your ordinary feature film]*, I cannot simply rate the film, say, a 10 out of 10, because there's a whole different set of credentials I need to follow. As a result, this review will take the form of a short essay of my own, in which I tackle the following criteria: What stance does it take on Obama? And does he do this stance justice (are the details in any way valid?)?Now, before I tackle that part of my review, I might as well get technique out of the way as that still remains a factor in this movie. The overall presentation is fantastic. The way some of the clips, the precise detail, the way it was all strung together, it gives the film a perfect flow. And instead of mostly talking heads, many of the interviews are filmed as if they were scenes in an actual movie. It just goes to show that the overall editing, cinematography, and use of sound are all first rate. And frankly, if I were to give it the general 10-star rating, this film would earn a whole star based on the technique alone, as the presentation of this particular documentary ranks the film among the best in cinematic history.Now the question is, does the whole rest of the film live up to the film's technique? Well, Dinesh D'Souza starts off his documentary by going through a general rundown of where he came from as an immigrant to the United States, and then he moves on to compare his origins and views on America to those of Obama. He essentially starts from day one, specifically where Obama's father came from and what he did during his lifetime, and then goes from there (as that he was one of Obama's original sources of inspiration). He interviews various family, friends and acquaintances that knew either his father or Obama himself, and even looked into his autobiography and his various speeches.The film itself is based on D'Souza's observations on the President and the various interviews he's done for this particular project. The stark contrast would have to be Michael Moore who not only cherry picks his clients and then turns a tragic incident into a gun control propaganda flick, but is a complete cynical @2$h01e to boot. Here, there isn't a single solitary trace of cyncism or otherwise attempts at mean spirited wisecracks. Granted, what he says can make you uncomfortable (especially if your political leanings are more to the left, as are the majority of mainstream professional critics), but it is an important side of the argument to take into consideration.Now, before I continue any further, allow me to get something out of the way before some flamming Liberals begin to lynch me with so-called leverage they may have on me: I am not a Republican. In fact, I am not even a Mitt Romney fan. Yeah, my leanings are more towards the right, but I am a nonaffiliate. I am only going to vote Mitt Romney because based on personal observations, Obama needs to go, and Romney's the only candidate who remotely stands a chance getting rid of him.And in addition to this, I am not fond of many of the previous projects from the Conservative side of the movie business. An American Carole, while a sincere attempt at satire, falls flat on its face. Most of the jokes don't work, and its satirical approach is both too easy and too obvious; and only the former is in any way understandable. And the less that can be said about Team America: World Police, the better; and need I mention Adam Sandler? Or Larry the Cable Guy? Heck, the only films tackling the Right that I admired in recent memory are Atlas Shrugged Part One, and to a lesser extent, Act of Valor (a great film, but more of a pro-marine propaganda flick than a pro-conservative one).But the question shouldn't be about my political preferences so much as whether or not the film works. Well, after gathering all the facts together and putting together all that he knew from his various interviews, he came to a startling conclusion: Another term under Obama would be catastrophic. Not just for America, but for the rest of the world as well. This film doesn't bs at all; it is a straight-forward analysis of Obama's history and how it's come to shape who he's become today.Now considering the fact that I whole-heartedly support this movie's stance, I can't bring myself to rank this film at all. I mean, as far as setting up a side in an argument's concerned, it's a solid A+ in my book, but beyond that, this is a completely different entity from just about every other film I've seen this year. To rank it among the 10 best films of the year wouldn't be able to do it, or any other film on said list, justice. And the radical changes to form in this movie means that it utterly defies the typical 10-star rating system that I normally give it. It is utterly unrankable under any circumstances in my book.But overall, it was an enlightening experience, but a cold, uncomfortable reminder of what may soon become our reality. But the sad part was that, at the mere age of 22, I was easily the youngest person in the theater. The fact of the matter is, more of the younger generations need to see this film, as it is clearly resonating more with an audience that should already know all the details presented in said film.So who can I recommend this film to? Anyone who is young, ignorant, and/or anyone else who relies more on raw emotions and other chemical and hormonial imbalances than their brains. Of course, those who are conservative or undecided need to see this film too, but the younger generations need the wake up call the most. Those who are genuinely concerned for where this country--and for that matter, the rest of this world--is heading needs to see this movie. I don't care who you are or what circumstances are preventing you from seeing this movie; see this movie. The only way you will not get much out of this is if you lean too far into the left of the political spectrum and you firmly believe that Socialism works.But when and if you do see this movie, I suggest you do something fun and may cheer you up, like watch a film you greatly admire, or play a video game you like, or even something more casual like going for a swim. In fact, that's exactly what I'm going to do. But no matter what happens, keep what you've gathered from this film as food for thought.***Spoilers end***I figured today, this movie is proving itself correct with each and every passing day.  While it isn't quite 2016 yet, I am confident in giving this movie a perfect rating.  As to where I'd rank it on my list of favorite films of 2012, I'd rate it number 3--better than The Master, but not quite as good as Seven Psychopaths or Holy Motors.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	ANZBB39S9Q4OX	Guillaume Normand	This documentary uses Obama's own words to support a theory that explains like no other theory does Obama's consternating actions.  From returning the bust of Churchill , a gift from England, to the support of the Muslim cause and while running the largest deficit in American history, this president's actions are baffling to say the least and are not in the best interest of our beloved nation.Like the author I came to America over 30 years ago.  I love this country, and I am struggling to find minute evidences that this president is acting in the interest of our nation and the welfare of its citizens, and I cannot find anything.  This documentary presents the theory that Obama shares his father's anti colonialism , and identifies with it profoundly.  In fact, the author argues and concludes that this is the only theory that really explains the motives behind all of Obama's actions and policies.I was not born in America like Obama, but I am now a proud US citizen, and I can say without any doubt that I am more American in spirit than this president ever will.A quick note on all the one star reviews.  I think Amazon should only allow reviews from verified purchasers.  It is quite clear that the majority of these reviews are from people trolling sites like this one to skew the prevailing opinion of the folks who really watched the movie.	5.0	A great documentary that connects the dots	2012-10-13	45	28	17

Far behind us - but still we feel the sting of the bush's and their self - centered and self seeking abuse of our county. Democrats need to be more driven and critical of republicans.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AUCWQN7I47CKQ	Gus Venegas	For those unfamiliar with the documentary &#34;2016: Obama's America&#34; follows Dinesh D'Souza's carefully chosen steps as he travels the world in an attempt to better understand Barack Obama. The journey takes him from the Hawaiian Islands to Indonesia; from the slums of Nairobi, Kenya to the seat of the world's largest superpower in Washington, D.C. Along the way he interviews relatives, scholars, and other sources of information on Obama's life in a documentary that is a fine piece of investigative journalism. D'Souza tells us in his &#34;2016: Obama's America&#34; that Obama holds outdated anti-colonial, anti-capitalist views that he inherited from his 60's left-wing idealist parents and continued learning from mentors in his youth, which explains a lot of his attitudes and policies as President today. This film should not be mistaken for a conspiracy theorist's quest. There are no baseless accusations based on the place of Obama's birth, religion or college transcripts. D'Souza stands on solid ground, steering clear of conspiracy charges. D'Souza intentionally traces the steps of Obama's upbringing, attempting to explain Obama's sometimes baffling decisions.	5.0	2016: Obama's America	2014-04-03	4	3	1

I expected the movie to provide facts of the Obama's current model.  His upbringing is interesting to a degree, but I don't form my conclusion about the current model by knowing that he studied communism philosophy decades ago, or he entertained the company of persons with which I find fault.Instead, tell me where he stands on birth control, gay marriage, taxes, and any number of issues that shape the USA.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AN3Y6Y6AT3XMW	Hammer55	This movie is a must see for the folks who know nothing about Obama. You may have voted for him, but you don't know him. Obama and his party have an agenda to destroy this great country. The great irony is that the sheeple who support him will be the ones who'll ultimately suffer the most. Sure, they will get free stuff for awhile, but that won't last if the wealth creators are chased out of the country. The Federal Government doesn't make money, they take money from the people that make it. Obama is attacking the very people who created the middle class. Raising taxes will drive the wealth out of America and to places like Canada, who aren't stupid. They see what Obama is doing to the US and are preparing themselves for an onslaught of new businesses and jobs coming across the border. The Canadian corporate tax rate was recently lowered to 15%. Obama wants to increase ours to 35% or more. It doesn't take genius to figure out that a business making a one million profit can keep an extra $200,000 in their pockets each year by moving to Canada and taking all their jobs with them. They could actually hire 4-10 more employees by doing so. And I can go on and on with similar scenarios. Four more years of Obama... Canada and the rest of the world wins, AMERICA LOSES. Obama couldn't care less about poor people. He only cares that they vote! If you love LIES and RHETORIC, then Obama is your man. If you love FREEDOM and OPPORTUNITY, then vote for Romney. It really is that simple!BTW, did I mention that most of the movie is based on Obama's books and in his OWN words? ENJOY!	5.0	This movie is a MUST SEE for EVERYONE!	2012-10-13	33	24	9
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1U9V4LBJ468NU	Hank Charleston	I normally do not like reviewing political products anymore because it attracts low review ratings from people who don't like the subject matter, regardless of the review.  What I will say about this movie is that it does not try to 'slam' or 'attack' Barack Obama, it just takes a look at what Obama is currently doing in his administration of the White House and where these ideals may come from.  It is taken from the perspective of someone with a similar background to Obama and laid out for everyone to see and make their own judgement.  It is slow moving in the beginning to explain the past, but moves a little faster in the third quarter.  This is a documentary, not a blockbuster action film.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3NY5H9LQ5QEM3	Harvey	Dinesh D'Souza has a more accurate perspective on who Barack Obama is than do most people who voted for him. Like Obama, Dinesh was raised in a poverty-stricken country and has a largely outside-of-America perspective on our country. Dinesh has retraced Obama's steps -- largely from maps taken from Obama's own books -- studied his major influences (including the influences Obama cites in his biographies), and then uses that information to make sense of some of the positions Obama had taken during his first term as president.Obama's father, while having spent virtually no time raising Barack, was a major influence in his life because of how his mother kept his father's memory alive through what she told him. Obama's father was an extreme anti-colonialist, so Obama looks at everything through anti-colonialist eyes. Obama's grandparents were (like his mother) extreme communists, so when his mom sent Barack to Hawaii to live with them they sought  out a communist -- Frank Marshall Davis -- to mentor him. When Obama got to college he said he &#34;sought out&#34; communists and Marxists as teachers and friends. He purposefully and intentionally looked for them as friends.It doesn't seem to make sense that he wants to impede the Canadian pipe line and do away with as much oil drilling as he can &#8211; through regulation and otherwise &#8211; while at the same time financially backing off-shore oil drilling in Mexico and Brazil. That is, it doesn't make sense until one realizes Obama considers America to be a &#34;colonizer&#34; and far too wealthy.  Since we are more wealthy than either Mexico or Brazil, Obama wants to help these &#34;poor&#34; countries &#34;catch up&#34; to the US.  Since several other countries with nuclear weapons have only 300 of them, Obama thinks it is only fair that we should only have 300 as well. And what better way might there be to make us poor like the rest of the world than to get us so far in debt that it crushes us?Using Obama's own words and ideas D'Souza reveals to us the real Barack Obama. And it isn't a pretty picture. But if you don't think his words as president match his deeds and this confuses you, you need to watch this movie.  While the truth isn't pleasant to learn, it is better to enter his second term as president with your eyes wide open.	5.0	Most people who voted for Obama don't even know who he is.	2012-11-22	7	4	3

It is well researched, balanced and presented in an intelligent, thought provoking way  and unlike Michael Moore's type of documentary that is satirical and tells the viewer how to think, this film allows the VIEWER to make up their own mind about this con-artist ""president""...  This is NOT a bashing film either - just just presents FACTS.  Granted it DOES push a closing opinion that he is taking the USA in a wrong direction towards the very end  - but during the film it mainly presents facts...  if you watch this and actually pay attention to what is going on in the USA right now - it is very accurate. Everyone pro-or con should at least watch this film and really think about the direction he is taking this country.  But then of course in 4 years it will be even MORE painfully accurate and we will be living this film anyway.

This film is like Dinesh D'Souza's books: logical and semi-academic up to a point, after which it turns avowedly mean-spirited and begins to parrot far rightwing ideology.I too had questions about our first black president, some of them still unanswered. And one of the reasons I bought this film is because I thought that D'Souza might shed new light -- however jaundiced it might be. However that is not what he did. He came just short of ""setting up"" those he interviewed, egging them on, channeling his questions so that only the bad side of Mr. Obama would be revealed.Did Dinesh think we were too dumb to see what he was doing, or, are his standards just that low? For me, who has read and reviewed most of his books, I can assure the reader that it is both.In this regard, I thought the way he treated Mr. Obama's brother was really low-class. Although the brother avoided being drawn into D'Souza cleverly engineered trap. By the way, Obama's brother had written a book himself, so if Dinesh wanted to know his views on his brother, the President, any studious investigator worth his salt, would have used Obama's brother's book as a basis for framing and formulating ""real"" rather than ""slimy trick"" questions.I just don't quite understand why conservative ideologues have no regard for either the truth or fairness.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1EVN8OFNWWEMG	H. Geschichtemann	"To begin with a caveat, I strongly recommend reading both of D'Souza's books on this subject, along with both of Barack Obama's autobiographies and a sampling of the writers that Obama flatly states helped form his world-view.I long ago figured out -- at the time of the return of the Churchill bust -- from reading ""Dreams From My Father"" and ""The Audacity of Hope"" that Obama defines himself more on the basis of his personal understanding of his Luo, Kenyan heritage than anybody who has not read those books or who has read them uncritically can imagine.  I also realized that this identification was powerful enough to direct Obama's attitudes toward the United States and to prompt a certain amount of interference in Kenyan politics (like sending Joe Biden to campaign for Odinga's Shari'ah-friendly constitution) but definitely NOT strong enough to move Obama to any personal expenditure of either self or money on his family connections there.D'Souza, with his extensive knowledge and research has done an outstanding job of exposing, in the words of the title of his first work on this subject, ""The Roots of Obama's Rage.""This is a thoughtful, careful presentation that deserves very serious consideration in the process of trying to understand this otherwise engimatic radical in the White House."	5.0	The Most Compelling Explanation Yet	2012-11-17	7	3	4

If you asked me in 2008 who I voted for I would have told you: ""Not Barack Obama"" not because I liked McCain, but because I really was fearful for my life and the life of our people if he were to be elected.Now, in 2012, two weeks away from the debate, I have watched this documentary not to further my dislike for Obama but to educate me on what exactly it is that I do not like. I was not ever politically savvy in the previous four years since Obama has been President of the United States, but now I'm scared. I have a 2, almost 3 year old daughter whose future I nearly weep for when I think about what her life might be if Obama is to get re-elected. I don't think Romney is the Messiah sent to clean up the mess of our country, I honestly don't, do I think he will do less harm than Obama? Yes. Do I think Romney truly identifies with the American people? Yes. But I am not voting for Romney to be saved by him, no, I am voting for Romney to further distance us from the Obama Administration which is clearly anti-America and pro-socialist.This video has helped me open my eyes to what is happening in our world, it has strengthened my knowledge on what is happening. I feel that Dinesh D'Souza has properly framed everything that has happened in the last four years and exposed the mindset of our current Commander and Chief. I don't hate Obama, I hate the things he stands for, and I feel that Obama may not hate me (he doesn't know me), but he hates what I stand for, and what I stand for is the same things that our founding fathers stood for and that is for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.I would strongly urge all Obama-sympathizers to watch this movie with an open mind and realize that Obama is against you to. He doesn't like America or at least not what America was when it was founded or what it has become over its entirety, but that he only loves the America that HE wants to make in our world. I don't want to live in fear, and with Obama being in office, that's all I will do is fear for the life of my children. Please, don't shut our door to this video, if anything, watch it challenge yourself because as an American people, we live for challenges.I hope, come November, that we make the right decision and I hope, that we no longer live in fear. In 2008 America voted for ""Change"", in 2012, I hope we vote to ""Change Our Mind"".God Bless America"	5.0	A Real Eye-Opener	2012-10-17	32	23	9

Obviously, this documentary -- like Farenheit 9/11 -- is presenting the director's point of view and people will agree or disagree with the content.So my focus will be on the product. Did this picture grab and maintain my interest? Did it seem to try to be fair while attempting to persuade the audience to take his view? Did he let his opposition speak for themselves as opposed to using cinematography to twist their comments? The answer to the preceding questions are yes, yes, and yes.While Michael Moore is a household name, Dinesh D'Souza is not. As a result, D'Souza wisely introduced himself -- comparing himself with Obama. He also mentioned a debate with Jesse Jackson on racism. He established that his background resulted in him having a perspective that would differ from one who lived here in the country. Additionally, later on in the movie he showed some criticism he received for his book ""The Root of Obama's Rage"".He early on stated things about Obama's presidency that made him wonder. From there, he looks at Obama's upbringing -- frequently using Obama reading his own words -- for the purpose of seeing how his background affects his political worldview. He then commented on what he expected (right on target each time) and projected what he'd expect in a second term.Important things to realize. D'Souza is not a birther -- he stated Obama was born in Hawaii. He also focused on areas of economy and foreign affairs; abortion and same sex marriage were not topics in this documentary.In conclusion, the ending of the film can be considered propaganda. However, it does give some interesting perspective on our president."	5.0	Agree or Disagree, if one looks objectively at this product one would say it's well done.	2012-12-26	1	1	0
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A27GTCGI9IBJER	IndyCA335	This is a good visual summary of Dinesh Disouza's book, which in turn analyzes why Obama thinks like he does, i.e:  the US should not be a pre-eminent country, Israel is bad, Britain is bad.  It is scary, but explains that just maybe Obama does not WANT the economy to improve.  Why does he let his brother languish in a small hut in poverty?  Because the brother, who seems well educated, says that Kenya was much better off as a British colony.  What the film does not discuss is how any nation of educated people could let such a dysfunctional person rule it.	4.0	The Roots of Obama's Rage	2012-11-07	8	2	6

You and I know that many of the 5 star reviews are republicans/tea party people who have deep hate for our president.I am not surprise that the author and supporters of this movie also go after president Obama family members to prove their point as well.It's also shocking to see that you can write a book or make a movie filled with someone's ideas, lies, lack of evidences to support evil statements, misleading statements,  against someone; people who are smart, educated, supposed to be wise will still believe it.

I too had an immediate dislike and distrust of Obama.  Sorry Libs it wasn't his skin color.  I liked Cain and even donated to his campaign - a first for me.  It was his friends and those who supported him, ACORN and the Black Panthers.  I was appalled by how the population applied a different set of rules for him.  If a Republican of any race (example Cain) had but one of Obama's questionable associations, he or she would not have been able to get a security clearance let alone the Presidency.  Yet so few seemed to care.  It didn't matter in Obama's case.  This disconnect from common sense and reason terrified me.  The collosal arrogance of his Democratic Convention, roman pillars and all, floored me.  I think it floored the Clintons too.This movie/book put into words what my ""danger meter"" was sensing.  And he has indeed accomplished much of  his agenda.  What amazes me today is that so many still listen to his lies.  He had 2 years of a super majority to impliment what he claims the Republicans are blocking.  And people still nod their heads in agreement!This is a must see especially for Obama fans.  You more than the rest of us need to ask who is he?  If he is so great you should relish getting to know him anyway you can.No one knew much at all about him when they voted for him.  But if they have the courage to watch this movie they will know.  This isn't Limbaugh or Coulter.  This is a man who did his homework, used his brain, and came up with an answer.

Even after this truthful dvd came out, those people voted for him again anyway. The state of the country seemed unimportant to the liberal voter and still does. They still think Obama is their saviour and a world leader. I think this video was very accurate and used the facts to tell the story about how Obama dislikes this country and has an agenda to kill our position as the premier country in the world. To the liberal, Obama was similar to Che. They liked him as an anti-american hero of the whole world....The fact that he could possibly bring our country to a halt seems so unimportant to the liberal voter....facts and criticisms do not phaze the liberal voter.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1LJCJLFWTURI4	Jakey D	"Dinesh D'Souza is not out to insult or disgrace our ""president"". He actually felt pride in the decision that America made. I personally didn't, since I saw the socialist Obama, but if Obama would have proven me wrong, I would be the first to admit my mistake and judgment in a man and what he was about to do. The movie, ""2016: Obama's America"", is to present facts, show you who the man in the White House really is and what he represents. For those of you who feel that this movie is about ""Obama trashing"", you could not be furthest from the truth and therefore would be the primary audience to watch this film. It is a movie that is a must see before the election for everyone. Whether you believe that the current Occupier of the White House has done a great job or not, you have to know who Obama really is, before you press the voting button!!Mr. D'Souza is a scholastic and political genius in my personal opinion. To try not to go into the details of the movie too much, I would just like to provide my personal view on what I have gathered from the movie and would encourage everyone to see it, make your own judgment and decisions. As mentioned before, the movie IS NOT about bashing Obama, not about discussion about the ""president"" and what he has not done, but it is about Obama as a person, his view of the world and his view of America's future, which is different from what America was built upon. The film is about his childhood, family members, mentors and everyone who shaped his young life. We cannot judge a man, without seeing what shaped and developed his life. As per my background and my view of the world, how I was raised, how I was brought up to despice socialism and what it stands for, due to the fact that my family had nothing that the socialist society has to offer, I shaped my decisions and my views from that. The same goes for everyone, including Barry Soetoro aka Barack Hussein Obama.Here are the facts and the shaping of the anti American ""president""...While watching the film, I could not help but notice the similarities in all the ""open thinkers"", ""scholars"" and ""anti colonial"" socialists. Obama's biological father died in a car accident. According to his close friends, they were drinking and having their ""intellectual"" discussions. At 1:30 pm he was already drunk and drove home killing himself. Not the first time for Barack Obama Sr to drink and drive, but this time his life ended just like many ""heroes"", where drinking and doing whatever you please for scholars, elite members of socialist system was popular. One that really comes to mind was Yuri Gagarin. Yuri was a Soviet Pride. Gagarin, first man in space, prove to the world that the Russian space program was the best. Yuri, at the time a test pilot, becomes a national Soviet hero, only to die later testing a plane. Well, according to some, something went wrong, but according to others, Yuri was an alcoholic. Could it be that another ""hero"" was just too drunk to figure out what to do in the complex situation, like flying a plane or in Obama Sr's case, just driving a car? Not saying anything about Barry Obama, but just pointing out my point of view on the so called ""free thinking"" socialists. There were other ""free thinkers"" and just plain bums in history who turned to bottle, so that they can avoid personal responsibility and preach ""equality"" to others and in such way Karl Marx comes to mind. Free loader, alcoholic, even though a scholar, but let his own children starve to death, so that he can drink and preach useless theory that later ruined nations and created millions of miserable lives. I am not saying anything about Obama, yet, but merely drawing parallels on some of his family members and others who have chosen to live the same ""heroic"" way.Obama's mother.... She tried to get away from ""imperialistic"" and ""capitalistic"" United States or the West in general. She did everything and anything to insure that her child, Barry, was raised with the same views that she held dear. She even divorced Lolo Soetoro, hence the name Barry Soetoro, because Lolo did nothing more than tried to provide for her and their children. She despised success and American free market, just like I despise socialism. Perhaps Obama's mother would have been better off in those societies that she ran to, but even they couldn't handle her and therefore divorce after divorce she kept searching. She did whatever she could to ""shield"" young Obama from anything that she deemed western and therefore ""corrupt"".It seems that according to his socialism sympathetic mother, her anti Colonist views of the world and Obama's grandfather, they thought that someone like Frank Marshal Davis would serve as a better role model. Mr Davis was not just a friend of the family. Frank Marshal Davis became Obama's friend, mentor and the influence that later provides direction to Obama's views, choices in life and friends that he makes and keeps. Not to mention that Frank was a card carrying communist and an open anti American, Soviet supporter. They had a name for people like that and still do. They called them Enemies of the State!!Then we skip to the more current events and take a closer look into Obama's speech ""your brother's keeper"". By George Obama's example, younger half brother of Barack Obama, besides the fact that Obama would not support his own brother,  on the merit of brother's keeper and because George does not share his anti Colonial and anti Western views, it is not about family, values or ""brother's keeper"", it is all about ideology for our ""president"".  Furthermore, we can clearly see that not just the fact that Obama has shared views and idolized his drunken socialist father, but he also based his magnetism towards certain individuals on the false hope of a myth rather than the character of the individual. Obama is truly an opposite of what Martin Luther King Jr. has spoken about. Obama doesn't judge the people by their character, but by their ideology and therefore the background of his own false demons and idols. Therefore his own brother does not fall into that category and is ruled out of Obama's ""brother's keeper"" rhetoric. Barack Hussain Obama sees the entire western world as colonizing oppressors. It is not an attack on our current resident of the White House or an insult, but a fact. Before I saw this movie, I had many theories of my own, since I have some background and experience, my view on speeches and promises that BHO made in 2008, but the way Dinesh D'Souza describes it, it makes complete and total sense of what Obama stands for and why he cannot stand America, Israel and the entire western society as it is. That is why Obama is sympathetic to the ""oppressed"" Muslim world and that is why he stands on the wrong side of our principles and our values.What a clich&eacute;, Jews voting for Obama and Barry's views on Israel as a ""colonizing"" nation. I am a Soviet born Jew and therefore I cannot see Obama as someone who would support our closest ally. Obama sees the world as such, so he views Muslims as oppressed, rather than oppressors, even if they kill millions of other Muslims, that would be fine according to people like Barry in Chief, as long as the tiny Israel is not involved. Then Obama steps in and pretends to be on the just side of the formula and trying to broker peace from the Palestinian side. How obvious and how much more does he have to do, in order for people to realize that he is not friends of our friends, our allies, and sides with American enemies?Towards the end of the film, I noticed another interesting item that just brought me right back to the oppressive and brainwashing Soviet regime. The kids are singing an Obama song in the classroom and the teacher very enthusiastically working with the class on the song. If the teachers are so patriotic, they should then implement singing the National Anthem or recite The Pledge of Allegiance? I bet they didn't sing songs to be ""pro-American"" during Bush or even Clinton era. Is it because we made history this time around and the teachers are proud to pretend that we actually chose our first Black president or is it because we chose our first socialist president? Have our ""educators"" been victorious in finally achieving the first steps in socialist direction, therefore the song seems appropriate? Very recently, we have noticed teachers disallowing the Pledge of Allegiance because it invokes God and yet we praise a man who we don't know much about and is only in the office for 4 years? Recently, a teacher decided to disallow and omit ""God Bless the USA"" from the program, saying that it is too much of a song for the young kids. The parents were fine with the song, the kids enjoyed learning it and yet it was too much? I guess singing and praising Obama in the song is not too much? This reminds me, very much, of the times when we were forced or better yet, asked with enforcement, to learn songs about the revolution, Lenin, Stalin and recite poems in former Soviet Union. Dictators love to be praised and it is just too hard for me to ignore that this ""school song"" about Barry Obama is just an innocent celebration of historical event. Sorry, I am not buying it!!To wrap things up and let you go ahead, get out of the house, away from the computer and watch this incredible, eye opening film, I would just like to say a few more words. In my personal opinion, I have been noticing a trend. The trend is that even the far left is not able to ignore at times. Yes, we have some very left liberals, but when faced with pure socialism, they tend to realize, that it is not their cup of tea or brand of vodka. The other day, I was watching CNN and the headlines were ""Obama Revealed"", so I guess the Prince of Poppers has been revealed, even by his loyal legions of the left wing media. Even MSNBC's Rachel Maddow had a presentation on Obama's extreme and possible martial law and that should have been a sign that a very liberal Rachel is just not buying the whole ""Hope and Change"" any longer? Even they did not sign up for what the most elusive and secretive ""president"" has to offer. When Obama promised to transform and change America, those who praised it, might have not realized that, he actually meant what he said, but perhaps they were just not listening?Also recommend:AfterTastes and Tales from Russia: (Forgive me for being anti Social...ism)"	5.0	2016: Obama's America (My Humble Feedback)	2012-12-09	3	2	1

During this journey he discovers how Hope and Change became radically misunderstood, and identifies new flash points for hot wars in mankind's greatest struggle. The journey moves quickly over the arc of the old colonial empires, into America's empire of liberty, and we see the unfolding realignment of nations and the shape of the global future.

The author begins by noting certain similarities in his own and Obama's upbringing. Being of Indian origin and of the same age as Obama, D'Souza understands the kind of British-inspired anti-colonialism that Barack Sr. would have felt and how it would have resulted in the kind of worldview that President Obama that he uses to view the planet.D'Souza does something the mainstream media has NEVER done... he has sought those who knew Obama prior to his candidacy for president. And as he illustrates in this film, the media reaction to D'Souza's scholarship by the mainstream media is scoffing disbelief and continued ignorance: the disgraceful treatment of Obama's half-brother living in Kenya (why? Because he doesn't share the vision of Barack Sr.), the influence of a CPUSA member on a young Obama, the divorce of Obama's mother from her second husband when he turned out not to be the revolutionary she thought he was... all fascinating. Yet not worthy of CNN or the New York Times.Why would Obama back Argentina's claim to the Falklands over the British? Why would Obama order away the bust of Winston Churchill out of the Oval Office? Well, if your father hated the British as much as Barak Sr. you might not be so sympathetic to the British role in history either.Anyone, pro- or anti-Obama, who thinks they're going to watch a hit piece when viewing 2016 will be disappointed.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A19ZJ2V3FBWIKK	JaneLovesJesus	D'Souza's background gives him the unique perspective that brings the contradictions of Obama's presidency into clear focus.  Why is it okay for Brazil & Mexico to drill for oil off-shore, but not the US?  Why do we weigh in on Arab Spring protests, yet remain mum on protests in Iran?Anti-colonialism is the tie that binds the seeming contradictions together.Obama's life goal is to take the United States down a few pegs -- to punish the US for the sin of success; for the crime of having while others have not.He is well on his way to achieve this goal. The damage done by increasing our debt, emboldening the Muslim Brotherhood, and protecting anti-American aggressors will take years to repair.  If he is given another 4 years of raw power, scarcely dented by the constitution or rule of law, there may be nothing left to save.D'Souza's film is well written and constructed.  There is a weird segment when the background music is overpowering, but hang in, because it isn't like that the whole film.  Yes, there is speculation, but he lays out the facts that led him to his conclusions for our evaluation.I would have liked even more examples from the past 4 years (such as the returning of the Churchill bust -- historical facts that can't be disputed nor explained from ordinary channels.)Obama constantly speaks about 'how unfair' this country is.  Makes you wonder how so many Americans -- even recent immigrants HAVE succeeded, and become entrepreneurs, huh?  He absolutely is trying to cut America down to size.

Littlepage ""jclittlep"""	I expected Obama to apologize to everybody after he was elected - that's standard liberal claptrap - but I didn't expect he would send the Churchill bust back, or that he would give Tony Blair a set of DVDs with North America encoding (not usable on EMEA players), or that he would give the Queen an iPod full of his speeches!!  Talk about narcissism.  I also didn't expect him to bow to the king of Saudi Arabia.D'Sousa's theory that Obama's working philosophy is anti-colonialism, rather than Marxism or Socialism, fits with that.  It also fits with his not understanding or caring about the defecit, and his unrelenting attack on business, both small and large.  It fits that his health care agenda is not one to make sure the poor have health care, but to destroy the health care industry.  He also doesn't seem to care that this industry pretty much takes care of his precious 3rd world free of charge, and provides advances to make them healthier.His agenda is not about reward at all - it's about punishing the colonials (or in the case of the good old USA, neo-colonials.) We can look forward to this agenda on steroids if the man is reelected.  As the Psalmist says, gird thy loins.If you see this documentary and still vote for him, you can't say you weren't warned - you have only yourself to blame.	5.0	D'Sousa's neo-colonial theory explains a lot	2012-10-14	17	10	7

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A359TUQDTLENBI	Jared	"If you are a conservative or someone who wants to know more about our president this is the movie for you. Obviously the reviews are politically biased for the most part the 5 star being the people who accept and now know the truth about Obama and the one star reviews coming from the left who think this man is perfect. (Trust me go with the 5 star reviews.)I originally thought this movie was going to be a dramatization of what our country would be like in 2016 if Obama was to be in for a second term. However this movie is more of a documentary on the background of Obama, his roots, and his political/personal beliefs. There's just enough facts and statements introduced at the beginning to get hold your attention for the whole movie. It then goes away from politics and focuses on Obama's father's life and the person he was. Plus most of the drive behind this movie comes from the book Obama wrote himself ""Dreams From My Father"" which is proof of what the director bases the whole movie off of because when you find out Obama is trying to complete his father's ""dream"" it makes you understand everything Obama is doing is purposeful and deliberate because he has set goals for himself that correspond with the things he has done in office so far. This isn't a huge exploration into Obama's life but enough to show you who he really is and spark a curiosity to embark on researching more about who Obama is and what he stands for.People may say D'Souza is an idiot but considering he went to an Ivy League school that should put him on the same playing field that Obama is on since he went to one too for you Obama supporters. I'm glad D'Souza had the courage to speak boldly to really awake people to what can happen in the future regardless to who it offends. You should be offended by what is going on, even if you don't believe it hopefully when it becomes apparent what Obama is trying to do (if elected to a second term) people will then see this guy is right and we need to stop this deceptive president with a dark agenda.For anyone undecided for the election, someone who wants to know more about Obama, or hopefully even some Obama supporters who want to learn more about Obama this is a great resource to start with. (Many of the things in this movie I had already known about but many more I learned from this documentary.) It is a well put together film that has enough to give you some topics to investigate upon if you want to dig deeper into the grit of these matters, but the movie let alone is enough for you to get a good foundation of who Barack H. Obama really is.2016 has a great, yet bold ending, and the key line is mentioned, that it really is up to us to take a stand against this president and stop him at this election while we have the chance or if we want to risk putting our great nation on Obama's planned path to destruction. For anyone who is skeptical or interested now is the time to watch it before the election. Go to the polls knowing who this man is, even if you don't believe it still watch it, draw your own opinions from it and see where you stand after watching Obama's America 2016.

Listen, if you hate Obama and his policies, than hate Obama and his policies, but to conjure up a bunch of lies about the man, and then call it a movie is ridculous.

I am a Buddhist, child of Anthropologists, raised in a fairly liberal American household growing up. Having become more conservative as I've aged, I still do not fit neatly in a single political or social box. I give this background for much the same reason D'Souza gave his in the movie, to allow the reader to judge my biases for themself.I hadn't made much effort to see this movie because I had assumed it would be sort of a &#34;tin foil hat&#34; conspiracy theory movie, but when the movie maker was jailed for what seemed obvious political retribution by Obama, suddenly I was intrigued and felt compelled to at least buy and watch the movie as a show of support for free speech.Far from the wildly anti-Obama &#34;tin foil hat&#34; conspiracy theory, I found a lucid, sober, and extremely thoughtful examination of Barack Obama's personal history, philosophy, and motives. There is even some interesting insight into what might motivate us as an electorate to elect someone from his unique background. Well worth the time to watch.Love Him. Hate Him.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2FHIOLDQM1RSL	"J. Clyde ""Clyde's Stuff"""	"I really liked this movie. It falls into two of my favorite movie categories.  I love comedies and I love documentaries.  So when I can find a film that encompasses both of these genres I'm on cloud nine.Having seen it in the theater, I couldn't help but roll over in laughter, especially when at one point, some members of the audience stood up and began yelling, ""We're all going to die!  Obama is going to kill us all.""  It really had me in stitches.But not as much as the woman who as she was leaving the theater had tears running down her cheek while crying, ""God, save us from this abomination known is Obama!  I don't want to wear a Burka!  I don't want to have to learn to speak Muslim!""Behind me two elderly gentlemen were whispering, ""What we need is another great president like George W, who did such wonderful things for this country.  He should be on Mount Rushmore instead of that Kenyan Born Muslim in the White House.""  I swear, that one had me in stitches.  I was rolling in the aisle and laughing so hard I thought for sure I would spit up my popcorn.A young lady in front of me with her mother was really into the movie.  ""Momma, I bet it was Obama who kept Bristol Palin from winning Dancing With The Stars.  Everybody knows she should win because she's the second greatest American to ever live next to her mother. Can we watch Sarah Palin's Undefeated when we get home momma?""  Now that's comedy gold from the youth of America, Praise Jesus!All in all, if you really want to enjoy this film, see it with a far right wing conspiracy oriented low information uninformed voter crowd.

Truth is we don't really know who he is or why he was &#34;chosen&#34; to advance to the presidency. Nor may we ever. The movie is well done but I think it's just preaching to the choir. I would like to see a sequel to this that would set aside the idea that we really don't know who he is (and that he is not qualified to be the president... no he is not, his job history is pathetic) and talk about simple facts that we know that the media won't truly touch: The insane debt he has racked up; the fact that we could tax the rich in this country at 100% of their income and that would not pay the interest on the money we owe (I don't know why people can not do simple math); he talks about being transparent and is NOT; he turns down any and all proposals from the republicans and the American people think the Republicans are not being cooperative.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2S1YX9WZLLNMY	"J. Cordray ""Joe"""	"After the last 12 years I find myself as a Jaded independent whose no longer satisfied with promises these politicians make. What they say doesn't mean anything. Where in one hand you can see Paul Ryan and Joe Biden deeply engaged in their political battles and then in another moment you can see them hugging and greeting each others family on stage. It is a show. They never say what they mean and they never do what they say.  Nader got it right. This is a 2 party dictatorship. I don't live in a ""battleground"" state so my vote doesn't even count even if I wanted to vote. I noticed the establishment arrested the green party gals when they showed up to attend the presidential debate at Hofstra.Arrested? For what? It's a joke. But if their message ever caught fire they would represent a threat to the establishment and the donkey and elephant show they call a government would go under real change.  Can't have that now can we?Why did I watch this movie then?Well despite my jadedness, I love this country with all my heart and it's a movie that so many are paying attention too. I also wanted to see if there was any good information that I wasn't aware of about Obama.  It's the same reason why I would endure a Michael Moore film.Now at some point, the film maker always disappoints me. Their slant becomes obvious and its like over spicing or over cooking what would have been a nice dish.D'souza is a sell out. He stays close to the agenda of making Obama look bad but doesn't go beyond that because it would threaten the establishment. He keeps the message dumbed down and a very simple delivery and he never deviates from this.D'souza does point out some interesting ideas in regards to Obama's ideology but it still requires a stretch of speculation since some of obama's actions have contradicted this. Sure I don't care for Bill Ayers or some of these far left cookes or Jeremiah Wright but I can see how its instant fuel to push a far right agenda also.Is this by design?And sure I agree that Obama is Anti Colonial and its typical to find that ideology paired up with anti capitalism. Does that mean Romney is all for neo colonialism? mmm...Most Americans really are unaware of the corporate activities we have been involved with in other countries for decades and decades and we completely benefit from it without even knowing. These corporations primarily do it to avoid being taxed, to avoid regulations, and to maximize profit in ways they could never accomplish in the United States but often at the expense of that host nations peoples. And then we get other countries tied up in loans with organizations like the IMF and World Bank and when they can't deliver on paying back those loans we go after their minerals and other natural resources through our corporations who have lobbyist in Washington who pay these politicians with contributions to implement policies that favor their industry or even their company. We do much of the same with powerful families in countries or ruthless dictators our record shows that...And we wonder why people across the world on one hand can wear our style of clothing and love our Hollywood and listen to our music on an iphone but on the other hand are seen burning the US Flag and attending anti american rallies?Its really crazy and in the states were constantly told its their religion religion religion...One form of division.See, D'Souza would never have the Balls to put that in his rinky dink documentary. Just showing some images of shanty shacks in indonesia or kenya doesn't cut it dude. See he wouldn't go there because it points to a bigger problem than Obama and again Dinesh chooses to keep it simple and stay on point which is a single idea to make Obama look bad which I don't necessarily disagree with but its more that that!To me all of this with our Government is a huge payola system and our US Dollar operates much like a ponzi scheme just like social security and fractional reserve banking. I think its designed to fail for a single purpose of consolidation of resources which will be easier to control the masses in the future.Now Obama's record stinks not just with Right obviously but also with the true libs. Arguments have been that he is actually a Libertarian. When you see him do things that are not in step with the perceived notions of his political party, you have to wonder...Speaking of not in step, did you notice this year in the DNC how they had to vote the word God and Israel back into the platform? What a farce. And all of those boos when they announced that they had added those words back into the platform. I laughed for days over that one!Did you notice how the Ron Paul followers were marginalized with a quick vote at the RNC? Lemmings falling over a cliff. I liked Paul but I already knew he was not a serious candidate. He played his role well.When Romney gets elected 4 years later when he's the incumbent, we will be doing the same thing with him as we have done with Obama and it will be a Michael Moore film that I will be flaming....2008 Obama and Hillary were at Bildeberg conference2012 Romney was seen at Bildeberg...Coincidence?I believe Obama has upset the Crown in Great Britain and I'm not talking about Churchill's Bust or the Falkland Islands. There's actually more D'Souza could have pointed out in that regards but again, keeping his message simple for mass effect was his apparent intent.And of course Obama has also upset Israel. Did you know there was a time where Romney and Netanyahu worked for Boston Consulting Group? Its true. Romney is Netanyahu's guy...See things can appear to be complicated but one thing is clear in my mind. You don't want to piss off the ruling class elite and I truly believe Barack has done that.Which is why I would be SHOCKED to see Obama be re-elected. What's not shocking is this Documentary....--------------------Update 18-oct-2012i was on hulu and i discovered The Hope and The Change 2012. No narrator. Just Democrats and independents taking out Obama. More intense than Dinesh's flick.Maybe it was Dinesh and his narration boxing it in that I didn't like.

It's not a question about whether he's a secret communist who's going to take vengeance for his Kenyan father's struggles against colonialism blah blah blah. He's been politically moderate, he's had some pretty good stumbles through his term and some decent accomplishments. Folks who think either Obama or Romney will come in with the secret cure for our country's ailments are about as silly as anyone who thought Obama was going to do any better than McCain back in 08. This largest economy and most powerful country on Earth is more than any one man... including and especially the President. The President can only do so much to affect the economy. It's funny to hear Obama take credit for the jobs that have been created under his watch about as much as it is to hear Romney say with one breath, ""I'll create jobs as President!"" and with the next breath saying, ""Government doesn't create jobs!"" I'm not worried about some silly conspiracy theories this movie extracts from completely out of context quotes taken from Obama's book. Dinesh D'Souza is about as informative as Hannity from the right or Bill Maher from the left, although D'Souza is clearly in Hannity's camp. Think for yourself folks... Obama had his chance to ""destroy"" the country from 2008 to 2012. You really think some Manchurian candidate would say, ""Hmmm, I'm President now... but let's wait till my second term to destroy the US, bwah ha ha ha(evil laughter).""

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"In ""2016: Obama's America,"" Dinesh D'Souza makes the case that President Barack Obama is trying to fulfill his father's anti-colonial dream of destroying America and allowing the rise of the ""United States of Islam."" The film is a curious mix. It includes dramatic recreations of past events (notably and repeatedly, a young Obama grieving at his father's grave), interviews (including some with friends of Obama's father), graphics (the Statute of Liberty drowning in a sea of red ink!), guest narration (by Barack Obama himself from the audio version of his books) and some of the most audacious jumps of logic this side of the Olympics.The list of the film's flaws, outright lies and intellectual dishonesty is endless.D'Souza starts by dramatizing a conversation with a nave white college kid who tries to ingratiate himself with D'Souza by telling him how blown away he was by the awesomeness of India, D'Souza's home country. D'Souza cuts him off, citing his country's poverty, caste system and bride burning tradition. Having thus defeating the mighty, liberal college student, he claims to have bested Jesse Jackson in a debate, when (he claims) Jackson could not name a single instance of overt racism in the US. Whether true or not, by this encounter D'Souza shows that racism is no longer a potent force in the country, and is just an attempt by minorities to shake down the System for privileges. He illustrates America's color-blindness with a staged scene in barroom full of blacks and whites, celebrating happily together. One of the white kids even bakes a cake for a black friend! Racism is dead!D'Souza then roles out a clever technique: in a voice over, he makes a true claim, but one that his audience will accept as false. The ploy is clever because on its face, he has stated something true. Who can argue? But since his audience likely does not believe the statement, D'Souza communicates the very opposite of what he overtly states. This happens at least twice in the film. Once, D'Souza states that anti-colonialists and their white liberal allies believe that western nations (like Britain, France and the US) colonized African countries to get their wealth. Then, on a visit to Hawaii, he meets with a historian who claims that missionaries, merchants and politicians overthrew the government of Hawaii in the 19th century to allow the US to annex the islands and grab their wealth. To anyone with a modicum of education, these two claims are utterly true. Belgian troops committed horrible atrocities in the Congo to brings its wealth, mostly rubber, back home. The Spanish and English were notoriously brutal in removing indigenous peoples to extract riches from their lands. And the US did undermine Hawaiian customs and royalty in order to establish a pretext for annexation that would ""save"" the islands. D'Souza is either ignorant of these facts, or assumes that his audience will be unaware that their country participated in such skullduggery.Early on, D'Souza claims that Obama has shut down oil drilling off US shores, but is subsidizing oil drilling in Brazil and elsewhere. He spins the short moratorium on drilling after the Deep Sea Horizons explosion as a permanent ban. In fact, Obama has expanded drilling off the US Coast. The claim that the US wants Britain to give the Falklands back to Argentina is also nonsense. And claiming that Obama has ""done nothing"" to constrain a nuclear Iran is an outright lie.D'Souza claims that in 2008, no one knew who Obama was. He was, according to D'Souza, and with no evidence whatsoever, the great Black Messiah, embraced by whites who didn't care about Obama as such, but only wanted to participate in a historic election to raise a black man to the presidency. It is true that Obama rose quickly the from Illinois senate to the US Congress, where he had served only six years. But Obama had written two probing and intelligent book about himself -- one in 1995, the other in 2006 -- that laid out his intellectual development and influences. His 2004 speech to the Democratic Convention brought him to the attention of a wide segment of American voters. Barack Obama was hardly unknown in 2008, especially after a grueling primary season in which he and Hillary Clinton, who were in a death struggle for the White House, campaigned in all 50 states and debated 28 times.The interviews with friends of Obama's father are amateurish and slanted. D'Souza wants desperately to tie the father's supposed anti-colonial rage to his son. He finds one old friend, a man whose grasp if English is rudimentary, to state that the Obama senior and junior ""are one."" It was clear to me that the man was saying something no more controversial than that the son was a chip off the old block - perhaps looking the same or having similar personalities. To suggest that this man was making a nuanced conclusion that the president shares his father's politics stretches logic to breaking. In an interview with Obama's half-brother George, D'Souza tries to show that Obama has not done enough for his own family. But the canny Obama refuses to take the bait to denigrate his brother. Barack has his own family to support, says George. By helping the world, he says, he helps me. Bravo!Large sections of the movie feature Barack Obama himself, reading from his books ""The Audacity of Hope"" and ""Dreams from My Father."" This gives the impression that Obama is hanging himself with his own words. But while the words are Obama's, the wild conclusions are all D'Souza's. Obama, says D'Souza, has anti-colonial rage, somehow inherited from a man he hardly knew, to diminish America and put it at the mercy of foreigners. He wants to create a ""United States of Islam"" that will be a threat to the United States. This is ""proven"" because Obama supported attacks on Libya to protect its citizens, while refusing to attack Syria which is also attacking its citizens. That the geopolitics around each country are radically different (Syria is geographically closer to Israel, for a starter) matters little to D'Souza.Nearly every one of the film's statements and conclusions is open to challenge. By the end of the film, I was dazed by its inanity and begging for it to end. Just one more example. D'Souza tracks Obama's childhood years in Indonesia, where he lived with his mother and his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro. According to the movie, Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, was appalled that Lolo was getting involved with American oil interests who were bribing their way into influence. But rather than admiring Dunham's distaste for corruption, D'Souza blames her for trying to flee Lolo's ""Western"" ways. And where did this crazy leftist turn to flee the evils of western corruption? Hawaii!! She hated America so much that she fled a Third World nation for the U. S. of A.!It's hard to know whether D'Souza is merely partisan, or dishonest or just not very bright. His premises are shaky or wrong. His conclusions do not flow from them. But the effect on a certain segment of the American populace is unmistakable. The 40-some-odd folks who watched the film with me were all white and of retirement-age - the Tea Party demographic -- some of who were annoyingly vocal about being in synch with the film's conclusions. These are the unreachables in our body politic, having neither the basis in factual knowledge nor discernment required to understand that they are being lied to.But I wonder about D'Souza himself. He was bred in India, a country still suffering the after-effects of British colonialism, just ended in 1947. Wouldn't he be the one who was prone to unrecognized rage about colonial powers? After all, Obama was an American citizen raised in Kansas and Hawaii, with only a 5-year stint in Indonesia. D'Souza spent his first 17 years in Mumbai, before coming to the US in 1978. One has to wonder whether his entire oeuvre is to project his own fears and inadequacies on others. Why not? If Obama can be haunted by the political views of a man he met only twice in his life, why not Dinesh, who spent his formative years in a Third World country, with a US education his only means of escape?""2016"" is a mess of lies, half-truths, and truths presented as lies. Frankly, it says more about the author than about its subject. And it says a great deal about a citizenry that is willing to swallow whole, and without evidence, paranoid and baseless conclusions about the inner workings of the mind of what, to all outward appearances, is a man who loves his country and wants it to prosper."	1.0	This guy went to Dartmouth?	2012-09-03	288	76	212

The shame is what has become of the American electorate and their willingness to buy into one half baked conspiracy theory after another. We have almost completely given up on selecting our officials based on the facts and instead rely on childish emotional responses fed to us by a right wing hate establishment.  Obama is one of the most moderate and pragmatic Democratic presidents in our history, any historical review of the EVIDENCE will confirm this assessment.  His policies towards Africa have actually been a step backwards from those of his predecessor.  I found the in abstentia psychological assessment in the movie the most disturbing element and a flatly ridiculous premise. What radical influences were needed to stimulate a desire for universal health coverage?  Something the rest of the civilized world took care of decades ago.  What radical influences were needed to push an intelligent and pragmatic President to seek a path of moral authority and diplomacy over a the path of being a world bully and our all to frequent ""yur fur us or agin us"" mentality. Finally, the whole conjecture of the film, that an Obama second term would produce disastrous consequences flies in the face of the FACTS from the last four years. What circumstances in the second term will eliminate a stonewalling GOP that has blocked almost every piece of meaningful legislation proposed by the President, many of which emerged from the Republican party or affiliated think tanks.  The President's power is not absolute and his ability to affect long term change is far more nuanced than the film would lead us to believe."	1.0	An Atrocious Disservice to America, Not Obama	2012-10-16	62	15	47

I commit every once of critical examination to its verification. I've carefully analyzed all the information I can gather from every side of every issue, and although I'm not an expert on the matter at hand, everything that I have discovered over four years, is that the reelection of Obama will result in certain disaster for this nation. I understand that many voters could have made a mistake the first time around, but to repeat such a mistake is proof of only one thing, absolute, undeniable ignorance.I'm tired of combing the news wires for information on Obama, his origins, his theories, his philosophies. They leave me a bitter man, lead me to loose all hope in any kind of a future for America. All of my resources point to one common conclusion, and it's a conclusion that many fail to acknowledge because they simply do not believe this could happen to America, yet here it is right before our eyes.It is not this one film that leads me to my disastrous conclusion about Obama and his true agenda for you and me, but it has driven the final nail in the coffin.

It's one fault it's credited by those who oppose it, is that it shows a side to President Obama that his faithful either can't tolerate or refuse to hear.  Further they don't want YOU to hear it!  So, now they are getting on here with their reviews (most of which if they were honest would have to admit they NEVER saw the film) and are nonetheless giving it a one star rating just to poison the effects of this documentary.  This film is a very courageous statement if you really consider who made it & produced it.Let me ask you a few questions and you will need to be open minded and fair.  Have you ever wondered why Obama's background (his political views and idealogy) weren't more vetted?  Have you ever questioned the source of your information?  Is it the mainline press on either CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, or ABC news?  I would venture that 85% of the top level broadcasters or news analysts, news writers, reporters, or news producers are either extreme left leaning or consider themselves Democrats.  Why does this even matter?  Because even the best of news people can't help but have their political bias show through... and the worst among them purposely slant and ignore important news stories that don't show their political ""Rock Stars"" in a good light.  If these channels had been more committed to unbiased news then there would never have been a Fox News.  The reason Fox News has now overtaken all the other news broadcasts in the rating is that they don't ignore the news stories that are breaking they report on them and follow the story to wherever it leads or investigate it to try to find out how or why it happened.  If you were college educated do you realize that 80% of the university professors are also clearly left leaning.  These institutions have even given entry and refuge to 60's radicals who clearly have agendas and actively plotted to overthrow our government.  Some of these very people have the President's ear and are his advisers.  Do you know that the President's election team in 2008 tried to buy his former pastor's silence?  It's because they knew if you heard, really heard what he believed you would be forced to think what was Obama thinking to stay in this man's church for all those years!Getting back to this film... clearly this IS a film that the people in Obama's reelection campaign do not want you to see.

D'Souza presents it like-this is what I found, this is what I discovered, and this is what I will predict will happen. You don't have to believe his prediction, he is presented it, so you can form your own opinion.For me, some of it seems like a real possibility considering his history so far these past four years. Other stuff may be far fetched.I found his upbringing to be very enlightening and shed light on he really is.I never trusted Obama, didn't think he had enough experience to rule our country.

I found it to be well presented, and the author did a good job of tracking down as many people that know Obama as he could even though some refused to be interviewed.  It is full of facts and record checks on actions this president has taken while in office.  Yes those actions are available for all to know, if you know where to look, but presented in this way, allows those  who don't always read every newspaper or listen to every news report every day, to have a much broader and clearer picture of what has been up to and what he intends to be up to if elected again.  The background interview with relatives, particularly the half brother, was very interesting indeed.  I sure hope enough people listen to this who are undecided.  It will or should change their minds about the guy they thought they knew.  This man is very dangerous.  I thought so before the last election, and I now realize he is even more dangerous than I had previously suspected.

Almost as if Mr. D'Souza tried to sell his personal agenda by cloaking it in smoke and mirrors.  This was a startling look into the hearts and minds of those convinced that Obama plans to bring America to its knees.  I found the so-called 'expert' opinions particularly noxious because they tried to portray their *opinions* as factual information.  Not to mention the obvious slight of hand played when discussing the national deficit and the total national debt.  Clearly, this film is meant to play on the fact that most Americans have a very vague understanding of American history, government, or the often thrown around Constitution and know even less about world history.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3NLLGAM8EPIJA	jmoney2999	This film seems to be just as much about getting to know Dinesh D'Souza as getting to know the director's stated objective to help people understand who Barack Obama really is.  The first 15 minutes of the film gives us a short bio of Dinesh, so that he can parallel his life with Obama's.  Dinesh is from India, which was a British colony, and Barack Obama's father was from Kenya, another former colony of the British.  The theory of the film is that Obama wants to weaken America, so that it does not continue to have the kind of global power the British once had.  The problem with this argument should be pretty obvious-America doesn't have any colonies.  Dinesh seems to have more of an axe to grind with his home country of India, than Obama has with America.  This seems odd for a conservative, since India is the largest democracy in the world and a great ally of America.  He even goes as far as to suggest that Kenya was better off as a colony of the British.  Once again, why would a conservative be in favor of having a peaceful democratic country under the political control of another country? His whole argument is specious and mostly based on what certain people Obama grew up with believed.  It shouldn't seem that outlandish that Obama's father would not want the British to rule over Kenya, any more than our founding fathers wanted to be ruled by the British.  If Obama really held such anti-colonialist views and wanted to weaken America, he would be pulling our troops from countries throughout the world.  While we may have a military presence throughout the world, we do not exert complete political control over these countries.	2.0	Dinesh D'Souza 2012	2012-11-04	14	7	7

There is no debating that facts of the movie are FACTS as he uses obamas own words (with the exception of his predictions at the end of the film).

There are too many variables in our lives to say that Obama is that or this.  Amusing documentary or a personal interpretation of an individual influenced by certain groups to tell the story of Obama.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AUQKSLUBGU6V	john j. winsch	I give this movie the highest rating, because it has been eerily accurate in predicting the downfall of the prominence of the U.S. due to the policies of Obama. We are now hopelessly in debt, which will eventually result in hyperinflation. He has an overtly socialist agenda that is exactly what his teachers, many of whom were openly Marxists, would glory in. The background on his Mother clearly shows that she was one of the .flower children who had no morals and hated America. His Father, if anything, was worse. For those of us who have loved America, it is now likely too late to undo the mortal blow his policies have dealt us, but at least the viewer will understand what policies are destroying us, and where Obama got his inspiration for them. We, the electorate, have only ourselves and our greed for government handouts to blame.	5.0	2016: Obama's America	2014-04-07	5	4	1

You get the point in a time frame which will allow you to get the pertinent information before Election Day.  Every voter must see this film.  It explains the motivations behind Barack Obama's otherwise bizarre behavior while in office.  The final scene is downright chilling.  Pay close attention to young Dinesh and what he is reading.

It also answered some of my questions about how a relatively unknown political figure can rise up in such a short period of time to become the leader of the free world. If you are like me, you have had the gut feeling that something isn't quite right about this administration, and that there is more to it than just a clash of ideals between conservatives and liberals.Other than the information contained within this documentary, it is very nicely done and very interesting and entertaining from beginning to end.	5.0	It helped me understand the sometimes confusing actions of our president	2013-03-15	5	2	3

Too many Americans and foreigners involved in the world political playground chose to stick their heads in the sand...or are conspiring for a world that &#34;the little people&#34; would be aghast to hear of.

I have seen the movie twice in theaters but not the DVD.This movie gives more time to ""the roots of Obama's rage"" in a psychological examination than is worth doing.  The conclusions do amount to a theory that explains what are otherwise odd and contradictory policies and procedures.  The movie explains Obama's anti-colonialist dislike of the United States that is convincing and is hard not to sympathize with.  More refutation of it would have been welcome.Obama's brother George seems to be a smart man; I wanted to read his book after seeing his exchange with D'Souza.The movie concludes that Obama is a dangerous person to have in the White House, and sells the conclusion well, despite some stylistic problems and emphasizing some things at the expense of others.

If you really want to get an insight into Obama's past and real agenda (which I happen to believe is even more destructive than presented in the film), watch Dreams From My Real Father; that will wake you up and put to rest all the distractions from the real issues that have been brought up (the birth certificate, the relationship with questionable characters such as Wright, Ayers, etc., Obama's and Michelle's real accomplishments or lack thereof, the history of Obama's part in Chicago politics, and so on).

I thought the film attempted to be objective in its evaluation of the inner workings of the mind of a collectivist.  Those who criticize the film because it mentions the mentors of Obama influenced his thinking process are just ignorant of the facts.  We are all a product of what we have read and studied in our life.  It is clear President Obama's far left radical ideas came from his many communist and socialist teachers and from the books he studied throughout his life.  Anyone who thinks stealing from those who produce in order to give to those who refuse to produce should never be trusted to govern a free country.It is also obvious that we fail to learn from history.  Socialism has failed all over the world (Greece, Italy, France, spain), yet we seem to be heading in that direction every day.  The last four years have been clearly a failure under President Obama's leadership, but the majority of people drank the cool aid and reelected him to another four years.  Well, if you liked the last four years, you will love the next four years.In conclusion, this is a film every American should see in order to better understand the true and real meaning of the President's ""Hope and Change"" philosophy.Rating:  5 Stars.

But the one thing that really scared me was that off mike remarks he made to Russia's President that he would have to wait after the election when he had more flexibility.  My question is flexibility for what Mr. Obama?  The Russian president says to Obama he would inform Vladimir??? Everyone knows that ""Vladimir"" Putin is not just a PM of Russia, in fact, he runs Russia and he is ex KGB.  Why is our Pres Obama going to give him? I dont want to find out I hope Obama is voted out cause the debt and Obama's executive orders are pretty scary if he gets re-elected.

It lays bare who influenced Barack Obama in his influential years, and finally makes available to the American public a fact-based presentation of his ""goals"" and idealogy when he says ""level the playing field"" and ""fundamentally change America"". It gives thought to exactly what is in store for America if he manages to get reelected (I pray not). I watched this movie, then sent an email to three people, explaining my reasoning why they should watch this movie NOW. I hope others do this as well, spread the word.

This movie properly vets Obama--something the media willingly neglected to do--and further engages the audience by skillfully painting a picture of what 2016 in the US will look like under an Obama Admin. Criticism of the movie often contends the movie is completely speculative. In response, I would kindly read the title: 2016: Obama's America. Unless I am ignorant to Dinesh D'Souza's possession of a Crystal ball, I find his speculation of the future of America necessary and well-intentioned. The movie is not based on ideology, but rather facts and interviews, through President Obama's own words, his book, relatives, and friends. It is hard to achieve a bias through these resources. America needs to stop shielding Obama from any criticism. NO, criticism of Obama does not mean your a racist or radical conservative. Our job as an American voters is to be as informed as possible.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AJXX5XJS86P6S	jul0317	Politically I consider myself a middle of the road or slightly left. I'm a white single female from a republican Midwest state. I voted for Obama and plan to again. I educate myself on both sides of the coin no matter what my instincts are. I wanted to watch this movie to gain more perspective of how republicans view our President, and possibly learn some truth. I have to say, if this is the way most republicans view him, I've only heard this from extremists on television. 50% of my friends and family are voting for Romney 2012. I have never heard of them speak in this way about Obama.One of the worst things I heard about the election from this movie is that the only reason he got elected was because of race, and that he got where he is because he has the ability to convince 'white america' that we want to help him and that he didn't have any new ideas. If that's not extreme I don't know what is! I voted him BECAUSE of his ideas; he was actually going to, and did, make real changes (if you disagree with that, you need to educate yourself on what has been done during his term). I love the fact that his background is so different and he comes with a fresh perspective.Nothing is wrong with being a 'white picket fence, white family, strong religious background, wealthy family' type of candidate; but we've had too many of those and they haven't done the jobs we hope they will. Americans have said for years that we need a change, and when it comes, we get scared off and twist the truth so much to make this look like the biggest mistake we have ever made when in fact it could be the best we've had. Then people like Dinesh come along, while he seems to be extremely well educated and intelligent, made it clear that he only looks at the President the way he wants to see him because he is scared that some BLACK man whose roots are not similar to us 'normal' Americans could actually make this country better. The fact that Dinesh completely ignored the financial collapse of America that came from republican power is just sad. If Obama was not President I don't believe we would have made as much progress as we have today. Somehow we all pretend that nothing happened and it should have only been a couple years to recover completely. How ignorant!!!I'm really disappointed. I was hoping for something new and fresh. If you want to make an anti-Obama documentary, by all means do so -- same goes for any other candidate. But if you're going to do that, look at the WHOLE picture and it will be received much better. Being so judgmental, one-sided, ignorant, and oblivious is not appealing. I would have LOVED to watch a documentary about Obama, even if it was a republican point of view, that had some actual sense and came across as intelligent--point out the great things he has done for our country; how many Americans he has helped, along with your criticisms. If you believe he's not the one to run our country, let us know that, but don't insult our intelligence by eliminating and ignoring all the good that has been done on his watch.	1.0	Extreme right wing point of view	2012-10-19	78	25	53
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1DM29V2PYU086	Jules	I was reading other reviews and he truly does use a lot of Obama's own words. Dinesh did not bash Obama he merely spoke the truth. He wants to live the Dream of his father not that of his own, Which is scary in itself. I also had watched Dreams from My Real Father and he was very close with Frank Marshall Davis and was Obama's mentor for many years which Frank had known Vernon Jarrett ,Yes related to Valerie Jarrett. Who is always by Obama's side and also has her own secret service which was never heard of before in the postition she holds to have her own secret service? In early 1948 Davis served on the publicity committee of the Citizens' Committee to Aid Packing-House Workers with Vernon Jarrett.[...] If you scroll until you see Vernon Jarrett click on his name and then you will see Valerie Jarrett they are all communists.. These are scary times. He wants to disarm America and let others have more control over us.. He wants us to have only 500 nukes which, Iran in itself are starting to build them and other Countries have many more than us which would make us weak and vulnerable.. Obama feels after seeing for himself also the way the people in third world Countries live that even the poor in America are Not poor enough.. They do not live in huts like Obama's half brother does. And we do not have to dig through garbage as they do to collect cans or what not for money to buy there goods..But I do not want to live Obama's Father's Dream.. I want to live my Founding Father's Dreams..Peace, Freedom, Prosperity !! We are prosperous here and we are lucky to live in America. The land of the free and the home of the brave and I do not want to lose that because someone else has a dream they want to live out for someone else.. We should be trying to help them become prosperous. Not taking from the rich to give to the poor.. Or in Obama's Dream from his father taking from our poor to give to third world Countries who are poorer..  And this is a must see before you vote...God Bless and let us live in our America that was founded by our founding Fathers! It is a much better dream to live and if the left really saw this movie and thought Obama wanted to help the poor , yes he does but not over here.. In third world Countries, That is what his Global Tax is about also. Just one of many programs off hand!  We do not need to Fundamentally Transform America(Obama's own words) also.. However we need to bring our priciples back into our lives. Believing for a better America for ourselves our Children and our Grandchildren.. We need faith back in ourselves and in the America Dream.. Wether you believe in God or another higher power?.. Nobody believes in anything anymore.. And we must have faith and believe again to restore America's future..	5.0	WISH ALL PEOPLE WOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE BEFORE YOU VOTE!!!	2012-10-23	56	40	16

While many of the things that are presented may be true, and would certainly explain some of the decisions President Obama made during his first term, how do we really know any of this is true? Anyone is capable of presenting ""evidence"" and arguments against someone, especially if they don't like them.  Personally, I don't like people I refer to as ""fear mongers"", such as Glenn Beck.  The sad thing with people like Glenn, and possibly Mr. D'Souza is that even if there is any truth to their message it gets lost in what appears to be nothing more than a personal attack.  That being said, I didn't vote for President Obama to be re-elected, but it wasn't because of anything I heard or saw in this video.  In the end I am not sure I really ""KNEW"" the President any better than before I watched it, I only ""KNEW"" what Mr. D'Souza claimed.  Regardless of the fact that he won the re-election, the best thing we can do now is to pray for him and for our country.  Whether we actually do end up where Mr. D'Souza believes we will by 2016 remains to be seen, but even if we do, God is still in control and He commands us to honor and respect our leaders."	2.0	On the Fence	2012-11-14	6	2	4

After all, in four years he has failed to stimulate the economy, create jobs, reduce the national debt, etc. After watching this documentary, it becomes evident that all his ""failures"" have been intentional and part of his plan to downgrade America's economic and military power. Obama was brought up as a socialist, and anti-colonialist.

Makes a person wonder if he isn't the Anti-Christ. I do not understand why people would not want to see this documentary of the President of the United States. What are they afraid of, that it might be true and they'd have to change there minds on this person. It was very well done and able to follow along with what is being told thru-out the documentary. In my opinion it is a must see. I want to order it so I can watch it again and so friends & family can also watch it. I have known or thought that there was something different about the President, so this documentary tells the story & why no one knows anything about the man. He is a big secret, I looked up online why him and Michelle were disbard from practicing law. They weren't but turned over there law license as not to be investigated on something they both did wrong. If they should want to practice law again the state of Illinois could reopen it and investigate whatever it is they did that was ""unlawful"". There is alot we do not know about the President and seeing this documentary helps you to know what he is hiding. His true faith and nationality. Please see it everyone. This is OUR country we are talking about and we do not want the Anti-Christ running it, unless of course you are a devil worshiper. No one will judge you for changing your mind about the President of the United States of America, as I said its OUR COUNTRY we're talking about and the future of our children and grandchildren.

I found 2016 Obama's America a very interesting study of the re-elected president of the U.S. This well done video references Obama's philosophy as he gives it in his book, Dreams From My Father, in his speeches, and his choice of associates. This study of Obama's background provides a strong explanation of why he is so far to the left politically. I always research and listen to all of the speeches by the candidates for offices for which I will vote.

This documentary is not based on any truth or fact, it is pure speculation. Speculating Obama's beliefs based on inconclusive evidence of his absentee father's beliefs and the company he kept. Here is a prime example of how anyone can twist and spin anything anyone says and bend it towards their own agenda. D'Souza seems like an egotistical man who thinks that since he is a dark-skinned immigrant with an Ivy League education he has some insight into Obama's deepest 'conspiring' thoughts. He also seems like a man who is smart enough to make a lot of money off Obama haters. I think this film is pure crap and I want my $4 and 2 hours back.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1TO1P3NV7OAU6	"KevinB ""The Honey Badger"""	"Dinesh D'Souza is an Indian man that attended Dartmouth, an Ivey League University. In this documentary he takes the Presidents autobiography and retraces Obama's footsteps to try and understand what motivates the President in his relentless pursuit of America's downfall. D'Souza begins by describing Obama senior and his immigration from Kenya. He trace the Presidents footsteps and meets many influential figures. One of Obama's many half brothers and his best friends from childhood to his election for Illinios senate.Obama's actions are very clear after watching this documentary. He stopped offshore drilling and gave billions of dollars to other countries so that they could make more oil rigs in the gulf. He is taking away our defense capability by reducing our stockpile of nuclear weapons, as well as making crippling cuts to our military. He dishes out money to those who don't want to work. He also bypasses congress and goes to war in Libya and Egypt. All the while tripling our national debt. It is now 3 times what all 43 presidents totaled conbined. America is nearly on it's knees.Dinesh D'Souza uncovers the things in Obama's past that make him intentionally destory our contry. This documentary is very objective and informative. If you are curious about the President's motivation and aim over the next 4 years, this documentary spells it out very clearly. Obama has already disregaded the constitution more than once, he may find a way to become President longer than 8 years. If anyone watches this documentary and still thinks that Obama should be the President, I think the country and it's prosperity are not important to those people. Free stuff is most likely all those people care about. Obama doesn't give out free stuff. He uses taxpayer money to do that.Being a graduate of Dartmouth one would think that Dinesh D'Souza would have a skewed liberal view of politics. This documentary, however, is very objective. It uses Obama's very own autobiography to prove it's claims. This is a must see film for every American. Please wach it and take it to heart. ""We the people of the United States of America"" are responsible for doing what is best for our country. We must know the facts and act on what we know to be true."	5.0	An insightful documentary into the mentality of a controversial man.	2012-11-09	2	2	0

The assertions Dinesh D'Souza makes in this ""film"" are complete fabrications based on D'Souza's own crack-pot psychology. At the end of the day, this is just another example of what has gone wrong in this great country. We used to have respect for the President of the United States. Regardless of personal feelings & political disagreements with the man serving in the White House, people would be always respectful when they discussed the President-- out of our deep respect FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, no matter who that may be at the time.  Sadly, those times are long gone...replaced by dangerous hate filled rhetoric and propaganda used to try and de-legitimize OUR OWN PRESIDENT. So anyway, the bottom line is that you should avoid this piece of junk & anything like it like the plague."	1.0	Absolutely Horrible -- Just More Hate Filled, Fact-less Propaganda about The President	2012-10-04	86	16	70
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A31QXQN5HXVWVB	Kevin	"After having seen the documentary and reading the book, I have to say, this is one of the finest pieces of scholarship explaining a President's true inner motives that I have ever seen. For those on the left who make ill-informed assertions attempting to deface this, all anyone who has to say who has read the book and/or seen the film is, ""What does constitute legitimate criticism of President Obama?"" In fact, I am perplexed because this a straightforward and well-founded critique of the President. He is first and foremost an anti-colonialist. Now if Dinesh wanted to engage in petty unfounded partisanship he would have simply thrown out that ""He's a Muslim, or a socialist, or both."", but in fact, he discredits both of those assertions made from us on the right. In fact, he explains why Obama's philosophy can best be explained through the prism of anti-colonialism. If you try socialism, by definition he really is not, because he is not seeking a true definitional command and control economy. It's doubtful that he is a Muslim because his father was; he ended up becoming an atheist. Now if we look at Anti-Colonialism, a philosophy which says Colonial powers (Either British, American, etc.) must pay their former colonized regions with wealth and power, now that is a much more telling and insightful viewpoint. That explains why he removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the White House and supports Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands rather than Britain's. I could go on and on, but to get the most intellectually rich criticism from President Obama, you need to see ""2016: Obama's America"" and read the book as well. Excellent work Dinesh."	5.0	Excellent scholarship	2012-09-30	52	35	17
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AFYL1YCJBCI91	Kevin Hitchcock	Two years ago, Dinesh D'Souza did a remarkable job when he released an expose of the real history - the roots - of our sitting president's misguided and radical political agenda.  Thoroughly researched, with firsthand, on-the-ground interviews with key influencers and contacts, the story woven is a compelling one, difficult to dispute.  Along with facts are derived logical inferences and an education on historical political ideology.  As with all documentaries, watch with an open yet critical mind, and your beliefs and attitudes should either be reinforced (if a conservative, tea party or libertarian) or at least somewhat shaken (if a moderate or liberal).  Radical leftists and progressives will likely label propaganda, which it is not.  As an immigrant himself, Dinesh is certainly not a 'hater', and not a simple-minded member of a Radical Right.	5.0	Eye-opening documentary	2014-03-25	4	3	1

Obama  does not like America, the America that we were founded on and the America we are as a nation. Michelle Obama is the same. Seeing this movie and re-watching it really brought out what we do not know about why Obama does not like America and why he wants to ""change"" it. Something that was stated toward the beginning of the documentary is that who we are as adults is partially influenced by our upbringing. While we can change some things about ourselves there are some characteristics that are just there. I did not believe this as a young adult but as I have gotten older I see it in my own children and myself and those around me. Obama is no different. This movie really supports that reality. It is an excellent movie. It does not bashes Obama like many have thought, but really delves into his past and explains much about him. What we as Americans really need to ask ourselves is what do you want for your country, your children and your grandchildren, because what Obama wants is a ""very different"" America. Keep in mind, if he is elected, he has 4 more years to continue his quest to ruin America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave.

There are simply audio clips, cut out of sections without explaining the context, and pasted over non-relevant imagery in order to form a negative opinion about a great, great President (one of, if not the best Presidents we've ever had).The people who give this film 5 stars, well, it's surprising they can even use a computer since their minds are so warped and twisted by the likes of Glenn Beck and sites like The Blaze and WND. They (conservative fringe groups) have somehow deluded themselves into thinking that they are this 'silent majority' than could actually re-claim the country -- sometimes by force.It is sickening, delusional thoughts spouted off by sad, lonely people who simply don't like blacks, multiculturalism, or any ideas that differ from their own. These evil, raging people who frequently vote for the party of greed (GOP) have this way of taking a factual sentence and stripping away all of the facts, leaving only their own misguided opinions and false beliefs.These people would rather shove Christianity and it's lies down people's throats than accept the fact that Jesus is make-believe, God is no longer needed, and the Bible is a lie.But, no...they'd rather just hate on the black 'muslim' president, and pretend that words like 'communism' and 'socialism' are bad words.Here's a hint: they're not bad words. I'm openly a socialist and I'm proudly American. American doesn't mean ""GOP or leave."" It means a bunch of ideas coming together to accomplish a number of tasks. And, one of those ideas, like it or not, is socialism and communism.I'm proud of Obama. And He's a great leader.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A34PS3WWD52X2L	La Mayimba	"I just watched this film and my advice to anyone who watches it - fact check, fact check, fact check.  Then use your heads.The entire premise for this film is simply non-existent.Having read both of Obama's books during the democratic primaries in 2008, I am scratching my head at how a personal autobiography which illustrates this man's depth and grasp of history, his love of literature and excellent writing skills, can be construed to personify him as an angry Kenyan Colonialist bent upon destroying America is simply beyond me.The film commences with Mr. D'Souza wondering how Obama could return the Churchill bust (false), support Argentina in the Falkland issue over Britain (he was neutral), sign an executive order to send 2 million dollars to Brazil among others (just not true).  All are either totally false or have been grossly misrepresented to make his case.  D'Souza also asserts Obama is not desirous of halting Iran's quest for nuclear weapons, and expounded the same old silly story that ignores geopolitical complexities - Obama's hesitance to intervene in Syria and much less in Iran (we have been there - remember the Shah - and we all know how that worked out).  How ANYONE could imagine an American president desirous of Iran's achieving nuclear capabilities is simply beyond the pale.I believe this is a totally ineffective film and dangerous in that it gives credence to urban legends and speculative theories with no depth.  The conservative base loves it and it continues to perpetrate silly falsehoods about the president that divide, divide, divide America and make us hate one another.  It certainly will not sway any reasonably well-read American in any way shape or form.I myself disagree with many of the president's policies; and it would be so with any president.  But these assertions, that Obama is angry, is a Kenyan Colonialist, communist, Marxist or otherwise, are just silly and empty.  Guilt by association ie Frank Marshall who was actually introduced to Obama by Obama's white grandfather, proves nothing except that Obama enjoyed surrounding himself with people from all walks of life (I share this trait - my close friends are libs, conservative, radical conservatives, radical liberals, etc.)  Marshall died in 1987, when Obama was in his 20s.When I was a kid in the 60s, I marched on Cadillac for civil rights, I had black panther friends in San Francisco - I was a total revolutionary.  I saw the injustices inherent in our system (as there are in ANY system), and I railed against inequality - but I always loved and still love my country.As president, I would like SOMEONE to point out Obama's communist policies.  We see the stock market over 13,000, we see corporate profits way up.  We did not see Obama nationalizing failing companies.  I would also like someone to point out his ""anger.""

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2PEVLETUSVAIA	"Laura L. Hubka ""Lhubka"""	"After seeing this movie and THEN going to look up everything it spoke about I realized that it is nothing more than a ""scare tactic"" film.  There is just so much wrong with it.Like many conservatives, D'Souza has magnified some of President Obama's pre-presidential companions and a few quotes from Barack Obama Sr. calling for progressive taxation and the force of state power to guarantee economic equality and extrapolated them to explain why Obama is Obama. D'Souza's thesis began as a Forbes article, merged into his 2010 book The Roots of Obama's Rage, and forthcoming Obama's America, and finally an hour-and-a-half documentary ""2016: Obama's America.""The movie is an assertion, President Obama is somehow anti-American or un-American, but it is supported by circumstantial evidence and ends up riddled with inconsistencies and logical errors.The majority of conservative outrage at Obama has centered on the Democratic president's supposed Marxism: bromides on wealth redistribution and socialized medicine. But ""2016&#8243; is really a foreign policy movie thinly disguised as a movie about a domestic-minded president. In fact, the specific domestic policies are barely remarked upon.""2016&#8243; begins with an autobiographical sketch of D'Souza himself growing up in India and reading about the great empires of Rome and Great Britain. He even goes so far as to imply America is an empire, although qualifying it as an ""empire of ideals.""The point of the movie is that President Obama is not an authentic American in the mold of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin because as a product of a third world upbringing, Obama is an anticolonialist, opposing the traditional imperial powers and thereby favoring poorer nations he believes have been oppressed. But unless Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin were also democracy-crusading nationalists with a particular attachment to a foreign state, then neither is Dinesh D'Souza an authentic American.Exhibit A of D'Souza's evidence of Obama's anticolonialism is the president's decision to remove the bronze bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office.The bust imbroglio, however, was not quite what it seemed. The bust was a loan, not a gift, to President George W. Bush and only for the duration of his administration. Then-prime minister Gordon Brown offered to extend the loan, but the new president declined. So, Obama may have returned the bust, but the spirit of the accusation, that he unceremoniously returned it, is false.None of this confirms or refutes Barack Obama is a Marxist and anticolonialist at heart. But even if they are true they are not reflected in reality even if they exist in the collective Republican conscience.A long-time advocate of a single-payer health care system, Obama capitulated and signed into law the Affordable Care Act, written by the insurance companies, that forces Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine. ObamaCare may be unjust, but it is not socialized medicine. As for being an anticolonialist, one might want to find another term to describe a president who has done nothing to speed up withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, intervened in Libya, and drone bombed Pakistan, a country that was under the colonial thumb of Great Britain.D'Souza uses the intervention in Libya to stop genocide as evidence of Obama's peculiarity, but he neglects to mention that it involved teaming with former colonial powers Great Britain and France. Although the point of Libya in the film is to show Obama's inconsistency by staying out of Syria where a bigger genocide may be taking place, this is a major problem for D'Souza's thesis. Why would an anticolonialist align with two of history's big colonial powers in an act of unprovoked aggression against a third world quasi-socialist country?Near the end, in the hypothetical 2016 that follows a second Obama term, a barbed wire appears on a map sequestering the borders of north African countries, extending to the Middle East, and south Asia with a green flag covering it. The flag may or may not have been intended to represent alleged Iranian hegemony, but it deliberately conjures images of Western propaganda films depicting the Nazi or Soviet flags covering the European continent.Here D'Souza is either playing dumb or is confused about his countries. Should Obama have intervened in Syria and removed the Assad regime that is aligned with Iran? One of the primary reason given for a prospective Syrian intervention is because it would weaken Iran, not strengthen it, because the fighters, particularly those affiliated with al Qaeda, are Sunnis and therefore enemies of Iran.But perhaps the icing on the cake is D'Souza's decision to include Daniel Pipes as his ""Middle East expert"" to make the anticolonial case. Pipes, a neoconservative currently affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, whose only policy prescription is ""Bomb Iran,"" also infamously stated that he would vote for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if he could, presumably because that would assure that relations between the United States and Iran remain frigid, thus keeping intervention on the table. If D'Souza had genuinely wanted an expert without ideological baggage he could have hardly done worse than Daniel Pipes.One need not be a ""birther"" to be curious and even fascinated by Obama's exotic youth, upbringing, and education, if in fact Obama was reared differently from every previous American president. But D'Souza's case that Obama is an inauthentic American and an anti-American president would be better supported if he had relied on more than stock conservative fears, because despite the different background, as president, Barack Obama has not imported anything fundamentally alien to either the Democratic Party or the American body politic. Even the toxic health care law has Republican DNA. The Obama presidency, for good and bad, is a result of the administrations that preceded it.There was certainly more to ""2016: Obama's America"" than can be adequately recorded in a movie review, but the ideological presumptions distract from and derail what could have been a useful educational resource about a mysterious and still perplexing president."	1.0	Joke	2012-09-30	219	67	152

Obama's ideas were set in motion based on the premise of taking from the rich and giving to the poor which brings to mind Robin Hood and his Merry Men.  However, this approach can not work here in America.  We are drowning in debt and taxing the rich more is NOT the answer to the problem unless serious ""tax reform"" is instituted into the equation.  The top 1-2% giving more will not ease the debt, BUT, a fair tax that is shared by ALL living here would help tremendously.2016 Obama's America --> Is there one among you that can honestly say or believe that there are not leeches/moochers milking the system?!!  For example, the FREE phone plan with 250 FREE minutes each and every month is one of THE best examples that was documented by a news station that was NOT FOX NEWS.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2INPSF1AA2RU8	Lientje	There has been so much said about this film already that I don't need to go into a lot of detail.  I will say that oneshould have been able to expect more out this EX-college president than we would from, say, Rush Limbaugh, or Glenn Beck.But instead we are told that X + Y automatically = Z when that is absolutely not the case.  For instance X (Communist Poet)+ Y (grandpa who had a friendship with said poet, &  occasionally dragged sonny along to their chat fests in restaurants andbars) = a future socialist Commie leader of the US.  The fact of the matter is, of course, that many many blacks and otherunderdogs and their supporters joined the Communist Party in those days and the vast majority of them eventually left it.  Another cringing aside here.  In the tough movies and books a  member of the Communist Party was always a CARD CARRYINGmember, not just a plain old member who showed up at meetings or not.  In this movie some pathetic soul not only says&#34;card carrying&#34; but whips out a card of sorts and gives us the number.  I wonder if this is one of the reason why severalpeople praised the production values.Another &#34;wonderful&#34; production value.  D'Souza interviewing all these people on the phone which apparently is meant to seemlike they are giving on on-the-spot and off-the-cuff interview when in fact they are having their own &#34;teleprompter&#34; moments.This guy was hired by some college to be the President of their college and this is what they got for their efforts.

Understand that for entertainment value on a scale of 1 to 10  I rate it a 4. So unless you are looking for something in the drama or comedy or other than a political horror story. Then this in my opinion is not for you. I watched this after reading The post president and was impressed with were and how Obama has a very fragile mind set. The book also explains a lot as well. If you want to know what type of person we are dealing with as our president, then you will want to watch and keep an open mind while doing so, if you can.	4.0	Very well and information is excellent.	2012-11-03	12	6	6

Amazon is BIG, and obviously does not want to ruffle the wrong feathers. Amazon IS a business, and their intent is to make money. They are protecting their....ass-ets.This story was taken from Obama's own words. Anyone who looks around, and can't see that the government IS the problem, that they have to much power and greed, AND re-elected him, sadly it's to late for them. They have already been brainwashed.He himself was brainwashed by his mother, to idolize his womanizing, bigamist, wife beathing, drunken, poor excuse for a child deserting, anti-american father.The government does have a communist agenda. They want everyone dependent on them. Your money, your food, and your health care. (Welfare/food stamps/Obamacare). Almost half of the people in this country are dependent on the government.People stand by while the government gradually passes more and more laws, taking away our rights and our freedom. They are chipping away at the Constitution. He's already said he's not going to follow any laws he doesn't like. The UN has a plan to DEpopulate. He's passed a law giving him security protetion for life. He plans to get rid of the 22 nd Amendment so he can run again.When he is sworn into office later this month, he will put his hand on the Bible (Not the Koran) and SWEAR to uphold the Constitution.God!

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AD72DGUUIAHRA	Linda Dansberger	Barack Obama was elected to the presidency in 2008 by the American people.  The movie speaks for itself in revealing this man of mystery and his past, present.  This journey was filmed in 2012 just before his second term of office. It takes you into how the old foreign empires functioned and into America's &#34;land of the free&#34; with liberty and justice for all. We see how Obama's past has influenced his decision making and how the realignment of nations as well as the shape of the world can be affected.  It brings your emotions on a roller coaster ride as you learn more about what makes this man tick in the heart of the world's most powerful office. Will America be redefined by 2016?

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3M64JHUVM92TM	LINDA VANTASSELL	Whether you are a liberal or conservative, Obama supporter or no, there is value in this documentary for everyone.  The first half of the documentary focuses on Obama's family history all the way up to the death of his father.  I think this information is beneficial to everyone and is factually represented.The second half of the documentary is where I think people will deviate as to whether they think it's good or bad, useful or not, factual or theory, despite the fact that it's based upon Obama's own writings.All in all, I would say that this documentary is very insightful; and if the theories are to be believed, it is very unsettling.  While some of the end theories are yet to be proven, Obama's actions, thus far, go hand-in-hand with the anti-colonialist, anti-American viewpoint; and if the rest are to be fulfilled, the horizon looks very bleak for America.The summation of the documentary says it all, no matter which side you fall on, the future of America is not in the hands of Obama.  It is in the hands of the people.I think everyone owes it to themselves to be as informed as possible.  This includes viewing the documentary before judging it, reading Obama's own books, familiarizing yourself with his voting records and actions, and coming to your own conclusions.  If you denounce this film because you think it's anti-Obama, you are doing a disservice to your own self, your own mind, and your own conscience.  There are truths to be learned and information to be gleaned.	5.0	Insightful and at times, Unsettling	2012-10-25	22	16	6

D'Souza does well presenting actual quotes from Obama's autobiography ""Dreams for My Father"".  The fault I find here is that there were a lot of assumptions made, or at least I will consider them assumptions because factual backup was omitted.  (ex. Obama had an educational background from his prep school in Hawaii - no info backing this up)2.) Obama's father.  D'Souza once again does well, via interviews, published articles, etc. tying Barack Obama Sr. to  a radical anti-colonialism agenda.  However there are more assumptions based Obama Sr.'s friends having identical extremist beliefs.3.) 2016 projection.  While D'Souza did call it a 'projection' and it seems plausible if you believe the story line that D'Souza previously presented, the project relies on one fact that is hard to believe: Obama will forsake the best interests of America to push his (and his father's) person ideology.Overall, I was provoked into some deep thought with what D'Souza presented.  There were parts where I was consumed by the story.  And there were other parts I missed because I was wondering how D'Souza came to certain assumptions.While some may call this slanderous, right-wing propaganda...one has to keep something in mind: This is a documentary.  The entire case for the film is based off of pushing a certain point of view.A lot of the film was very informational.  Other parts, assumptions yet to be proven true or false.I will say that a lot of the factual information was never vetted by MSM....but what is with President Obama.

You are free to agree or disagree with the conclusions, but the filmmaker uses Obama's own words from his biography and develops a full and complete picture of Obama's childhood and the influences that shaped him.  The film takes you to India, Kenya, Indonesia and Hawaii.  After you see it, you will know a lot more about our President and where he is taking us.  You will also learn about Kenya and Indonesia and life there.  What a contrast to our lives here in this country.  Obama's  half-brother in Kenya has some very interesting opinions in contrast to those of his famous brother in the White House.  What an engrossing film.  I watched it more than once to fully grasp the entire substance.

He included GLOBALISM as part of America's ""recipe"". Oh REALLY ??? That sure as HELL is not part of the USA's ""recipe"" NOR is it a part of our Constitution.Oh yes, we are allowing it to creep in {can't believe I have to say anything so disgusting and true} but the way he said that was if it's just us and the way we are. Very matter of fact. Well I'd like to say NO IT IS NOT. If we let it happen yeah, we are going to get swallowed by Globalism. {New World Order}. NO IT IS NOT ""PART OF OUR RECIPE"". I am really annoyed by that statement and Dinesh ought to explain himself on that statement of his.2. Made the occupy movement sound only negative. It didn't go perfectly no, but hey, at least some people got off their butts to protest what is going on. We are supposed to do that, we're Americans and we have the right to get mad and protest.3. There was a third point and I forgot it - likely I'll remember it. When I do I'll come back and edit. It was something Dinesh said that didn't jibe - it was just as odd his weird statement that ""Globalism is part of the American recipe"".I thought this DVD was otherwise brilliant and I believe it - but WHAT THE F. with this guy and his crap that the USA has Globalism in it's ""recipe"". ? Listen carefully to him in this film. You might come across the third oddball statement of his that I'm having trouble remembering-Dinesh had me agreeing with nearly everything but he'd slip in these bizarre statements.So I don't entirely trust him, and after seeing the DVD I sure as Hell don't trust Obama. No secret he's been taking apart the Constitution,I already knew that. Now though,it's more clear as to why. And he ought to be impeached. America is being attacked from within as many of us know.

Phillips	"As someone who has worked and traveled all over the world including the middle east and Asia, I can relate and attest to Dinesh's documentary. There are those that say that it's a right-wing political movie. Of course. What else would one who is in denial or wants to cover the truth say? If you can't rebut the facts, call them names and call them crazy.Regardless, the concept of ""checking the background of someone in such a high position"" is intelligent for so many reasons. There is no reason why one would not want to look into the past, the people, and influences into our President's life. Why not? Companies do way more investigating on an individuals they hire. As any psychologist would contend; a person's past, their influences and experiences are what make them who they are. The interesting thing is that Dinesh simply follows the people and footsteps that Obama talks about in his own book. When Obama says in his own book and it's documented that Frank Marshall Davis was a big influence in Obama's life, it's hard to argue with this. And for someone to just ignore that Frank Marshall Davis was a documented card carrying Communist that was high on the FBI watch list, is baffling. Anyone enamored with someone that much that they ignore the facts he writes in his own book are either blind, in denial, ignorant, or all of the above.Great job Dinesh!"	5.0	Very enlightening & scary	2012-10-23	18	13	5

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	ALND45MWBGUQS	Lunar Boulevard	Back in 2008 I remember being puzzled at the hype surrounded Barack Obama. Fellow students and friends were hanging on every word and I remember celebrations and joyful outbursts floating across campus the night he won. It just didn't make sense to me and I always felt like something wasn't right. Here was a man who came out of nowhere, swooned everyone into loving him, and had no clear experience or new ideas to bring to the table. I always felt that something was missing and I couldn't put my finger on what it was about Obama that I found so frightening. I'm a conservative but it was more than just a difference of ideas. There was something about what he said and it made me uneasy. I figured he was just incompetent and unable to rise up to the role of Leader of the Free World. That may very well be true. However, 2016: Obama's America finally proposes a theory that makes sense and does it in a compelling and respectful manner.Dinesh D'Souza did his homework and takes us into Obama's past, present, and the probable future if he retains power in the White House. One thing I really appreciated about this film was that it examines Obama's life and beliefs without being mean-spirited. There are no personal attacks, hateful remarks, or unfair shots. Everything is calmly and easily laid out in a conversational manner, sucking the viewer in without insulting their intelligence. There's also nothing in here about Romney or any Republican candidates. This is solely Obama's film and he is the main focus.D'Souza's theory is brilliant and he uses Obama's own words to prove his points. For the past few years I kept trying to figure out how Obama could do what he does and why so many harmful and questionable policies have been enacted. D'Souza's assertion that Obama holds an anti-colonial view of America was the missing puzzle piece I was looking for. Granted, only the president himself knows what he really believes. This is simply the theory that makes the most sense and I believe it's spot on. The facts and interviews are very revealing and give D'Souza's commentary the weight they need to really be persuasive. The production values on the film are excellent. This doesn't look like some half-baked documentary or propaganda piece. It moves at a brisk pace and keeps you engaged from start to finish. The last ten minutes are especially chilling and a serious look at what America, as well as the rest of the world, may look like if Obama gets four more years. Any open-minded and serious voter should see this and give it consideration.If you're an Obama supporter then chances are you've either dismissed this film or haven't seen it, which I'm guessing many of the negative reviews here prove. On the flip side, the detractors will feel validated after watching this and it will probably reiterate what you already know. Every American needs to be informed and make up their own mind after examining all of the facts. This film gave me the confidence to stand by what I've believed since 2008: we really don't know Obama and we can't afford his policies for another term.	5.0	The Missing Piece of the Puzzle	2012-10-16	0	0	0

He misinterprets and misrepresents President Obama's stance on foreign policy by suggesting that the President is an anti-colonialist. If D'Souza was more educated beyond his undergraduate training, he would know that President Obama is not an anti-colonialist but working through the process of decolonization which is a totally separate issue that D'Souza doesn't seem to understand. Decolonization is a continuing process for all people, Americans included. Sadly, D'Souza believes the world still needs the U.S. as global police and it is because of this kind of fundmentalism that wars are being waged and cultural imperialism destroys other countries while displacing indigenous people. D'Souza doesn't admit to supporting the most heinous crimes that come out of colonialism and imperialism (a more articulated version of colonialism) and that is the violation of human rights on a global scale."	1.0	Denish D'Souza	2012-11-02	28	9	19

It is interesting only as study in propaganda and it would make Doktor Goebbels proud.In other words, it has technical merit; it is well-made. But it is fiction mostly. President Obama is an inscrutable and cynical intellectual to be sure. He is also a classical liberal at heart and he is too smart to ever show that hand or to allow it stand before useful consensus. The idea that he is waiting for a second term to unleash a secret radical agenda is just fear-mongering. Second term Presidents are less political and more philosophic. In his second term, Obama will track a bit towards his liberal roots but more towards his legacy and that will stand or die upon his ability to remain politically accommodating. He and Romney are birds of a feather. Neither of these men is radical. THAT is their mutual indictment and virtue.	4.0	This is a Republican Hit-Piece	2012-10-18	27	7	20

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2DAHERP7HYJGO	Mark Turner	Documentaries have never been a popular film genre in the U.S. On occasion a rare documentary will capture the attention of the film going public, it will get an increase in hype and the movie will take off at the box office. But for the most part it rarely happens which is sad.More sad it the recent trend in documentaries to be so over the top one sided that most become more propaganda than actual films about the topic being discussed. Rather than take movies like this to task for some reason, they've been held as the standard for the genre. The most blatant example of these are the films made by Michael Moore. Having won an Oscar for one and having made the most financially successful documentary to date, Moore's films are more about himself and his beliefs than they are about an open minded discussion of ideas seeking a center of the road approach. In Moore's films, it's his way or the highway. The fact that numerous web sites have popped up to show the falsehoods in his films says a lot.So into this genre comes a new picture. And just like Moore's film FARENHEIT 9/11 which was released only weeks before this country voted for a new President, so has this film been released, in theaters months before hand but now on DVD within a month of the national election for President. That film is 2016: OBAMA'S AMERICA.I'll admit up front that I tend to lean conservative when it comes to politics but when I'm watching a film I try to judge it based on what it presents, how it presents it and just how misleading it can be. There have been propaganda pieces done by the right as much as by the left. The only difference is that in Hollywood to lean right means to be chastised as out of touch or a traitor so folks rarely have movies made with that political perspective. If you don't think that's true, try telling Stacy Dash.So when I sat down to watch this film I wanted to see if it was no more than a film much like the ones Moore has made or was it more of a true documentary? I'm glad to say that while it doesn't present President Obama in the best light, it does seem well researched and even handed. Rather than insert insults and caustic comments, the film offers interviews with various participants and allows them to speak for themselves.Co-writer/co-director/co-producer Dinesh D'Souza based most of the movie on his novel THE ROOTS OF OBAMA'S RAGE. He begins the film by discussing similarities to his life and that of Obama. Both had a foreign parent, both are men of color, both were born in the same year, both went to Ivy League schools and both graduated from those colleges. But their views on this country and how their views were shaped were vastly different. Where D'Souza saw this as a land of opportunity, Obama's views were of a country where America was trying to rule the world rather than present opportunity.D'Souza focuses much of his research and opinions on the books that Obama wrote, especially DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. In the title alone he theorizes that Obama wasn't writing about dreams presented from his father to him but dreams that his father had. These greatly involved anti-colonialism and in so doing present an image of why he has followed up trying to do some of the things he has done while in office. One example is of his sending a bust of Winston Churchill back to England which many questioned. The reason presented here is that it represented the British Empire which had held his father's land in check for many years.While the better part of the film is discussing the things that D'Souza researched, it doesn't just stick with his ideas but presents the facts through archived footage of the President as well as interviews with people who knew him and his father. The most talked about interview involves his half brother George, a man living in poverty who has never talked to his half brother nor asked him for anything. This man presents a much different picture of the President's father than we've heard before.It also leads to a fearful prediction of where this country will go if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. This is the only section where rather than go with straight facts D'Souza theorizes as to what might happen. Granted, he uses the words of those interviewed as well as information well known about the President's past history and who he was shaped by while growing up, but it's still just theory. The good part is that D'Souza never presents it as anything more than that. It's his belief, something Moore never seems to state in his films.While the movie is well made and well researched, it is sure to cause controversy, more so since the DVD release has been made so close to the election. It is a film that many should watch just to find out things that the major media failed to discover or at least reveal during the election of 2008.Sadly the film will find supporters that will cheer portions of it blindly thinking of it as an attack film which it definitely is not. Those on the other side of the fence will condemn the film and talk about how it's filled with lies while never viewing it. Rather than allow the far ends of either right or left make the decision for you, I would suggest that people watch the film and make up their own minds. I would also suggest that rather than except anything seen as pure fact, do more research and find out the answers to the questions it raises. In any event, this is one film that should be seen.	4.0	EYE OF THE BEHOLDER	2012-10-16	111	80	31

Dinesh D'Souza has done a very respectful job in making this film. I was rather surprised to find that this was the case because I had heard nothing but negative reviews and responses over the film. Those who react negatively for any single reason or motivation will miss the real value of this film. This film gives a more clear understanding of who Obama is and where he is coming from.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS	Mary Esterhammer-Fic	"I read ""The Roots of Obama's Rage,"" on which this movie is based, shortly after it came out. I agree with much of what Dinesh D'Souza says about Barack Obama, and D'Souza builds the case around his thesis very competently: Obama was groomed to be an anti-colonialist, sees the U.S. as a colonial power, and is dedicated to ""correcting"" our society to make up for past mistakes.  Unfortunately, Obama's approach, if successful, will cripple--if not destroy--American culture, and it will take decades to repair the damage.Some of the problems people have mentioned, with this movie, are the flashbacks and D'Souza's insertion of his own personal experiences as an immigrant coming from a background almost identical to Obama's. I don't find the flashbacks annoying, but D'Souza's personal journey was, perhaps, a bit overplayed. Obama's own memoirs and the comments of his friends offer more than enough evidence to support D'Souza's claims.The Jesuits used to say, ""Give us a child until he is seven, and you can have him for the rest of his life."" That's true: the events that played out in young Barry's life formed who he is as a politician. Even his most ardent supporters would benefit from watching this film and considering some of the questions posed by Obama's early experiences.Two mentors are given the attention they deserve: Frank Marshall Davis, who is such a hardcore Communist he makes Stalin look just slightly to the left of Joe McCarthy, and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who is still stung by Obama's rejection of their relationship.I was impressed that D'Souza included a few segments with Daniel Pipes, one of the world's foremost experts on radical political Islam. I've followed Pipes for years, and have yet to find his analysis of any issue off the mark. Pipes is solid; the film is worth watching just for his comments.Obama's view of America's place in the world is disturbing on a very fundamental level. He almost speaks in code when he makes statements about foreign policy, but if you KNOW the code, his perspective is pretty creepy. This will help you understand why he says what he says, and what impact those statements will have on the country in the coming years, if he's re-elected. (We've recently seen some of how this plays out regarding the Benghazi murders.)This movie gives every registered voter important information about the candidate. If you haven't had time to read ""Dreams from My Father"" or ""Roots of Obama's Rage,"" this movie will give you insight into both books.In less than a week, the election will be decided. Whether or not Obama wins, the message of this movie will resonate. Viewers will either be relieved that we dodged a major cultural bullet, or we'll know what we need to brace ourselves for.Either way, it might be a good time to start reciting the prayer to St. Michael."	4.0	How fast can we decline in four years?	2012-10-31	12	8	4

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI	Matthew P. Cochrane	"For those unfamiliar with the premise, 2016: Obama's America follows bestselling author Dinesh D'Souza's carefully chosen steps as he travels the world in an attempt to better understand Barack Obama. The journey takes him from the Hawaiian Islands to Indonesia; from the slums of Nairobi, Kenya to the seat of the world's largest superpower in Washington, D.C. Along the way he interviews relatives, scholars, and other sources of information on Obama's life.This movie should not be mistaken for a conspiracy theorist's quest for truth on Obama. There are no baseless charges or accusations based on the place of Obama's birth, religion or college transcripts. In fact, about fifteen minutes into D'Souza's film he matter-of-factly states Obama was born in Hawaii, as was reported by two Hawaiian newspapers on the day of his birth. Even Slate's Dave Weigel begrudgingly acknowledges D'Souza stands on ""mostly solid"" ground, steering clear of conspiracy charges making rounds in conservative circles.Instead, D'Souza intentionally traces the steps of Obama's upbringing, attempting to explain Obama's sometimes baffling decisions. Decisions like returning a bust of Winston Churchill to Great Britain at the beginning of his presidency, delaying the construction of the Keystone pipeline while giving money to South American countries to drill for oil, cherry-picking where to intervene in the Middle East (e.g. using force in Libya but not Iran or Syria), reducing America's nuclear arsenal while making no moves to stop Iran from making nuclear weapons, and reducing NASA's mission to Muslim outreach are all examined. D'Souza's conclusion? Obama is an anti-colonialist.Anti-colonialism, D'Souza explains, is the worldview that sees America's net effect in the world as bad, not good. It also is the belief that America and European countries got wealthy not through capitalism, entrepreneurship, and innovation, but by exploiting Third World countries and stealing their natural resources.Through interviews with Obama's father's friends and colleagues, and a close examination of some of Barack Sr.'s written work, D'Souza shows that Obama's father espoused this very worldview. Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, though only married to Barack Sr. for a short time, always loved and respected him. By reading passages from Obama's book, Dreams from My Father, D'Souza shows that Ann passed many of Obama's father's beliefs to our president when they lived in Indonesia with her second husband during Obama's childhood.As Obama grew older, he began associating himself only with leftwing radicals. A passage from Dreams reveals Obama picked his friends ""carefully"", choosing to associate himself only with those who shared his political and cultural beliefs.Some of these associations are just scary. Frank Marshall Davis became a close mentor of Obama's during his formative years. In Dreams from My Father, Obama mentions Davis numerous times attesting to their close relationship. Davis was a Communist Party member who was under constant surveillance by the FBI, who had direct orders to pick him up immediately if war ever broke out between the Soviet Union and the United States. Of course, there are also the more well-known associations of Obama like Bill Ayers, the known leftwing terrorist, and Jeremiah Wright, Obama's pastor of more than 20 years. The relationships between these men and Obama are all explored at length during the film.Some of the interviews in the movie score major points. While in Kenya, D'Souza brings one of Obama's father's wives three goats for the right to talk to talk to her (even though her speaking fee was just one). She quickly turns cold, however, after a phone call and tells Dinesh he must leave. Many of Obama's father's friends and relatives who met Barack when he visited Kenya after his father's death, describe the father's and son's ideology as identical. This is especially chilling after D'Souza shows an article authored by Barack Sr. in which he states it would be theoretically okay to tax people with tax rates as high as 100% as long as they were compensated in return with commensurate government services.D'Souza's coup de grace has to be his time spent with Obama's half-brother George Obama. George is also a scholar of sorts having authored a book a couple of years ago. Unfortunately for George, however, he deviates from the family's anti-colonialist beliefs; thus he is largely ostracized from his family and lives on a couple bucks a day in a small hut in Nairobi, Kenya.George believes that white people, meaning Americans and Europeans, were good for the development of Third World countries. He even goes as far to say that white people were even a net positive in countries like South Africa, where the native population was oppressed and discriminated against for centuries by their colonialists. For proof, George points to the economic development of countries like South Korea, Singapore and South Africa which were once on economic par with Kenya but have now far surpassed the economic prowess of the central African country mired in poverty.The end of the movie turns into a horror show as D'Souza speculates what Obama might wish to do in a second term. In short: You ain't seen nothin' yet. With good reason, D'Souza believes we will see higher taxes, more spending, more attempts to lower the number of nuclear warheads in the U.S. and no resistance to our enemies building their arsenals. Most frighteningly, D'Souza fears a United States of Islam might emerge in the Middle East, isolating Israel even more from the rest of the world.Credit is also due to Dinesh: He lets you see when he falls short. Throughout the course of the interview with George Obama, D'Souza tries to get George to say that Barack should help him more. Instead, George gently demurs and states that he is an adult and perfectly capable of taking care of himself. George says that Barack has enough on his plate without having to help his half-brother he only met once a long time ago. Instead of editing this bit out, however, D'Souza leaves it in, confident enough to let you in on his shortcomings.This is where the similarities to Michael Moore end. While the documentary employs the same slick editing and fast pace of a Moore documentary, it employs none of the ambush/gotcha-style interview tactics commonly seen in Moore's films.As I write this 2016 has surpassed the $20 million mark in ticket revenues, making it the fifth largest political documentary of all-time. To say that the low cost endeavor, with virtually no promotional backing but heavily-promoted by talk radio, has surpassed expectations would be an understatement. The NY Daily News goes as far to proclaim that the movie has ""shocked"" industry insiders. For comparison, Rocky Mountain Pictures, the studio behind 2016, had previously never produced a film that surpassed even $12 million.All in all, D'Souza has given us a highly entertaining and informative feature-length documentary that is well worth the price of admission. Even for someone like me, who follows the news religiously through several mediums, I exited the theater feeling like a I learned a lot about our president, his worldview, and ultimately, where he wants to take the country."	4.0	Not Michael Moore hackery, this movie deserves serious consideration	2012-10-13	168	130	38

I was once very liberal when I was younger, and as I aged became more conservative. However, when this man spoke, I could feel it in my bones, I absolutely had to believe in him. I've seen what this country has gone through in the last 3.75 years since he's been president. Because of my discontent and dissatisfaction, I have studied politics on both sides as if were my religion. I am not pushed from being a centrist to completely supporting Romney and his ideology towards American Economic Recovery. Dinesh D'Souza did an excellent, objective, and very pragmatic documentary which doesn't paint him as evil or necessarily a sleeper int he White House. It just points out that because of who was as a child, and who he surrounded himself as he grew older; may in some sense explain many things that we've always wondered about President Obama. A man with a magic tongue, a master orator since Hitler, possibly a socialist and borderline Wells/Marxist......definitely the person who promised hope and change and delivered a debt so high my grandchildren will never see the ceiling of. Excellent film, great imitative, and kudos for the guts to defy mainstream media and national popularity with regards to politics, social ideology, and philosophy.

Bad judge.Americans have grown lazy and want the government to do everything for them. Hence the election of Obama. D'Souza, in his film 2016, points to all of Obama's radical, left-wing influences throughout his life. And all of them, to one degree or another, hated America. (Note however the interview with Obama's brother in Kenya who yearns for the colonialists to return to help rule over Kenya.)The opening scene of the film is remarkable.  D'Souza, an immigrant, comes to America to study, against the wishes of a few members of his family who feared a ""racist"" America. He gets to America, to Dartmouth, where he meets young, deluded self-absorbed Americans at an ""international party."" One American babbles incoherently about how ""cool"" and ""far out"" India is. D'Souza asks him what he finds so ""cool"" about bride burnings and the caste system, and the hippie is left in stupefied silence.This story about our president is best told by an immigrant. D'Souza is a man who judged America from afar and then came to embrace that world as a citizen, unlike Obama who still retains hostility toward a country his father and mother both taught him to hate.D'Souza is not ashamed to admit his love for this country. Unlike Obama and his mother and father and grandfather, all of whom revealed an openly hostile attitude toward America in particular and capitalism in general.2016 reveals the true Obama. A man obsessed with getting it right and MAKING it right with his father.  ""It"" being the total transformation of America's political and economic traditions.When people watch a Michael Moore documentary, they are obliged to like it. If they don't, they will suffer the wrath of their liberal friends who will say they have no heart.However, there is no reason or obligation for anyone to like 2016 other than for its accurate presentation of the facts. And it is tempting to observe that if someone does have a negative viewpoint about this film, this might be indicative of someone who has no brain.D'Souzah has no ""dog"" in this race.  He knows what colonialism is and what it did for his country--good and bad. Yet he chooses to dwell on the good, unlike the critics who choose to dwell on the cliche of the ""evil white devil slave master.""For them, it's so much easier to ""loathe thyself"" than to ""love thyself."""	5.0	2016: Beware the Danger of Electing a King Instead of a President	2012-09-30	46	27	19

Supporters talk about the film's ""facts"" but these nuggets are nothing more than conspiratorial assertions. The fabricated guilt-by-association connections between President Obama and his father, as well the ""mentors"" highlighted in the film, are not evidence of anything. It's no more real than the myriad of false accusations Republicans shot at him in during his first term. None of those bore fruit and neither does this film. There's nothing here. It's fiction that pretends it's a documentary in search of some evil truth about President Obama but it just makes the extremist bubble more isolating. It's also a dull film, especially the three-quarters.D'Souza brings his paranoia and sense of entitlement with him everywhere. He's been upset because there were no Oscar nominations for the film.

It does explain a lot of Obama's decisions that I could not understand.  Why he was making the foreign policy decisions he was making, why after preaching about reducing the deficit he has been bent on spending more and more.  No country can defeat us militarily, and until so much of the manufacturing jobs went to other countries no one could  economically.  But with the increasing deficit, bigger and bigger government, and more and more social programs we can't afford our future is definitly not as strong.  If he wants a weaker and less influencial America - his policies make sense.  Otherwise they don't.

What a waste of time this conservative conspiracy theorist narrative was.It starts off by Dinesh saying he is a Republican, and that he worked for Reagan. What kind of movie would you expect from a policy advisor to Ronald Reagan? There is nothing in the world clearer to me than Reagan and Obama having different views on how this country should be ran.The movie is mostly a narrative by Dinesh. Most clips of Obama in this video are him giving his positive speeches, and then Dinesh, ""experts"", and Kenyans give their opinions. This movie needs more facts, and more talking from the President than Dinesh. Way too subjective.Does this documentary provide a little more insight into why Obama thinks the way he does. Yes, I believe Dinesh did a great job there. In fact, I think it makes Obama even more genuine. Obama's past shows the struggles of those around him, how he helps others, and how hard work leads to achieving the American dream.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2T29CXPVEW9V1	M. Hines	"Washington Post Review -- 1 star (out of four)[...]Why is the film called ""2016""? D'Souza's one-sided argument ultimately stoops to fear-mongering of the worst kind, stating in no uncertain terms that, if the president is reelected, the world four years from now will be darkened by the clouds of economic collapse, World War III (thanks to the wholesale renunciation of our nuclear superiority) and a terrifyingly ascendant new ""United States of Islam"" in the Middle East. These assertions are accompanied by footage of actual dark clouds and horror-movie music.The real bogeyman isn't Obama, who D'Souza acknowledges can come across as an appealing and charismatic leader. That honor is shared by several men D'Souza refers to as Obama's ""founding fathers,"" in an unsubtle dig at the president's patriotism. It's a group that includes communist Frank Marshall Davis; former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers; academic Edward Said, whose views are described as anti-Zionist; liberal Harvard professor Roberto Unger; and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a proponent of so-called black liberation theology.None of the names of these putative villains is new, which gives ""2016"" the air of a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequel, pandering to the franchise's hard-core fans, while boring everyone else."	1.0	Nothing But a Slick Informercial	2012-11-13	26	10	16

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AHDI5V2CXBV5R	"mhouse ""ple8en"""	"I resisted seeing this movie until a family member decided we had to see it.First, the documentary's 88 minutes felt like two hours.  There's quite a lot of filler material where there is no dialogue but plenty of images, mostly of impoverished nations like India and Indonesia.  Some of the editing was quite good, especially in those sequences where there was the director on the phone with the person he's interviewing while the person being interviewed is also being filmed at his/her location separately.The movie contained a handful of misleading items where the video of Obama or someone else was taken out of context to impart the views of the movie's director.  I found the ""damning"" evidence of Obama's alleged socialist or communist tendencies and anti-Americanism to be unconvincing.  This is no Michael Moore-caliber documentary where facts come at you left and right and you need several viewings to digest it all.  I'm not convinced for a second about Obama being anti-American.  Not much exists to convince me he doesn't like this country.  However, I am somewhat convinced of his anti-imperialist leanings, in particular, where he might (please note the word: MIGHT) think the US, in the form of its elite citizens and corporations, has employed resource rape across the globe.  I'm in agreement that America, just like Europe before it was superseded, has committed crimes in other countries, both political and economic.  The American public needs to see that the USA isn't the darling its media pretends it is.The movie's greatest error is in its flimsy conclusions.  Obama's desire to reduce nuclear weapons, including our own, is painted as a weakness.  Apparently, you are a real American only if you think we should have more weapons than anyone else.  Obama's desire for a world-wide reduction in nuclear weapons is viewed as a negative as well.  The director asks one person ""What if America isn't America?"" which is a ridiculously biased question implying that under Obama's leadership the country will become something else, something other than what the director thinks.Unmentioned in this movie are Obama's stances on drone ""kill lists"" and his initial refusal to sign NDAA into law and then changing his mind, signing what is clearly a heinous piece of unconstitutional legislation.  These issues are real and immediate dangers to American values and they get no mention here.  If you're going to slam Obama, at least attack his record as President using some facts instead of innuendo and guilt by association.The movie also seems to suggest that every bad thing that is occurring in this country is Obama's fault.  Yes, his deficits are the largest in history but if deficits mattered, where were people when Bush added his $4 trillion and the other Presidents added their amounts?  If Obama's deficit is the only one that matters, then I have to question people's sanity.I am left feeling that the only people who would agree with this movie are those who already hold a negative view of Obama.  The movie fails miserably in proving any of its viewpoints.  Hanging out with communists or socialists doesn't mean you are one.  If you hang out with gay people does that turn you gay?  If you hang out with someone who's critical of America, does that mean you will be too?  This documentary makes logical leaps that are too broad and unsupported.I'm grateful this documentary didn't have any measurable effect on the 2012 election, though I didn't vote for Obama myself this time or earlier.  In summary, this documentary does ask a few intriguing questions but its ""conclusions"" are just vague predictions stitched together from too wide a fabric of facts."	2.0	Documentary designed for Fox News viewers	2012-12-17	19	13	6

He said that God revealed to him that a ""dark skinned man would be the last president of the United States of America"". He went on to explain in detail that he believed Christ would come back during this term and receive His people.Now, all devout Christians know that the Holy Bible teaches no man knows the day or the hour of the coming of our Lord.  But our old pastor had a rare spiritual gift- and ton of insight.Now I believe that what God revealed to him was not the coming of our Lord, but the demise of America as we know it.  President Obama will likely get re-elected, and our nation as we know it will cease to exist.  Sure, it sounds like crazy doomsday conspiracy theory rhetoric.

However, the movie is so well done, articulated and filmed that I guarantee whatever your political persuasion you will find this movie more than worth your time.D'nish does a great job of explaining colonialization and why it has affected Obama the way it has.His brother has so many of Obama's mannerisms, it's earie...but is very articulate and looks a lot like his famous brother. He is in favor of white influence in Africa and explains why he thinks S. Africa is doing so much better than his country, Kenya.I also thought Obama's family dynamics (absentee father, step father, mother, grandmother, grandfather and his mentor) were interesting and how this inspired Obama...If you think Obama is great and really do believe this to be the case, you should LOVE this movie because the words are taken directly from Obama's books...much of it recorded by Obama, and they are just telling you what you must be for...and if you're conservative, perhaps Obama's words are such that you are inspired to get others to see this movie.	5.0	Liberal or Conservative...you will love this movie!	2012-10-05	26	14	12

Gloria Borland, past Hawaii resident, has made an excellent film on Obama's childhood in Hawaii interviewing 47 people including Barack's friends, teachers and family members. Obama did not grow up in Kansas as Dinesh states he was raised in Hawaii by his white, Christian grandparents. As far as 'Obama / 2016' this sensationalized Obama attack piece trots out every negative trope short of birtherism.  It will confirm for Republicans that Obama is an evil anti-American intent on undoing American from the bastion of American power.  Democrats will confirm that Dinesh D'Souza is a right wing, conservative, conspiracy wacko. As a documentary film maker, myself, I will say that Dinesh has succeeded in fabricating a right wing propaganda film.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A25LSNKTK8W9O3	Mike Renzulli	"I must say I like this film. It is based on 2 books authored by D'Souza in which he makes the case that Barack Obama's world view and approach to governing is grounded in anti-Colonialism. In effect, the President wants to see a reduced role for Western civilization (specifically the United States) in world affairs while, simultaneously, strip wealthy countries of their prosperity and redistribute it to third-world nations who have been ""exploited"" by their former occupiers.WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! Dinesh D'Souza draws on a variety of sources to make his case. He interviews members of Obama's family, friends of his father and demonstrates the kind of people who mentored Barack Obama in his college days. His mother, Ann Dunham, was the one who emphasized the goodness of Barack, Sr. and demonstrated her far-left sympathies by divorcing an Indonesian man named Lolo Seotoro. As it turns out Seotoro decided he would leave his job as a government relations officer for Union Oil Company and an enlist in his country's military to fight Communist rebels. Barack's father, D'Souza claims, is the most influential figure in his life thanks to the way the mother built him up and can be seen as such in Barack Obama's own book ""Dreams from My Father"". Barack, Sr. was a non-practicing Muslim-turned-atheist educated overseas. Initially, the President's father did have classical liberal/libertarian sympathies but somehow changed as indicated by some of his friends that were interviewed. During his travels, Barack, Sr. irresponsibly married a number of women and fathered numerous children (including Barack, Jr.). Barack, Sr.'s recklessness not only included womanizing but also abusing alcohol and, consequently, Barack Obama's father met his untimely demise in a car accident in Nairobi, Kenya in 1982.The people who played a large role in shaping the President's world view (i.e. Barack Obama's Founding Fathers) were hardcore leftists and anti-Semites such as Frank Marshall-Davis, William Ayres, Jeremiah Wright, and Edward Said. Each of the men who influenced Obama's life condemned the United States and the prospertiy we enjoy and it should be no surprise that Barack Obama is implementing the policies he has. D'Souza makes a very thoughtful critique of Barack Obama effectvely attempting to present an intellectual profile of him in order to make sense of what the President thinks and why.""2016"", however, should not be taken entirely as Gospel. In my review of some of the things brought up, I did discover some issues raised that were incorrect. For example, D'Souza alleges that Obama returned the bust of Winston Churchill to England since Churchil was the person who put down the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya and represented British colonialism. In fact, the Churchill bust was on loan from England and was to be returned to Great Britain before the President took office. A White House spokesperson states another bust of Churchil is in Obama's private residence. In another segment, D'Souza accuses President Obama of wanting to return control of the Falkland Islands to Argentinia from Great Britian. However, back in April 2012 the U.S. nixed the idea by refusing to approve a resolution at a Summit of the Americas conference declaring the Falkland Islands Argentinian territory.The movie further alleges that Obama has not done anything significant to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms. While the President does oppose an interm military strike against the country, the U.S. spearheaded a U.N. resolution imposing strong sanctions against Iran, and U.S. Naval forces were recently increased in the Persian Gulf. Also, three computer viruses were directed at Iran in which all three actions are geared at disrupting their nuclear ambitions or being a buffer against the Islamist regime's influence. Obama's low opinion of Western civilization (including Jews) is further evidenced by his conduct toward Israel along with his courting Islamist regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and siding Egypt's elected President Mohammed Morsi who is a member of the Nazi-sympathizing Muslim Brotherhood despite Morsi's ouster by the Egyptian military.Despite the movie's flaws, I think D'Souza makes a very strong case as to why Obama is conducting himself the way he is. By understanding what influences Barack Obama's world view it is small wonder that the U.S. economy is in such a downward spiral. Not only have the Fed's recent and past constant credit expansions along with new economic laws passed by Congress resulted in the near stagnation we experience, but Obama has (directly or indirectly) redistributed American wealth from the United States to developing third world nations. He not only authorizes the payout of money to Islamist organziations and regimes, he also has spearheaded spending billions of dollars to fund companies (like Solyndra) geared toward renewable energy that eventually went bankrupt. The new offshore oil drilling rules he pushed for has made the process to obtain drilling permits very cumbersome. As a result of this and his moratorium(s), U.S. oil companies are looking to drill offshore in places other than the Gulf of Mexico. His quasi-nationalization of the healthcare and automobile sectors of the U.S. economy is an extension of his low opinion of capitalism too.In her book ""Philosophy: Who Needs It"", Ayn Rand outlines the power of philosophy by showing its influence in uncommon places. Ms. Rand points out in her essay ""Egalitarianism and Inflation"":""There is only one institution that can arrogate to itself the power legally to trade by means of rubber checks: the government. And it is the only institution that can mortgage your future without your knowledge or consent: government securities (and paper money) are promissory notes on future tax receipts, i.e., on your future production.""She pointed out many times in her speeches and writings that if one wants to understand the actions of someone, you need look no further than the philosophy they subscribe to. In the case of Barack Obama, it is a disdain for American prosperity and the ability to flourish. The left looks to drag down America and other Westernized countries and pragmatically allies themselves with like-minded people (such as Islamists) who will help them achieve their goal naively thinking they will be the remnant to restore society to their liking. It does not matter that the ones who helped them will also clamor for power up to and including going to war against their leftist ""friends"" which will lead to total and complete civil unrest.In a recent interview, Dinesh D'Souza discusses how he ended up becoming the brother of Barack Obama's half-brother George who was also interviewed in ""2016"". George believes that it is Kenya (and not the West's fault) that the country is poor. George's son was in need of an expensive medical treatment due to a serious illness he contracted and asked D'Souza for money to pay for it. Upon confirming George's story was true, D'Souza wired George a thousand dollars. When asked as to why George didn't call Barack, essentially, George stated Barack doesn't talk to him anymore.In his book, Barack Obama also talks about a lunch he had in China with his half-brother Mark who is a successful physicist and works abroad. The two had, according to Mark, an ""intense"" and ""overwhelming"" meeting. As it turns out, Mark authored a book based on his experiences growing up with Barack, Sr. whose story revoled around a Jewish mother and an abusive father. Mark has disclosed in interviews that Barack, Sr. was an abusive man and I am sure the discussion the two men had in China centered around just that. Barack did not like the fact that Mark openly told the truth about their father and he would not return to Kenya. Barack Obama continuously demonstrates an altruistic morality and chooses to live in a fantasy land where his father is one he has chosen to emulate and will cut off relations with anyone who does not share his world view or reveals the truth about his ideal man.The philosophical lines were clearly drawn in 2012 with Mitt Romney representing the former private sector executive who worked extremely hard to become the accomplished man that he is. Obama, on the other hand, represents the Harvard and Columbia-educated college law professor who not only never worked a day in his life and also subscribes to a quasi-Marxist philosophy seeking to damn the very civilization that enabled his mobility in order to reward his supporters who leach off the productive. D'Souza points out in his film the learning institutions where Obama let his subconscious (paraphrasing from Ms. Rand) accumulate a junk heap of unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together by chance, and integrated by his subconscious into a kind of mongrel philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: self-doubt, like a ball and chain in the place where his mind's wings should have grown.Despite ""2016""'s flaws, Dinesh D'Souza has certainly hit the nail on the head in terms of Obama's base philosophy and is a testament to the wisdom of Ayn Rand demonstrating the importance of philosophy and how it can affect or influence one's activities. While it is not my intent to slander the President, however, I urge you to see the other side of the coin and am not specifically refering to voting for the Republican Party. Restoring America to the greatest country on Earth is a priority and all Americans have an obligation to open their eyes by understanding the threat and impact that President Obama's beliefs and actions are having. They are the result of the men who planted the intellectual seeds in the President's mind. That's what D'Souza's movie does a very good job of pointing out."	4.0	Like Father(s), Like Son?	2014-03-26	5	4	1

It covers things about Obama by supporting it with Obama's own words.Obama's early and formative years were much different than most people that grew up in the United States, especially from a stand point of how different poverty in Indonesia is verses poverty in the United States at that time. The film is more bent on the psychological aspects of a absentee father who was made into a hero in a son's mind with the support of his mother.Obama's own book is about dreams of his father. It therefor outlines what his father's dreams were ad investigates what those dreams are. It goes further to show the continuance of those dreams by whom Obama associates with past his youth. It then makes the the connection between Obama's beliefs and maybe how they translate into Obama's policies.It does all of this in a fairly placid and unremarkable way.It also attempts to explain why his past goes greatly unquestioned and not investigated by the media and supporters. It attempts to explain why his is accepted, supported and defended.I would recommend the viewing of this film. It might give one some insights about the man. It's really not hard hitting, it's rather matter of fact.The fact of the matter is he just grew up ""differently"" and has a much different view of the world. It's unfortunate that this film failed to scream this. Instead it whispered it.In the end, does all of this matter?

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A30EW9B3LG78H9	M. Lawrence	"So I watched ""2016 Obama's America."" The first 85% of it or so was a pretty OK exposition of Obama's life. I found parts of it interesting. Much of it I already knew, but it filled in a few details nicely. Obama's half-brother seemed like a pretty cool guy. All in all, I believe it was accurate and even quoted heavily from Obama's actual writings. ...My only real criticism is Dinesh D'Souza is about as interesting as a wooden plank. ...Then when the movie is almost over, D'Souza makes an astounding leap of logic to say that based on the hour-long infomercial we had just watched, he is able to decode exactly how Obama thinks. We are supposed to forget the fact that Obama has been politically Moderate and tame his first term and think that he's only been waiting this whole time to get re-elected when he would start unleashing his *real* agenda. (Whatever his *real* agenda is, I guess we're supposed to fill in the blanks with the most sinister thing we can think of. A Stay Puft Marshmallow Man kind of thing...) Never mind that doesn't make any sense whatsoever, since he could very well have *not* been re-elected in 2012 and he would have thus completely wasted those four years in power when didn't enact his secret agenda. ...But that isn't even the real juice of the piece. That doesn't come until the final 10 minutes--the stuff he throws at you with spooky music and never explains anything. For instance, he talks about the debt crisis. It is stated bluntly that the debt crisis is going to collapse America. But he never states 'how.' He can't even bear mentioning the obvious fact: That accumulating a lot of debt in Obama's first term was exactly what prevented America from collapsing after the financial meltdown of 2007/2008. ...Perhaps if that fact isn't so obvious to people on the Right, it is nonetheless what people on the Left (and Moderates) are saying about it all the time. If he's not challenging his political opponents' beliefs, then why is he making the documentary? ...Other things he throws at you in tiny sound-bytes--like Obama's efforts to get America out of the Middle East or to reinstate more progressive tax rates--I happen to think are good things. So, I just kind of shrugged my shoulders at those points. Then there was this very confusing thing he said about Obama trying to create some kind of ""The United States of Islam"" in the Middle East. I'm not even sure where that comes from, what that means, how he knows Obama is trying to create this, or why that's necessarily something to fear. I mean, maybe I *should* be afraid of a ""United States of Islam."" But tf he can't be bothered to tell me why, then why is he even bringing that up? ...I would kind of think in a 90-minute movie that ends with such provocative statements should spend the first 80 minutes or so building them up instead of dumping all of it off on us at the end. That sounds like the sort of term paper my grade school English teachers used to beg me not to write. ...So I guess the film started out OK, sort of interesting, but slow. And then it suddenly and dramatically shifted tones to a fear-mongering piece that was obviously meant to do nothing more but to energize Right-Wingers into voting Republican in 2012. ...I guess it didn't work."	2.0	Begins Kind Interesting.

I've watched anti-Bush documentaries in the past that were basically just Bush bashes.  No real information being presented, just critical commentary from the left.  I'll be honest and admit that was what I was expecting when I went to see this, a big Obama bash.  And because I detest the man I was looking forward to it.  What I got was a very well put together documentary about things from Obama's past that I'd read in his book and how it has been governing his decision making during his presidency.  It was alarming.  When I read his book I was disturbed by his anti-colonization attitude and anti-western society views (but the liberal media did a great job of smoothing that all over and I was dumb enough to buy into it), but I never really put 2 and 2 together.  I left the theater sick to my stomach.  This movie certainly lit a fire in me.  The predictions about what would happen in his 2nd term, compared to the things currently happening are frightening.I liked that D'Souza included all the crazy talk about himself from the media.  Also the interview with Obama's brother, George, was very interesting.  All in all a very informative documentary.  I wouldn't say I'd recommend it to everyone.  If you worship at the altar Obama you'll certainly not appreciate the information being presented.  But if you're not (to steal a term from Mr. Hannity) a ""yes we can chanting zombie"" or maybe you are but your open minded, you'll enjoy this movie.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AP16KVX06QXCI	Mr. Anderson	"Whatever else this film is, it certainly is not scholarly.  D'Souza's thesis (such as it is) is one that hinges on speculative insinuation.  D'Souza offers no documentation or scholarly sourcing to support his thesis.  He cleverly tricks undiscerning viewers by providing documents and some sources to discredit OTHER personalities discussed in the film but NOT Obama directly.  D'Souza's primary claim is that Obama is still trying to please his dead father and holds antisemitic and anti-capitalist views that he intends on inflicting on America in his lame duck term.  D'Souza presents a ""timeline"" of Obama and his journey to the presidency and in this ""timeline"" concedes that Obama WAS born in Hawaii.  Thus any ""right-winger"" who cites this movie must (by implication) also be admitting the ""birther"" argument as false.  And D'Souza has taught us that implication is the same as fact...so there.There are plenty of shots of D'Souza walking around the capital and looking longingly up at the Lincoln Memorial but virtually nothing else.  I have seen far more fact-laden ""documentaries"" from Alex Jones that are available free.  If you are a ""right-winger"" or a ""tea-bagger"" this should not be your go-to movie for Obama criticism.  D'Souza uses the opinionated ""pow-wows"" he has with various people as his primary ""sources.""  He is shown having phone conversations with his self designated experts that are filmed and cut together to like a feature film.  That is to say we are shown footage of interviewer and interviewee as each other is talking to each other (over the phone) and the phone conversation is run simultaneously.  This is normally done in TV and feature films to better ""tell the story.""  However in a documentary it indicates that the producers were more concerned with visuals than they were with facts.These ""pow-wows"" do nothing to further his thesis as he only talks to those who agree with him.  To better water-proof ones argument one needs to acknowledge and compensate for criticism; this film will have none of that.  If anything the film reaffirms the very reasons why I voted for Obama to begin with.Overall D'Souza succeeds in attempting to rake water into a pile.  His thesis is so broad that it is rendered pointless.  D'Souza seems to be implying that somehow he is ""in Obama's head"" because of his remote viewing of Obama's past.  I suppose in the world of palm readers and tarot cards this kind of reasoning makes sense but certainly not in the world of rational thought.Thumbs way down."	1.0	Nonsenical Right-Wing Gibberish at Its Best	2012-09-13	245	73	172

Doyle	"Let me start by saying I am a Political Atheist and feel a vote for either candidate is a vote for more of the same nonsense we have come to expect from the Military Industrial Complex Eisenhower warned us about all those decades ago.I was invited to watch this film at a family member's home the other evening and heated debate ensued as I made the error of pointing out various fallacies and contradictions in this film to an audience who essentially swallow the mainstream cool-aide.The most stark example of the cognitive dissonance here was the criticism of Obama's foreign policy.In reality he has simply carried on with the polices of previous administrations and we now know that you can't slip a piece paper between Romney and Obama on this issue.They both take their cues from the Military industrial complex.This is where the vast vast amount of government spending goes incidentally.So go ahead and cast a vote for more of the same if you want.It won't matter who's name goes on the ballot.Politics is theater and this film contributes nicely to the smoke 'n mirror world of info-tainment that now replaces real discussion and any hope of actual change.I really don't like Obama but this film does nothing to address the reality of problems we face as a nation.It is jejune and simplistic.If you want a better film to watch in terms of understanding the reality of our situation I suggest the ""Obama Deception"" ."	1.0	Exercise in Cognitive dissonance.	2012-10-29	53	22	31

I never heard or saw any advertising for this movie.  Maybe that's why more people did not know about it?  I was able to purchase it through NewsMax a couple of weeks ago.  An interesting, informative video on President Obama's life.  Whether all of it is true and accurate, I am not sure.  It seems believable to me.  Time will tell.  The main thing about Obama Care that bothers me is the Personal Mandate.  Why can't the millions who voted for Obama see that forcing people to buy health insurance is un-American.  How is a person supposed to pay for health insurance when they do not have a job?  Of the last four years, I have only worked two of them - and that was a part-time job that paid almost the same as unemployment.  This video should have been released six months ago so people could have learned of it and seen it for themselves.  I think the election would have turned out differently.  I believe we will be sorry for re-electing Obama.  I don't love Mitt, but I think he would have been a better choice (and I am a Democrat).	4.0	Too Late!	2012-11-10	3	1	2

Read Obama's book ,Dreams From My Father, which was quoted from in the documentary.  You will learn directly from Obama his hatred of his whiteness, all whites, this country, colonialists.  You will also learn of his training in Marxism (mother, father, grandfather, Frank Marshal Davis, etc.) and Islam (father, mother, step-father, Malcolm X, etc.) from his birth through his studies in Occidental and Columbia. Obama admits seeking out the Marxists, radicals, minorities. Obama was 23 yrs old when he wrote this book.  These teachings are his identity.  His anger runs deep, and his focus is to change America.  He is a Communist with Communist appointees set out to destroy the USA as we have known it.  I saw and heard the president of the Communist Party USA when he was interviewed by Glenn Back just after Obama's election in 2008 say with a wide grin on his face and with the gnashing of his hands, ""...with the election of Obama, America has been brought to its knees.""

That said, before watching this movie I was and undecided voter, not I am 100% going to vote for Mitt Romney, if he does not win, the US is in trouble at many levels in 2016 and beyond!

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A39XL143NH1CIH	NickF	"I recently watched this video. The first half of the video discusses Obama's background and Dinesh presents what I think is a very good psychological profile of Obama.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning his history and his motivations.However, where the film falls short is in the critique of these things. The assumption that America is a ""force for good"" in the middle east and elsewhere is a false on. If you look at any metric or any empirical evidence, it is immediately clear that America has been on net balance a destructive force. The intentions may be good, surely, but in practice it is not good for anyone. During the first Iraq War and subsequent sanctions in the 90s, over 576,000 Iraqi children were killed because of American foreign policy. This is staggeringly more than even the monster Hussein had killed.The nuclear proliferation point, I think it is insane. Why is it necessary to have enough nuclear warheads, in relative peace time, to blow up the world multiple times over? I mean seriously, having enough nukes for a massive nuclear exchange isn't going to help us win. Having enough nukes to be a deterent, coupled with SDI, is the economic way to go."	3.0	False Conclusions and Assumptions	2012-12-10	3	1	2

This documentary is long but it's worth watching to the end to get it all. There are points in the movie where it seems to be the end but it keeps going AND GETS EVEN BETTER. Better? It starts to tap into the other things U.S. citizens need to know. Are you looking to pop the propaganda bubble and tear down the facade they have erected of this man. Watch this movie. Firstly it is well made, great soundtrack, great visuals, real and computer generated. This man knows how to communicate by the media of film making. He's coming out with &#34;America&#34; this fourth of July, 2014. This movie was not made to entertain but inform, no, WARN YOU what we are dealing with as a nation. TOO many people are apathetic to find out, too godless hedonistic and dumb down to even have a clue or care. Ripe we are for the demagogue. This movie will give you a major beginning but there is so much more to know.  Maybe it will awaken you to get busy and understand why everything from the economy's down spiral, the taking over of the health care system towards single payer, the rule by fiat undermining the Constitution, the desperate push for amnesty, the monstrous inflation of the welfare state is going on. This movie is worth watching more than once.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A74CIM60PQV6U	NJ	The details I'll remember from this film are what the author bases his summary on in the video's trailers see those.In the film, Obama's friends from the past are something D'sousa questions in this video he gives the reasons why.  The author gives numbers on what has happened with the national debt (over 5 trillion to now 15 trillion) and makes the point that a country without funds is immobilized to defend itself. Will an enemy lend the US money to defeat them under a threat? Of course not, and no funding means no power. To look further than just an enemy... will anyone lend money to another party who is so far in debt that there would never be the possibility of payback? Of course not. When the need for power arises, the funding and won't be there.Also mentioned is the elimination of our nuclear warheads (he mentions Obama's goal to reduce them in his first term and eventually to zero in time) while he suggests that the enemies of the USA are not going to return the favor.Take it for what it's worth. Very interesting movie. We'll see how many of the author's assumptions are correct.I'm not sure the interview with his brother George, though interesting, is anything except a search for material.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	ADGPA9Q047X9D	NM JIM	"There are numerous examples of docuganda that offer slow, methodical assassinations of the characters of people, places, institutions and other such things of controversy.  What makes this one work well, for me, was the rather simple premise that most people who voted for the President really didn't know much about him, why he might think the way he does in matters philosophical, religious, sociological or political.  This piece allows the viewer to ponder those same questions without being rushed along faster than the average viewer can rationalize.It is a well structured essay.  Ample time is spent early on showing the background of D'Souza, the real protagonist of the film.  It is his ""story"" of curiosity and his task of discovering what (sometimes little) information there is to explain who our 44th President is - a man who essentially burst upon the American stage in his 40s and rapidly rose to the highest office in the country, unchallenged and unvetted, often due to political correctness.2016 is not a character assassination; it does come to a conclusion which is troubling, which betrays the objectivity that a true documentary requires.  It is a warning about where President Obama might leave our country if given a second term.  Thought provoking, simple, not snarky - just a lot of facts that beg contradiction... but instead come through quite simply.  Obama is not a saviour, not a chosen one, not even truly a leader.  He is a talented, insecure kid with an atypical upbringing who appears to be enacting an agenda which originates in post-colonial socialism and will, if successfully put forth, forever change the United States."	4.0	Unvarnished and Simple	2012-11-06	8	4	4

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AYDQA2E4WJBAN	Nome de Plume	Mr. D'Souza had an opportunity to address Mr. Obama's first term with objectivity, in the end it was just a political hit piece.I am no great fan of Obama and hoped this documentary would give me legitimate reason's for me not to vote for Obama again.  All this film didis preach to those already converted.Mr. D'Souza was not very honest with his background.  He made it seem as though he was born to the typical Indian household.  In reality he was born into anupperclass Christian, in his case Roman Catholic, Indian family.  He can't really speak to the typical Hindu, let alone Muslim Indian person - just as a Christian American can't speak to that of say a Muslim American.Furthermore, Mr. D'Souza gave examples of why Obama is so bad and one he gave was that he is the first US President who has taken Argentina's side against that of the UK regarding the Falkland Islands.  I for one don't think Britain has any business in a country that is off the coast of Argentina.  In addition, just because he is the first president to think a new way doesn't make him bad e.g. if he were the first President to condemn the genocide of Armenians at the hand of the Turks it would be a good thing!  Which sadly NO president has done.Mr. D'Souza just twisted facts for his own purpose e.g. he completely gave Reagan credit for ending communism when the Pope was at least as if not more responsible for it's demise.In the end this documentary will not convince any fair minded person to look at Obama more critically, and that is a real shame.  The Democrats are focused on his reelection while the Republicans are all about getting him out of office - even if their means are utterly Machiavellian.  Unfortunately no side is interested in what is best for this country - they are only concerned with their own wallet.	1.0	Not informative - Pure Propaganda	2012-10-15	91	24	67
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2KBQR1M61UHT2	"NoMonet ""nomonet"""	Obama inherited some problems, but what he did with the country as president in the last 3  years hasn't helped and I would argue he has harmed the American economy and the American way of life.  This movie pretty much backs that argument up.What Obama inherited was an economy at 3.3% GDP.  Our GDP has decreased to 1.3% now.Gas prices were under 2 bucks when Obama came in, what are they now?  Over 4 bucks?He inherited a national debt of 10 trillion and he increased it to 16 trillion, squandering money at a record rate.Obama vetoed the Keystone Pipeline.  He also put a stop to offshore drilling.Obama gave millions of dollars in loans to Solyndra and other green energy companies owned by his cronies that went bankrupt.Since his leadership our soldiers have come back in body bags at twice the rate they did under Bush.Obama said we'd be out of the war by now.  He lied.Obama took over GM and Chrysler.  The Volt is what they have to show for it, a car whose battery catches fire and costs more to make than they can sell it for.  This is just typical government incompetence and an argument for free market capitalism that has budgets and whose aim is to make money and not lose it.The most striking thing about Obama is his lack of compassion for American citizens.  There are 23 million Americans who don't have jobs, Americans who have not been able to work because the cost of gas is too much for them to commute, more Americans on foodstamps than ever before in history, and this joker of a president is flying his family around on multiple vacations that cost the American taxpayer hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He's neglecting meetings with world leaders so he can hob nob with celebrities on The View and host fund raisers with rappers.  He could care less about the suffering of Americans.  Why?  Why do you think he is so heartless? Well, this movie addresses that.  His principles, his prime directive overrides compassion. This movie discusses how his background, how he was raised, his belief system and uses Obama in his own words to explain his actions since he's been in office to explain the real reasons for the bad policies he's created that have caused so much suffering for so many Americans.This movie was very factual and informative.  It's worth watching.  All of America is his victim until he's voted out.If you've been watching the sycophants at MSNBC or CBS, PBS or CNN telling you differently, that everything is fine, that nothing bad is Obama's fault you're being lied to.  News flash:  those aren't actual news outlets anymore.  They are Democrat propaganda machines.  If you want to know actual news, I'd recommend FOX or the new media online: Breitbart, Blaze, Newsmax, Drudge Report, Daily Caller.

If you stop and think about it, obama rarely, if ever, gives us the details of what he really wants for America or how he plans to achieve his vision.  ""Hope"" and ""change"" can be whatever each individual wants it to be.  What is ""hope"" and ""change"" for America from obama's point of view?  He never gives us those details.  He always keeps it vague, letting each person 'imagine' it to be what they want for our country.  Obama struck a cord with people's emotions in 2008 when he ran on hope and change, but he ignored giving us his intellectual solutions.

Having watched this 'documentary' I became curious about the director, Dinesh de Souza. He was college president of The King's College, a Christian college, until it was revealed that he announced his engagement to a woman while still married to his first wife. He also appeared in a movie, ""Michael Moore Hates America."" He has written many books attacking Obama and liberals: ""The Roots of Obama's Rage?"",""The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11!"", and ""Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream."" Neither the movie nor these books attacking Obama make the connection between him and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, for example. FDR also took over the presidency at the beginning of a depression and is indeed a touchstone for all modern liberals. Did Obama stop us from The Great Depression, Part 2? Doesn't Obama's anti-colonialism have its roots in the birth of America when we overthrew our colonial masters, the English? Aren't all Americans sympathetic to nations economically colonized as a result of our national experience? The question I would ask the director is ""How can you call this a documentary when it most closely resembles a polemic?""

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A10UHL4CLX42SO	Oscar	Yes, Obama has decreased the number of nuclear weapons we have, but that is an extremely good thing. First, we have the capabilities to destroy the entire world ten times over with our nuclear arsenal. Is it really necessary to have that many nuclear weapons? Dinesh argues this lowers our military strength; however, our military budget is the largest in the world. Our military budget is larger than the next 15 largest militaries combined. Some of them are our allies. Additionally, due to the START treaty which Dinesh briefly explains, the treaty not only lowered the amount of nuclear weapons we carry, but also lowered Russia's nuclear weapons count. The cold war is over people. Russia is no longer a threat to our country. As a matter of fact their country's population is dramatically dwindling. By 2050 they may have as little as 150 million people in their country. We have 1 million troops in our army branch alone. China is increasing as a world power, but controls most of our debt. There is no reason for them to go into war with us. We purchase their merchandise, hence driving their economy forward. Lastly, another reason why having a large amount of nuclear weapons is not a good thing is because we cant even maintain the nuclear weapons we have. Go read about the fungus that grows on our nuclear weapons or the numerous close calls we had with them. We have lost several nuclear bombs and have even dropped some over our own country by accident. It's all true just look it up.Furthermore, Dinesh states how Obama plans to increase our taxes. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Since the global war on terror, taxes have actually decreased. hence creating an era of frictionless war. By creating more taxes we can hopefully fix many of the problems we have here at home, and hopefully it will wake Americans up to the fact that we are at war. The war in Afghanistan is the longest war in American history. We are making no real progress there and the war is an enormous burden on our country. The war in Afghanistan is our generation's Vietnam. The Taliban will take over Afghanistan once we withdraw, but that is inevitable. The ANA (Afghan national Army) are incapable, corrupted, uneducated, and unwilling to defend their own country. President Karzai is also strongly corrupted. We need to withdraw our troops before we bury ourselves any deeper in debt and blood. Our current military personnel  may not be the best generation, but they are most definitely the best of our generation. Bring them home to their families and let them live in peace and harmony.Dinesh, also tries to use Obama's half brother against him, but his half brother doesn't even care that he is not receiving any financial help from Obama. He states &#34;I'm a fully grown man, and I can take care of myself.&#34; He also explains to Dinesh that &#34;Obama has bigger responsibilities and by helping the world, President Obama is taking care of his him.&#34; These are President Obama's half brother's words. Dinesh also argues that building a foreign policy against colonization is a bad thing. The United States makes up 5% of the world's population, but we consume over 25% of the earth's resources. Here is a visual. If everyone on earth lived like the average American, we would need four Earths to sustain ourselves. So, it's no wonder why the entire world's population hates our country. Perhaps it is time we based our foreign policy on moral integrity rather then national interest.Lastly, Dinesh argues how Obama is driving our country towards socialism. We are no where close to a socialist society if you look at the numbers. The top 1% own 40% of all of the nations wealth and it's only getting worse. ( http://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM). &#34; None are more imprisoned then those who believe they are free.&#34;I enjoyed Dinesh in his &#34;God Debate&#34; at Notre Dame (I highly recommend you look it up on youtube), but the film was a huge disappointment and I didn't even vote for Obama. The film is more about Obama's father rather than President Barrack Obama. Dinesh could have attacked many of Obama's other polices. For example the increase of drone attacks in Pakistan, or the reinitialization of the Patriot act, but solely focused on the possibility that Obama may be like his father.	2.0	Go into the film as a critical thinker.	2014-01-20	7	1	6

It reveals a person who was raised with a philosophy that is different than native born Americans.It is based on the research of Dr D'Souza, head of a small NY college. D'Souza is himself foreign born (India). Thus, he understands better than most Ameriicans what shaped our President.If you want to understand someone, you have to know where he came from (who were his main influences and what is his past record of accomplishments).

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A165TQIT4VQCWT	Pat Forde	"This is a must watch film for anyone voting in the presidential election. The movie lays out what seems on the surface to be an off-the-wall assertion that Obama's political career is motivated by the anti-colonialist ideology of his father. What is surprising and unsettling as an American citizen is the level of evidence provided in the documentary to support the position that President Barack Hussein Obama II stands to fundamentally undermine the ideals that once made America one of the greatest nations in the history of the world. While the scene where Obama is completely unable to describe the fiscal stability of the plan that would become his own ""Affordable Care Act"" at a town hall provides a sort of break in the tension in an otherwise marching fact-filled documentary, this scene still leaves me bewildered as to how the mainstream media could ignore these incredible gaffes. The film builds to the starkly sinister moment when Obama is unknowingly recorded while pleading with then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during a nuclear summit in South Korea. On the tape recorded last March, Obama asks Medvedev to request that Vladimir Putin have patience while Obama is campaigning for re-election as he will be able to be ""more flexible"" with Russia regarding Nuclear arms issues following the presidential race. Towards the end of the film, D'Souza makes three insightful predictions worth staying tuned for. Sadly, all of D'Souza's predictions appear to be coming true and are leading America, and the world, on a downward spiral that may take generations to recover from if we are able to do so at all. The film ends with a subtle sense of optimism: the values that will shape our future may be heavily influenced by Barack Obama, but our direction as a nation is still ultimately in the hands of the American people and their vote - more and more of whom seem to be seeing through the fog of his feel-good-but-phony slogans and grandiose speeches full of empty promises each and every day."	5.0	Obama: A Paradox of Principles	2012-10-20	16	10	6

So far he's not held up his part of the bargain.I found it very disturbing, but not for the same reasons as he did.The tone starts out as very cozy- the lighting and sound and visuals invite you in as if this will be a lovely biography. But as it proceeds, it subtly changes- the lighting gets murky, the colors harsh, and the background music resembles a horror movie. So it helps to manipulate you through your senses.As to the content, D'Sousa presents a lot of ""facts"" to support his conspiracy theory. I picked one at random to check out. Did Obama return a bust of Churchill to England, because Obama thinks England is an imperialist nation? Here's the truth:[...]Once I find someone has lied to me, I suspect whatever that person says next! Don't you??So using untruths and innuendo and manipulation, D'Souza lays out a theory that makes no sense: that Obama has hidden his true agenda which is to destroy the US. All the interviews with various people who knew Obama's father seem to agree that he was an activist who opposed Imperialism. Wouldn't you, if all around the world you could see the developed countries invading and controlling other countries to extract their natural resources, leaving them destitute? He makes it sound terrible that Obama supported the Falkland Islands being returned to Argentina. This is not exactly true :[...], but even if it were, why would that be so terrible? The islands are thousands of miles from England, and just off the coast of Argentina. When I was in Argentina a few years ago the sentiment there was similar to what it would be here if another country claimed Nantucket.So the good news is, you can stop worrying that the US is about to turn into Red China!

Predictably, many of my fellow reviewers seem motivated by their political positions, but I watched this movie with an open mind. I allowed the narrative to lead me logically from point to point, and I ended up agreeing with the conclusion reached by the narrator. I believe that any person who watches without a preconceived notion will, at the very least, be challenged to find out more about the facts behind Obama's meteoric, improbable rise. How did he do it, and what drives him? If you give this movie a chance, you will at least know more about the nominal leader of the free world.	5.0	Well-documented and well-made	2012-10-18	23	17	6
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1BVCH82W0M2W2	"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more..."	"He knows that if the loses the election on November 6th he is not likely to get another chance down the road. He realizes that in order to bring his agenda to full fruition he is going to have to hoodwink the American electorate one more time. Furthermore, he understands that if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are elected much of what he has ""accomplished"" over the past four years is going to be overturned. But make no mistake about it. Barack Obama means business. He will say anything and do anything to secure his re-election. And if you believe he is dangerous right now just imagine President Barack Hussein Obama without the shackles of another re-election bid to tie him down. Author Dinesh D'Souza and Academy Award winning director have contemplated this scenario and offers us a sobering glimpse of what Mr. Obama would do in a second term in the remarkable new documentary film  ""2016: Obama's America"".  You will come to understand what Dinesh D'Souza means when he opined in the companion book ""Obama's America: Unmaking the American Dream"" that ""the makeover of America will be so drastic that the `shining city on a hill' will become a shantytown in a rather dangerous global village.""  I saw this film in a theater more than a month ago and I found it nothing less than chilling!  This in spite of the fact that I have read more than a half dozen books about this President over the past couple of years.  I can only imagine the impact this film might have on someone who is completely oblivious to what has been going on.In his popular 2011 book ""The Roots of Obama's Rage"" Dinesh D'Souza theorized that it was really ""anticolonialism"" that shapes Barack Obama's worldview.  Now it is extremely important to understand that the way anti-colonialists like President Obama see it the Western world has grown rich with the gold and raw materials mined in places like Latin America, China and Africa.  In their view this wealth was really not earned....rather it was stolen. Thus, according to the anti-colonialists the optimum way to settle the score and make things right is a massive program of global reparations.  Although President Obama subscribes to this way of thinking he understands that the American electorate would never buy it.  And so he and his minions have devised other means to achieve the very same end.  In ""2016: Obama's America"" you will discover that in order to complete the job before the end of his second term Obama would continue to ratchet up our national debt exponentially which would more than likely result in an economic collapse of monumental proportions.  Thus one could argue that if Obama is re-elected the American people will have essentially voted for their own demise.  Furthermore, if all goes as planned the United States would be through as a superpower and the American people would suffer a steep and painful decline in their standard of living. And as you will discover in ""2016:  Obama's America"" these events would pave the way for increased Muslim influence in the Middle East and around the world. Very scary indeed!Perhaps the most alarming facet of Barack Obama's grand scheme to weaken the United States and diminish our influence around the world is his plan to make drastic cuts to our nation's military. He intends to achieve his by doing the following: 1) continue to slash defense spending, 2) blocking missile defenses and 3) make further drastic reductions in our nuclear arsenal. The President is well aware that China continues to add to its stockpile of nuclear weapons and will achieve parity with the United State in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, you will be distressed to discover that while our esteemed President has drastically curtailed new oil drilling in this country and blocked the construction of the Keystone pipeline he is busy assisting other nations like Brazil, Columbia and Mexico in securing new sources of oil. The American people should be outraged!In my view Dinesh D'Souza and John Sullivan have done the American people a great service by producing this film.  ""2016:  Obama's America"" clearly and logically lays out the facts for everyone to see.  What kind of America do you want to live in?  Clearly this President does not have the best interests of the United States at heart.  It is my sincere hope that ""2016: Obama's America"" will help to sway just enough independent voters to allow us to wrest our country back from those who wish to diminish it.  It would be nice to have a President who is on our side once again.  If you have not yet seen ""2016:  Obama's America"" I would wholeheartedly encourage you to purchase a copy and pass it on to relatives, friends and neighbors after you have viewed it.  The future of our nation is at stake.  Very highly recommended!"	5.0	Time is of the essence.....you must see this film and pass it on to your relatives, friends and neighbors!	2012-10-11	44	32	12

Bill Clinton said it best, ""This guy is a Big Fairy Tale."" Dinesh D'Souza tells Barry's life story by using the subjects own words as written in his book, Dreams From My Father. Since Barry actually read his book for the audio version, the impact of the film is enhanced. We all have moments in our life that help shape and point us in one direction or another. In Barry's case, his mother, grand parents, communist mentor (Frank Marshall Davis), and last but not least, his absentee father's memory provided the foundation to his beliefs today. Those of you that might think of Barry Obama as a 'great' leader should see this film to hear in his own words where he came from and how he came to the realization of what America should be. Those who think Barry is the 'worst' President since the inception of the office, should see this film to learn where his 'fair share' mentality came from (dear old dad). Anyone that wants to know the truth about Barry Obama, should see this film and recommend to others. It is the best source on the man that came from nowhere in 2007 to become America's 44th President.

Obama is doing a great job. Just accept it and realize your biased opinions come from him being different. There is no grand conspiracy, no one is out to get you, and our country is doing great considering he was handed a max out credit card. He is a christian, romney is not, but regardless of what he is he will respect you and fight for your religious freedoms and the right to bash him. That is the sign of a true American.Now for my film review:It is truly insane!!!! There are plenty of pictures of Obama as a child with his sister Maya and his grand parents, pictures of him in elementary school annuals, stories from friends he grew up with, etc. All you have to do is a simply internet search and you can find them. Oh, and how did he get rich?? When he finally made decent money, it was from his book sales. He wasn't a millionaire while he was a community organizer. It's very well documented. He even released 10 years of his tax returns so you can go see it for yourself. Also, he had huge student loans debts after college, even with the several scholarships. Scholarships are things smart people who go to college get, since I am confident you have never heard of one. If you actually believe all the stuff in this movie, you are (1) too lazy or dumb to find this stuff on the internet (except the crazy foreign passport nonsense), and (2) need serious psychological help. I am not being trying to be funny. The films claims are INSANE. My god! There is no grand conspiracy within the entire world of media.The film quality was great, the film content is pure scare tactic and suggestive of insane ideologycouple with poor editing to paint Obama as a man that has a sinister motive.  The only proven conspired sabotage on our country was made by Mitch McConnell to make sure that Obama does not get re-elected, proven with the GOP's congress track record of voting against improving our country.	1.0	Regardless of your politcal affiliations,	2012-10-20	47	7	40

The mainstream media has kept hidden (and still does) many of the details about what makes Obama tick, what he really believes, and how he disguises his real agenda with soaring rhetoric that often misleads and masks the truth about his real goals and intentions.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2T22JLHNDH9TV	Peter B. Young	"This documentary is intriguing.  It starts out as if intent on a careful investigation about who Obama is and how he thinks. There never, however, is direct interview with Obama.  Instead, the author/creator talks at length with various people who have known Obama, with people from his father's world, and with people from his mother's world.  The stitching together of the various threads of information and opinions appears relatively reasonable until near the end of the movie, when the 'gloves come off,' as Obama is imputed to be actually a communist who is intent upon reducing the US military advantages and helping create a United States of Islam (the various countries of northern Africa plus many of the middle east).  As this slide occurs from apparently rational and balanced analysis to strident bashing, the background soundtrack picks up tempo and volume, such that the theatrical aspects are manipulated to enhance the presentation's efforts to demonize Obama.  The ""apparent"" nature of the reasonableness is also evident to anyone who has studied logic and/or honest weighing of conflicting data; even early on in the film statements are made that defy good logic or honest analysis.  Often a specific example of apparently socialistic or communistic influence is taken from Obama's past education and/or associations and then turned into evidence of his total acceptance or belief of such notions.  This process of slowly dissecting Obama as a 'closet' anti-American and dangerously misguided and confused man is carefully managed, such that only through careful attention to the film's claims and the author's choice of words is one able to perceive this underlying yet abiding intent.Another reviewer compared this to Michael Moore's films.  Surely there is a comparison to be made, as both are clearly highly opinionated and intent on a final message.  But Moore, while clearly providing one-sided arguments, also makes no bones about his intent; there is nothing hidden about his purpose.  He would appear to relish the probable distress he invites for insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc. Moore openly despises those that he perceives as villainous.  This author is much more clandestine in his intentions.  All of which makes me more suspicious.  Yes, I probably agree more with Moore's conclusions than with this fella's.  But also I have objected to Moore's tactics, which tend to irritate those who don't agree with him, rather than offering a path to understanding that might allow for changing opinions.  This guy's efforts are 'sneaky,' which is alright if that is what he intended.  But the final impression then is one of his trying to manipulate me (& others) rather than trying to inform.  Moore clearly is informative and stridently opinionated, mostly against many of the Far Right's perspectives.Finally, if only we might come to a less divided place in this country.  The polarization of our population, mostly through information similar to this film wherein truth is not pursued but rather an agenda of discrediting the other, is most unfortunate.One final plea would be for immediate and ongoing efforts to reform elections after the presently distinctly ugly election is over.  We citizens MUST put pressure on the politicians to make the election process about issues rather than about money.  My personal preference would be for each candidate to receive a set amount of money FROM THE GOVERNMENT to run the campaign, which could last NO MORE THAN 6 weeks.  No private monies would be allowed in politics going forward.  That would actually return the election process to the people of this country.

For the most part I can't think of a more compelling reason to do what the president has done. Being ANTI-COLONIALIST is not communist OR anti-American. The Federal Reserve is a parasitic institution that funnels vast wealth out of the hands of Americans into offshore European pockets. THAT sounds like colonialism to me. Yet he has not attempted to dismantle the FED. So it sounds like he is not anti-colonialist enough for most Americans.

What I got was a bunch of excitement and hypothesis.For me, the most telling statement was one made at the beginning of the movie: Obama returned the bust of Winston Churchill as soon as he got into office. If that is true, there is definitely a claim to be made about Obama's anti-colonial attitude. So, did he really return it? No. No he did not. There were currently two of them at the White House, one on loan to the Bush administration from the British Embassy. The second was returned.Read more about it here: [...]This clear misrepresentation of an event leads me to believe the entire film is a sham.

The people who voted against Barack Hussein Obama in 2008 knew he was a Socialist then. But you take those same people, plus many more since 2008, and people have discovered that Barack Hussein Obama is much more than a Socialist; Barack Hussein Obama is a Marxist.  The movie is on par with former DOJ civil rights attorney, J. Christian Adams, and his book entitled, Injustice, with regards to the many questionable acts associated with Barack Hussein Obama.  While viewing 2016, or even reading print exposing Barack Hussein Obama for what he really is, I stop and think how blessed we really are to have one of the many rights that grants us access to the very truths that help protect us as a nation.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1FCBJNIFF4PPU	prairie woman	"Wow!  It's amazing to me to read all these reviews and see how many one star categories there are and how many four and five star categories.  Everything from ""right wing"" propaganda inferences to bad filmmaking, to comments about D'Souza's lovelife--it's all over the place.  First of all, like the writing on the DVD cover says ""Love Him Or Hate Him, You Don't Know Him.""  If anyone read Dinesh D'Souza's What's So Great About America, you already are familiar with his views and that's what he brings to this film.  So if you already don't agree with his ideas of American Exceptionalism, then you won't like this film because your mind is already made up. The belief that this country has survived as long as it has with our constitution, the idea that we have equal opportunities, and that we champion free speech and a free economy is the reason we are a country of immigrants and people looking for a better life.  I was made aware of this when I took my daughter to visit the large university that she had been accepted to.  At the hotel we stayed at, there was a large group of students from Thailand who were also looking at this university as a potential place to study.  My daughter roomed across the hall from an engineering student from Malaysia.  Dinesh D'Souza talks of this opportunity as well as he came here to study at Princeton, and much to the chagrin of his family, became a writer, because he realized that in this country he could do whatever his passion led him to do. Yes, this country started out with the anti-colonialism idea of separating ourselves from Britain, but we became so much more.  Why would we want America to be just like the European countries who are going bankrupt, do not have a strong defense, and really do depend on America, that great beacon of light to help defend them from our foes, and believe me they are out there!

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2D8ALKALWPTGA	"Prof. Dragon ""profdragon"""	Dinesh D'Souza is intellectually gifted and articulate. His precision in research is only surpassed by his mastery of the rhetorical arts. The admixture is a prescription for a factually based fiction not unlike the great historical fictions which brought us such entertaining figments of imagination as mythical detective, Gordianus the Finder, of the Roman Blood Series and the most recent Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter movie. In this case, D'Souza spins the extraordinarily rich tapestry of Barak Obama's life into the conclusion that he is anti-American and a closet socialist despite significant evidence to the contrary.Beware threads of facts spun into a false fabric of conclusions. Yes, Obama was influenced by his angry father's anti-colonial views. Yes, he was influenced by various mentors who sensitized him to colonial abuses of third world nations to drain their natural resources. Yes, as a result, he is sympathetic to other world opinions outside the beltway power elite views that are buying elections with unlimited superpac money. The conclusions of this documentary skate upon the thin ice of the assumptions that a Harvard educated person of mixed race inherently is anti-American to the point of destroying the nation that elected him.After watching the video, which is a riveting documentary, truly a triumph of the art form, ask yourselves: Why, if Obama is such an anti-capitalist, he would appoint to our crucial monetary regulating positions, such as the Federal Reserve, businessmen from the very groups, such as Goldman Sachs, that participated in the greatest decline in individual American wealth since the great depression; Ask why, if he is a rabid anti-colonial fanatic and a terrorist sympathizer, that he would relentlessly hunt and kill Osama bin Laden; Ask why he would want to give every American decent healthcare and seek another course toward world peace than military and economic domination if he wishes to destroy our country. The answers are clear. Obama is a measured moderate, too conservative for many on the left. More likely, Obama is man at the nexus at which the tyranny of the old meets the promise of the new. The kernal of those truths is the hidden story within the documentary.Note that Dinesh D'Souza, the author and narrator of the documentary, seems to be a pro-colonialist, born of privilege who had an executive father working for an American pharmaceutical company and who is a self-styled gadfly who foments disrespect for a sitting president with whom he shares many characteristics except, perhaps, the president's concern for the future of humanity.So, see the documentary. It is a masterful work but be mindful of what may be its hidden agenda: to advance a continuing pro-colonial agenda of transnational corporations by undermining the real interests of America, peace, security and prosperity of its citizens in favor of power elites and their agendas, lower taxes and deregulation.	3.0	Through a kaleidoscope darkly toward a pro-colonial framework	2012-10-21	23	6	17

Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza is as fierce as ever in exposing the real Obama in his recent book ""Obama's America."" The American voters have two choices in the 2012 presidential election; realizing the American dream as envisioned by the founding fathers or the Obama's dream, which is a world in which countries share wealth and power, and unmake United States as a global leader. Obama has done plenty to alienate Israel to win the minds of Islamists in this country and Islamic nations around the globe. He has minimized the influence of Christian principle on which this country was founded. His foreign and domestic policies have weakened American influence in global affairs. He pushed for elections in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood emerged as victorious, which is not in the best interest of United Sates or Israel, since this group is a known supporter in Islamic terrorism. We have given Egypt an average of $2 billion annually and we help elect anti-American leadership. He has done very little to contain Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Internationally, he's been scaling back America's influence in almost everything.The movie exposes the real Obama by going into his grass roots to understand his political philosophy. Filmed on four continents, it features on-camera interviews with his destitute half-brother George Obama in Kenya, and Philip Ochieng, an associate of Barack Obama, Sr. The film is produced by real heavy weights like, Doug Sain, and Gerald Molen, who produced ""Schindler's List,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Hook."" This film has fired up Americans and it has grossed more than $33 million at the box office, and it is at the top of the DVD charts. The film is also the top-selling documentary of the year and fourth documentary of all time. It uses the best argument of all: Barack Obama's own words from his book ""Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance.""Gerald Molen, the producer of this movie has stated that the current scandal involving the film's star and co-director, Dinesh D'Souza should not be used by movie critics to discredit the movie.

Our freedom to serve GOD and to promote the gospel in our land is disintegrating. We are engaged in a great spiritual battle that threatens our country, our families, and our lives.

Much of the movie is comprised of direct quotes, video and audio excerpts from Obama's books, speeches, writings..and from his friends, family members and associates. It is obvious that his sycophants will love and adore him no matter what; but this movie- along with Kengor's 'The Communist', Gilbert's 'Dreams from my REAL Father' and Klein's 'The Amateur'....all illustrate the fact we have a SOCIALIST, ISLAMIC MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE in the White House, who has surrounded himself with Communists, Socialists, Islamists - all with the goal of bringing down America to fulfill his 'Fathers Dreams'. I have many Liberal friends, who are in such denial they have shut down all reason. I suspect they will curl up in the fetal position and lock the doors on November 7...but if justice were served, Obama would be impeached - along with Eric Holder - and removed from office before January 21, 2013.	5.0	OBAMA in his own voice, words and deeds....	2012-09-29	84	51	33

One thing that I did not give as much thought to as before was the fact that Obama was not greatly influenced by the U.S. civil rights movement and does not think in those terms; it is much more global.  His ideology, unlike one of let's say a Jesse Jackson is much more global.  It also explains why he would not at all feel indebted to capitalism.  That is, unlike (other) activists, the problem isn't that within the capitalist system the ""RICH"" ignore the poor; it's that the system fundamentally does.  I mean guys like Jackson and Sharpton need capitalism and capitalists, there isn't the opportunity to extort corporations under socialism.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1NRNGJKX55IX6	RCT	"Just finished watching this. This could have been a great video if the author chose to include all the men and women in Obama's life and if he made it clear that almost all of the quotes attributed to one of the Obama's was the elder Obama. You have to watch this one very closely. It is obvious that President Obama's half brother knows very little about him. It was obvious the elderly man who attributed Obama senior's attributes to his son was bragging and just happy to have a connection to an American President. Where was his mother's influence, where was his grandfather's influence, where was his grandmother's influence? Are we to believe he had no white friends who did not have communistic or socialistic views? If you look at Dinesh D'Souza's writings, you will only see a conservative view. He did not write a balanced piece because he does not have a balanced view of this world--he is totally to the far right. I thought I saw some of Mr. D'Souza's own issues in this piece more than I saw Barack Obama's. Here is a man who grew up under colonialism and liked it (or so he says). His parents benefited greatly from it--he went to private schools and probably had a good life as opposed to the rest of India's people. But on the other hand, in Barack's mother, he saw a mother who made sure her son did not grow up under this in Jakarta. No mother would accept that for her son--that he should learn to be subservient to a colonialist type atmosphere. As a white woman, I am sure she saw exactly what was happening and did not want her son to become like his stepfather. I can only believe that Mr. D'Souza had no such advocate and thus fools himself into believing that his parents did the right thing--and maybe it was the right thing for his culture which was not an American one which Barack's mother was part of. I had to laugh at his comparison of himself to African Americans. He has to know that there is a very clear difference in how he is viewed and how we are viewed by some. It so clear that Mr D'Souza (a colonial name) has his own issues. He clearly does not understand the dilemma of a biracial child in coming to terms with their identity as this is not his struggle. During the 60's every educated African American man went through this struggle--identity, self-image, father/son relationships; their place in America; communism; socialism-- it was part of our culture and not unique to Barack Obama. It shows how little he knows about us. As a right-wing conservative, he would not have had many African-American's in his circle and it shows that he so clearly misunderstands the road we travel, the fences we straddle and how that shapes our view of the world.  As an African American democrat, on the other hand, we have many white American's in our lives who we appreciate greatly.A different person looking at Barack Obama could as easily see a man who wants health care because his mother died because of her lack of such care. A man who has a different view of war because he had a grandfather who was a veteran and may have told him the the true horrors of war regardless of who is right or wrong. I could go on, but it is very clear that Mr. De'Sousa is happy with his life in the US and as any disenfranchised citizen of his own country his issues are hostile to those who do not agree with his privileged life in his own country. That he was one of the lucky few is obvious--having a father who worked for Johnson and Johnson as an ""executive"". What he has done is make a film about his own beliefs and not a balanced view. And, I guess it does not hurt to want to further your own ambitions as his fortunes are tied to there being a republican party in the white house--having worked as an adviser to previous republican presidents.We have our Michael Moore and the conservatives have their D'Souza-- I guess that is balanced after all."	1.0	Unbalanced and More of a View into the Author than the President	2012-10-25	107	53	54

Present-day American Conservatives are being conditioned to love the war and excuse war crimes, and some, very unfortunately, buy into that agenda. But in reality: war, and the ""preemptive"" invasion especially, have absolutely nothing to do with Conservatism, or Patriotism, or Christianity. The idea of a perpetual war with some perpetual enemy has been the backbone of every totalitarian tyranny in the history. It is a Marxist idea.And one more observation: this important documentary about the most important person in the world, made by a private citizen, near the end of Obama's presidential term, shows how terribly lame and useless the MSM journalism became."	5.0	Meet the Obamas	2012-10-04	22	12	10

Obama is a confessed Muslim Marxist bent on having Socialism replace Free Enterprise and the private ownership of property.As an old professor who taught economics to MBAs, I am disappointed at the American acceptance of TREASON! Ignorance, Arrogance and Denial do not solve problems. They grow them.

Even though his father was an extremist and a tyrant all of his own nature due to having ""power"".D'Souza also tells of how Barack Obama even turned his back on his own family in Africa and Indonesia, including his own brother.From my own experience, coming from a family where my father died when I was 12 and not really getting to know him as an adult, I can empathize with Barack Obama in wanting to do the best by and for his father.  However, Barack Obama's father was not a good honest man.  He carried multiple wives illegally, has a good number of illegitimate children by a few different mothers, and he abused and betrayed the people of his country.  Sometimes we need to grow up and face reality, sometimes people are not who we envision them to be as we place them up on their own iconic ""Glory Days"" pedestal.  This would be like Charles Manson's son growing up, becoming President of the United States of America, and wanting to live up to the fake ideology and childhood dreamt imagination of his father.That would not be good."	5.0	Re-shaping America (The Correct Way)	2012-10-30	11	8	3

It simply shows you things about Obama's background such as his associations with various far-Left elements, that are consistent with his ideology and his actions as President.  Dinesh D'Souza has done a public service by producing this film so that we may all understand who the man is that America elected as President.  I remember when JFK was elected President; there were countless TV specials and magazine articles that told us all about John F. Kennedy.  Until this film, Obama was a near-cipher.  Very strange.

However, after reading many reviews, I'm seeking clarification.So...it's not okay to respect and support the President because his father was from Kenya or he really wasn't born here or he just isn't American enough (whatever the reason you choose) but it is okay to respect and support a guy out of India who preaches American ideals to citizens born and raised from generations of Americans?  I don't know about y'all but I get a little suspicious of foreigners telling me what's wrong with my country.I'm really just not following the logic here.

Interesting credentials.  I would classify this film definitely partisan and propaganda..I also came across an interview [both written and on video]with D'Souza and Chris Hedges discussing this film ~ Obama 2016.Chris Hedges is a journalist, author, 20 years as a war corresponent in Latin America, Balkans & Middle, a Pultizer Prize recipient....This is what Hedges had to say about the film ~ ""..it's void of facts, reality, intellectual depth..""  He continues, ""...it is vile in terms of underlying realism, it panders to stereotypes [i.e. racists, bigots, conspiracy theorists, birthers...]....it demonizes Obama...swift boating a politician by using 1/2 truths, innuendos and lies to turn him {Obama] into a monster...""Interesting ~ so I watched the entire film and have read so many of the 5 star reviews stating w/excitement how 'evil' this president, that I concur Hedges description is doing the job and spreading more division, hatred and non-Christian values.My suggestion is to turn off FoxNews and start living a Christian life ~ that is 'treat others the way you want to be treated' ~ I was always taught LOVE is the greatest gift of all.  It certainly has been lost in this country when people can ""gleefully"" express such hatred.I gave this film 5 stars because for those who still have caring and respect for others, hopefully they too can see the racism, bigotry, lies and propaganda stated in this film and how our country has become so divided and hateful with propaganda spread across the media such as this....Since everyone is so into documentary films, I would like to see a film entitled, ""Romney 2016"" and how our country is when it becomes a Plutocracy government under him..owned and governed by the top 1% and Corporations.  Be careful...Romney did more destruction in MA than he is stating.

It is the job of journalism and the media to inform, not be biased. Had they done the same job on Obama as Romney has been under the media microscope, Obama would not be in office. I have watched the damage by the left in my state of  MD for 20 years so I also read as much as possible about politics across the US. I didn't like Obama from the get go because his demeanor seemed phony--he wasn't phony, he was secretive about his agenda and from his own voice, manipulative at duping trusting white America by using race as the dupe. I knew much about this man but Mr. Desouza expanded my knowledge so that I could get a bigger view of this man. I did not know how colonialism/anti-colonialism fit into Obama's agenda, but this is quite interesting. Considering that he came from both a black degenerate and white trash with a grandfather who had Frank Davis, a communist as a friend and mentor to young Barry, goes to show the reason for the attitude and militancy in his background.  It is obvious why he chooses to hide his founders and background since he needed to finesse his way into the WH, which he did. And our media did not vet him! Now that we know what this man has done and is capable of continuing to do with a free hand, it is definitely up to America, I know what I want and I know what I do not want and I now know this man better. I want my America back! Thank you Mr. Desouza.  Now my update--unfortunately marxist Obama won the country being elected by either takers, white guilt, black on black voters or those vested in getting what they want from the government or don't care about the US, only what they can get from the country. True lovers and supporters of the Constitution and the USA and givers, hard workers and responsible people who were smart enough to see this man, are now captive to the socialists, marxists and communists who voted for this destructive, narcicisstic, and arrogant man. Lets see what kind of destruction he creates over the next 4 years because it has already started. He lies straight faced to the public while he does his sleezy deal magic behind closed doors, all driven by his internal personal agenda! Since it is difficult for republicans who are decent, yet too weak to stand up to slime and sleeze, lets see where the Constitution and USA stands in the next 4 years."	5.0	Very Informative!	2012-11-03	17	10	7

I suspect at least 4-5.What's more telling is seeing the worshipers come here to defend their savior having never seen the movie.  Its sad, but I understand it.  When you've made a Christ in your own minds eye and someone suggests that your redeemer may not be who you thought he was, the natural reaction is to see that as an attack on yourself. It angers such to suggest that their own personal ideologies they've projected onto someone as the embodiment and fixer of all things they see as evil in their world just maybe a charlatan with an ulterior motive; it goes to their core...  As a result they lash out.As another reviewer rightly points out Dinesh uses a LOT of Obama IN HIS OWN WORDS. Obama recorded his own audio for his book Dreams FROM My Father. Dinesh uses Obama's own voice in the reading of that book to reveal that it's not about Obama being a Socialist or a Marxist, but that at the root he is an Anti-Colonialist.Watch the movie before you review it; simply allow Obama to tell his own story.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3394OJCMXRF1S	Self-reliant	the story line of President Obama's past does give a great insight into his methods. He is of course the first African-American president, but the ideals he clings to are very anti- America. Before ever reading anything of Obama's history I was shocked to see my president apologize for everything American to the world. I saw him bow to middle-eastern powers and other foreign monarchs. He never quite demonstrates the pride an American President should possess. It is nice to see that I am not the only person who notices this lack of affection. I could care less what color a president is, as long as they empower America and demonstrate exceedingly high levels of American well being. From the moment he has been elected he has not addressed the key issues that got him elected, instead he focuses on a health care reform no one asked for. I have seen the way he divides the American people by social class, race, sexuality, religion and gender. He exploited these differences in his first election, I just hope my fellow Americans (notice I m not distinguishing race..etc) will rise against this toxic influence.

Saw him only once in his life.  His father has several wives and several children who are half siblings to the president.  He was raised in southeast Asia not the USA so he had a different upbringing from most American children.  Then he was sent home to the Hawaii to be raised by his grandparents and away from his mother, step father and half sister.  If you are scratching your head and wondering what is going on in the USA today.  This gives a possible reason.	5.0	Author's Analysis Of How President Obama Thinks And Why	2013-03-27	3	2	1

Given the directors background with in the Reagan administration one might feel as though Dinesh D'Souza is Bias. Of course he's bias and of of course that matters, but his bias leaning toward conservatism is what made an objective vetting of Barack Obama possible. That is what has been missing since 2008 from our media sources concerning our dear ruler. Put this film on the top of your must watch list you will not be disappointed.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1W9JB3KRSDEQD	"singer ""mg"""	"Even if you are mistrustful of Obama this is one bad documentary. The first 15 minutes of this documentary is devoted to D'Souza who explains his relationship to Reagan, his views on race and his thoughts on why America is a morally superior country as if this is really relevant, what it exposes is his lack of neutrality. He's basically saying ""This film is a conservative Republican politically motivated profile of Obama not a documentary on Obama"", and it is. This film makes huge leaps and bounds on Obama's past family history in an effort to psychologically profile the man and they do it as if they have intimate knowledge of the man. They screen through Obama's admittedly badly written autobiography and use some elements, leaving out others to hone into the most negative representations of Obama's past and what they believe to be his ""psyche"". They approach ""experts"" to explain Obama's deep innermost motives and what you get is not a thought provoking insightful profile but a carefully managed hit piece.I personally dislike Obama and believe his presidency to be a disaster. I don't think he's a strong leader and I often think 'I don't know the man' in the sense that I am not clear on what he really really stands for but if you are going to attempt to ""know"" the man through his past then you have to do so in an objective and even manner.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3GHGISUXOYHDV	skiman100	"There are plenty of reviews on this documentary, some of hatred, and some that are objective. So I'm not going to bloviate too much.1- It's a pretty decent documentary; I've watched it both in the theater and at home. Is D'Souza showing his conservative hand with some of his theories? Of course he is but if you watched his speech at CPAC you would understand his primary reasoning for doing this documentary. I don't anticipate the ""progressives"" will take the time to watch his speech, or attempt any investigative research, as they're happy receiving their daily intake of media kool-aid. I personnally enjoy watching both sides to better understand how screwed up this country really is.2- Is the documentary worth the $10 on Amazon, or $5 on cable? Well... I guess that depends on how informed of a voter you want to be. You could continue to get your news from the left leaning media that fails daily to do their due diligence in accurate reporting, or you can do the right thing and become more informed. Review BOTH sides with an open mind and attempt to remove emotion from the equation; it only clouds clear thought. Once this is done make your decision. If you can't do this I ask that you stay home and not vote. The future of my children greatly depend on ethically smart people running this country.3- Is the documentary all conjecture and right wing extremism? Only if measured with the extreme hatred of the far lefts yard stick. As many reviewers have stated D'Souza references Obama's own words numerous times; it's not D'Souzas words... their Barry's. He interviews numerous family friends and acquantances, from around the world, to establish an Obama baseline; something NO ONE HAS DONE TO DATE! To truly understand what has happened over the last several years one must establish a character baseline as we didn't have one for Obama to begin with.In closing, I would recommend this documentary. I believe the title is absolutely true ""Love Him, Hate Him, You Don't Know Him"". Never before in our history has someone held the most powerful position of our country without a deep dive and understanding of their past.

And the one question from the film that continually stands out to me is how and the heck did this guy ever get elected?? I mean c'mon, an Illinois Senator for like 2 years, no real work experience, etc. Not to bash Obama's character but he has to be one of the most invisible and underqualified persons to become elected.

And, having read them all 47, I was disappointed to realize that none of the one-star ""reviewers"" has seen the documentary. Their under-rating is an act of politically motivated blind hatred.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2HMB1IEBSGSHJ	sneaky-sneaky	To be fair, the first half of the documentary is quite interesting.  Mr. D'Souza traces the path of Obama's childhood from Hawaii to Indonesia, and also traces the origins of the president's parents.  Extensive quotations are provided throughout the documentary, all from 'Dreams from my Father' and in Mr. Obama's own voice, presumably from an audiobook.  Mr. Obama's remote, idealized father turned out to be a drunken womanizer killed in a DUI, and certain professors that influenced a young Barack held leftist views, all valid and interesting material.  But the conclusions that D'Souza draws from these influences on Obama are beyond hypothetical and cross into paranoid fantasy.First of all, a 'United States of Islam' stretching from approximately Israel to Afghanistan.  In 2016?  Maybe after four hundred years of arguing, not four.  And secondly, so what?  If there were a United States of Islam (and I doubt they would choose that name), it would not be the 'fault' of a U.S. president or even his or her responsibility.  Obama is a rabid anti-colonialist.  Proof?  A Winston Churchill bust scandal and some leftist professors, unconvincing at best.  And the kicker.  Obama secretly wants to run the deficit to such extremes that he will bankrupt the country, and then remold it as a socialist utopia!  By that logic, starting two wars (and keeping funding off the books), and simultaneously providing a massive tax cut just as the baby boomers were preparing to retire would be a far more realistic scenario for bankruptcy.  Also, you could unleash a greedy financial sector without regulation and see what happens, that might bankrupt us too.I had the privilege to hear Bill Clinton speak a year or so ago, and he advised us to hold our noses and watch Fox occasionally just to see what the other side is saying.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2HT0J58KOSITH	"soothesayer ""soothesayer"""	This is one hot subject that creates controversy between both political parties.  Now that the election has come and gone it is not nearly so controversial, but it does offer information I was not aware of about the president.  I see this film as a documentary, not a fiction work filled with opinions or made with an effort to coerce individuals into thinking negatively about this country or who runs it.  It offers the facts only, but unfortunately too many individuals are jaded by their own opinions with a determined mindset and refused to take the time to learn more about this individual and his previous background both politically and personally with his own difficult upbringing.  I feel this film was not given a fair chance by the general public and was badly slandered by the entertainment hype which prevented sharing this valid information.  It is well made and I feel Mr. D'Souza did a fine job of remaining fair and not opinionated while making the film.

Very scary analysis of Obama.  I have always had the opinion that Obama and his agenda have been the greatest terrorist threat to the US since 911 and after watching this, I feel better about my assumption.  IF all those people that voted for him had seen this and learned more about his true upbringing and intentions, he never would have been elected.  No surprise that almost none of what was uncovered in this movie was told to the US through the liberal biased media.  While I am mostly right wing on most issues (not social ones), I would GLADLY go back to 2008 and give the election to Hillary for EIGHT STRAIGHT YEARS *IF* we could erase the past 4 and not give him a shot at re-election.  The US can't take another 4 yrs of his policies that continue to weaken America in every aspect (military, economy, immigration, foreign policy and America's standing and responsibility to be a beacon of democracy).  GO SEE THIS AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND- if you watch this and still feel Obama is the right choice- fine, but at least know WHO you are voting for THIS TIME.	5.0	Simply amazing movie- a real eye opener and confirmed my belief of his true intentions for America	2012-10-17	37	27	10

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1TV2LWOMQNG5L	stealth2e	There is quite a bit of factual information here, and quite a bit of spin.  If you are a white American or a non-white American who is not comfortable with people who have a different ethnic or cultural background than you do, you will probably not want to vote for Barack Obama. I think that what this story demonstrates is candidate and President Obama's skill as a politician in negotiating the possible while staying in power. I cannot justifiably presume Obama's ideology from this story as the author does, although I would venture to say Obama is a realist and a centrist, although spun slightly to the left compared to the right.(!) He still has my vote.  We are not all on our own.  We are all in this together.  Overall, I would describe this film as fear mongering tripe, and it does not reflect well on Mr. D'Souza.	1.0	junkme2e	2012-10-25	49	13	36

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1NZEERZBH2SY9	Stephanie	"Having read a variety of D'Souza's previous work and the President's own autobiographies, I found the movie very compelling.  Politics aside, this is one man's THEORY of why the POTUS does the things he does and some background on the man himself based on the president's own words and actions, and some opinions of various people around him and from a lot of different places.  You can agree with the theory or not, but the movie itself is well made and the subject matter keeps things interesting.  Let's face it, most documentaries are prescriptions for a nap and I didn't find that to be the case with this one at all.  As far as politics go, liberals will find this as inflammatory as conservatives did ""Fahrenheit 911.""PS:  I find it interesting that the mainstream media has rabidly gone after Mr. D'Souza for his theories but Michael Moore was lauded for his.  Enough of that...vote however you like, just make sure you vote!!"	4.0	Interesting theory...	2012-10-24	49	37	12
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A10LC705MF5LBT	Stephen	"First off, the title is slightly misleading.  This documentary is based off of D'Souza's book, ""Roots of Obama's Rage,"" thus, at least 2/3 of the film is spent offering an answer to basically two questions:  1) Who is Barack Obama, Jr?  2) How does that affect what he wants to do as President?  The last 1/3 of the documentary builds off of the important background of the first 2/3, and offers a theory of what Obama would do if re-elected (unlimited by not having to cater to the American public to get re-elected for a 3rd term.Artistically, this is one of the best put together documentaries I've ever seen.  The mix of music, the story line, the addition of the audio straight out of Obama's autobiography--read by Obama himself--offers a powerful touch.  With that, the integrity of the editing is par-none.  Other reviewers claim that D'Souza cuts and splices--something Michael Moore got rich off of--but D'Souza does not have a purpose of propaganda, he has a purpose of informing his viewers of Obama's past, his father's past, and the roots and outcomes from their shared anti-colonial beliefs.If you like the Michael Moore type mis-information, cut-and-pasted speeches to alter what was actually said, then this documentary isn't for you.  If you are close-minded about learning anything about Barack Obama other than the color of his skin or his political party affiliation, this documentary isn't for you.  It is for the open-minded, non-apathetic person.  This documentary looks at the scope of what Obama has done, what he has said, who his ""associates"" in life have been, as well as the same subjects about his father.  D'Souza went searching to find the lens by which to understand Obama's worldview, and the one he has applied--anti-colonialism--looks like a very solid fit.  D'Souza finishes the documentary by applying that world view to what Obama has already done and then offers a vision of what that anti-colonialism will look like in the Presidency over four more years.One very strong point from the documentary I took away from watching it:  Obama does not care about helping the poor (go ask his brother George), he only cares about taking from the wealthy...as a penalty.  Why?  He believes that America did not get wealthy by innovation, but by stealing from third world countries.  Thus, D'Souza predicts that the biggest affect of an Obama re-election is domestic economic terrorism by the President (my phrase).  In short, Obama wants to continue to go farther and farther into debt, so that America is no longer a colonial super-power.Those who make this all about politics or about a ""black man"" (who happens to be just as white) in the Oval Office and want to discard this documentary because of political party affiliation must, in my opinion, critically answer why Obama has done some of the things he has done (like allowed the debt to get so high, returned the bust of Winston Churchill, etc).At the end of the day, the documentary attempts to inform the viewer of who Obama is--a question nobody bothered trying to find out when Senator Obama was running for President.  D'Souza does not go over the top to scare anyone, though watching it critically should result in some fear of Obama.  He doesn't bad-mouth the President or paint him as evil, though again, one may come away with that view.  He simply explains Obama's background; D'Souza takes Obama's friends, mentors, and Obama Sr. and their politically beliefs, and extracts the common themes.Thus, the documentary aims to answer the problem stated in the subtitle:  Love him, hate him....YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.  He is more than a black man.  He is more than a Democrat.  He is more than a Harvard law student.  He is more than an Illinois Senator.On its merits, there is no reason to give this documentary anything below three stars.  It is cinematically polished and well done.  It is artistically made.  It is not full of the explicit political propaganda of other documentaries of this genre.  The storyline is edited with integrity, unlike many documentaries of this genre.  Finally, D'Souza himself states that he went looking for the background information of Obama in order to understand his driving worldview.  He boldly claims that he believes the anti-colonial theme explains Obama's actions more perfectly than any other theme.  Thus, he leaves it open for someone to disprove his theory.  You'll never see that in a Michael Moore documentary.At the end of the day, I'm left with the conclusion that the negative reviews I've read on Amazon of this documentary are rooted in political affiliation/color of skin, because on its merits, this film is one of the best--if not the best--in its genre.So who should watch this film?  Anyone who wants to KNOW Obama and try to understand him.  Anyone open-minded enough to look past a donkey/elephant and the color of a man's skin.  Those who want to learn, rather than be entertained....this is NOT a Michael Moore-make-someone-look-ridiculous-by-editing film.

Most of these documentaries use quotes out of context or pseudo-facts, and this one is no exception. However it is well made and engaging, other than the interviews conducted over the phone. He had the budget to travel to India and Africa, but not NYU? That seemed strange.Like other reviewers the first 2/3 of the movie are just an analysis of Obama's background through the lens of his father's political views. Nothing very interesting, although he tries to equate the father's socialist rhetoric with Obama without any context of the statements. However this is common in most documentaries of this type (see any of Al Gore's work).The most profound / ridiculous statements are made during the last 1/3 of the movie, claiming that Obama is a secret Muslim / 3rd world sympathizer. First the chart of the national debt since 2000 was to illustrate that Obama is intentionally trying to weaken the US to the benefit of the 3rd world. However if you look closely, the debt was rising at the same rate during the Bush administration. So the conclusion must also be that Bush was a secret Muslim sympathizer as well. Also ominously at the end of the movie he circles the entire middle east and northern africa as the United State of Islam. Evidently he does not understand the difference between Shia and Sunni. Also to equate Al Qaeda with all Muslim countries is nonsense.The only other point that is brushed over in this doc, is the point that he tries to state that he has some understanding of the African-American experience because his palm of his hand is the same color as Jesse Jackson's...

Obama's dream for America is to downsize our great country and make it vulnerable as already shows in his actions. When driving down the street in my town I see the for rent signs, out of business signs etc. evidence that his dream is coming true. What his voters don't realize is when he taxes small business they won't be able to grow and hire employees. People are not poor because some are wealthy.I did not vote for Obama in the first election. I will not vote for him in this election. Mitt Romney showed great leadership skills during the first debate. Obama appeared to be like a school boy getting scolded. Not quality of a good leader.If people are voting for Obama because of his skin color that makes them racists. It they are voting for him for any other reason they are stupid and don't understand or don't care about the issues.Obama has done nothing positive for this great country of ours. There is so much division between people and races since he took office, it astounds me that so many people actually voted for him and will vote for him again. That says a LOT about the people that give him their votes. They are like mules with blinders on. Wake up people...know what the issues are before you cast your vote.I was skeptical of Romney but after watching the first debate I think he is going to make a fine leader for our country.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3V3D48MP9KWPA	stillbillythekid	I found the movie a fabrication of the truth and releasing this piece of garbage during an election year a cheap exercise in exploitation snuff. While I am not an avid Obama fan, I do respect what he has accomplished especially considering the situation the country was in when he took over and the lack of any cooperation from across the aisle. Obamacare has helped my family and returned a refund to my employer and my IRA has recovered all that it lost in 2008 and has even increased some. BTW: I walked out of the theater when I saw enough (about 15 minutes worth) and would never suggest purchasing this and fattening the wallet of its mastermind. I am a Vietnam era vet and respect my President....even GWB until the lies came to light in Iraq. I have not heard of anyone questioning the current President's actions....just his heritage, citizenship, religion and associates.

Then he goes on to constructs a fascinating piece of work that is a handbook on how to use illogical conclusions, half-truths, and guilt by association to support his goals. After his personal history D'Souza goes on to suggest Obama's initial actions are inexplicable. Oddly he starts with Obama's removal of Winston Churchill's bust from the Oval office. He neglects to mention what Obama replaced the bust with [Lincoln's bust]. Had he done so it might vitiated his line of reasoning that comes further in the film. The other actions that puzzle D'Souza are equally insipid and each has a reasonable explanation. But again clarification would mitigation his anti-Obama tirade. This is film should be watched by both supporters and opponents of Obama; the first to illustrate what type of propaganda is being circulated and for the opponents, assuming they are intellectually honest, to see a flawed production.	1.0	An anti-Obama campaign piece	2013-01-05	26	11	15

You come away with a feeling that you really know the reasons for the president's loyalties.  He is passionate about what he believes having been raised with an eye single to his purpose, and surrounded by like minded individuals his entire life.  The picture painted is grim.  It portrays a man with a vision of an America that is too far reaching where the world is concerned, and needs to be brought down a peg or two.  It also shows that he believes that the government's roll is to provide for all the needs of the individual.  But if one is aware the writing is on the wall.  We're trading our precious freedom for what we perceive as security.  As someone who already held these views it was not a revelation to me.  However, to someone who supports the President's plan it might give that person something to think about.  His supporters may realize that they really didn't know his agenda at all. Having been born and raised in America, my feelings about this country, its government and its purposes are different than his.	5.0	well done, important	2012-12-07	5	3	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1LJTW8QHWRHZR	Tchaz	Out of fairness to the audience, let me introduce myself. I am a republican.  My first election was Nixon vs McGovern (RIP).  I remember what's his name overseeing the Watergate scandal.  What a mess.  What an idiot Nixon was to have done such a thing.  He was a criminal.  He got what he deserved; maybe less than he deserved.  He did some great things as president, but his legacy will always be Watergate.One of the most prosperous times we've seen in this country was during the Clinton White House.  He was a scoundrel, no doubt, but his presidency, with republicans in the congress clearly set the tone.  Balanced budget.  New reforms.  Good times.So, regarding this documentary, I was surprised.  I expected a lot of rhetoric, but that's not what I saw.  What is presented in this video is Obama's true thoughts.  His real inspirations. Obama is a true Marxist.  He wants to level the playing field, not only in this country, but in the world.  He's not looking to make the rich poor and the poor rich.  He wants to redistribute wealth globally.  He wants to make sure the US looks like a 3rd world country.  He wants to raise the quality of life in Afghanistan and Libya to our standard.  And reduce our standard to their's.We cannot allow this.  Vote people, Vote!	5.0	Biased, but listen	2012-10-21	24	17	7

While I took exception to a couple of items presented, like claiming Obama was born in Hawaii when no one knows for certain where he was born.  Overall very interesting film and well documented.  Makes one think, is this someone you want as President?  Especially disturbing was who the individuals were in Obama's life that formed his anti-Amerian world view.  For instance Frank Marshall Davis a card carrying Communist and Soviet Agent had a tremendous influance making Obama into a died in the wool Marxist.	5.0	Interesting perspective	2012-11-06	10	4	6

It is presented in a fair and impartial manner and does not advocate a specific political ideology. It does not mention Mitt Romney and is not a propaganda film. It does not advocate voting for nor against Obama, as some who've posted reviews (in most cases, not having actually watched and listened to the documentary) seem to think. This documentary attempts to answer the following questions: Who is Obama? Which people, experiences, and beliefs influenced and shaped him during his life? What is Obama's worldview and where does he see the USA fitting into the world? Much of the material is drawn directly from Obama himself, by way of audio clips narrated by Obama in his own words, in his own voice, from his autobiography ""Dreams From My Father"" (not of, from). The producers also interview some members of Obama's family and some of his parents' friends and associates who knew his parents and Obama himself. The questions asked are specific but are not leading, and are fair. I would recommend this film to anyone who intends to vote for the next U.S. president, who wants to know more about Obama, or who wants to get more facts about him to better understand him and his policies. Unlike a propaganda film, this wonderfully made documentary leaves viewers to decide for themselves, to form their own opinions. It provides more than a single point of view and never pushes the viewer towards one conclusion or another."	5.0	High-quality, unbiased, intelligent and thought-provoking	2012-10-13	33	24	9

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AV6QDP8Q0ONK4	"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z"""	Dinesh D'Souza opens the film as an ego fest comparing himself to Obama, claiming they are both &#34;mixed race.&#34; He discusses his debate with Jesse Jackson where our author agrees with Jesse that &#34;racism is a reality.&#34; D'Souza claims he is a black man just like Jesse Jackson because when they both hold up their hands, the inside of the palms looks the same. I mean seriously, the guy shows two palms side by side in the film. Wasn't anyone else laughing at this point?D'Souza is also the guy who took his mistress to a family values meeting and wondered what the fuss was about.His impression of Reagan was that he was &#34;not that serious of a guy.&#34;He claims Obama was born in Hawaii, perhaps as an attempt to look factual. D'Souza plays clips of conservative pundits claiming they don't know anything about Obama, followed five minutes later by revealing important things about Obama, in his own words, from his autobiography that would have been available to said conservative pundits. I guess &#34;truthiness&#34; is what counts.The film mentions that the first act of Obama was to return the Churchill bust. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence outside the Treaty Room and is still there as of this writing. The confusion is described by Factcheck: &#34;The White House has had a bust of Winston Churchill since the 1960's. At the start of the Bush administration Prime Minister Blair lent President Bush a bust that matched the one in the White House, which was being worked on at the time and was later returned to the residence. The version lent by Prime Minister Blair was displayed by President Bush until the end of his Presidency. On January 20, 2009 -- Inauguration Day -- all of the art lent specifically for President Bush's Oval Office was removed by the curator's office, as is common practice at the end of every presidency. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence.&#34;The connection of Obama to his father's dreams seems to be a main point of the film, although we never specifically told what those dreams were. D'Souza conjures up guesses from dubious interviews. Obama's father worked within the system. He valued education and attended American universities. At this point D'Souza attempts to rewrite history. Apparently the effects of colonialism was all a good thing.D-Souza doesn't understand why Obama intervened in Libya and not Syria, or why we aren't taking our marching orders from Israel and going after Iran. All one has to do is look at a map to answer that. Coastal areas provide for easy drone access in Libya whose population is concentrated in a small area, no need to use ground troops. The Strait of Hormuz near Iran, which passes much of the world's oil, needs to be stable.D'Souza also gets a failing grade in economics. A communist would not have bailed out the banks or saved the auto industry. Obama has carefully taken steps to prevent socialism.D'Souza also claims the government took over health care. This is not really true. The government is regulating the private health insurance business. Obama adopted a Republican plan that requires people to buy health care insurance. He is forcing people to buy something from the private sector. I can't imagine this is what communist Frank Marshall Davis had in mind, that is, enacting a Nixon plan for health care.What D-Souza doesn't say is that the US and Russia together have the capability to destroy the world 400 times over. Seems once would be enough. It cost money to maintain nuclear weapons, something our one-sided narrator never mentions. He should have quoted Reagan May 16, 1983 &#34; And my goal is the total elimination of nuclear weapons.&#34;The movie is as entertaining and accurate as a Sean Hannity telecast. It draws lines and makes connections that are not there. It relies on the fact that most viewers don't have the background to grasp complex issues or are willing to Google the information.An entertaining film for all the wrong reasons.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1GOJSM3XB62VB	Thomas G. Farrar	"2016: Obama's America is self-described as an explanation about the politician and his beliefs, and ultimately what will happen if Obama is re-elected in the 2012 election.D'Souza, the writer and narrarator,  describes a curiosity about Obama, who he originally felt a kinship with as a racial minority (in D'Souza's case, from India) who attended an Ivy League School and became involved in politics.  D'Souza joined a radical conservative group at Dartmouth, and eventually worked within the Reagan Administration.D'Souza spends most of the movie investigating Obama's impression of his absent father, and concludes that Obama idolized his missing parent.  For a brief time in the film, D'Souza describes Obama's attempt to fill his father-figures with mentors, including Jeremiah Wright.Ultimately, D'Souza decides that Obama's entire philosphy is based around ""Anti-Colonialism,""  which is the idea that the US (and many West European Countries) exploited third-world/developing countries and should pull back and allow other groups to develop themselves.These ""investigations"" take up the first 80 minutes or so of the documentary.  For the last 5-10 minutes of the movie, D'Souza finally describes what he thinks will happen if the US follows the pattern of Anti-Colonialism, which is the US will lose all of it's nuclear superiority, the economy will decline (and likely collapse), and there will be a new ""United States of Islam"" (yes, those are the author's exact words)through the Middle East.First of all, the claims of Obama being affected by his absent father are likely true at least in part (after all, who isn't affected by their parents, present or absent?).  Secondly, the idea of ""Anti-Colonialism""  is nothing new (look at European countries such as Britain and France pulling away from all of their influence in Africa and Asia), and Obama may be affected by this idea in part as well.So these factors may have influenced Obama and his policies.  D'Souza has found support for his own theory that Obama is pulling US influence away from the world scene to some degree.  However, US foreign policy moves in cycles, and after a push of foreign involvement the US typically pulls back and focuses on domestic issues The Reagan and Bush eras focused externally, while the Clinton era focused internally.  Since George W. Bush, the US seems to be focusing internally again, shown by both Romney and Obama campaigning heavily about the economy and unemployment. This historical pattern is completely ignored by D'Souza, and he seems to be trying to self-fulfill his own prophecy.I also was very disappointed that after trying to support his theory, there was only a tiny percentage of the film devoted to the future.  The film is titled ""2016"" after all.  D'Souza took a few situations, dramatically took them to the frightening extreme, and again ignored much of the complexity of the world (not to mention complexity within the US itself).Thus ultimately I found the documentary unfullfilling:  A few unoriginal ideas that weren't investigated very thoroughly.  I get the feeling that once the election is over, no matter who wins, this film will disappear as irrelevant."	2.0	Without getting political, this documentary was disappointing	2012-10-22	26	6	20
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A2G417I6GAPMI8	Thomas	I saw the film last year. I found it very interesting and well thoughtout. I have also seen the writer on a number of debates about the facts of the film. Most adverse comments come from adversaries that offer little fact based information to refute the information presented in the film. Many attacks are pure personal against Mr. D'Souza. It is now 2014. So far this year, the information and predictions from the film are becoming real. Look at the Middle East. Is it now in turmoil and and be approaching an Islamic caliphate. What do we have with Obamacare? Income redistribution? Minimum wage? Drugs? We have another two years to go to pronounce how well this film predicted 2016.I also find it suspicious that the Justice Department sent an entire FBI investigation team to go over every bit of Mr. D'Souza's political donations. They came up a 20K problem after all this. Strange that we have Benghazi and Fast and Furious where Americans died, yet no answers. No full investigation there? Seems they too busy with Mr. D'Souza's records. He could be guilty...but sometimes I wonder how this administration is so open as they said they would be?	5.0	Waiting to See Events	2014-01-25	6	4	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A4KDWVIN2L4E0	"ThorBjorn ""Norseman"""	"In this excellent film, Dinesh D'souza has created a detalied summary of the unqualified poseur presently mismanaging OUR NATION.D'souza exposes obama's early life, placing emphasis on the vast array of blatantly anti-American leftists who counseled him from his youth to the present. Much effort is placed on the character of obama's ""dead-beat dad"" absentee father, a true leftist-loser who returned to Kenya after some years abroad at various universities. Unable to find the success he believed he deserved, obama senior spent his last years as an abusive, chronically unemployed alcoholic.Then there is the mother, ...another parental figure largely absent from her responsibility. When one reads the biographies of various leftists, prominent and obscure, ...chronic dodging of responsibility and an overt lack of accountability is really quite common. The priority for barry's mother appears to have been the pursuit of her liberal politics combined with international philandering.Many of the facts detailed in this movie were known to me from previous reading, ...however, I did not know that barry was an illegitimate bastard!In fact, obama-the-father was already married in Kenya, when he was engaging in his deceptive daliance with stanley ann dunham.So who IS this pretentious buffoon who just appeared out of nowhere?All the basic questions are answered in this film. Despite being largely abandoned by his parents, barry was raised by his mother's parents. The dunham family ensured  that their grandson was exposed to ultra-left radicals at a very young age, most notably a notorious communist-journalist, frank marshall davis. In his priveledged college years, this list would include edward said, and lefto-terrorist bill ayers. The 20 year affiliation with racist white-hating ""preacher"" jeremiah wright has continued up until very recently, ...until it became a potential impediment to barry's political career.So what will be the end-result of another 4 years of this highly questionable individual at the helm of OUR nation? We have a ""president"" who DOES NOT love our country.This individual and his followers desperately want to believe that America and the West are ""inherantly racist"" and undeserving their hard-won prosperity. If you are a patriot who loves America, you should watch this movie as soon as possible, and make all necessary preparations for the worst possible scenarios."	5.0	VOTE the bastard OUT!	2012-09-30	40	20	20

I gave the movie three stars, not because of it's workmanship; it's actually excellent. I gave it three stars because I am a Democrat who voted for Barack Obama four years ago and today I with great remorse voted for Mitt Romney. I could not shake the feeling that our nation is headed down the wrong path. It's the feeling you get when you think you've missed the exit sign on a strange interstate. You think you're lost but not sure yet and even less sure about how to get back on track. The realism of the movie and the disappointments of today don't make me happy.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A27FYYS44LH7KD	Thucydides 1	"By now you've probably read dozens of other reviews, insightful and well-written.  But I feel unsatisfied because this ""expose"" didn't go nearly deep enough into Obama's past, or with nearly enough focus and scope.  In my opinion, we know far less about Barack Obama than we do about any other President of the United States, and, unfortunately, this documentary is simply inadequate for the purpose of revealing anything that most of us haven't known about this man for over four years.I won't give high praise for any compendium of revelations about Obama until a LOT MORE is revealed than this meandering documentary shows.  Truly, although it appears to be quite accurate, it is, at best a skin-deep introduction to Obama for people who haven't really been paying attention since this man came up out of nowhere in 2008.  Some day, years from now, a much more complete and thorough biography of Barack Obama will finally emerge, and I suspect that THAT will be far more interesting than anything any of us have seen so far."	3.0	I wish it gone much farther and much deeper and stayed tightly focused on Obama's history...	2012-10-26	8	3	5

I hope that this has been a lesson to all.  I greatly appreciate what the producers and director have done here.  I may love Obama, but I hate his leadership and direction.  Too many have forgotten where we came from, along with trials and tribulations that helped to form this great young country.  To look back at older countries and follow their failed path is certainly proving to be wrong. I look forward to the truth, like this, to continue to be written and the end of the deceit our main-stream media companies have kept feeding the weaker, poorer, and nave citizens of this great country.

His family history is captivating and explains so much of some of the seemingly illogical moves, such as returning the bust of Churchill and giving the Queen of England an iPod full of his speeches.  Perhaps for me the most compelling explanation for Obama's turn away from America's traditional allies and pivot toward her long standing adversaries, was the love his mother had for the third world and her disdain for America.  Couple this with the longing for an absentee father, who aside from being muslim and anti-Israel, had his own struggle and antipathy for British colonialism and the theory holds a lot of water.

However it does show that the left has created an unbeatable voting block in minorities, poor, illegal aliens secretly granted the right to vote by democrats, and Obama's DOJ who sues any state upholding the Voter ID Law.What I came away with is there is no longer Democrats and Republicans...there is only Patriots and Traitors.With the abomination called Obamacare the poor and liberal traitors, and skillful USSC appointment have brought an end to the freedoms we formally took for granted. Obama has just a few more Federal Court Appointments to make and the noose will be set...His Will, will be the new Law of the Land.With the hiring of 17,000 new IRS people to enforce Obamacare, the recent order by this Socialist Government of 7 BILLION rounds of 5.56 Assault Rifle hollow point ammunition (illegal for use by any military) things are adding up...fast.We have already lost control of our Government. Obama's promise to take money from the rich (and Middle Class) and give it to the POOR, illegal aliens, and Middle East Muslim countries... in exchange for votes and financial support. In 2008 Obama got $63 million in illegal campaign funds from the Middle East, he promised to return it. As president he picked his own Dept. of Justice and Communist sympathizer Eric Holder, and no one brings charges against their boss, when he's the president.I think even the movie maker would admit that things are even worse than predicted. Obama said he wanted his own Federal Police Force the same in size and funding as the US Military...behind the curtain he is building that personal Federal Force right now. Exactly the same as Hitler did in 1930's, Obama is building his SS Troops out of illegal aliens with the promise of amnesty and entitlements for them and their families still in Mexico. Mexico is now run by Drug Cartels partially armed by the US Government. Those in the middle, come here.This story is only just begun...and the worst is yet to come. When you don't pay for your expensive Government Health Insurance, ""Obamacare"" ... Armed IRS Agents will come to your door.Soon your going to have to ask yourself just how much does FREEDOM really mean to you, and what are YOU willing to do to preserve it ? Will this be the generation that ended Freedom in America ?

In these times, people are likely to review it based on their partisan beliefs (esp. considering the timing of it's release!), but I feel it is a must-watch for all Americans. When you consider a person running for our nation's highest office in 2008, and then leading our nation the past 3-1/2 years, it was surprising to me how much NEW, factual information we never got about then-candidate Obama. I thought a lot of the facts presented in this presentation were compelling and relevant. While you may agree or disagree with his conclusions, there is no escaping from the fact that the persons in his life - his mother, father and father figure(s) had some influence on his core beliefs, not to mention that much of his upbringing was removed from America itself. It is up to us now, as individuals, to decide whether or not these factors and beliefs play a part in helping decide if that is the man we want leading our country.	5.0	Provides the Background We Weren't Given in 2008	2012-10-22	23	18	5

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AGC8BAUJ8XOKO	Troy	"I've never seen such a fear fest in my life! I can't believe people are believing something just because the way the music swells, the film is edited & the way somebody says something with supposed conviction. They did all this stuff with Bush & most of my co-hort GOP voters never said a thing about how that was put together! They used actual quotes from him & supposed charts & graphs etc, etc & if you ask me the whole lot of it is fear mongering! If you use this film as actual factual material you very well could've been one of Jim Jones' followers drinking the Kool-Ade with everyone else. If you're looking for facts look in places you normally wouldn't look as well. Look for simple, uneditorialized informational facts... not just something that supports only your views. Just because somebody FEELS & shouts something strongly enough like my new enemy Rush Limbaugh, doesn't mean it's necessarily factual. If you can find the same facts in at least 2 varying places then MAYBE you can begin to think of it as fact. I'm not saying this movie is bad because of what it's saying but how they tried to make me fear/believe what it said. This movie has really & truly made me, my wife & first time voter 19 year old son to actually vote for Obama. I honestly never thought I'd say this but after fact checking everything this film purported I find that at least 90% IS fear mongering. We, my family & I, have lost a couple of friends over this but I don't care because I have to vote for the facts first & the correct context in which they were written. This film made me do a LOT of homework but I am very grateful to God I did. I have been suggesting to friends who want to see it to check out my work after viewing it. 2 couples have & did see what I was saying... one of the couples from Ohio called me tonight & said they understood my qualm with it & the whole Romney campaign... they too, after much prayer & thought are voting for our (who I have now come to believe as our) staunch, Christian president. After all Jesus did provide for the poor & hungry & those who had little or no voice. I believe this with my whole  heart today.I have no desire or intent to argue or try to proselytize regarding my views but in reviewing this film I must thank the filmmaker for helping me see the extremes some politicians will go to ""fear"" people into voting.Now, with no fear or anger in my heart I hope & pray you all vote your hearts & minds as well. Not the way you may just ""feel"" about someone/something.God Bless (I apologize if you leave comments regarding this review...

I have to admit, I wasn't very exciting about going, but they didn't want to go alone and I had agreed to go, so I went.  The movie is a documentary based upon narrator Dinesh D'Souza's 2010 book, THE ROOTS OF OBAMA'S RAGE. As far as documentaries go, 2016 isn't terrible. There are parts of the movie that are well-researched (for instance, it's far better researched and documented than some of the stuff in Al Gore's AN INCOVENIENT TRUTH), but then there are other things that aren't as well documented, presented, or researched. As far as having an agenda, not all, but most documentaries have an agenda of some sort. The difference between 2016 and many other documentaries is that the agenda of the movie has a conservative bent instead of a progressive one. Personally, I didn't learn anything new by watching 2016. It's stuff that I've heard before. Being from Illinois, I've known about Obama and his socialist ideology long before he gave that 2004 Democratic National Convention key note address that made him famous. People on the far right will fawn over the movie and people on the far left will hate it without even giving it a chance. I know there are some in the U.S. who don't know much about President Obama and they might learn a thing or two or be spurned after watching the movie to do their own research into Obama's background and beliefs. 2016 is an average documentary that might be worth watching if you try to watch it without bias.

All in all, D'Souza's article reads like a bad conspiracy theory.""This is a work in that long conservative tradition of creating a self-reinforcing alternate reality that only they see.So if you're a conservative, take a break from Fox News and Glenn Beck and watch this and then feel the camaraderie amongst yourselves about how much you hate Obama."	1.0	Partisan hackery	2012-10-24	47	11	36
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1IHP7DPR9H453	Vince In Houston	Face it, there aren't too many people that are going to pick up this movie for entertainment on a Friday night. It's a documentary. A documentary on a political figure. I think this movie will mainly appeal to one of two types of people:1) People that want to see this movie again and show it to others2) People that have heard about it, are curious and want to find out for themselvesI myself, was never sure if the questionable economic decisions Obama was making were because he was ignorant of the way our economic system works or if he made those decisions because he did know and his purpose for doing them was for ill. Much of this film has Obama describing/illustrating in his own words, his thoughts and feelings during pivotal moments in his life - a surprising amount of it is actually in his own voice. 2016 Obama's America examines not only Obama's public persona, but how events that happened during his formative years might impact his life, form his motives and shape the decisions he makes. Here, to me, the difference between D'Souza's film and someone like Michael Moore's films are evident. D'Souza doesn't tell you what to think about Obama, he asks you what YOU think and he follows a logical progression from child to man - you make your own conclusions. Now, knowing more about Obama and his formative years, it's a more informed viewpoint that allows me to determine Obama's possible motivations and it's much easier to make an educated guess about who he is and why he makes the decisions he makes.So is this a political hit piece or is it something else? If this was a hit piece, the film might take a different tact such as only listing Obama's negatives and accusing him when there is no evidence to support such suppositions. Instead, I think D'Souza is passionate about finding and presenting the real story of Obama's life and trying to find out who our president is regardless of where that leads him. I think Dinesh's agenda is to inform people that knew next to nothing about Obama. D'Souza informed me when facts were there and clearly asked me to question things when the facts aren't as clear. Unfortunately, for Obama (and people who voted for him and looked to him to make positive changes in America) the portrait that emerges from an examination of his life isn't a positive one.I rated this film a 5 because it has been extensively researched and is a well done documentary. And guess what? It IS an enjoyable film to watch specifically because it is topical and informative.	5.0	Political hit piece or informative film?	2012-10-18	19	13	6

It definitely made you think about how a persons upbringing with strong family and community influences at a very early age, as well as reinforcements through growing years, really is what molds the inner person.  It would be very difficult to imagine that his past would not have strong undertones of his values and vision for the future.All in all it was very thought provoking.One of the most interesting things about the story, is that is was written by a person that had a similar upbringing and came from immigrants of more recent lineage in America.	5.0	Informative Documentary with Facts	2012-11-03	14	8	6

If you wonder why Obama approved the Ground Zero mosque, supported rebels in Syria but not Iran, preaches supporting one's brother but allows his own brother to live in a shack in Kenya, does not believe in American exceptionalism, does not talk about race, is working to weaken the dollar, and wants to bring down the economic elites, this documentary explains it fully.I teach human development, and I use excerpts from some of the PBS American Presidents series that show how events in the early lives of certain presidents account for their beliefs and actions as adults.

Mr. D'Souza skillfully tells the story and fills in the blanks regarding the unknown background of the 44th President of the USA.  Perhaps the best part of this biographical story is utilizing Barack Hussein Obama's own words and video clips of his speeches that leave any objective viewer little doubt as to the motivations, influences and intentions of Obama.  Mr. D'Souza is neither sensational nor biased in his conveyance of the facts; he merely shares the details of his research, and effectively uses Obama's narrative from ""Dreams of my Father"" to enable viewers to draw their own conclusion about Obama.  And unless the viewer is in a state of denial, the litany of truisms and details as well as the documentation of Obama's USA-hating, communist-embracing mentors leaves little doubt about our President's mission as well as the irreparable harm he is likely to cause if our unwitting American public elects Comrade Obama for a second term.  Mr. D'Souza neglects to go after many aspects of Obama policies that would likely be low-hanging fruit, but instead addresses background facts with indisputable documentation.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3N54RDA10RKDF	Ward K. Brown	MichelleI will purchase 2016 but from another source after reading Sam Graham's Amazon editorial review. As he discusses  Dinesh D'Souza's predictions that Obama will cut the military(check), raise taxes (check)  spend money irresponsibly (check) and so on) he attempts to make light of the filmmaker's contentions that Obama's father , mother, close friends such as. Bill Ayers, and Reverend Wright had influence on Obama and/or claims these are tired concepts. Graham even goes so far as calling the question  &#34;Do you see Israel as a little colonial power in the Middle East?&#34;  a &#34;prodding&#34; question, &#34;typical&#34; of the film.  Graham states &#34;About an hour into the story,..., pretty much all pretense of objectivity is abandoned.&#34; The same must be said about his review, but of course, the reader reaches this conclusion within the first few sentences.  Graham states &#34;the end result will be that those predisposed to mistrust Obama will find nothing to soften their view here&#34; (not the objective of this film)  and &#34;neither will those who think it's nothing but hateful, divisive nonsense&#34; (some people are so close minded, it's difficult for them to consider opinions other than their own.) .

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1TCREA3DWM7NG	Wick111	"I found this film is very well done and informative. I was prepared to wade through the makers' bias and try to glean some factual information. Doing so was not difficult. much of the dialog comes straight from Obama himself - from his book, in his own voice, from his speaches and writing. And his words are not butchered for soundbites in the manner of the campaign ads we are currently drowning in. I don't believe that anyone is contesting what obama's actions have been in the context of this film - it is the interpretation of the motives behind those actions that may be open to interpretation. Watching Obama perform as president i have often been troubled and confused as to why his has done what he has. The typical ""stupidy"" & ""pandering"" retorts are tiresome and fall far short of any kind of explanation. Obama's America 2016 does offer a very cohesive theory that strings together Obama's acts and accomplishments with an elegant simplicity that feels to me very close to unvarnished truth. 2016 does take the viewer one step farther implying what President Obama's second term might entail. Of course no one can know this for certain, but after following Obamas history (from his own mouth/book remember), rise in power, & actions as president in such a logical manner it is not difficult to find 2016's conclusions well within the realm of possibility...even probability. One thing about this 'movie' that did surprise me was that I have much more respect for Obama that I did previously. He has accomplished more and came farther in his life than the vast majority of the population could even dream of.....but how he has done it and what he has done with the power entrusted to him is alarming. ""love him or hate him"" - watch this film, leave the mind-numbing party dogma to sleep, and THINK on it. As long as I'm on a soap box ... how about showing each other as much respect as we would like to be shown? Nothing wrong with having different ideas and opinions.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1OCC2FR1N365O	"William Bjornson ""stranger in a strange land"""	"This is an artfully deceptive and twisted image of a man with a sophisticated and varied childhood who, clearly, is not driven by personal greed or corruption. It attempts to portray Obama as unreliable and beholding to values unAmerican, such as altruism, empathy, sympathy, the very bedrock of any social group's hope to be continuous in time and not destroy itself ripping itself to shreds to suck whatever value it can away from the herd. All civilization depends on the herd, and all war and destruction is born in the elites.Fascism is not a word that the bottom half of the American intelligence distribution fully understands. Nor has any of them even heard of, much less read, the most influential book of the 20th Century: ""Propaganda"" by Edward Bernays (cousin of Freud). It was from this playbook that Goebbels fashioned NAZI Germany. It is from this playbook that rupert murdock manages fox news. If you seriously read many of the reviews here, you will discover comments essentially of the order ""I knew Obama was a bum before I had ever heard of him."" These are the same folks who would reelect gwb or his (proven) even more evil twin romney. America's greatest threat is the absolute ignorance of history so fashionable amongst the anti-intelligentsia and their Pavlovian reflexive embrace of unconscionable greed as the ""American Way"". A great British philosopher and thinker, W. Olaf Stapledon (ex: Star Maker), in the 1920's was so advanced in his realization of group behaviors that his contemporaries had no idea what he was talking about and he had to turn to science fiction to bring his thinking to a wider audience. He liked to create civilizations based on sound humanistic self-reinforcing ideas that allowed a civilization to rise to great heights and then describe in great detail how those same values would mutate just slightly over time and lead to the absolute destruction of the civilization. We are seeing that here in America at this time. ""Freedom"". It has made America strong and powerful. Now, ""freedom"" is being used to justify complete economic domination of all Americans by a psychopathic, completely parasitic, greed-deranged elite who, themselves, see the herd as their rightful victim (there's one born every minute and one born every hour to take them) and are developing ever more invasive and powerful tools to enslave Americans into their trap of debt. There is only one determinant of 'right' in America, only one source of power at this time: Greed. The Constitution has been pushed aside, the ownership of America taken from the people and given to the clinical psychopaths comprising our elite. Corporations have become their tool of parasitism, sucking our energies from us and packaging them for delivery to the elite and dropping a few crumbs to the more easily corruptible amongst us who, themselves, make Judas look like the right kind of guy. There is not a senior corporate executive in America who would not have sold Jesus down the river for the bottom line. Again, ""Freedom"" has been corrupted to mean freedom to enslave, freedom to punish monetarily those who choose not to jump through the shiat-covered hoops exactly when and how high corporate dictates. Have any problem and the credit score slave collar tightens until you become almost a non-citizen unable to find housing, food, even a job. Good luck, America. The same American parasites who fully supported German National Socialism (NAZIs) in the 1930s and into the 1940s (even as we were at war with them) are now aiming at you with the same tools. That, organized innuendos and outright lies, is what this video is about. If you buy the message, please don't forget to apologize to your children for the harm you are doing to them now and in the future. Slavery is measured by the limits on one's options. Ask a recent college graduate out of the middle class (your child?) what their options are. That is slavery. And it's creeping over all of us. And there is only one way to rid ourselves of this curse because the psychopaths who make up this now hereditary deranged elite will not free us without a fight. We must shave these people off the hide of our America and bury them. We'll grow a new elite, but they will be much more honest and polite."	1.0	America sinks into fascism	2012-10-27	46	12	34
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A3I4M2K28RM4XN	William B Martin	I watched this prior to the election when I had already made up my mind as to who I would vote for and why.  This did not sway my vote, but it did result in two things.  First, I found a greater respect for Barack Obama as a person.  His life path is certainly unique and not necessarily one that is conducive to the heights he has achieved.  His success is commendable.Second, I finally saw the ideology of Obama laid out in a manner that made sense and quite honestly can be used to explain every decision that he has made as President.  For those who actually paid attention to the Presidents words and followed his actions and initiatives, the conclusions of this film are of no real surprise and really should not have swayed their votes either.I found this to be a very respectful film and did not serve to &#34;trash&#34; the President but to simply explain his world view and the roots behind it.  It is a narrative that needs to be told for every person entrusted with the honor of the US Presidency.We are in an age where our most powerful officials are not being fully vetted in the manner that is appropriate.  We get caught up in the politics of guilty until proven innocent, such as the case with Obama's birth certificate and Romney's tax returns.  These are simply diversions and have no real material impact on how the person will guide the country.  This film uncovers the idealogical discussions that should be conduct in media interviews and debates.	4.0	Very respectful film	2012-12-12	7	6	1

I was skeptic because i tend to hate partisan documentaries. I was surprised how neutral the first two thirds of this movie are.The majority of the film is a biography of Obama's life, I real eye opener. I actually gained respect for him, as his upbringing is atypical for a modern President. He is portrayed as an abandoned son looking to know his father. A man who really was undeserving of the hero worship his son bestowed upon him. In fact what I took is the need to meet his father's false legacy groomed a Young Barack Obama into the liberal activist who would eventually become the first African American President of the United States. It really is the true American Dream, I think a lot of his detractors don't really appreciate the journey this man has taken, this film articulates his journey very well.The last third of the movie can be seen as the conclusions section. And while the conclusions are logical and well laid out. I don't know for sure that the President is an &#34;anti-colonialist&#34;, even though he does have some leanings toward that ideology.I think anyone, liberal or conservative, with a critical eye should check out this movie.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A25I8NADWLAZLY	"Willie S. Matney ""Dixie Gunsmithing"""	"I watched this video, but first you need to understand that the guy who made it isn't even from here, he's a ex transfer university student from India, who admits he hates the UK, and admits he was a conservative activist while here, and became one at the university. Next, the producer goes around trying to ""find out"" who Obama is, and starts with talking to a psychiatrist, who I think was definitely a far right-wing republican. This MD ought to lose his license, if he is even an MD to start with. He diagnosed a patient without ever examining them, or ever speaking to them. Plus, he seems to think that Obama has issues, over child abandonment, and surprisingly wants to be just like his father, imagine that? Hogwash, pure and simple!The producer goes to Africa next, only to get ran off by the authorities when he approaches a relative of the presidents, which he should have, and rightfully so. After this, he heads into the village, and finds a so-called friend of Obama's father, who then swears, with a slur, that he's just like his father, and the same guy looks like he's drunk to me, and was probably paid to say it. You could see his bloodshot eyes, and the way he can barely form a sentence.This claptrap goes on and on, alluding to Obama being a socialist-communist, due to his father, but they never come right out and say it, more than likely afraid of being sued. They do this by trying to continuously compare him to his father, who was supposedly a socialist in Kenya. However, there are a lot of socialist states in Europe, like Greece, or even the UK, which this same producer is calling communists by this label. Socialized government and communism are two different things.After I finished the DVD, which was mailed to me by a republican arm known as the ""Citizens Awareness Project"", I removed it from my PC, and threw it in the garbage, where it belongs. It was the most un-truthful video I've seen in a good while, pure propaganda.

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AX6BH7NOU6NF5	Wojo	The background music was so loud on the DVD that it was very difficult to hear the narrative.  While I appreciate the content in this DVD, I only wish it was easier to hear what was actually being said. This dvd gives the viewer a clear picture of just how this man plans to take over America and turn it into a socialist nation.  It gives very good clues so one can be aware of what's actually happening behind the scenes in politics.  This is a must watch video for anyone who cares about the direction that America is going. After seeing this video, the viewer will know and watch out for the things our politicians are doing to ruin this once great nation.  Take heed and make sure you pay close attention to the content of this video.	3.0	Music overpowered the narrative	2012-12-29	2	0	2

There are many fact based observations concerning his upbringing that help explain what is going on with his decision making process. I believe it gave me insight into the man and his apparent goals for his second term.

If this was read by everyone, I don't think he would have gotten re-elected. Its going to be a long four years. Maybe he could do something if he got out of vacation mode. He needs a vacation to rest from the previous and future vacations Not much time for anything else. Must be nice and the tax payer pays for it all.	5.0	Scarie movie	2013-02-17	5	3	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	A1ZBIACY15JRNY	W. Taylor	"This explains a lot about Obama.  It's very consistent with what he's said and done.  But I think there's about one third more.  You can find it in the bookThe World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for The Third World (Vol. 2) (v. 2).  That book describes the KGB's operations everywhere else in the world but America and the Soviet Union.  The KGB was involved not only in direct actions, revolutions, sending ""technical advisors"" and supplying arms, but were also very involved in sophisticated propaganda programs.  Third world nationals that viewed the old British and French empires as enemies were courted by the KGB and by Soviet academics approved and supported by the KGB to promote a pro-Soviet viewpoint customized to include anti-colonialism and especially to view America as the new imperialist power.  So people like Obama's father didn't just feel justified in resting the old empires, but they were taught to hate all of the west as well.  Obama's mother, like so many other teenagers in the 60's got sucked into the same propaganda.  As the movie explains, she repeated Obama's father's views (or what she thought they were) to him.So the person in the White House right now really is more Soviet than American in his viewpoint."	4.0	Illuminating	2012-10-26	13	8	5
1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AFKRPSC54NI8I	wyatt	Okay.  Here we have a situation where I waited a long time to review a book.  Most likely because this is a political hot topic.  But now things have changed.  They continue to change for the worse.  Two weeks ago, Dinesh D'Souza was being investigated by none other than Eric Gopher Holder.  Normally my review would be limited to the book which was perfect and informative.  The movie is also great.  Both should be required reading for all including K 1-12.  Every household should be provided with a free movie CD.  Like many people, I do my own research to better form my own opinions.  I am still trying to figure out if it is Barry Sotorro or Allen Owens.  Another book could be written just on the events that have occurred since the last election.  I don't believe in coincidences, so maybe someone should look into and write about the recent plane crash death of the official in Hawaii that is suspected of forging a birth certificate.  This author has limitless possibilities and clues that could result in a series of books.  All of which would be non fiction.  But be careful DD.  Accidents do happen.  Good luck on that bogus investigation and congratulations for being the first to expose the fraud Prez..	5.0	2016	2014-02-16	4	2	2

The theory predicts in graphical animation a map of North Africa showing nations coming under the influence of a specific political party. I think Dinesh's theory was vindicated by US efforts promoting what happened in Egypt(before the coup in 7/2013), Libya, and Obama's insane efforts to get the US involved in the middle of the Syrian civil war. Eventually, military officers now silenced/'retired' and the 'civilian'  survivors (silenced under Dept of State gag orders) of the  ghastly Benghazi atrocities will tell what happened....

That is, the author provided his background that was used to present the viewer an insight from his years of experience of working with various political individuals. It concludes leaving the viewer with a basis to choose what direction America might be headed in.  If you take this info combined with many other readings pertaining to Obama a reader would conclude we have the Manchurian Candidate in the White House.	5.0	AMERICAs DOWNFALL = OBAMA	2012-11-20	4	2	2

1400322715	2016: Obama's America	AZM47XT9V63NL	yepthatsme	I'll keep my review short and simple. I avoid giving reviews unless I am motivated to do so because I would just be repeating what has already been said. Anyway, after seeing the movie, I was very impressed with the amount of research and the amount of information that was compiled to make this movie. Before purchasing this movie, I read the one star reviews as well as the five star reviews. I must say that I have to agree with all of those that say those that gave it one star most likely did not see the movie. If they did see the movie, they probably either slept through it or they have selective Obama vision. I was actually expecting a Micheal Moore type of movie. This is NOT that type of movie. I think this movie was done very well and is a must see for every American. It explains so much about the confusing and conflicting actions of our president. Everyone needs to see this movie before the election. And for you Obama supporters, try to keep an open mind. If you do, I think you will finally see Obama for what he truly is, anti-American. Don't be a blind supporter. Do your homework. Please, prove me and the movie wrong with facts, not name calling.	5.0	Excellent Documentary	2012-10-26	12	8	4
