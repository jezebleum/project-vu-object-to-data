1424810248	Facing the Giants	A155X6KYOPQEZ5	"#1 Cardinal Fan ""Afe"""	Coach Taylor is having all kinds of problems in his life. He's about to be fired from being a football coach and he can't have any kids because of him. When things get really bad, he turns to God. Facing the Giants is a movie that expresses what God's love really is and how he can really work in people's lives. Never underestimate God. He can do anything and everything. Facing the Giants is the best Christian movie I've ever seen to this day. If you're looking for hope, turn to Facing the Giants. You won't be disappointed.	5.0	Best Christian movie ever seen!	2008-06-18	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3NLBG46H2HV08	Accutron	This really is an impressive film.  Good, exciting storyline.  And when you consider the shoestring budget it was made on, it is even more remarkable.  If it were not an overtly religious piece, I might give it 4 or 5 stars.The problem is the false teaching that the movie perpetuates.  That is, if you are a Christian, God will overcome all your earthly obstacles for you and make you an outstanding, victorious success right here on earth.  That teaching is nowhere to be found in the Bible.  Christians are to persevere and glorify God regardless of their circumstances, success or failure.  Rewards will be in eternity, not in the here and now.	1.0	Impressive Movie; Bad Theology	2009-06-22	33	9	24

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AQHAECZ4WIG61	adaptive	"Simply the most likeable movie I have ever had the pleasure to SEE and HEAR. I found this movie to be both amazing and inspiring. When a friend told me he was in tears or laughing through this movie, I kind of shook  off his opinion as someone perhaps being maybe a little too soft or vanilla. To my surprise, I often found myself reduced to tears, and many times laughing. I have heard the scene the ""death crawl"" has been employed by college coaches. This was also a heartfelt and practical movie in that many characters had real life STRUGGLES not easily overcome by some immediate hollywood phony wizadry or manipulation. The ""Cinderella Man"" is the best movie I have seen in my lifetime, the close to the truth based story of James Braddock fighting in the Depression and the gentleness and goodness of family though faced with very hard times. This might be the most likeable  movie you will see, and the spirited dialogue never lost by cliche' in my opinion or review. My Thanks."	5.0	The power of perseverance touched with compassion	2011-01-08	0	0	0
1424810248	Facing the Giants	AZLPRZN6XTK6K	"A. Doyle ""olivedoyle"""	"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! The struggle between complacency and having faith that God can and will show His power through our weakness is the theme of this movie. The ""death crawl"" scene was just one of the scenes that had me in tears; such a beautiful picture of how our heavenly Father gets us through difficulties in life that we don't think we can handle and brings out a strength in us that we never knew we had. As the main character, Grant, experienced time and time again, God's love is overwhelming!!Some reviewers thought the acting was poor and its low budget transparent, but compared to other lower budget Christian films such as ""Left Behind"", I thought the writing, acting and cinematography in ""Facing the Giants"" to be quite high quality. I plan on buying it so I can watch it again and again. Highly recommended!!"	5.0	His Power Through Our Weakness	2007-02-12	12	10	2

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A343RDBINT3WN8	A. Flynn	One of the most pedantic, predictable and pandering movies it has ever been my misfortune to watch. The performances are terrrible, the dialogue trite and simplistic, the story is horribly contrived, not to mention providing a foolish moral: pray to a Christian God and all your troubles will miraculously solve themselves. What disturbed me most was the unsubtle themes of racial and religous intolerance. The people who made this film should be deeply ashamed. Heck, as a Christian myself I feel ashamed by association simply for having watched this piece of drivel. Save yourself some money, ignore the artificially inflated rating and avoid subjecting yourself to this pile of excrement-covered celluloid.	1.0	Avoid at all costs	2009-09-20	31	7	24

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1LIS4BFMI6C4A	A. Jasper Rains	After reading several reviews here, I felt I needed to add one of my own. I love this movie. I love it because of what God did in my life as a result of it. I think to view this film as simply a God gives you what you want piece is short sighted. Yes, in the end the conflicts all tie up positively and nicely but most movies do so I don't know why so many people had a problem with that. I also think this movie is not saying name it and claim it. I think it is a challenge for us to remember that God makes things happen when we believe. God taught me the power to praise him when I win and when I lose. I am a Pastor and this movie encouraged me to remain in that truth and I have seen God use it in my life many times since first seeing this film. I gave it four instead of five stars because I have to admit as Sherwood's second outing, the acting and script and not yet polished. On the budget they had they did an incredible job. I sense the Holy Spirit's presence when I watch this and that is what is most important to me.	4.0	A Movie That Can Change You If You Are Willing	2011-09-26	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2Z4VVF1NTJWPB	A. Lee	I rented this movie and watched it with some close friends yesterday and just had to watch it a second time today. While the movie is about a football team, it really isn't as much a movie about football as it is about life, our goals, our hopes and dreams. It helps one to reflect upon what is and what is not truly important in life.  Whether you rent this or buy this, it is worth watching and be sure to watch the special features.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A186L40TP0FDVA	Allison Collins	I don't often write reviews but I was so turned off by this movie that I felt compelled to warn others not to waste their time or money on this one. The acting is the worst I've ever seen, the dialogue is extremely stilted, and the biblical messages--while worthwile--are presented in such a blatant way that you feel you've been beaten over the head instead of allowing you to think and reflect about a deeper message. As other reviewers have said, the movie presents God as some type of genie--the minute the characters follow His Word, everything changes for the better. Life isn't this neat and tidy and it would have been more believable if the characters experienced even minor challenges throughout. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that there is no violence or swearing so it would be suitable for kids.	1.0	Bad Acting, Predictable Plot, Cheesy Message	2010-06-20	31	10	21

I find this movie to be inspiring for my every day life.  I continually watch the scenes where Brock does the Death Crawl to show that we all have the capability to go beyond what we think we can do. I'm also impressed with the scene where the older gentleman comes in to tell the coach he still has a door open where he is. I love the story about the two farmers who prayed for rain but only one prepared his fields to receive it.  Later in the movie, when the coach decides to kick an impossible field goal for the win in the championship game, he statement is ""I'm preparing for rain"".

For the past two years I have walked by this DVD on the shelf at our local parish library despite the fact that everyone told me it was great.  Finally I brought it home even though I don't like football, and I thought that the game would be too big a part of the movie.  But it's really not about football game, it's about trusting  God.The movie is about a high school coach in danger of losing his job because of too many losing seasons along with a host of other problems.  He turns to God and puts himself in God's hands and it is amazing to see what happens with him and with the team members who also change their lives.  Their new philosophy is to praise God when you win and praise God when you lose.This is a low budget film produced by Sherwood Baptist Church of Albany Georgia and it is a winner!

We can truly let our children watch ""Facing the Giants"" and not be concerned. At the same time it offers several opportunities to open up conversations with your children.  There is: *no sex *no swearing *no immorality *no innuendo *no unnecessary violence *no immodesty.  There are people you can believe with real, everyday problems.  They show life the way it is - you have to work through your problems and face them head on.There is one situation where one of the players is overtly disrespectful to his father.  The scene is necessary to the movie and is handled very well.  It is not just thrown in there because it's ""how kids are"".  The resolution comes later in the movie and is to be commended.For a cast and crew of volunteers this movie can't be beat!  Buy one for yourself and several to give away and look forward to a wonderful evening with your preteen and teenaged children.Not sure why it's rated PG.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1UDL8R0OQDZ5P	Anthony J. Simeone	"I just bought this dvd, and watched it 5 times in 2 days!  I can't put it away.  Honestly, I thought this was a weak movie during the first 15 minutes, the first time I viewed it.  It did start slow, and I felt that the acting was a little weak!  But the movie picked up pace as it went along, and had me on the edge of my seat by the end, each time I watched it.  Toward the end, I was even impressed with the acting.  For second rate and unknown actors, these guys are great!!  The one scene, the ""Death Crawl"" scene during training, was an awe-inspiring, tear jerking, academy award performance scene that had me in tears!!  That scene alone is a must see, and out-does, out-performes any scene in any other football movie I've seen to date, including Invincible, Friday Night Lights, and Remember the Titans (yes, even the Titans does not stand up to the Death Crawl!).  The Football game scenes are perfect: very action pact, short enough, and to the point.  They dont overwhelm you, and the scenes are great football!  The movie centers around the coach, but you do start to feel for the team as a whole, and some of the key players do have their shining moments that support the movie.  You cant help cheering for them, and you cant help loving the team!  Yes, it is a Christian-Faith, Believe-in-God, Believe in the Bible movie.  For those that believe, this supports your faith 100%.  You couldnt ask for a better movie.  It's what the bible is all about.  For those that dont believe, still get a taste of what the Christian faith is all about, and still get to see how a coach and team pull themselves up from dust, and soar like eagles in the end!  For those that dont believe, then this is just another way a team turned a losing season into a winning season.  Who's to judge one method over another.  In this movie, they chose to believe that God could make it possible, and for them, it worked!  I rate this 5 stars.  Any movie that can make me cry after the fifth viewing in 2 days, deserves nothing less.  It is a clean movie, with no foul language, supporting good morals and good principles.  And it is Inspiring!  We need more stuff like this out on the market. I plan on buying more copies of this movie, and giving them as gifts to my friends.  I hope you feel led to buy it, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"	5.0	Awesome! Inspiring!	2007-02-03	7	6	1
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A595T15OO91DC	"A. Ort ""aorto"""	There are two levels on which to view this movie and understanding the motive is key to watching it.1) As a typical Hollywood film.  On this level the viewer will be disappointed.  While the production quality is high, the acting is down home and transparent although there are some scenes where you really feel the actors and these scenes would not be out of place in any film anywhere.However, about halfway through the film it becomes predictable and the dialogue often running into high cheese factor.  The flow, the set-up and the ending are predictable.  Had I not understood what the film was about I would have turned it off about halfway through. Hollywood this isn't.  I'd give it about two and a half stars if that were it.2) As a Church film with a Message.  This film was done entirely by a Church and ended up being distributed by a major movie distributor.  Understanding this, the film is an impressive work.I give it a solid four stars on this level (one star short of five as I am a movie buff).  It is a preaching film, a film about a life devoted to Christ and what can be accomplished when God is central in one's life.  Episodes and scenes in the film become directly relevant to the lives of those seeking to follow Christ and in this the film is successful.  It is a modern day parable.Either way, it is a feel good movie and will make you, even if just for a moment, really believe in what is possible in this life.I highly recommend watching the extras as to the making of the film.  This is really an amazing accomplishment.  God certainly works in mysterious ways.	4.0	It's a great Message movie...	2007-04-16	8	7	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	ACXHNOC6L8LUO	Artist & Author	"I don't know how to approach reviewing this movie.  In general, I am very much in favor of movies that depict Christians positively.  However, I am reminded of a country preacher who came to his church one Sunday after a terrible blizzard, and only one old rancher showed up for the service.  The preacher asked if he should go on with the service.  The rancher drawled, 'When I go out to feed my cattle, and only one shows up, I feed it.'  So, after going through a compete Sunday service, the pastor asked how it was.  The rancher replied, ""When only one steer shows up, I don't give him the whole load of alfalfa!'  Unfortunately, almost all so-called Christian movies try to give viewers the 'whole load.'  I felt that they were trying to cram in everything from a revival to a miracle pregnancy as positive examples of what happenes when people get right with God.My second concern with this movie is the notion that when one becomes right with God, everything goes for the better.  If that were true, St. Peter and St. Paul must surely have done something wrong.  They both spent months and years in prisons, and were eventually killed for their faith.  Instead, in this movie it seemed that everyone who was committed to God had the wonderful things they desired happen to them because of their belief.  Could it be that Peter and Paul's belief was not merely strong enough to get God to dispense good things to them, but that it was so strong they could 'read' the mind of God and by that know for which person to pray that they be healed, or even to face their own death with full faith in God?I commend the producers for trying to make a Christian movie for the general population.  But, it leaves many theological questions that families might wish to discuss with their children.  These questions will probably never be answered in human terms, but they should be deeply thought about by all people of faith."	3.0	Another Typical 'Christian' Movie	2007-05-28	11	8	3

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2JSGJE2IGJU20	a voice of reason	"First and foremost, I want to applaud Alex Kendrick and Sherwood Baptist Church for not only making such a wholesome movie but also for depicting what a difference faith in Jesus Christ makes in a believer's life. When Coach Taylor shows his wife what he has written down about his new approach to coaching his football team, she says that all of the items on his list are applicable to the rest of life as well; thus, football becomes a metaphor for life in this movie. And the relevance of God and His word to our lives is, I believe, one of the two central messages of this movie. The second primary message is that we are to praise Him when we `win' (that is, when things go our way) and praise Him when we don't `win' (when things are not going our way).God turns lives around through the way He can work in them once people have come not only to faith but also to trust in Jesus, and the movie gives many excellent examples of this: the coach who refuses to give up in the face of personal and professional adversity, his wife who endures repeated disappointments, his team that gets on board with his new philosophy, the teenager who decides to respect his father, etc. The changes in attitude that we see in so many of the characters in this movie cannot help but result in more positive outcomes in life and make us realize, as is stated throughout the film, that nothing is impossible with God; to quote the late Rich Mullins, ""What trouble are giants?/What's wrong with being small?/The bigger they come/You know the harder they fall./When you're fighting for Zion/And you're on the Lord's side,/I think you're gonna find/It ain't no trouble at all.""If there is a flaw in this movie - and I am reluctant to nitpick at such a wonderful film - it is that every believer in the movie `wins'. (Before anyone accuses me of having too little faith, let me say that I am walking evidence of what God can accomplish in a believer's life, but I am not perfect and not everything in life goes my way [and this is true of every believer I know]). There is danger in the idea that everyone will have `health and wealth' if only they trust in Jesus. Coach Taylor receiving a new truck (from an anonymous parent) and a pay-raise in the middle of the school year are nice touches, but they are examples of such thinking. That being said, I am by no means accusing filmmaker Alex Kendrick of presenting a `health and wealth gospel' message; he has clearly made an uplifting film about people who live out their faith (and I feel certain about Kendrick's intentions because I also have the DVD of his previous film, ""Flywheel"", which contains a fantastic evangelistic message - if you liked this movie, you should check out ""Flywheel"" as well).Some reviewers have had negative comments about the acting in the film, but I thought the characters were simply real and believable - they are just like people I know (and like me), and that makes this story far more effective than it would be with slick performances from Hollywood stars. As far as the football plot is concerned, the story is - of course -  about an underdog team that overcomes all odds on its way to the championship. The ending is predictable, but we viewers would not want it any other way. The nice difference between this movie and others in the sports genre, however, is that it is faith-based and can be watched without fear of profanity or vulgarity. So watch this movie and see how a character named David defeats the Giants."	4.0	Facing and defeating the giants in life	2007-04-29	6	5	1

My only other issue might be that God doesn't always give you what you want, and in this movie's case, everyone seemed to ultimately get what they wanted. Perhaps a little too unrealistic. That said, however, this is still one of the best movies I've ever seen. The positives far outweigh any negatives, so watch this movie!

So moved and inspired. After the film, I knelt down to pray under a heavy tears gushing out my eyes. While praying, I got the shining light into two vital areas of my life. 1. The challenge I am presently facing maritally became an opportunity for me to receive the faithfulness of God and after facing the giants in it, overcoming, becoming more matured, built up and rooted to handle future giants and help others with what and where I have been helped too.2.

There may be periods, sometimes long ones, when our lives seem to flow with little difficulty. But it is in the nature of our being human that comfort gives way to distress, periods of good health come to an end, and misfortunes arrive. Particularly when the comfortable times have gone on for a while, the arrival of suffering or the loss of material security can bring fear and sometimes anger.The anger comes at least in part from a feeling that what is happening is unfair. The good health and the serene sense of being secure can become to seem deserved and natural. When they vanish, a feeling of injustice can come. Even a brave man I knew wept and cried out in his physical suffering to those who ministered to him: ""I have always tried to be good. How could this happen?""My purpose today is to assure you that our Heavenly Father and the Savior live and that they love all humanity. The very opportunity for us to face adversity and affliction is part of the evidence of their infinite love. God gave us the gift of living in mortality so that we could be prepared to receive the greatest of all the gifts of God, which is eternal life. Then, our spirits will be changed. We will become able to want what God wants, to think as He thinks, and thus be prepared for the trust of an endless posterity to teach and to lead through tests to be raised up to qualify to live forever in eternal life.It is clear that for us to have that gift and to be given that trust we must be transformed through making righteous choices where that is hard to do. We are prepared for so great a trust by passing through trying and testing experiences in mortality. That education can come only as we are subject to trials while serving God and others for Him.""...[W]hen adversity arrives in our lives, the only true source of comfort is God. `Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid...'""President Howard W. Hunter said, `If our lives and our faith are centered on Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing can go permanently wrong. On the other hand, if our lives are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can ever be permanently right.'""The Savior said: `Therefore whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock--`And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.`And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand--`And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.'""It is interesting to notice that the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew against both houses! Because, living the Gospel does not mean that we will everlastingly escape adversity.  Rather it means that we will be prepared to face and endure adversity more confidently."""	5.0	Adversity Opens the Windows of Heaven	2009-09-03	0	0	0

He spends all night up reading the Bible and decides to turn things over to Him.  Win or lose, God gets the glory.He challenges the players to do more - with God all things are possible.  You always have a little more in you.  When you think you've reached the end, push just a little longer and you just might find success.  And they do.Perhaps a little to predictable in spots - it doesn't really matter.  Great story.  The lessons are timeless.  A multiple kleenex movie.

It's about a school football coach, his team called Shiloh Eagles who in the end win enough games to play at state (by divine influence)... It's about finding out who his real friends are. And about his family and home life. Things just don't start out like you think they should.There are so many instances of gaining things back that the coach loses, that you can't imagine a God doing anything less! Someone buys him a brand new ____:) (no spoiler) just because he led his son to God and changed the son's attitude on life. He held on by a weak string of faith, which grew stronger as the coach gets back into the bible and prayer. He encourages the whole team and it gets contagious and there's a mini-revival at the school.His wife and him go through a trying time of wanting a baby...

I found it easy to relate to the loosing football team and coach. I also was holding my breath as the coach and his struggle with not being able to have a child.The different characters stories add to the film and drew me into their world.After graduating from high school I was watching this and I cried. After being prayed for for years...the students lives are finally changing! At that moment I realized what is imprtant in high school is not just: popularity,clothes,grades(although important) winning football games, and the like; but it's the peace each individual has in their heart that really matters.There are lots of emotional and thought inducing moments.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1OV95VIA4BWLN	"Bronx Chick ""Yoly"""	"I read the one-star reviews for this movie before writing my own review.  I found myself agreeing with many of the comments written by those reviewers.  As a Christian, I was also a little disturbed by the simplistic message: if you give your life over to God, everything will work out for you in the end.  However, this is a film, and movies usually end with ""and they lived happily ever after.""Perhaps as someone who suffers with infertility, I was maybe a little oversensitive to the ending.  I was left with a very uneasy feeling at the end, which I couldn't immediately name.After some distance, I came to the same feelings as the one-star reviewers: bad things happen to good people.  Having faith and turning your life over to God does not mean that everything will go your way: it means that God is walking with you through the bad and good alike. It's dangerous to portray the faith in such a simplistic way.  If even one of the tied-up loose ends stayed untied, it would have made for a better film of what it means to be a believer.We live in a world filled with povery, violence and war.  While so many are living in such suffering, they cling to their faith.  The miracles that happen in their lives often come in the form of help from others.In this way, the movie does attempt to show that kindness and goodness affects others.  If we show love to others, others may do the same.  The coach receives a new vehicle because of the gratitude of the father of one of his players.  The father in a wheelchair doesn't get up and walk off - he gathers up all his courage and strength to stand (leaning on a fence) to show his son that he can have courage, too.  The conversion of one young man helps others to give God a chance in their lives when he shares his own struggle.  A life of faith is filled with other human persons following the example of Jesus, living lives modeled on His, and making a difference.I give the movie three stars because, while it is uneven, it isn't as bad as less-stars would denote."	3.0	A Good but Flawed Movie	2007-10-26	33	26	7

It's a stirring and emotional film.I had read a few reviews that said if you want to see a football movie, go see ""Invincible"" or ""Gridiron Gang"".  That review missed the point.  It confused ""Facing the Giants"" as a movie about football - it's really a movie about faith set to the backdrop (an effective backdrop) of a high school football team.The acting isn't great but this movie wasn't made by a big time film studio - it was made by a church that has a message to deliver: with God, all things are possible.  If that message isn't appealing to you, you may not like the movie.

I really don't like football at all, but loved ""Remember the Titans"" and since this movie had such great reviews I decided to check it out.  Glad I did... I'm facing my own personal giants right now & felt quite uplifted by the faith this movie inspired.  My dad is also getting ready to face his giant (cancer) to see if it's still in remission, so this movie was also uplifting to him.  This movie is about living faith not preaching or cramming it down anyone's throat.  God really does like to do the impossible & it's good to remember that.  Gee, and no nudity - how nice for a change.As far as being such a low budget production....we watched it on our 61"" HDTV & it looked great.

I ordered them from my rental service (haven't seen Flywheel yet).  Facing the Giants was very good.  Not as good as Fireproof but excellent in message none the less.  It was moving, inspiring, emotional.  I was smiling, laughing and crying through it.  So what if the acting wasn't perfect, I wanted a good message and a movie that made me feel good and not want to turn away because of gore, violence, sex or greed.  All the things that are lauded by Hollywood like they're good things.  Family oriented, meaningful, inspirational. I'm glad there are still groups out there still plugging along.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3P3U42S4A2YHQ	C.E.	This is a movie that is geared toward people of the Christion beliefs.  You should know that going into the movie so that you arent caught off guard.  The messages of faith, God, good works, and righteousness abound in this film.  If that turns you off- move on and find something more mainstream...With that out of the way, this movie was one of the most thought provoking- faith affirming films that I have seen in quite some time.  I enjoyed the message that with God all things are possible.  The theme of the movie is a great one and one that can be applied to all things, as mentioned in the movie: its not all about football.The actors did a wonderful job with the film and the performances contained therin.  There arent any big budget stars to detract from the film, no egos pushing around onscreen and no crazy marketing blitz...but this movie should still be in the hands of every family in this nation.With stellar acting, a great message and some really great scenes (for a lower budget movie) this film is a great find.  I am glad that I stumbled across it on a message board...im certainly glad that I watched it with my kids and my wife.  We enjoy it for its message and talk about it after the credits roll- that and how many movies today can the whole family watch and feel good about when they are over?

Anyone who claims to be a Bible-believer or a Christian must see it. It was a totally clean movie - something sorely lacking among today's movies (no foul language, no fornication, no alcohol, no drugs, and no criminal violence). It just goes to show that you don't need big name actors or a huge budget to make a great movie. If a small church in south Georgia can pull this off, then hopefully it will inspire other non-Hollywood, family friendly entities to do the same. Don't let the PG rating fool you - just some secular progressive liberals upset about ""too much God"" in their opinion.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A26KFC1T9BYQRX	charity sparks	Ok I could not think of a good title for my review so bare with me. I very much enjoyed this movie and I thought it was touching and beautiful. While at the same time it seemed a bit unrealistic. I agree with those who say it seems like it depicts God as a Santa Claus. God does do great things in people's lives don't get me wrong. I myself have seen him work in great ways in my own life. However, I have also had moments where I felt at the end of my rope and felt like life was crumby since following God. I feel like this film shows that once you give your life to God everything is perfect instantly.I think it would have been more impressive to see the coach and everyone starting to change their attitudes and stick it through with their faith before things got poured on them so it would show that God was really working in them and they weren't just changing because of what God does and not who he is. I mean the coach was all down and out and then when he starts getting all these blessings his faith soars. I understand that he turned to God before he started receiving the blessings. However, like I said it would have been better to see like his wife changing her attitude about not having a baby and him changing his attitude and trusting God to do HIS plan instead of seeing them blossom when things went according to THEIR plans. I think that would have shown the audience christian and non-christians that God is worthy of praise even in hard times and that when you have him in your life, you can not only smile when he's pouring out the blessings, but you can smile and rejoice even in a storm.God is not just our genie he is also the source of our comfort and he sustains us in hard times. Many people can change and praise God when he starts giving us our way. But, what about having joy and trusting him and praising him through trials? In real life, he doesn't always work when and how we want him. In fact, sometimes he shows us he has something better or something different for us in his plans and changes our hearts to see our situations how he does. In this film everyone got what they wanted, when they wanted, and how they wanted. God even says in his word that following him is not easyI just feel like this movie sent a message that if you give your life to God and life doesn't automatically do a 180 you might as well give up. The fact of the matter is God gives and he takes. There's good days and bad days.Also I feel that the gospel message seemed very spoon-fed. I mean I don't think they should have left it out, but they could have done something that leaves the audience (particularly non-saved people) asking questions and thinking leading them to want to seek God more. I agree it could have been more subtle or presented differently	3.0	Awesome and also could use improvement	2012-06-22	1	1	0
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A37P63QYF8375U	Charles D. Harrell	"This movie teaches how God will help you if you will have faith in him. Almost all movies today are centered on sex. This one is decent except for a few scenes where girls are wearing mini dresses. Either this movie or ""Flywheel"" had one curse word in it, I'm not sure which one. For a Christian type movie they could have used the real bible instead of a fake one. Considering how churches are today I would still have to say they did a good job with this movie."	5.0	Clean movie teaching Family values	2007-12-23	0	0	0
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3NOCKM0B6EYEC	"Charles Lyons, Ph.D. ""Charles"""	"The movie is exceptional. It is touching, gripping, tender and powerful. Are there scenes that could be predicted? Yes, some. However, is it more than refreshing to find a movie that has purpose more the puff, passion more than gratuitous violence, filth and profanity, meaning and substance rather than a feeling that you just wasted the better part of 90 minutes? Oh Yes, this is a movie to view, have and share!If you take the time to explore the additional materials on the DVD you will find that some of those actors are people who bring more to the movie than acting. The doctor is a real doctor, the wife of the coach is the wife of a coach, team members who are supposed to be friends are team members who are friends. Even the sports announcer is a sports announcer. The additional material is worth exploring.I'm not a big sports fan, let alone a sports movie fan. This movie is so much more than just a football movie. There is great change that takes place. There is great action and development and yes humor. Tough times do happen and yes sometimes God does answer yes to our prayers, not just wait and no. More important, faith does have a reward.This movie is not a theological document and it is not a ""religious"" film. This is a movie that is worth the time if you are a professing believer or just would like to see something fresh. Equally, it is a movie that can be enjoyed if you are open to enjoying a good movie. I don't have to be an atheist to watch a non-Christian movie and get something out of it. You don't have to be a fundamentalist or evangelical to appreciate the strength of a story about success, victory and characters who actually have a strong marriage.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3P876I6K3KL8V	C. Long	"People that review this movie negatively (which do also include some Christians), usually are based on the belief that this movie is all about showcasing that once you become a Christian and trust Christ, everything in your life becomes perfect.I do understand those thoughts and I had similar thoughts/concerns when watching, but I decided the issue came down to the question of what message the filmmakers were trying to convey. If they were trying to convey a message that everything goes smoothly in life here when you follow Christ, then I would agree that there's a problem.But in giving it consideration, I have mostly concluded that really wasn't the message they were trying to convey: the message was that when you follow Christ, nothing is impossible - that there is nothing impossible with God - and that with faith in God (and living an ""excellent"" life - i.e. the ""works"" part of the ""faith without works is dead"" thing) and when you desire for God to get the glory, that God is able to do beyond what we could even imagine.That message was the clear message of the movie. But in order to show that message in a movie-format, they pretty much had to show a bunch of hard/impossible-looking situations that became better when Christ was put at the center. A side-effect of doing that is it could give the impression that everything always goes A-OK in this life for believers that are really following Christ and want Him to get all the glory, which many of us know is not reality. But the movie never really says that - in fact, by the simple fact that the team in the movie continually makes a decision to praise God *whether* they win or lose, shows that they realize they might not win the games even with ""doing everything the best they could for God"" etc.To to sum up: I would say that if you watch this movie and think the message is that all goes okay in this life for Christians who have enough faith, then I would tell you that message is not an accurate one.  But I would also say that that message as far as I can tell really wasn't the intended message of the movie, but rather a byproduct (perhaps somewhat unfortunate) of the intended message which I believe to be a solid, worthwhile one of having Christ at the center of your life in all you do, and that He can do *anything*. If you take this movie at face-value for those messages and avoid reading in any other supposedly ""implied"" messages (i.e. avoid applying messages that the movie really wasn't actively promoting), I believe you will find it to be an excellent film. Given the fact that the movie does perhaps raise some of these questions though - and can actually unintentionally hit nerves with some people on subjects like infertility - this is an EXCELLENT conversation piece among family/friends/church groups after watching this movie!As far as the quality of the film itself: This movie was made on a shoestring budget with a lot of volunteer actors, and while you can definitely tell that, it does NOT really take away from the movie too much.  You will certainly not confuse the production quality of this movie with some Hollywood-produced film, but it is sufficient.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3C68EUZA04JAT	"Colleen ""If it's not fun, what's the point?"""	"The other reviews about this DVD do a good job of explaining the movie's plot and theme.  One of my favorite places in the movie was when the man came to the coach with a message given to him by God.  It was a good word in season.  The coach asked if the man really believed he got it from God and the man was sure.  It was that special message that turned everything around for the coach and inspired him to seek God's wisdom in how to do things altogether differently.  Oh, how many times in my life I have wished for someone to have a word from God for me, so I would know which way to go - what choice to make, or have the courage to keep going when all the world seems against me.Another thing I loved about the movie was the new truck in the parking lot that was given to him anonymously.  Wow... the generosity of people is amazing.  Sure the movie is fictional, but these things happen in real life and it inspires me that ""all things are possible..."".  This movie made me mad, it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me cheer.My husband and I watched this DVD just a week before the Superbowl this past February 2007.  My husband told me all the stuff coach Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts had been through with his son and all, plus being an extremely nice Christian man and battling to get to the Superbowl.  It was remarkable how much the Superbowl post game coach's speech and personal life paralleled the premise of the movie.  It was like the movie playing out in real life.  It was very touching since this movie was so fresh in my mind.  Bravo to the Baptist church who forked out the bucks to make this movie.  &lt;clapping>  Awesome message, and a better quality film than many Christian movies.I am glad I own it so that I can rewatch it when I am ""facing a giant"" in my life and need someone to yell from the sidelines, ""Build a Wall!""

Among the thousands of mainline films I have watched over many years, this is the first I've seen with a modern-day story that was unapologetically Christian. It actually used Jesus and God's name as you would hear in a sermon in church. Of course, the fact that ""Hollywood"" didn't make this film is understandable; it was produced, directed, written, etc., by a Baptist church in Georgia.But - surprise -  it has the production values of a big-budget Hollywood film. In other words, this looks nice and, for the most part, is adequately acted even though amateurs do the acting. The only one I thought sounded wooden, unfortunately, was Alex Kendrick playing the main character: coach Grant Taylor, the Shiloh Christian High School football coach. Kendrik directed and wrote this film, so kudos to him for all that wonderful work....but an actor, he ain't.Yes, the story is hokey, especially at the end at the last football game, but what Hollywood movie isn't?  To see a movie with this many inspirational and profound Biblical statements was a ""revelation"" and really nice to see (hear). Hokey or not, there are several moments in this film that should drive most viewers to tears. The main message of the movie: ""All things are possible with God,"" is a good one and one everyone, including Christians, need to be reminded of periodically.Secular people who don't want to hear anything positive about God or the Bible, or who are just plain biased against Christians, will hate this film and wouldn't last 30 minutes watching it.  However, if you are more tolerant, or are a follower Of Jesus Christ, then you will find this film inspiring and emotional and worth your time."	4.0	A Sunday Sermon Comes To Life	2007-09-09	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1FDVT0DLJWV78	D. A. J.	This film started a little slow, but picked up quickly. I love this movie on a number of levels. I viewed this film more as entertainment than a sermon or gospel message. I read some reviews that said that God doesn't bless people in this way. How can one person determine how God is going to bless other individuals? Just because God doesn't choose to work in your life in this way doesn't mean He won't bless someone else. God is clear that He will bless whom He chooses. But, enough about doctrine. I like this movie because our entire family can watch it together. There is no foul language or sex scenes that cause us to need to escort my very young children out the room. If you are looking for a film that will preach, this is probably not for you. If you have a specific theology and you can not bear to hear anyone believe something different from you - again this is not the movie for you. If you enjoy watching movies with your family and would like a fun movie with good humor and an inspiring message - this is the movie for you. My husband even got past seeing the Bulldogs coach (we are a GT family) and still wanted to buy this movie (we had rented it through Netflix).Why 4 and not 5 stars? Because it does move a little slow in the beginning and there are a couple predictable parts. It is still better than 90% of the films produced in the past 10 years. So, I highly recommend this neat movie. Don't view it expecting the unexpected, but do view it for a couple hours and good, clean, refreshing entertainment that your children can enjoy right along with you.	4.0	Great family movie	2009-12-27	0	0	0

This is a movie about overcoming great obstacles, something every family faces.#2.  This is a movie that does not rely on sex, violence, or profanity to carry a weak or boring plot.#3.  This is a movie that examines the relationships between family members, and offers sound Biblical advice on how to make those relationships more successful.#4.  This is a movie void of famous actors with large egos to build upon, which means cast was able to focus on the overall production and not worry about the performance of one actor or actress.#5.  This is a film that stirs all kinds of emotions and can definitely clean out clogged up tearducts.#6.  This is a movie with some great football action scenes that rival any larger, Hollywood, big-budget film.#7.  This is a movie written and produced by Christians dedicated to their work of reaching out to a lost world with the message of hope and love.#8.  This is a movie that celebrates the power of the human spirit to rise above what we think is possible.#9.  This is a movie that just seems to have the Lord's blessing on it throughout the post-production, production, and distribution.#10.

And most of the plot on this movie I figured out from the start...sort of.  There were some surprises, but I found myself drawn in by the combination of tensions that climax in a 'typical' football movie.  The Christian theme is simple, powerful and refreshing.  I've watched this movie twice this week, bought a copy for my family to watch with me, and will probably show it to our church sometime this year.The reasons I like this movie are:There are no famous hollywood actors!  Yet it is still fun to watch.Hundreds of people volunteered to help make this movie.It has no profanity.  No sex scenes.The production is really pretty good.There are a number of one liners that are actually worth writng down.The don't give up theme could help people who are facing discouragement of almost any kind.  This is a good movie to show cancer patients or people trying to have children, or people who are struggling with a rough financial or marriage situation, or just about any kind of situation that seems hopeless.  It teaches you to cry out to God and to praise Him no matter what happens in life, win or lose.  It's a great coaches training tool for any sports coach.My favorite theme in this movie is: Give God your best and praise Him whether you win or lose.The little credit scenes after the movie are some of the best ones because you feel like these guys who made this movie are just a bunch of regular Americans who love God.Go for it on this movie.  You will love it.  I actually cried towards the end, as cheesy as it sounds, but I was deeply touched.  I rarely cry in movies (once every fifteen years or so).I think God inspired this movie.

I can only believe that it is just a slew of partisan 'Christian' reviewers trying to make it score highly.  Yes the points made by some about no egocentric actors and the lack of anything offensive are true.  But what is offensive is that this would be considered a good film.  It is badly acted, poorly directed and so cheesy it is embarrassing.  If you like the story of overcoming through faith and are happy to sit through embarrassing mediocrity then this is for you.  If you want to watch something truly inspiring then try Shawshank Redemption - talk about overcoming and maintaining your dignity - and an incredibly well made and acted film.  Sorry, but someone had to expose the emperor's lack of clothes.	1.0	This Is Unbelievable	2012-05-01	22	3	19

I think the stories are written from the heart and carry a powerful message, this movie not being the least of them.  In fact this is my favorite movie by the Kendrick brothers.

I wish that hollywood would have more sense as to make more movies like this instead of the profanity-laden, violence-driven, sensuality-soaked garbage which seems to be standard fare in our theaters and homes today. All this movie's message does is lift you up, not put you down.All of us can simpathize with Coach Taylor. All of us have at one time or another questioned God's love and even sometimes God's very existence. And yet instead of turning to the bottle or drugs or an illict affair, he pours out his heart to God and waits for an answer. And God swiftly brings the matter to a resolution so miraculous no one could doubt the supernatural authenticity of it all.I've seen the miraculous in my life as well, and I firmly agree with Grant Taylor: ""With God, nothing is impossible""."	5.0	A Hidden Gem of a Movie	2007-03-01	6	5	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A347XDTKVA6GDG	David McElroy	"The producers of this movie meant well. That's the sum total of the nice things that can be said about it. Other than that, it's an absolute disaster. It's horribly written, horribly acted and directed by someone who might be appropriate to direct commercials for small-market late-night cable. Theologically, it presents a false gospel that pretends that if people just start acting religious, they'll get all the desires of their hearts.Real faith has costs. The kind of religion shown here has no cost. You just start acting the part and everything around you becomes rainbows and butterflies. A football team that can't win a game suddenly can become a state championship team. (Heck, God even changes the direction of the wind so a boy can make a winning field goal.) This is the kind of schlock that gets people emotional and ready to sign up for baptism, but that produces empty people who don't have real relationships with God.God doesn't really care whether your team wins a football game. To think so, you have to assume that there are no Christians on the other team. They're just a bunch of cartoon cutouts like their coach. We're apparently supposed to loathe them, not love them.In sum, it's quite simply blasphemous to call this a presentation of the Gospel. This is NOT the Gospel as presented in the Bible. This doesn't reflect God changing people's hearts and having them pay a price for following Him. It's a ""me-centered"" gospel which is a perfect reflection of our selfish age and our selfish modern church. Almost as bad, it's very, very horrible art."	1.0	This film is trash, artistically AND theologically	2008-05-17	79	39	40
1424810248	Facing the Giants	AGF5OPF3Y7278	David Robert	"It is rare that I venture into a movie theater, but my wife mistakenly told me this movie was based on a true story (remember the American Hockey Team in the 1980 Olympics),and we had a double date set up with another couple so I went. I have never heard clapping by the audience in a movie theater before, but when this movie ended the almost full theater was filled with clapping.  I personally thought this was a great movie, eventhough other reviews I read thought it was corny.  It would have been better if it were really based on a true story.  The story is plausible eventhough there are incredible odds to be overcome both at home and on the field. I was a little disappointed to find out it was not based on a true story.I'm not a big sports fan.  I can enjoy a football game if I'm watching it with someone who enjoys football, unless it is the LSU Tigers or the New Orleans Saints whom I don't mind watching by my lonesome.  I doubt the Saints will ever have a championship team, unless the majority of the players and the coach become real saints each with their own personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.  Do You Believe in Miracles? I do!  And, remember ""The Story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team.""Would I watch Facing the Giants again?  Well, I plan on adding it to my personal library when it becomes available.  So, I'll probably watch it a few more times.  If it were based on a true story, I would have given it 5 stars.Edited 5-29-08 Based on the 3 comments I've received I'm glad to change my rating to 5 stars for this item!

But I doubt that you will see a movie this year with such heart. Some people might pass on it because they don't like sports films. That would be a mistake, because this movie is about much more than sports. Others might pass because it was made by Christians (and let's be honest, many Christian movies are cheesy). This movie is not. While the faith of the characters are unapologetically on display, the film makers manage to avoid clich&eacute;s and stereotypes. These are real people, struggling with real issues. And their faith informs what they choose to do. Highly recommended for the whole family.	4.0	Faith and Football	2013-10-27	0	0	0

The story line is fast paced with conflicts between the coach and the football player's fathers, whose only motivation was to win games. When the emphasis became on honoring God in all they did, that's when everything turned around, not just in the coach's and player's lives, but it affect the entire school and the parents.

He can and will see to your needs and bless you in your life in ALL areas.  He has promised this in His word and He never fails.  This movie is a testament to that.  Nothing is impossible for God and that is a fact.  Even in my life, I have faced trials and tribulations and tried to overcome them by my own means and power and left God out of it and I have failed.  When I hit rock bottom and finally give over everything in my life to God.  He works and he rebuilds.  Why is it that we get this way?  Why does it seem we always have to hit the bottom before we cry out to God.  Well, Believing in God is not enough.  We need to be saved first by accepting God's gift of salvation through His Son Jesus and what he accomplished for us on the cross, and then we have a mediator between God and man that gives us the right to come to Him in prayer. ""For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"" (I Timothy 2:5).  Jesus forever lives to make intercession for us (Heb 7:25) ... to pray as we ought; but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us"" (Romans 8:26) Remember, John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."" Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;"" Once we are adopted into His family through the salvation God provided through His Son (Jesus) for us on the cross.  We have a loving father in heaven that wants good things for us and wants to provide for us. He wants to be a part of our lives. Too often after accepting Christ as our savior the cares of this world grab hold of us and we forget about our father in heaven and try and run things under our own strength and power.  It's our own stubborn self that brings us to try and run our lives and leave God out of it.

This is a story of a down on his luck coach,Grant Taylor, and his football team the Shiloh Eagles. It seems as if this team is convinced it is mediocre at best coupled with a coaching staff that flat out does not believe in it's leader, Coach Grant. There are far more important things going on in Grant's life. One is his and his wifes inability to have children. Put together with a lemon of a car, a community with an utter lack of faith, and a group of students fathers and staff that doesn't believe he has what it takes to win...or be a leader. He is looked at as a loser. One of the turning points of the movie is when god fearing man comes to him at his school office and reads a very powerful scripture from the book of REVELATIONS to him and tells him God wants him here to coach this team. Thru faith Grant opens his Bible and reads the word and asks for God's guidence and blessings. As always god hears all prayers and shows Grant the way to motivate his team. He reaches out to Brock(a Lineman who is more interested in being the class clown) and challenges him to reach deep inside his heart to channel his obvious abilty to be the teams leader. In the true turning point of the movie Brock is asked to do a crawl with a teammate on back for 30 yards then 50 yards and he gives everything he has in his heart and soul and with Coach Grant every bit of the way with him, challenging him to continue, Brock brings the whole team to their feet when he finally collapses and Takes off the blindfold put on by his coach not to hinder him by a visual of where he was at on the field he realizes that he has went the length of the entire field ...100 yards! Seeing this the team responds by coming together and turning to their faith in God to lead them through sport and life. This is a movie with a far greater message then winning football games. It says that with God, anything is possible! With faith nothing is unobtainable. This movement of faith vibrates through the entire school and eventually the community. It causes sons and fathers to come together, families to give all faith to God and just believe, and most of all shows that nothing is impossible through faith in God. I will not give away the ending because i encourage everyone who reads this to PLEASE watch this movie and recomend it to a friend and all who you love. It will inspire you to look in the mirror and challenge yourself. This is a great 5 star, family movie that may be a bit corny but so what. It's a great FAMILY movie.

I guess the more violent a movie is the more money you have to dumped into it. I plan to watch it again when I have more time to spare.

I pray that many, many people view this movie and that it will draw them to a relationship with God, and for those who are Christians, that they will be drawn closer to the Lord. This movie has really made our family look at things and JESUS in a stronger way! We also purchased ""Flywheel"", also by Alex Kendrick, and that is equally as powerful!

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A25G9GS04WB1YG	D. Nigh	"My family just finished watching ""Facing the Giants"" on DVD. My preschoolers were captivated by the preview trailer showing on those big TVs at W*LMART and I had heard some good things about the movie so I thought, ""Let's have a nice family movie night tonight at our house."" Great choice! My kids love sports and the football scenes in this movie were action-packed, very exciting - both for the little ones and for Mommy and Daddy. This truly was a great film! And there was NOTHING objectionable for even little kids. There are a few sad moments, but we talked with our kids about why the characters were sad and how we all get sad sometimes because of different things that happen in our lives. Of course there is tackling and other sports ""roughing"", but my wife and I felt it was totally appropriate for our kids. My wife said afterward that it is this movie is one of her all-time favorites! There are a lot of moving scenes in this one (they will move your heart!) Some will make you cry as you feel for the characters going through issues like so many of us face each day and there are some scenes that just make you feel so good inside as you experience the joy with the characters. This is a definite MUST see for all families. Your family will love it and if we support family-friendly movies like this one, Hollywood and independent film producers will keep putting out quality entertainment like this! I encourage you to support it to the max by purchasing it now when it has just been released on DVD. I see that it is #14 in sales on this website. It is so amazing that from the box office alone this movie has already pulled in more than 100 times its production budget! Let's keep giving it support!

It is full of moral values and standards that we should all live by. There is noviolence, cussing, sex situations, no suggestive elements. Finally a clean movie the wholefamily can watch without reservation. Everyone can take something good away from thismovie that they can apply to their life. Truly shows how when you put God first and giveHim the Glory no matter what--big things can happen.I feel that leaders sometimes have to go to outside help if they feel they are strugglingwith situations.  They have to be morally responsible and create standards that everyoneneeds to learn by.  Me being a devout Catholic, I feel that my leadership style reflectsmy religion and my relationship wtih God.  I do feel that if you put God first, good thingswill happen to you.  I feel various people in leadership roles throughout all of history,have led based on thier religion.

It's a good explanation of how our faith should be expressed in real life. Believers who see this film will be touched deeply and then challenged to rededicate all they do to the glory of God.I am a grown man and spent much of the movie in tears. I watched it with my group of 9 teenagers and many of them were in tears, too.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A10IG8YERDHOLM	Edwin C. Jones	"I knew what to expect when I first watched this movie. It comes from the same church who brought us the movie Flywheel. Facing The Giants like Flywheel is a bit corny and predictable like most ""Christian"" movies.However, this particular movie seemed to touch me more than Flywheel. Maybe I could relate to the coach in the movie. I have been high school football coach with a losing record for the past three years. Maybe it was because I let my guard down a bit more, or maybe it was conviction because trusting God is something I lack in my life. Whatever it was, I found myself having tears at the end.As I mentioned above this movie is really corny and predictable; however, it makes some great points about trusting God and giving Him the glory in whatever we do in life. In some of the other reviews people have stated that the movie's claim ""If you just pray and put your faith in God then you will be blessed"" is bogus. That there is no way you would blessed over and over again. I think unless it has happened to you, you really cannot comment on the fact. Maybe if we devote more of our time to Christ things would happen, but it seems as though many people nowadays use Christianity as a convenience rather than a relationship with God. People trust Him when they want to trust Him. I personally have never had something happen to me like it did in the movie. However, I know I have never fully given all the glory to God.This aside it is a family friendly movie. The acting and the cinematography are not that great, but this movie was made by a church in Georgia, and it's only their second movie. They're bound to get better.  This movie also features a fantastic score, and the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs football team (Mark Richt).

But how many movies can you get that allow the whole family to sit around and enjoy it without worrying about sexual innuendo, cursing, etc? There just are not many family movies around, and this one was not only family-oriented but obviously had a goal of glorifying Jesus. While my next door neighbor or co-worker may not find this to be a fun movie, my wife and three girls all enjoyed it...and they don't even like football. So, I say, get a tub of popcorn and have your family sit around the television on a Saturday night, but make sure you get the Kleenex ready for the women--they'll want to cry throughout!	4.0	Christian themed, my family enjoyed it	2007-02-18	8	6	2

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AXHPRJ7IHD26P	Eskypades	"When Facing the Giants first came out, I heard many varying opinions about it. Perhaps the most predominant opinion was that Facing the Giants was nothing more than a movie wrapped up in the health, wealth and prosperity gospel. The movie is about a high school football coach (Grant Taylor) who has a losing team, is on the road to losing his job, has a junker of a car, and, most worrisome to him and his wife, they are unable to have children. The coach turns to religion and everything - and I do mean, everything - miraculously turns out for the better. Sounds like a good, unhealthy dose of prosperity gospel, right? If you had asked me a week ago, I would have said the same thing.Then I watched the movie. And I couldn't have been more wrong.First, let's get the thing that everybody brings up when discussing Facing the Giants out of the way. The acting was horrible. There - it's been said. Now we can move on to a more in depth review.Coach Taylor is facing another year of high school football at Shiloh Christian Academy and knows that this year is going to be the same as previous years (or rather, the past 6 years, to be precise) without any hope of improvement. His team is mediocre at best. Compounding his problems is that there are some in town who consider his coaching abilities lackluster and are hinting at his dismissal. On top of all this, he and his wife are facing the heart wrenching likelihood of infertility. Everything in his life is failing. In utter despair, he reads Ps. 18:3, ""I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies."" He cries out to God, ""You're my God. You're on the throne. You can have my hopes and my dreams."" This is the pivotal moment of the movie. From here, Taylor reevaluates his thinking in how he approaches life. The trickle down effect is that his team starts winning, the school experiences revival and his life in general gets better.So how is this not a health, wealth and prosperity gospel? Just add Jesus to your life and everything gets better, right? On the surface and in summary form, this might be exactly what is being taught (which for the longest time, is the reason I had no desire to see the movie.) But there's a huge difference between what the prosperity gospel teaches and what is taught in this movie. Prosperity gospel says if you do such and such, God is bound to give you the good life. If you just get your heart right, you'll see the material blessings flow in. The problem with this philosophy is that the results are entirely centered on us, on what we get. In contrast, what the movie teaches is a God-centered gospel - a gospel where God gets the glory! In teaching others, Taylor stresses that the results should not determine whether we praise God or not. He asks his wife, ""If the Lord never gives us children, will you still love Him?"" In the locker room, he challenges his team by saying: ""Winning football games is too small a thing to live for...So far all this has been about us. How we can look good. How we can get the glory...If we win, we praise Him. And if we lose, we praise Him. Either way, we honor him with our actions and our attitudes. I resolve to give God everything I've got and I leave the results up to him.""That is no prosperity gospel. That is no philosophy that says ""Name it and claim it."" That is reflective of the Biblical truth that says ""Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power"" (Rev. 4:11). Is it a little unrealistic to see everything in a person's life turned around for the good? Perhaps, but even here what man sees as utterly impossible, with God it is possible. There is a two-fold lesson in the movie. First is that, no matter what the outcome, God is to be praised first, foremost, and always. Second, God will get the glory when the impossible becomes possible through his power. When we come to face our own giants, we should be firm in our faith to give God the glory. If, like Paul, our giant isn't slain, God promises grace sufficient for every battle so that his power will be made perfect. And if the impossible comes to pass, may we see God's power and honor him. That's the lesson of Facing the Giants, a movie I heartily recommend."	4.0	Facing the Giants - A Review	2009-12-20	1	1	0

God can do anything.2.  God loves you.3.  Jesus is the way.4.  It shows kids how to respect their parents.5.  It encourages a ""do not quit"" work ethic.6.  It shows how the wife respects her husband as the spiritual leader in the home.7.  It shows a husband who truly loves his wife.8.  Great football scenes.9.  It shows that cheaters lose in the long run.10.  It shows that God blesses those who put their faith in him.11.  It shows that talking bad behind someone's back is wrong.12.  There is NO swearing, no sexual perversions.13.  It shows a Godly father teaching his Son NEVER to give up.Lastly, it has such an awesome ending.  But if you think about it, all of us who put our faith in Jesus WILL have an awesome ending as well.  I am almost crying just writing this review.

It was uplifting, but a bit on the preachy side.  I am a very conservative Catholic, but this movie was more like one of the hands in the air praising movies.  A young football coach and his wife fall on hard times (his team isn't winning, she isn't able to get pregnant, their house and car are falling apart), and then he turns to God for help.  Everything starts turning around for them and the team.  The rest you can fill in the blanks easily.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A261NTSMST5OER	"Forest Cole ""First and Forestmost"""	I felt this movie really speaks to what many different people may be facing in their lives at different levels. It reveals twists that open up in two ways - to renewed opportunity and bigger challenges (Giants in this case!) to face. Albeit the Giants here are football ones, but still giant football teams are pretty scary, lol. Seriously though, this movie faces the viewer with both the fears of failure and of success in a more subtle way. It makes for great family and friends viewing.To me, it went a little deeper than their previous movie FlyWheel - also a favorite of mine - but didn't maintain quite the same element of simplicity.

You will not find too many movies to compare to this one, if you are looking for good family values and A BIBLICAL INTIMACY with God.  The husband and wife team really show how a Biblical marriage is intended to be.  Even if you can't have both marriage partners be close to God, you can certainly model many of the Godly attributes this husband and wife show.The film is full of the bottom line value and Biblical examples of ""i'll praise You when we win, and i'll praise You when we lose.""  What a heart-throbbing movie at times!  If you walk intimately with Yahweh, and His son Yeshua [Jesus], you will feel the Holy Spirit's Inspiration flowing thru this film.  God indeed desires a PERSONAL relationship with you, to walk thru the storms AS WELL AS to bless and reward you in various ways.Also, watch the ""special features"" on the DVD and see how many people were on their knees ALL THE TIME in prayer to glorify God, while they made this movie.  It's heart-warming, encouraging, and indeed, glorifies the Holy One.Another ""buy it you won't regret it, and share it!"" type film.  Praise the Lord."	5.0	Wow!

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A231HAEWH5RTMJ	Gerald Khoo	I just watched this movie and it brought tears to my eyes.  The central theme of the movie is that with God, all things are possible.  It tells the story of how a Christian school had a revival after someone had been praying for that revival for a long time, and the revival came through the school football team, and God took the team all the way to the state finals.  It also tells the story of the coach and his wife's infertility and that with God, all things are possible!It is reported that the cost of this movie was $100,000, and majority of the cast and crew were volunteers.  It is also reported that it raked in $10,000,000 by 1 Jan 2007.  This is truly the 100-fold increase!Eventhough the production may not be as polished as Hollywood production, but the values that it portrays are better than some G-rated movies and cartoons.

The lead in the movie also wrote and directed the movie, and his movie wife is no actress, but an actual resident of southern Georgia who is married to a high school football coach. She is VERY different from most women you see in movies today, and I say that as a compliment.The actual star of this movie isn't a character at all, but the faith that gives purpose to every character. The movie is just a subtext to explore the idea of what faith can do in our lives when we trust in something greater than ourselves.This movie proves you don't need big stars or big budgets to tell a great story, or to express an idea when you have something important to say."	5.0	What a movie should be	2007-02-14	11	9	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3HYCGZ5CKCZIH	"G. T. Howell ""neogalahad"""	"Most of the reviews I read before seeing ""Facing the Giants"" focused on the film's amateur actors and the predictable plot.  I sat down to watch the DVD not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by this winsome little gem.Yes, some of the supporting performances are pretty wooden (although the lead actors do a great job), and yes, the overall plot is standard sports-underdog fare, but somehow it all works.  Alex Kendrick and Shannen Fields (who play the coach and his wife, respectively) and the two assistant coaches (played by Chris Willis & Tracy Goode) make their characters so likeable and sympathetic that you can't help but root for them.The story itself is indeed fairly predictable, but the dialogue sounds natural, and there is enough humor to keep things from getting maudlin.  I found several scenes very stirring, especially the one where the coach shows the team what ""giving your best"" actually means by taking one player aside and pushing him to achieve more than he ever thought possible.  The football action is also good, and doesn't look over-produced.Some may criticize the story for implying that if you surrender to God's will all your problems will be fixed in a jiffy.  The obstacles and trials faced by the main characters do seem to be resolved a bit too neatly, but the filmakers also point out (in another moving scene, BTW), that we should thank God, love Him, and surrender to His will even when things DON'T seem to be going our way.I think 2 Chronicles 16:9 sums up the message of this film: ""For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.""  ""Facing the Giants"" is an excellent illustration of how God has to sometimes bring us through trials to strip away the things we clutch so tightly.  He's not trying to deprive us; He just wants us to trust Him above all else.  Too often, though, our disobedience and lack of faith get in the way of His blessing.  Coach Taylor's circumstances only begin to turn around after he humbles himself and turns to the Lord in complete trust.  ""Facing the Giants""  teaches a valuable lesson for all believers, even if it does lay it on a bit thick.A film with its heart in the right place, ""Facing the Giants"" overcomes its shoestring budget and rates as a solid four out of five stars."	4.0	Uplifting & encouraging film	2007-02-27	10	9	1
1424810248	Facing the Giants	AXPXQ1STKM0OF	"GT Rider ""AP"""	An excellent, fantastic, stupendous movie, but be forewarned that this movie has a deeply religious message if you haven't seen it before...Having said that, this movie is an incredible example of writing, acting, directing and cinematography.  The actors are all unknowns as far as Hollywood is concerned, and this fact makes the movie even more refreshing.  If the key, religious message is removed from the storyline, this movie is still a winner!  Even better, this movie can be seen by audiences of all ages without having to worry about the sex, drugs, violence and other gratuitous gimmicks Hollywood uses to lure their audiences into theaters.As a sports fan, this movie is fun to watch in order to get ready for football season.If you want to watch a love story, this movie has elements of that, too.As a Believer, watch this movie with a box of tissues nearby.  This movie will bring you to tears because of the powerful presentation of its message.  There are also important life lessons for non-believers (charity, honesty, etc.).P.S.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3R4ZE0J8IO2BO	H. Brown	I rented this movie for the kids (and my husband who loooooves football)and I ended up enjoying it more than I thought.  I was under the impression that it was just another football movie. They are usually good and instill a lot about teamwork and dedication, so I am not knocking football movies.  Our kids play soccer and I am always up for a movie that has a lesson behind it and motivates them to try their best even if they are on a losing streak. This film took it to a whole other level.  It truly showed how God can work even on trivial things like sports in order to achieve a bigger purpose.  I have not prayed for my kids to win games, but to be honest...after seeing this movie I actually did.  My daughter's soccer team (made up of pre-teen girls) has been on a losing streak this season.  They lost nearly every game.  We had a tournament recently and I asked that He show them how to work together as a team, and to let them see that their dedication of practicing 2-3 times per week was not a waste of time.  I asked Him to let everything finally click with them so that they don't end up being discouraged from coming in at nearly last place for the season.  Well, they won every game throughout the whole weekend.  They beat every team that had beat them during the season and they made it all the way to the championship.  The game went into two OT's before it had to be ended with penalty kicks!!!  The other team scored just one more penalty kick than us, so we barely lost.  But most importantly- God took them and showed them exactly what I asked.  He showed them how to rise above any self-doubt they had and believe me- they were a completely different team.  Don't get me wrong- I don't think He cares too much about who wins or looses in sports, but he cared about the fact that I asked him not to let their self-esteem be hurt by a terrible season.  I asked Him to show them and let them feel how much He lives and believes in them. No one knew about this prayer except for God and me. This movie is a testament to God's awesome power  and I just wanted to share my recent testament, as well.  Brilliant movie.  We need more like it!!!	5.0	I'm buying it!	2007-03-06	6	4	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	AAWUXA65NDMYM	HeatherHH	This movie tells the story of a football coach at a Christian school who has had one losing season after another.  Not only does he feel like he's failing as a football coach, but as a husband, because he can't afford to buy a car that actually works, plus there's the infertility.  He finally comes to a point where he recognizes that he needs to praise God whatever His circumstances.  When he lives that truth and imparts it to his players, God begins to work.I loved the inspirational message of this story, and I loved the improvement the football team showed as they began to focus more on God and less on themselves.  My husband and I found it very moving.  But the storyline was a bit overdone.  God is capable of working miracles, and even very great ones, but I think the ending felt a bit contrived.  It wasn't enough for him to learn to accept whatever God had for him, and for his life to improve somewhat.  Everything, and I mean everything was tied up perfectly with a beautiful bow so that everything was coming up roses by the end.I think the movie would have been stronger, and more believable, if one of his troubles had remained or at least not been so amazingly and completely overturned, and he had still been content in his circumstances.  Still, it was a good movie with a good message.  Our children also enjoyed it, and we will be watching it again in the future.	4.0	Inspirational and enjoyable, storyline a bit overdone	2011-02-22	0	0	0

This touching film underscores the truth that nothing is impossible with God and that we can trust Him with every detail of our lives.	5.0	Facing the Giants	2008-01-02	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2PC6M9QPYSXQ3	H.H.	"Only because this movie is family friendly, not having any sleaze or profanity does it deserve one star. The comedy in the movie was quite stale. Its starting to get really old to always give the black actor/s lines that somehow are suppose to demonstrate they are not afraid to talk about something African American while making others laugh.The makers of this movie seek to teach and show that all things are possible with God. First, they would have done a better job by dealing with some problems that are truly serious and impossible to solve without God's intervention. Instead they chose to deal with some of the most frivolous of issues that people face today. A highschool football coach is distraught because him and his wife can't have children...like adopting a child doesn't exist and possibly could be God's provision of a good home for a child. He is disraught because his football team has a loosing streak and talks are held about possibly replacing him. He is distraught because he doesn't make enough money to own a reliable, newer vehicle. I'd hate to see this man faced with real problems like facing his own terminal illness or that of a loved one, like not having a job at all, like not having a wife at all and not seeing one anywhere on the horizon, like not having a vehicle at all, not even one that runs some of the time?  And then there is his wife who desperately wants to have a baby. Does she want a baby so that she will be looked upon by society as a ""normal"" and complete woman and wife? If she wants to nurture a little one and to provide him or her with a good home, why is adoption not considered as possibly being God's will? And then we have little David who needs to trust God to be able to kick well on the football team. There are so many abused and neglected children who wish they had such a fluffy problem and would gladly change places with David. Instead, they wonder where their next meal will come from, will they get medical treatment when they are sick, will they receive an education, will they hear the gospel preached to them.Throughout the movie we hear that nothing is impossible with God which is truth. However, we also ""hear"" in this movie another subtle message. One that says if you pray and believe, that all of your problems, frivolous or not, will be solved just like you want them. We see the characters of the movie pray and ""believe"" and every one of them receive exactly what he or she wants. You can even predict the scenes of ""victory"" long before the movie gets to them! Its good to see there are at least a few Christians who are not taken in with the mush of this movie and actually think they can use it as an effective tool to witness Christ to a very dark world where so many are in bondage to some of the most vile sins. These people, as do all people, would rather benefit from the Gospel, the whole Gospel, and not just a fictitious, horrible unrealistic portrayal of a message of ""pray and believe God"" and everything will be peachy king."	1.0	Shamefully Unrealistic and Predictable	2007-03-17	47	12	35

Many, many, many volunteers helped make this film possible. Some of the football game shots were filmed at area football games, including the Sherwood High School and Lee County High School games. I highly recommend this film as both an Albany, GA/Lee Co. resident and supporter and also as an avid film viewer.

I am not a practicing Christian, but I fail to see how anyone could be threatened by this. Are your children somehow going to be contaminated by hearing about people with ethical, moral beliefs?

Six years as a losing coach, facing money and marital problems, he has to reevaluate his purpose in life.The story is uplifting and is a nice departure from most of the stuff coming from Hollywood these days.  The real life story of how this small church in Georgia made two major pictures is just as amazing, God truly does work in amazing ways.This is a great film to watch as a family and used to discuss what your values are as a father/mother and the values you want for your kids.This movie is released in widescreen ,so it looks great on a HDTV with an upconverting DVD.	5.0	Time for a family movie night that could ignite your faith	2007-02-02	15	13	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1MYDYK6074EFI	Humor Collector	"To be honest, when I hear, ""it's a Christian movie,"" I wince.  To me that usually means trite, unsubtle, with the supposed message (not the one that's really conveyed) bludgeoning people over the head, while the acting stinks up the screen and the cleanness of everything gets on my nerves.  This isn't that movie.I kept waiting for the story, or the action, or the actors to stumble  (make that fumble).  And they didn't.  At times, it's evident that some of the actors are saying lines, but that was never very distracting and I've seen a LOT worse performances, by well-known Hollywood celebrities.  A of couple times during the scenes of football games, it was evident that there had been only one camera filming.  But I don't know that I would've noticed that so much, if I hadn't heard about it beforehand.  The blurred parts only made me look away for a moment, and then I was right back into what was happening.This movie explodes all stereotypes about southerners being ignorant, slow-talkin', thick-skinned, unfeeling, two-dimensional types or worse.  Which is how they are portrayed in small parts in many, many films.I knew it was possible for someone to be shown reading the Bible in some kind of visual media, and it just meant someone reading the Bible -- looking for wisdom, listening for guidance, being encouraged.  Just a character, at that point in his (her) life.  Not an extremist of some sort.I cried several times, laughed hard several times and enjoyed myself thoroughly.  Which is what I go to the movies for."	5.0	Surprised at Quality	2007-01-01	34	31	3

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3USRUCHAOC3MT	"Indiana Jeff Reynolds ""Preacher Jeff"""	Have you noticed that you don't need a mega star or big budget special effects to make a good movie?  This is a case in point.This movie is basically a Christian movie, in that it is taken from a Christian point of view.  The writers, directors, and producers were Christian, and so were the characters.  If this offends you or turns you off, this movie is probably not your movie, though I would encourage you to be more open-minded and tolerant (which is what Christians hear a lot, but is no less true with some non-Christians).One unique thing about this movie:  It was made by a local church, which is one reason you don't see any familiar faces.  So what are the negatives as a result of a church doing this instead of a big Hollywood studio?  Well, the story is predictable . . . but then, that is also true of a lot of Hollywood movies.  Well, there's no graphic sex and violence . . . but then, I consider that a plus, which I wish Hollywood would imitate.  Well, there are no car-chases or explosions . . . but then, the purpose of this movie is to inspire your hearts and minds, not to dazzle your eyes with special effects.Having said that, the test of whether this movie succeeds in its goal is the impact it makes on you.  Its goal is to increase your faith in God to do His job, and to encourage you to do your part, which is to seek Him and obey Him.  It also is clear that God won't always do things our way.  I cannot speak for you . . . you need to watch the movie and see if it affects you.  It did affect me, giving me hope and motivation in my life.One last comment.  The actor who played the Giants' coach is great!  He made as much of an impact as some high dollar celebrity would.  Same is true of the assistant coaches for the home team.	5.0	A Movie That Encourages And Builds Up Hope.	2006-12-28	30	26	4

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3Q04XXGGED746	"Jan Peczkis ""Scholar and Thinker"""	"Everything goes wrong for Coach Grant and his high school football team. Six years as coach, and he hasn't had a single winning season. The players have a defeatist attitude against good teams, and also manage to goof up when playing weaker teams. The players fail to apply themselves in either academics or on the field. One after another, the few talented and motivated players leave for better teams.The problems pile up. There is gossip about the need to replace Grant with a coach who can win. ""The team, the kids, and the community deserve better."" His wife cannot get pregnant after four years of trying. On top of all that, there are annoyances that add insult to injury. There is a mysterious odor in the home, and the family car has a battery that keeps on dying.A change in attitude can lead to a change in circumstances. The players focus on Christ, resolve to do their very best for Him, and praise Him in victory and in defeat. The rapid building of a fortification wall by the Prophet Nehemia, with each person responsible for only the segment of wall in front of his home, serves as the inspiration for an impregnable defense. Christ's teaching about the narrow entry into heaven serves as a metaphor for accurately-centered field-goal kicks.A delightful and inspiring movie!"	5.0	Changing Your Attitudes Can Change Your Life	2008-11-30	1	0	1

After the first 30 minutes I was about to turn the TV off because I thought it was bad acting, a mediocre story, and a waste of time.  I kept watching and things changed real quick.  It became very christian in it's story and I was afraid it would get a bit korny.  Even though there was a lot of reference to God, it was done in a very good way.  It shows how a man is brought low and humbled in many aspects of life, and then his only recourse is to finally embrace his faith and use it.  Use it he did and it made me cry 3x even though I try to be a manly man and shun crying (thankfully I watched the movie alone, haha).Give this movie a shot.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AXE3KZLDIGP1B	"J. D Morrow ""left out"""	"The movie is called ""Facing the Giants"" and one of the first characters you meet is a small kid named David who is just trying out for the football team since he can't play soccer at his school.  He becomes the back-up kicker; hmmm... what's he going to do against the Giants?So as far as movies (just writing, acting, filming etc. not message), this movie is awful.  The plot is formulaic to the point that you think it might be making fun of Christian formulaic movies.Outside of this, the movie sends terrible messages.  First is race.  There is not one single black player on the football team, in Albany, GA!  There is only one black character with any speaking lines - an assistant coach.  He is used specifically for comic relief.  The only other time he is used is when the coach ignores his input.  The only other black people in the movie are all opponents. They are described as faster and stronger, but the all-white Christian team can beat them, as the main character (and writer-director) says, ""we can out think them."" The movie appears to promote the marginalization of blacks in a protestant christian context.  Great Christian message for kids!The second issue is Creation Care.  The wife in the movie drives a gigantic SUV and the coach gets an F150 as his reward.  So this double income, no child family has two  gas guzzlers that destroy God's Creation of gift to mankind - and this is considered a good thing.  Another great Christian message!Issue number 3, pray to God and you'll get everything you want in life.  This is not only simplistic but also offensive to everybody from Southern Sudanese to Jews and Christians under Soviet Communism to Job!  Not one bad thing happens to the team after they become Christians.  This is not the message that any of the Christian or Jewish writers of the Bible protrayed!  In this awful film, salvation comes as material rewards in this life.  Great Christian message!The fourth issue has nothing to do with Christian values. The score is 23-21 with like 15 seconds left in the game and the coach of the other team (the only one with black players) goes for it on fourth down instead of kicking the field goal.  No coach who has one three straight state championships has done so by being an idiot!  But, this coach blows the game by not kicking the field goal!  It's just ridiculously implausable.I would never show this movie to anyone.  Its racist undertone, its lack of concern for the God's creation and its complete highjacking of Christianity into an instant-gratification materialist consumerist faith are offensive to me and to my faith.  While I know lots of people misuse or misrepresent the bible for their own purposes, this one is so egregious, I cannot accept it.  If I could give it fewer than one star, I would!"	1.0	Wow is this thing bad	2008-07-03	71	27	44
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"So what do you get when you cross ""Friday Night Lights"" with a Joel Osteen Sunday gospel hour? ""Facing the Giants,"" that's what. ""Giants"" is a sweet football movie proclaiming the message that with God, everything is possible. High school football coach Grant Taylor (played with heart and emotion by Alex Kendrick) is a man whose life is falling apart. Professionally, he can't get his team to win. He and his wife Brooke are having no luck conceiving a child. And with every loss, the parents of his team are getting more and more mutinous. Also, his car is a dud and he is hardly making ends meet financially. Seemingly at the end of his rope, he decides to re-examine his (and his team's) goals and to align himself with God's plans. Win or lose, he will give God the glory.Set in a Christian school, the film keeps religion in the background for the first 40 minutes. But then, like a biblical deluge, industrial-strength faith talk makes a sudden appearance and never leaves. Religious people may think this is as it should be. But I felt like I had been involved in a bait-and-switch operation, one that interfered with what was a fairly interesting (if predictable) story with sympathetic characters. The film's ""gospel of prosperity"" values -- that good things come to those who give God the glory -- is popular and comforting, but may be at odds with the difficult lives of many believers. I have a dictionary full of saints and heroes to back that up.""Facing the Giants"" trades good acting, subtlety and production values for a chance to preach the Gospel. Too bad. Tuning down the faith talk would have made the movie (and its inspirational message) accessible to a wider audience."	3.0	Inspirational, but way too heavy on the proselytizing	2009-01-21	5	3	2

I considered very carefully about saying this next sentence, and decided it should be said. This is the best movie I've ever seen. It's a critics job to find something wrong with every movie; if they don't, then they don't have a job, and we don't need them.It wasn't as visually powerful as a movie like ""Lord of the Rings"", but that's not its goal, and it certainly doesn't try to be. But as far as sheer emotional impact, you better buckle up. I say this to both women and men: You're going to need something to blow your nose, or dry your tears on, because you're going to need it. Even the tough guys. You've been warned, so you may not want to watch it with a group of macho dudes, because somebody's not getting out of there without breaking down.It's a story of a man coaching high school football, and the difficult circumstances that engulf both him and his wife. People will see themselves in this movie because it can't be helped. It will move you. Yes, the man cries out to God for help because he hits the very bottom, and there's no way out. There is so much in this movie to absorb. It will have tremendous influence on junior high, high school, college, young and old adults. It will hit everyone at some level, and hit hard. You will feel this family's pain. Undoubtedly one of the many reasons is because the actress who plays the coach's wife in the movie is the wife of the real coach in real life. I was stunned at how effective this film was in connecting with everyone who sees it. Only the jaded and callous cynic will be able to deny its influence and power.I can safely say that this is a movie that you won't be able to get extra copies of fast enough.

(honesty, hard work, doing the best you can do in all you do), without any other negative characteristics (greed, pridefulness, poor sportsmanship, cheating, etc), and above all, doing all you can do, and letting god bless you for your hard effort and good motives. this film, even though i do not care for sports, was very good, and brought tears to my eyes in several scenes, -- it was such a GREAT MOVIE!!!!!

I was afraid that it would be a let down for them compared to what I led them to expect. It was not. All of them were thrilled by this movie.

No that is not how He works, and I feel sorry for anyone who stops living a good life because they haven't recieved thier trillion dollars yet.I wish in the scene where they switched out the coaches old car for a new truck, that they switched out the car for a spare tire.

I'm guessing that refers to the fact that the movie mentions God and Christianity because the movie is utterly free from any swearing, hint of nudity--the only refererence to sex at all is that the feature couple in the film is trying to have a child--and no negative behaviour of any kind is promoted in this film.  My wife and I just watched it (again) with our 7 year old kids and I felt absolutley zero need to fast forward any parts of the film or to correct any poor behaviour exhibited by the film (this is in sharp contrast to the vast bulk of ""kids"" movies that they watch).  The movie is absolutely safe for children.The storyline is simple but compelling and EXTREMELY powerful.  You will experience a ton of positive emotions while enjoying this film. Nearly everyone will connect at some level with this movie.  I have shown it to a group of junior high and high school kids and they were completely engrossed in the movie from start to finish.As I first started watching this movie I thought, ""Great, another Christian movie with sub-par acting.""  However, this thinking was  dispelled within minutes of the film's start.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2MDZVFELW98B5	"J. M. Watkins ""Islander"""	"I watched this film in youth group, where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it. Then some adult couple at a church-related Christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance, and now my household is stuck with the film (though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap). I cried bitter tears over these sad events, and here's why: First off: this film has good intentions, especially if you're a Christian like me. This movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in God and that it'll make your life better. Not so bad, right? Eh. It turns out a be a problem--a big one. This movie was made by a church, so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for Christians as possible. It is all black-and-white, no gray areas. God's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing, and it comes instantly to all those who do His bidding.This is not the God I know. This is not the Christian life I am familiar with. The God I believe in is a powerful and trustworthy God, but He is not one that grants my every wish. I follow Him as best I can, though the going is often hard; yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self-control a lot easier than anyone should EVER find it. I cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad-side to good-side in the course of a few structured movie scenes. And when I DO follow His commandments as laid out in the Bible, I certainly don't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do. The largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that I have done the right thing; everything else comes with long, messy, arduous work.But take the example this movie sets: Grant Taylor coaches the football team at Shiloh Christian school, which has had 6 losing seasons in a row. He may lose his job over it, and he and his wife are low on money as it is. They want a baby, but the doctor tells him he is sterile. Oh, and his car doesn't work. And the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents, whiny after their million losses, and bad at kicking field goals. This is sure one rundown community here.But wait, Grant Taylor decides he's going to trust in God for everything! And he passes on his faith to his team. So far, so good. Not for long. As they begin to obey, blessing literally POUR in on them. Suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents; the school has a big ""revival""; the team starts winning EVERY game; they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league! Coach Taylor's job is reassured; the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present (which, by the way, is the epitome of shallow, fair-weather employers); he gets a raise; his wife (get this) even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm! And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters!! Wowzers, woot, yay, praise the Lord, etcetera, etcetera!!! ...Yipe. Just YIPE. Nobody in my church has ever experienced Christ in a such a cut-and-dry manner. Yes, there have been miracles aplenty in my family, as well as gifts and creature comforts, and I attribute them to God's grace and lovingkindness. But God isn't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad! He is by and large a mystery; His gifts come unexpectedly, often when you think you don't need them but you really do. It's a long, hard slog to the road of fulfillment, and things NEVER turn out the way you thought they would.This movie has good intentions. But because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism, it tanks tremendously to a 1/10. The bad acting and sports movie clich&eacute;s seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes.To all you future churches planning to make a movie: don't be afraid to show REAL life, even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix. However much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat, nobody has learned anything substantial from it. Give us the meat, the bones, the REAL stuff! True life applies to everyone, not just Christians, and that's one aspect ""Facing the Giants"" didn't manage to grasp."	1.0	It has good intentions, but all it does is a lot of harm!	2008-04-23	135	90	45

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2S9T9GB1FIEA	"Joey Morgan ""Unabashed book junkie"""	This is the central theme of this movie, and by the end of it you will know it for yourself. As with all of the Sherwood Baptist Church/Kendrick brothers movies, the value is in the message. Many have commented on the low-budget aspect of their movies, but they all do what any good movie should do--they tell a good story well. This is a movie you will want to watch again and again, to share with your friends and family, and to use when life hands you challenges to remember the awesome power of faith.There is only one flaw in the movies that the Kendrick brothers have written and produced--there aren't more of them.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A31LVH3RKHLJ3J	John Hardt	As I watched this film, its flaws (and clich&eacute;s) became quickly apparent. It was not produced in Hollywood with a big budget, and it doesn't have name actors, but what this movie does possess is a good story told with a big heart. The producers and actors obviously care about the message of this movie, and because of that have crafted a believable and entertaining sports (and life) championship drama.This movie tells the story of a young football coach toiling away at a Christian high school with less than stellar results in his first six seasons. The coach and his young wife face everything from car troubles and home appliance repairs to a fight with infertility, with the accompanying soul searching and God imploring moments. When he overhears several of the school's athletic boosters discussing plans to replace him, he finally breaks down in an emotional scene with his wife. As he searches the Bible for answers, he prays and questions God about His plan for him and whether He will provide a solution. The answer is forthcoming, as the school's lone prayer warrior (previously seen walking the halls and praying at each student's locker) visits him in his coaching office the next day with a word from the Lord. The message is simple; personally trust in God and praise Him whether he or the team wins or loses.The coach buys into the message, and starts by crafting a new team purpose. He announces his change of focus to the team, and things start to turn around. As they all focus on trusting in God and praising Him, the victories start coming both on and off the field. In the end, the miracles culminate in a victory in the State Championship.My kids attend a Christian school very much like Shiloh Christian Academy (SCA), and we also just won a State Championship (although in basketball, not football), so many of the situations and scenes were eerily familiar.  Like the fictional SCA, we see the apathy and self centeredness of our students, with many students living life with one foot in the Christian life and the other foot planted firmly in the secular world. Many of us pray for an event like the revival that happened on the football field in the film to happen at our school. We look forward to God igniting our athletic teams and student body like He did for SCA.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and give it 4 stars for a great story with minor production and acting flaws.	4.0	Why I loved this little Christian Film	2007-02-25	8	6	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A21Z4IVGGR7ZJ5	JOHN P. HANSSEN	"I think that it is a marvelous idea to have a film that inspires you to face your personal giants in your life, and we need more films coming out that deal with these positive, uplifting themes.  However, I felt that this film was a bit too ""preachy"" and actually contained too many wrong messages about faith.  When Jesus was here on Earth, he spoke about the benefits that God's Kingdom would bring, yet he never got ""preachy"" with anyone and, quite frankly, everyone felt comfortable around him.  In fact, the least likely people one would think actually became Christians.  Jesus even told the corrupt religious leaders of the day that the harlots were going ahead of them to the Kingdom.  This film, I felt, contained way too much preachy propaganda and also one must realize also that God could care less about whether a sports team wins or not.  Such things are rather quite trivial in comparison to what REALLY needs to be taken care of here on Earth, like starving children under a cruel dictator.  It's quite obvious that God cares about answering prayers of those children rather than helping a football team win.That being said, I did feel that there was a good message to the film about not giving up and persevering.  Nothing wrong with those themes.However, I felt ""We Are Marshall"" was so much better in dealing with sprirituality and the triumph of the human spirit.  I would recommend ""Marshall"" before recommending ""Giants""."	3.0	"Light-years inferior to ""We Are Marshall"", although the film did have a few good points."	2007-05-10	5	3	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3F9VH8916IA40	Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...	"I have the feeling that most people reviewing this film are reviewing it on the fact that it's a ""Christian"" film and that it was done by some church with mostly local actors instead of on the films actual quality. I also have the feeling that once i post this review I will get a stream of not helpful votes and comments from well meaning people telling me how wrong I am and how much I need god to change my heart of stone. Well, I'll just have to take that risk because I cannot take anymore of this moronic babble. This movie IS NOT THAT GOOD!!!!! its noRemember the Titans (Director's Cut), it's noRudy (Special Edition), and it's noRadio.Since this movie came out, I've heard nothing but praise for it from my church. ""Oh, it's great,"" or ""it's an inspiration"" and when I said I had no desire to see it, I get called heartless. HEARTLESS! For not wanting to see this movie and it turns out I had reason to.Almost every Christian movie that comes out is cheesy, and this is no exception. the actors are bad, I don't care if they are local actors they suck and that's all that matters, the script was horrible, and the message was just the same old same old you get from a million movies like this. Everyone, even people I love and respect, keeps telling me how amazing it is, but it IS NOT. So let me break it down a bit.---THE GOOD---I'll start with some good stuff before ripping into this movie, and yes there IS some good stuff here. First off, although the acting for the most part was subpar, it did have its moments. One part I remember is when the coach tells one of his players to pick up another and carry him across the field on his knees while blindfolded. This scene is amazing, plain and simple, and has some of the best acting in a sports movie I've ever seen.The second thing I likes was that there was a fare amount of hummer in this film. Not a whole lot mind you, but it did have its moments. These two things were enough for me to give this movie three stars, maybe i was being too lenient but three stars sounds fair to me.---THE BAD---ACTING. To put it simply, it's bad. I KNOW that they were using local actors, I KNOW that it was a low budget movie, and I KNOW that it was all done by some church in Georgia, but really people, I've seen lots of low budget movies that have better acting than this. These aren't real actors, their hacks.SUB PLOTS. The worst offence this movie has is its sub plot of David and his crippled dad. My goodness, you could not ask for a cheesier plot. this David character (just like King David in the Bible, duh. some dim witted person decided we weren't smart enough to figure that out) just moves to this new school and wants to play soccer just like any prick would but can't because they don't have a team. So, naturally, he wants to be the field goal kicker, only he's not any good. so his dad, his ever perfect loving caring flawless crippled dad who never speaks out of a monotone voice, looks like the bald guy from Who's Line is it Anyway, and never does anything wrong just like a real person (yeah right), tells him god loves him and that he can do anything if he just prays hard enough and believes in himself. Yeah... right... So in the end what do you think happens? Well, I'll tell you. The kicker gets hurt, so now David needs to kick the winning field goal to win the state championship. He goes ""I can't do it"" and the coach gives him a speech. Than his ""crippled"" dad stands up. Wow, I guess he was faking it the whole time. He kicks the winning field goal and they win the game. Hurray, David beat the evil giants, could this movie get any less subtle?""GOOD MESSIGE."" this is really the only thing people like about this movie. Its ""good message."" And what is the message people? God loves you, god will protect and care for you, god is good, yeah god, blah blah blah. look, I'm a Christian myself, but this its kids stuff that we all have to learn in Sunday school so we can get some candy as a reward. As adults we should expect more than this, but sadly this movie only spoon feeds us more baby food. Listen people, listen closely, cripples can't stand up, i've never seen it, and niether have you, they can't, thats why they never do, duh. People don't randomly come up to you and read you a bible verse, they don't. Students don't randomly get together and have a revival. They don't, especially in Christian schools that are often times worse than public schools.I haven't even talked about the cheesy ""evil"" opposing teams coach, the idiotic speeches, and the horrible game scenes they tried. As a pure sports movie, this is one of the worst I've seen. But I have to stop ranting at some point. This movie DOES NOT deserve to be praised by ever church in the world. It's not that good, get over yourselves. If you read this review, please leave a comment.Replay value; low."	3.0	Give Me a Break.	2007-10-01	18	5	13
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1RS12EWACTN8Y	Jon	Ok, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  When the film started, I did feel like I was watching a C-movie Christian film with church members doing the acting.But once I got used to that, this film totally bowled me over.  The message was incredibly powerful and extremely well-executed.  This film has catapulted itself into one of my favorite movies.  It's not just an inspiring message - the main character uses the Word of God in a way that I have seen countless people do but have never seen illustrated so well.  Once you get past the acting (and trust me, you will, just hang tight), this movie will inspire you and touch you like nothing else.	5.0	Easily the best Christian film I have seen	2008-02-12	0	0	0

Any man or woman who has faced their ""giant"" in life will be impacted by this film. Critics of this movie either went in with ulterior expectations of entertainment, or they are just pushing the powerful message away so not to be accountable for their personal relationship with God and what God wills to do through them. These people probably are best staying in their cynical ""Hollywood"" way of life. It's absolutely ridiculous the fixation on the ""amateur acting"" in other reviews. Point is, this movie is not about ""acting"" but it's real life, albeit with the great game of football merely being used symbolically. Any man who is making any positive impact in his life for Christ will relate to the coach in the movie. Any strong woman in Christ will relate to the coach's wife.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	Grant Taylor is the coach of a mediocre football team at Shiloh Christian Academy.  Because of the failure of his team to win more games than it loses, Taylor's job is in jeopardy.  In addition to this, his car barely runs, his finances are precarious, and he and his wife are unable to have the children they want.  All seems lost when a stranger comes into his Taylor's life and gives him some advice.  He changes the way he coaches and begins influencing his players' attitudes.  He shows them that all things are possible with God, and their lives begin to turn around in football and other areas.  This is a clean, feel-good movie which presents the Christian message and should provide postive motivation, especially for teenagers.	4.0	Football movie with a Christian theme	2007-02-16	7	5	2

The story is incredibly inspiring, and it had me laughing, tearing up, and going, ""Come on, come on, you can do it!"" the entire time.Some people have trouble enjoying the movie as a movie because it is ""preachy."" I didn't read it as preachy, I saw it as a snapshot of real life with God at the center of your universe. It also helps show how we can incorporate God into our daily lives. He doesn't have to stay confined within the walls of our sanctuaries and Sunday School rooms. We can find him in our homes, in the doctor's office, or even on a football field.God blesses those who give their lives wholeheartedly to him. And this film has captured the beauty of life with God at the wheel.It was also cool to see a bunch of churches coming together to pull the production together. These are real people, telling the story of real life, with the real God.(Music is fantastic too!)Awesome movie, and I would recommend ""Facing the Giants"" to everyone!"	5.0	Best movie ever!	2008-01-04	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AHWLTP9VR2IGT	kbt	We love football in the South, so we love football movies. They're exciting, action-packed and inspiring. And they usually address important character traits beyond teamwork, because who you are on the field, in the heat of battle, is who you are. But Facing the Giants takes it to a whole new level. My son and I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended. We bought it to take to Canada for friends to see, and one friend had just seen it a few nights earlier because somebody from Montana had taken it up! It's spreading like wildfire. Faith is really put to the test in this story, and not just faith in teammates or the head coach; real faith. The kind you have to dig deep for, even pray for, and then ignore everything your senses are telling you in order to keep. The kind that works. If you've never seen that kind of faith work in real life, like I have many times, then I dare you to watch this movie and not want it - that faith, I mean. And the movie, too!FlywheelEarlier movie by same group - less professional, but a great story.The Perfect StrangerHe's not what you would expect.	5.0	Inspiring beyond other football movies	2007-05-07	5	4	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3CRNB557EW50L	"KCWANGSVICK ""Bored with Today's TV"""	Some people would find this movie a bit 'preachy'. That is an issue with many 'Inspirational Movies' like Fireproof, or Courageous. If you are a person who is embarrassed or uncomfortable with seeing people honestly pray or otherwise show their Christian faith , you might pass on this one. But, you will be missing a really nice football movie. I rarely catch this one on TV (on the Hallmark Channels only), so I was happy to find it on Amazon at a good price. The messages of the movie are basic, both on the field and in the coach's home..... Anything is Possible with God. And, of course, Cheater's never Win and Winners Never Cheat. The Coach in this movie is the main policeman in Courageous.	5.0	Family Football Movie	2013-04-17	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A15JQ5PHYB9ER8	Keith Anderson	"I propose a counterpoint to those who say this movie has shallow ""genie-God"" theology.  This is not a movie about bad Christians that become good so that God will bless them with only good things.  It's about regular people who trust God even as life gets more difficult.  God's blessing is not portrayed as a predetermined outcome to certain actions.  On the contrary, one of the theme's of the movie is trusting God even when circumstances are very difficult.  ""If God doesn't... will you still love Him?""  The answer was a tearful but confident, ""Yes.""  Along the same lines we hear, ""If we win, we praise Him.  If we lose, we praise Him.""  Through this uplifting story, these real-life lessons shine through."	5.0	Uplifting but Balanced	2007-03-31	2	1	1
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1EHTFVSD0H7I6	Kelly Klepfer	I'm not a big football movie fan but I'm a sucker for overcomer movies so it was just a matter of time before I viewed Facing the Giants.I hesitate to embrace the positive press regarding Christian made movies because sometimes those who just want positive movies out there overlook some of the basic aesthetic details. Of course, the negatives can be backlash inaccurate also. I tend to hover in the middle on the side of liking a movie where I don't cringe at the language or feel the need to apologize to others in the room.Though made with unknowns by relative unknowns Facing the Giants impressed me. The Christian message is loud and clear so those who don't want to hear it may not appreciate the multiple mentions of Jesus in positive light. But those who expect Christian media to contain Jesus shouldn't be disappointed.The action scenes should be real enough to entertain football lovers.Some of the actors felt a little wooden, but the main characters were believable in their roles. I didn't expect to cry, but I teared up in more than one scene. Humor is tossed in throughout the film.If Facing the Giants is an indicator of the quality of future films in the growing Christian film industry, families are in for some great entertainment choices.	4.0	Better Than I Expected	2007-11-26	3	2	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1SSCNL9PZT4X0	Kevin Gwin	"I was looking forward to this movie as another of a new line of Christian movies that have hit the theater.  I really enjoyed ""The Passion of the Christ"", ""End of the Spear"", and especially ""The Second Chance"" for their clear Christian message as well as there professionally produced movie with real actors.  I look forward to the church using its best God given talent to portray God's message.That leads to why I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  Not only was the filming and acting sub par, which is disappointing but definately forgivable, but the message seemed to misrepresent God and His word.  It is forgivable that the movie was so predictable that my wife and I were talking about what would happen almost exactly about 10 to 15 minutes before it would happen.  It is not forgivable that it sent a wrong message.  Since when does the Bible teach that if you submit to Him and are obedient that everything will begin to go right.  This sounds like the health and wealth message that is popular today, but was not the story in the scriptures.  Have you ever heard or Job, Joseph, Jeremiah, the apostle Paul, and even Jesus Christ.  The list could go on, but people who were being obedient and suffered for it and not every thing went right in fact sometimes quite the opposite happens.  Church, do we really believe that if we are obedient we will not suffer, we will get all things to go our way.  The Bible says quite the opposite.  ""All who want to live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution"".  ""Count it all joy when you face various trials"".  The list could go on and on.  It is true that nothing is impossible with God as the movie states, but that does not mean that God chooses to make everything in life work our way if we are obedient.  This is not true to scripture and not true to life.  This movie would only work in ""American Christianity"" where it is believed that obedience equals blessing and a good life.I am disheartened as a Christian and as a pastor as I have read review after review of this movie claiming that it is the best ever.  I am thankful for the efforts of my brothers and sisters, but let's be honest with ourselves about what has been produced.I pray that some who see this will see that there is an implied message about how God acts that contradicts what is true."	2.0	WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!	2007-02-24	42	14	28

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AMI72BXDCWLF1	"K. Rockwell ""truth teller"""	"Besides being inspirational and a good family film, ""Facing the Giants"" has some very funny situations. One of the funniest scenes is the one in which the two assistant coaches are talking about historical events.  Since one of my high school history teachers was a jock football coach and not too swift in history, I particularly got a kick out of the scene.One of the reviewers who admitted to not being a Christian mentioned that the plot was trite and obvious and that the acting was terrible.My family is not evangelical Christian, but we found the movie sweet, funny, and uplifting.  The message of the Gospel is not going to be understood or embraced by all, but there have been acquaintances inspired by this movie. And even if one was to cover their ears and ignore the scenes in which God is mentioned, praised, or exalted, there are plenty of other scenes which simply reflect the little nuances of real life and everybody's desire for happiness or a quest for a direction in life.For those who cannot get beyond their embarrassment or hatred of some peoples' love for a Creator and Savior, it might appear to be a ""preachy"" movie.  But for those ""not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ"", we know the message to be true, and it resonates.  Everything really IS better in our lives when we accept that we humans have a very difficult time ""going it alone"".As for the reviewer's comments that the movie has a trite, obvious outcome, well...okay.  So most Hollywood movies today have good, serious actors and surprise plot twists with unexpected outcomes?  Uh-huh. Get real.  Hollywood has been learning with their box office busts of the last several years that people don't want the garbage that passes for ""real life"" or ""good movies"".  People are no longer spending their money or time to go see excessive violence or voyeuristic sex scenes, or to endure the bad and literally uncommunicative ""cave language"" (limited and repetitive four letter words standing in for real language) we encounter in the world each and every day.And, for the record, the acting in ""Facing the Giants"" was just fine.  The lead actor, Alex Kendrick, reminded me a little of Dan Ackroyd, and the lead actress, of Reese Witherspoon in ""Sweet Home in Alabama"".Sweet, happy endings are what the movies have been mostly about...at least the ones that everybody remembers and loves through the decades.""Facing the Giants"" is a refreshing movie which will make your family laugh and cry and, for the Christians who see it or for those inlined toward accepting the Gospel, it will give a new appreciation for faith, prayer, and our access to God."	5.0	Inspirational and funny and a good movie all around...	2007-02-22	15	13	2

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A14BTJRH9VNLJJ	Kurt A. Johnson	Coach Grant Taylor (played by Alex Kendrick) has been going through life, doing what he should...but somehow it never seems to amount to much. He wanted to turn his school&#8217;s football team around, he wanted to give his wife a good home, and he wanted to have a family. But, one by one, each of his dreams seems to be falling apart. And then, an old man comes into his office and reads to him from the Bible &#8211; it is then that Grant has an epiphany, it&#8217;s not about him, it&#8217;s about faith. It&#8217;s an epiphany that will turn his life around 180 degrees!This is a great movie, one that I found really inspiring. Yes, I can see how some people found it a little over the top &#8211; so much going wrong before Grant commits himself, and so much going right afterward. But, it is hard to use subtly when cramming a lot of learning into such a small time.I really enjoyed this movie &#8211; it made me think, and it really convicted me into thinking about my own faith and what it means for how I live my life. So, if you want a great, family-friendly movie with great values, then get Facing the Giants. It&#8217;s one of the best movies I have seen all year, and I give it my highest recommendations!	5.0	It made me think	2014-02-14	2	2	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3A873X9SFT5N	LaDawn Shocklee-Cox	I waited four months for this movie to come out on DVD because it was not shown anywhere remotely close to my city.  The wait was so well worth it.  Others have critizicized this movie for the acting, cinematography and a few other things, which is all well and good.  The point of any movie is what we walk away with as the end credits roll.  This film is AMAZING and it put so many things in perspective for me.  It is much more than a guy who declares his faith and gets everything he wants.  The movie demonstrates the AWESOME power of God when we commit to following Him.  It is a reaffirmation that we are to give our best to God everyday by doing our best in all that we do, including our relationships with others, no matter the outcome, good or bad.Of note, my children, ages 8 & 9, enjoyed the film, but didn't completely understand the deeper meaning, which is ok, because it gave my husband and I a chance to talk with the kids about the film.  This film is excellent for youth groups because they will be more likely to understand the message of the film.	5.0	"A ""Must Own"" Movie"	2007-02-05	16	13	3

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AC14HOLGCSX6X	L. Kendrick	How wonderful to see Hollywood actually portray Christianity in a positive light.  I've grown so tired of all the movies, beginning in the late 50's, that attack religion.  The reglious character are almost always portrayed as the crazy or bad guy, while the hero of the movie is often immoral, and a terrible role model.Granted, the acting wasn't the greatest.  But after awhile, I didn't mind.  The chacters seem to grow on you, and the acting does get better as it goes along.A few of the other reviewer's have said that there were some racist tones to the movie.  I did not feel or notice this at all as I watched the film.  I think they are trying to make something out of nothing.  I saw no racism.  I think that people of all races will enjoy this movie, and want to be better individuals because of it.SUMMARY:A great, and inspiring movie. Don't watch it expecting for big blockbuster speciall effects, oscar winning acting, or over the top action sequences. Watch it for it's heart and message, which is what it's purpose is.  You won't be dissapointed.Please support these film makers.  We've been begging Hollywood for family safe entertainment.  Hollywood listens to money and nothing else.  They are starting to make these family films, but if they don't make money on them, they won't make them.  Plain and simple.	5.0	Christianity FINALLY portrayed in a POSITIVE light!	2007-03-21	7	5	2

Trials are a normal part of life and learning to praise Him - win or lose - has truly become a household conversation for us. Even when applying for a job, not getting it and the dissappointment that comes with that.  The children remind me that we prayed about it and told God that we would praise Him either way and trust that His will for our lives will be done when we seek him first - and in everything.

I usually avoid football movies of any kind due to experiences with homicidal coaches in high school. But enough about me. I also skip movies that wear their evangelical mission like a big neon halo. Everything about ""Facing The Giants"" announces INSPIRATION AHEAD from across the room. The plot is manufactured for maximum uplift, the cast is spotty, and in places the dialogue sounds like a Sunday School bulletin. The ending lays it on so thick with miraculous ""coincidences"" that I was looking for Clarence the Angel to drop in with Jimmy Stewart so they could both get their wings.But, doggone it, I have to admit that something about this picture got to me, sentimental patsy that I am. Maybe it's exactly what I usually gag on that endeared it to me. Its go-for-broke, ""let's put on a show!"" veneer made me want to root for it. There are a couple of good performences, and it's a decent-looking film. It may not necessarily be you, but you know someone who would love this picture.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AGLO95OCA0ZDE	L. Schmitz	"I loved this movie.  I laughed, I cried, I related.  Until we put God first in our lives, we are just living but not receiving His many blessings.  If all we live for are material things we are missing out on the joy of our existence.The message to ""praise Him if we win and praise Him if we lose"" was an important element, that was wonderful!  However, once things turned around for the Coach, he, his wife, and his team got everything they desired.  I agree with the other reviewers that this is not how life normally works out.  Sure, God can work miracles, and He could make everything work out this way, but it is unlikely.  I wish we could have seen their strength and faith in the face of defeat.  And maybe not have wrapped it up so neatly with his wife getting pregnant at the end and him having another state championship trophy on his mantel.Sure, we as the audience desire ""everything to be worked out"" by the end, but this movie's purpose was to reach people and I think it somewhat has given people false hope that when they believe, all things will go the way they want it to, which is just not true.All this being said, I think it was a great movie that was entertaining, funny, relevant, commendable (lots and lots of volunteer acting going on here) and spiritually stimulating.  It is SOOOOOOO nice to watch a movie that is free of the violence, language, and sexual content of most movies at the boxoffice.  One I can actually sit down and enjoy with my family without being worried that something ""bad"" will come up.I appreciate what they did with this movie and it is one that I will purchase to watch again with my family."	4.0	Pure, wonderfully simple movie for a family--one to own!!	2007-07-09	2	2	0

God never promised us a rose garden.  He also never promised that our lives, our circumstances, our problems would change.  The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ - not money, cars, winning and pregnancy.This is a sad case of humanism being replaced for God.  In effect, non Christians who watch this film, and expect their lives to change and ""get all the goodies"" will be greatly disillusioned.  In fact this movie might be a tool for Satan, and I believe it is therefore a satanic film.It is sad such a pathetic humanistic excuse for satanic propaganda.  The writers, directors and actors should be aware that their false worldly portrayals are helping Satan not God.

I flipped channels  and could not find anything else interested. Finally I decided to give this movie a try. It grasps my attention quickly. I wanted to know what the main character Grant is going to do when he was going to lose his job? He cannot have children, his car is breaking down, his house has all kinds of problem and he does not have money to fix them. It seems he is facing so many giants in many areas. I can feel his pain and agony. He has been trying hard. He is as  head coach for 6 years, his team always loses and does not turn around. He is hitting a stone wall and cannot go any where.  Everything goes against him. The story resonates with mine. I feel in life we always face the similar situation: tried hard and prayed hard, still have a lot of disappointments. What do we do? The movies helps me put life in right perspective. It strengths my faith in God. It inspires me not focusing on results, but trust God fully and prepare my heart to receive His blessing.

""Facing the Giants"" is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen- period.  True, it's not based on a true story- but it is based on the truth of God's Word!  This movie is great for everyone who loves to see the underdog win (and who doesn't?).  But the important thing here is not just that the underdog wins- but how they win.Coach Grant Taylor has the unenviable job of turning around a losing football team at a Christian high school.  He also has a car that's about to fall apart, a house that smells for some reason, and he and his wife both have been longing to have a baby for a long while to no avail.  He also finds out that one of his star players has transferred to another school, as many seniors have been doing so they can have a better shot at college scholarships.And while he's dealing with all this going into the new football season, he overhears a secret board meeting where it's been decided that if he doesn't start winning, he's out of his position.Faced with all this, Coach Taylor is driven to the only place he can go- to his knees in prayer.  And he soon finds that the way to win is playing by God's standards.  When he commits himself and his team to play all for the glory of God- he finds out the truth that God honors those who honor Him!Outside of the ""Jesus"" movie and ""The Passion of the Christ"" and others that are specifically portraying Biblical events, this is one of the few movies I've seen that actually portrays a Christian who is NOT a hypocrite and actually lives what he says he believes.  And one of the few movies I've seen where the Coach reads from The Bible- Psalms 18:1-2 ""The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.""  (AWESOME!)And yes, straight up- this movie talks about Jesus Christ and the importance of having a personal relationship with Him.  It tells you how simple it is to do that by doing what Romans 10:13 says- ""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.""AND it doesn't come on like a heavy metal band screaming it in your face.  It comes on tempered with love and care in a more gentle manner.It is SO refreshing to see a movie about Christians who live out their faith and aren't hypocrites and who aren't bigots.  It's so awesome to see a movie where people can talk about how much they love Jesus and are actually inspiring and encouraging- not some weirdo freak.And it's incredible to think of how a Christian church in Georgia put together this movie with a budget of $100,000 and used volunteer actors from the church and area- with a nice cameo by the University of Georgia head football coach.  I know some people are going to argue it's not heavy-laden with the special effects and top actors- but it is heavy-laden with real heart and a real deep meaning- and that's what's most important to me.The theme of the movie and how the underdog football team started triumphing is also the theme of how the movie was made.  As I said at the start, it's all about Matthew 19:26 and an attitude of praising God in all circumstances.  ""When we win- we praise Him. When we lose- we praise Him.""  Give it your best and trust God with the rest.  That's not only true for football, but for life in general.  Don't be a wimp in the game of life- live life to the fullest as Jesus promised us in John 10:10.Don't be afraid- Face your giants!""With God, ALL things are possible""! (Matthew 19:26):-)"	5.0	AWESOME!-  With God all things are possible! :-)	2006-11-20	28	25	3

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) is the coach at Shiloh Christian Academy in Georgia.  Unfortunately, his life just isn't going right.  Not only does the team lose their most promising player at the start of the season, but they can't win a game.  His home life isn't any better.  His house is falling apart, his car only runs when it feels like, and he and his wife (Shannen Fields) can't get pregnant.Working late one night, he stumbles on a meeting of parents.  The group is trying to oust him.Ironically, this is the turning point in his life.  Crying out to God, he discovers what has been missing in his life.  Instead of trying to do things on his own strength, he turns everything over to God and vows to praise Him no matter what.  He shares his new outlook on life with his team, and the results are almost instantaneous.  How far with their new attitude take them?This is a sports movie.  That's all you really need to know about the plot.  I guessed at most everything and wasn't surprised when I was right.  The movie was made on a low budget with untrained actors.  As a result, some of the acting could have been better, especially the scenes between Grant and his wife.  Having said all that, I got pulled into the story and was crying at the end.My bigger complaint is the message it sends.  It seems to say, ""Turn your life over to God and everything will go your way.""  Yes, I get the fact that this is an inspiring movie.  But that is shallow theology and it really bothered me.Because the movie pulled me in, I was willing to overlook the poor acting.  But the theology really does bother me.  3.5 stars rounded down."	3.0	It's Not Whether You Win or Lose, It's Whether You Praise God	2007-03-15	21	8	13

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AEFBHW5IF06K	Mark McIntire	"I saw this film with my family during its original theatrical run.We would normally not bother with a sports film, but this is so much more. I heard a lot of the pre-release buzz on the radio and decided to check it out, and I'm glad I did. Our movie preferences vary widely, yet we all enjoyed this film.The characters in this film, like most of us, have some very real problems in their lives. It is a story about facing those problems rather than giving in to them, even when they seem insurmountable. The title turns out to be both literal, as the team meets the undefeated Giants on the field, and metaphorical. The story is both very emotional, and powerfully uplifting.Initially, I was struck by some pretty unpolished acting technique, but by the time the movie ended I found it hadn't really detracted from either the movie-going experience or film's message. I later found out this was because there were no professional actors involved. This film is all the more remarkable for this. I have always loved what can sometimes be done in film making on a remarkably low budget, particularly when the goal and end product don't include a campy ""B movie"" vibe.I have read reviews criticizing the overt Christian content, but the story is set in a private Christian school, so omitting it would make the story pretty unrealistic. I didn't find it overly ""preachy,"" and it certainly appeals even to those who aren't in the market for a ""Christian film,"" as it is a good film, period.I highly recommend both ""Facing the Giants,"" and the Kendrick brothers' follow-up effort, ""Fireproof,"" though the latter tackles much more mature issues and is probably not for younger family members."	4.0	Great Family Film	2011-08-29	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI	Matthew P. Cochrane	"I first heard about the film Facing the Giants from a good friend at church. My friend said he thoroughly enjoyed the movie about the lessons a high school football coach and his team learn during the struggles and triumphs of a season. Ever the optimist, I tucked the information away in the back of my head but thought the movie would be nothing more than a washed down presentation of the gospel and another lesson in mediocrity. I was wrong.When I finally got around to watching Facing the Giants I was pleasantly surprised by its open and explicit Christian message but was shocked by the quality of the acting, script and production. The story revolves around Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick), a football coach at a small Christian school in Georgia. The movie opens on the last game of the season with Taylor's Shiloh Eagles losing a close game, closing out another disappointing season. The story quickly fast forwards to beginning of the next fall's practice when Taylor learns that his star player has left the team to play for Shiloh's archrival.Things quickly go from bad to worse. Taylor's team opens the new season with three straight losses. A group of parents start lobbying for Taylor's replacement by one of his assistant coaches, Brady Owens (Tracy Goode). At home, Taylor faces another set of problems. Grant and his wife, Brooke (Shannen Fields), have been trying to have a child for years. A trip to the doctor reveals that Grant might be physiologically unable to fulfill this wish. Financial struggles for the Taylors are also present (something I'm sure a lot of families in ministry can relate to). Their one car is constantly breaking down and, in an especially poignant scene, Grant Taylor must ask for help to jumpstart his car after another close loss from one of the parents lobbying for his dismissal!Finally, amidst these trials, Grant realizes that he has turned his focus away from God. He renews his focus on God and replaces his ""winning is everything"" mantra with an emphasis on Biblical and character lessons (remember he coaches at a private school).As he begins to preach these lessons he begins winning the trust of his team back. With the renewed support of his team, Grant leads the Shiloh Eagles on a winning streak that earns the team a berth in the playoffs. Once there, they continue to win until they face the Richland Giants for the state championship. Through victory and defeat, Coach Taylor continues to emphasize to his players that they must praise God in all circumstances.Despite the film's surprising quality there are still several elements that could have used improving. First and foremost, the championship game was scripted as if the writers of the movie had absolutely no knowledge of the game of football. The opposing coach's strategy was so inexplicably bad it would have warranted an immediate job dismissal if it had taken place in real life. Nothing about the Giants' strategy in the championship game made any sense. Most frustrating of all, this could have been fixed with a few minor tweaks to the film's script.There were other minor problems with the movie, too, but none that I wouldn't have also easily forgiven in a big Hollywood release. Even Remember the Titans, the major Disney high school football release starring Denzel Washington a few years back, featured similar flaws in its scripted version of the championship game.Alex Kendrick did a great job writing, directing and starring in this feature-length film. Produced on an amazingly low budget, the film featured almost an entire cast and crew of volunteers. Kendrick, an associate pastor at Sherwood Baptist Church in Georgia, mentioned to his senior pastor one day that he would like to make movies in the future but quickly confessed that he knew that would not be possible at his current position. His senior pastor asked him, ""Why not?"" Sherwood Baptist Church quickly formed Sherwood Pictures and the rest is history. The congregation rallied around the cause by volunteering countless hours helping to film the picture and providing virtually all the acting roles -major and minor alike."	3.0	Decent Movie, Better Message	2009-06-04	2	1	1

This movie uses the game as a tool to bring the characters to a central point so they can help one another.  I like the movie because the focus is on characters, their lives, their faith, and moral courage.If you are uncomfortable with Christianity or Christian behavior (prayer and acts of service), you will not like this film.  I enjoyed it because every character was facing some sort of battle like biblical David facing Goliath (hence the title ""Facing the Giants"") and how, when the characters employed faith, hard work, and acceptance of God's will in life, they were able to overcome adversities and for most, there were miracles."	5.0	I don't like football, but I liked this movie!	2012-12-21	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2TPM6XC32QPW9	M.E.'s Family	"WOW!  This was a great movie!  Our family has basically turned away from TV and movies.  So it is awesome when a movie like Facing the Giants comes along, that is safe and enjoyable for the whole family.  Even so-called family movies, that feature kids as the primary characters, slip in profanity, scantly dressed females, and sexualized kids.  It is a sad testament to what our society has deteriorated to, where so many are immune to and allow foul language, ""soft"" porn, and promiscuity.  Facing the Giants does not have any of that!Facing the Giants is overtly and unapologetically about God.  When we set out to glorify God and focus on Him, good things will follow.  When we base our lives on worldly things, like winning football games, money, fame, addictions, etc,  we will fail.  Failure may not be today, tommorrow, or even next year, but when our foundation is not on God, failure is inevitable.  Look at the fallen actors, musicians, athletes, church leaders, etc who never or did not stay focused on God; they are just magnifications of our own lives.  As Facing the Giants and Casting Crowns' Voice of Truth, exemplify, when we listen to and focus on God (not on the world), we can succeed no matter how many times we have failed or how insignificant we may feel.  Our 4 1/2 year old can grasp these concepts and will tell you that Facing the Giants is her favorite movie.  Pointing out the similarity to the story of David and Goliath helped her understand that much more. Please don't misunderstand, this movie is not aimed at preschoolers or younger kids, but the messages are certainly within their capacities and totally relevant and applicable at any age. There are so many awesome teaching points in this movie for adults and children.For those that criticize the quality of acting, take a moment to watch the extra footage.  The actors are NOT professionals; they are everyday people who had a common goal to glorify God!  The coach's wife is the real wife of the coach the story is based on.  The movie was super low budget and, only by God's hand, made it big time.  To compare Facing the Giants to million dollar movies with over-paid actors, just doesn't make sense.  There is beauty in this movie, it is in the meanings and in the reality of everyday hopes, dreams, and dissappointments.  For those of you who have ever had trouble conceiving, had financial hardships, feared losing your job, didn't get along with your kids, struggled with your faith, etc, there is beauty in the messages. The greatest beauty portrayed is the hope that God offers all of us (who seek Him first) and the eternal life we can have with Him.Our family highly recommends this movie and it will be one to watch again and again.  We are now looking forward to ordering Kendrik's earlier movie, Flywheel."	5.0	Uplifting and family friendly!	2007-06-05	6	4	2

They weren't supposed to have a good season they weren't supposed to make it to the playoffs.  Coach Taylor was supposed to be out looking for a job. If you want to be inspired at what God can Do get this movie.  It is a football movie yes but its meaning is a whole lot more. The theme is that Attitude and God go Hand in hand.  In the scene before the Death crawl, Coach Taylor Says if your attitude is bad that means that your heart isn't right.

The acting is not awesome at the beginning, but as the movie goes on, it gets better and better.  Have a box a tissue near by if you are someone who gets teary-eyed easy.  This movie shows us scenes we are not used to seeing, so they are very emotional.  When the movie ended my husband turned it off and said, ""I loved that movie"".  He said he wants to buy it, and he never says that!  It would be a GREAT movie to give to someone who loves football or sports, and would maybe be ready to consider GOD in their life.

But anyone who is struggling or has struggled with their own Giants (and who hasn't?), could most definitely benefit from watching this movie.  The soundtrack is fantastic as well.  I can honestly say I've never been so inspired by a movie as I was by Facing the Giants.  It clearly delivers the message, ""with God all things are possible.""

The Chronicles of Narnia was good but this movie was awesome. I agree that the acting was not up to the professional level that you would expect to see in a movie, but the message behind the acting is what most people should have picked up on. I can relate to the coach in the movie. I have been through times in my life where everything was going down the drain and it took an enlightening event similar to this one to bring me back. This movie is definitely a must see for the Christian who is struggling in life with any kind of problem. It could also be a great witnessing tool for those who don't know Christ as their Savior. I intend to buy several copies now that it is out on DVD, to share with those who need an uplifting event in their life.	5.0	What can God never do? Fail	2007-02-04	9	6	3
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A15Q3UMYRVA2L1	MHoss	So I decided to give this movie a shot, seeing as how it was about football. I was not turned off by the fact that it had to do a lot with religion, that's fine, I don't care either way.Yet, from a movie aspect and football aspect this thing was horrible! Let me begin with the horrible acting job that these 'actors' did. The opposing coach was meant to be some aversive character, yet he was just a fat guy yelling obvious stuff and had a sucker in his mouth the whole time.The head coach of the team lacked a football personality, there was no big half-time speech ,there was just stupid rambling on the side. The guy in a wheel chair just seemed like he was overacting.The football scenes were awful, it was like these kids had never played before in the lives. Most of it was done so poorly and it wasn't even about football.This is nothing like Remember the Titans or Friday Night Lights. Those movies had characters that you could build around (Mike Winchell, Boobie Miles, etc) while this movie had Brock, who you couldn't tell if he was an athlete or a meat head.There was one part in the movie that had Brock do the death crawl, that was about the most exciting this thing got to, the football parts were bad, the acting was bad, the filming was bad, the plot was predictable.____________________________________________________As I read these reviews it is pretty much easy to see that there is a certain Christian group that gets on here and writes these awesome, misguided reviews to give this movie a better name. Then this group will go and give any review below 3 stars something that was not helpful...it is a little pathetic and actually makes this movie worse for me.	2.0	Poor movie all the way around.	2011-12-13	2	0	2

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A98HYSJHLWGF5	MICHAEL OBRIEN	"The many positive reviews have eloquently explained the strengths of this extraordinary film.  I thought I would respond to some of the negative reviewers who suggest that this film was not reflective of life, and that a film, to be realistic, must show prayers failing, things going wrong, etc., with faith persisting through the calamity.  However, that view has components which could be considered to be just as defeatist as the failure-prone mindset which the coach in this film confronted in his football players.  Matthew 17:20 states, ""If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you.""  If this verse be true, then the only variable affecting whether or not miracles happen is whether or not one actually does have confidence that they will come to pass.  This film depicted a determined individual with a profound and pure faith deciding that he and his team could move a mountain, and, surprise, surprise, they moved it.  While it is true that our faith may prove to be insufficient far more often than we prefer, it is also true that there are moments of true inspiration in which a confident determination does move mountains.  This is a movie about one of those times.  There is nothing unreal about it at all.  Exceptional, yes, unreal, not at all.  Further no one who considers that the above verse is true can dismiss this film as unreal.  This film depicts the way that it is supposed to be, the way that we are supposed to be, all the time.  Because it can be shown that many of us, maybe even most of us, are not that way anywhere near all the time is no reason at all to chide the makers of this film for asking us to reach out for that goal.  While it can be inspirational to see the human spirit persisting and remaining unchanged in the face of adversity, it is equally important if not more important to see people making it all the way, people reaching for the highest standard and attaining it.  Films like this help to make the world a better place by showing us that if our minds and hearts are in the right place, we can attain our greatest goals no matter how daunting they might seem."	5.0	A pure determination can accomplish anything	2011-04-28	1	1	0

THe movie brings so many aspects to truth like how we should behave when we are leaders, how we should try even though the goal line seems like an unreachable destination, believing even when you can't see the outcome. I wasn't going to watch this movie because football stories just aren't what I would call spiritual stories! The main character makes a fool out of me....it is a wonderful story.

"The Kendrick Brothers who brought us Flywheel delivers another film for the Lord, Facing the Giants.It's the story of a high school football coach who has to come toe-to-toe with some of life's ""giants"", but with and through the help of the Lord, he learns that winning isn't just on the field or that the trophy you and your staff hope to win can't be won overnight.  It also proves that fear and loss can be a motivator and that victory can be acheived off the field as well.The production team behind Facing the Giants is once again made up of church staff and volunteers from Sherwood Church in Georgia, lead by senior pastor Michael Catt, who also serves as one of the film's executive producers.Through the Lord and lots of prayers, there's nothing stopping the Shiloh Eagles (and many Christians worldwide) from facing their own giants!May the Kendrick Brothers and Sherwood Church continue success through their ministry to bring God's Word worldwide.Bless and keep them, Lord.

Everyone that has seen this film has not stopped talking about it.  its definably a must have.  so don't waste any more time and don't even think about listening to anyone who puts this film down, you will be inspired.  none Christians and Christians alike have all said it was a WONDERFUL experience.

Like almost all movies, some elements can be predictable, but I still find it entertaining even after watching it many times.  I especially appreciate this movie when I am feeling down or alone.  I teach leadership and coaching, and this movie has the best examples that I have seen; including a dramatic coaching scene of &#8220;the death crawl.&#8221;  It is solidly Christian (which is why it has the PG rating), but my friends from other faiths and those without faith still enjoyed this movie (which I think says a lot about it).	5.0	Meaningful and really enjoyable	2014-01-19	0	0	0

God has a plan for everything, it doesn't always end up this perfect, but things don't always get this bad. This movie is a statement of geniune faith,prayer, and seeking God's will.I was happy because the story of how this film was made ""by a guy with a dream to make a movie and his church"" and also the fact that it doesn't seem hokie or fake...I've lived in communities that really were just like this! Great way to capture it guys!I rented it....bought one for me and one for my family.Great movie, story, and statement of faith.Warning! The topic of Christianity is strong, not watered down or hidden or a referenced theme in the movie, very openly and intimately talked about. So, if you watch this in mixed company, be sure to let that be know first.This is a very intimate portait of a Southern Christian's life and struggle.Enjoy!!This also a great football movie!"	5.0	Authentic Christian Life, stuggles, and power of prayer	2007-05-16	2	1	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3K8AU6BAGN60E	"Ms. Parrothead ""Book Lover"""	"I am so thrilled with this movie. I have shown it to my 7th and 8th grade students, and they have loved it also. This movie shows the struggle that one man faces as he attempts to lead his football team to a winning season. I won't go into all the details, as other reviewers have done an excellent job doing so.  I will say that this is hands down one of the best movies I have seen, and I have personally NEVER heard anyone, youth or adult, say that he/she didn't like the movie. This film does an excellent job motivating Christians to rethink their attitudes and question whether or not they are ""doing their best"" to live out his/her faith. I'll be the first person to say that being a Christian will not make your life all roses. However, the movie does hit the bullseye with the message that by giving God the glory, all the time, and keeping faith in God will always result in God's perfect will taking place. With all of that said, my only complaint (and it is small) about the movie is the acting. Too often it seemed that the actors (mainly the wife) looked and acted as if she was performing in a high school play. Even that complaint was not enough to make me change my rating to 4 stars.  I still think this is a five star movie. This is truly one of the first movies that has had a Christian theme (not counting Chronicles of Narnia) that didn't just blow me away by how tacky and low budget it appeared. In summation, if I could give this movie ten stars I would....the message is just that good."	5.0	Wonderful Movie for Everyone	2007-05-31	6	5	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A11NGP2YMDI98X	MtnHiker	This is a fun flick that's also a tear-jerker (I've even known guys to cry during this movie--one of them a tough army colonel).  Some of the theology is a bit borderline/questionable, though overall it's quite good and personally challenging in regards to trusting, loving and praising God no matter the circumstances--and it's all about Him, not us.  My personal favorite point, though, was regarding man's perseverence in faithful and faith-filled prayer for over 6 years without ever seeing fruit (until the end, that is).  That's a good lesson for all of us, to persevere in our prayers for loved ones and for those around us.  Personally, it gives me much hope.  By far the best Christian-flick made in recent years.	5.0	Good show	2007-08-12	2	2	0

It's a great movie to watch with your friends who aren't really sure if they want to be Christian or not, as it's not overly religious.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for watching highly religious movies, but for someone who's new to it all, this is a great movie to introduce them.

You meet challenges, you face those challenges, you get on your knees humbly before Him, and God gets you through the challenge.  The movie was so moving that I cried as I identified with the coach's pain.  Then, I cheered as he was rewarded by God.  This movie was shot with a limited budget, and mostly local people as actors.  That's probably why it was so real in it's effect.  It had a well thought out story with plenty of scripture and application.  I want everyone I know to see this movie.	5.0	Best Christian Family Film Ever!	2007-05-12	3	3	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1129LM24YWSZV	"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw"""	"Facing the Giants is a movie about a high school football coach who inspires his players through his faith in God. While it would be easy to categorize this movie as just a religious flick, I think it's more than that.In the film, Coach Grant Taylor is having a rough time of it. His football team hasn't had a winning season in 6 years. There's a bad smell in his house. His car keeps breaking down. And he and his wife, Brooke, have been trying to conceive for 4 years, with no luck. Then, he discovers that parents of his own football players are trying to get him fired. And that HE'S the reason that he and Brooke can't conceive.Grant starts praying. And God answers, telling him to start with his football team and ""bloom where he's planted."" So Grant does. And things start happening. A new truck makes its way into Grant's life. He and his wife remove a dead animal under their house that's causing the smell. The team starts winning. Etcetera, etcetera.OK, now I know this sounds a little too pat. But it works. Why? Because the movie shows just how dramatic faith can be.Some caveats - While the actors playing Brooke and Grant Taylor are good, most of the rest of the cast clearly has little performing experience. The film could have benefitted ALOT from a more seasoned cast. Also, you can tell that the director is new to feature film. Some of the shots didn't work, particularly the scenes where Grant reads the Bible aloud (to himself) and prays aloud. I think that perhaps showing the words, having him praying to himself without hearing every word, etc., would have worked better here. Prayer is something very personal, and I realized while watching the movie that we rarely see depictions of people praying on film (other than the, ""Please God don't let him die,"" variety).Of course, there were some stilted moments as well. Another faculty member at the school comes to get him to show him what is happening on the football field. The faculty member launches into some rather lengthy explanations to bring both Grant and the audience ""up to speed."" I remember thinking, ""This is a movie. Don't keep trying to TELL us stuff. SHOW us. We're smart enough to figure it out.""All of that said, though, this is a very moving film. I really enjoyed it, and I think it demonstrates the power of faith in film. You CAN make a compelling, entertaining, dramatic, artistic movie about faith. Now, where are all of them, people?"	3.0	Uplifting and different	2008-02-05	1	1	0

The acting and sets are obviously that of a low-budget film but its still very enjoyable to watch.Word of caution: I was slightly concerned by the underlying theme in this movie that devoting your life to Christ will make everything in your life immediately turn out peachy keen - everything will turn out right according to God's plan, but this movie makes things turn out ""right"" in a materialistic human way.  I don't think the writers intended to mislead, but I would be hesitant to show it to an unbeliever, because accepting Christ does not make your life perfect in a way one might hope for.  When the main character in this movie re-devoted his life to Christ, his losing football team suddenly became champions, he was given a brand new truck to replace his old one, his wife suddenly became pregnant after years of trying, etc.  But they do give all the glory to God, which is nice!  :-)"	3.0	Happy to support Christian moviemakers...	2008-01-05	1	1	0

Furthermore, knowing something about the church that produced this movie (I have friends who are active members there), the folks in this movie are the real deal . . . just like you and me . . . which lends to their production an awesome, almost reality TV, sense - the actors live, personally, the message FTG portrays.  I highly recommend this DVD for every home library - watch it at least once a year (or more, if you are going through a struggle) and be inspired to trust God's providence in your own life.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A3EBJDZ5N1UEI5	Patricia	Our family (sons 18 and 15) watched this together, and to be truthful, I was disappointed. Not disappointed in the quality; it is adequate, even if the actors are all volunteers. Actually, I think they did a terrific job considering their lack of experience. It is certainly watchable. I have seen far, far away worse acting in huge budget movies. The plot is interesting, if not over worn. Even the fact that is was painfully predictable did not put me off- it is, after all, an 'underdog comes from behind' movie.To be fair, I would like to share what I liked about it.The photography is excellent, and the setting is believable for a small town in the south. Too, there's none of the teeth-gritting fake Southern accents film makers love to use just to make sure we know we're in the south. (Even my sons, who've lived outside the US as AF brats and visit family is SC every so often, commented that the accents sounded real)The characters are interesting. No one is very 'bad,' however the rival coach seems a bit cartoonish. There's no foul language and no sex. There is humor and kindness, and excellent role models for kids.The message is a good one: All things are possible with God.The less emphasized message is even better: Give God the praise, no matter the outcome of your prayers.This brings me to what bothered me about the film. This second, more important message was not illustrated. Prayers were answered beyond the characters' wildest dreams (in the most cliched manner possible, at that.)I know God works miracles, and Christ changes lives, however accepting His decisions, even when they are disappointing to us, is a situation we all face. Had the film shown this in at least about one situation, I believe it would have been a much stronger message and witness.And...more trivial, I know....I just can't get very worked up about winning a football game. Had the team lost, but left proud and confident because they did their very best and were thankful for the changes made in themselves and their lives, I would have felt much better about the message being given to my sons.Bottom line: A missed opportunity to show what is truly important.	3.0	A good message, but ultimately troubling.	2007-06-18	51	38	13

Usually, you equate faith-based productions with corny, poor-quality movie making that is preachy and lacks relevancy or diversity. however, I have found that quite the opposite is true with this production. It is spirited and leaves me wanting a closure relationship with God. It is a real outreach for Christianity and the way movie ministry should be done right.

He decided that whether or not his team wins, whether or not he keeps his job, whether or not he can have children, he will do his best in every endeavor in his life and glorify God regardless of the outcomes.His wife is played by a sweet and lovely actress who faces her own hardship as a woman who wants children and is having trouble conceiving.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	ABC8FXLD7W528	Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker	"We watched Facing the Giants when it was first released and I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it, so we watched it again just this past weekend for Family Night. It has a little something for everyone - football for the sports fan in your family, touching drama,  humor, and most importantly, a strong message. It shows dependence on God and the importance of standing together in marriage, even when the world around you is falling apart.Coach Grant Taylor is going through some trials in his life. The school for which he is a coach wants to let him go because his football team fails to chalk up any wins.  His car barely runs and there are some maintenance problems in his home.  There's the possible betrayal of a close friend. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that he and his wife are facing infertility problems.  It's during this difficult time in his life that Grant realizes how much he depends on the Lord.  Grant spends time in prayer and in the Word, and gives the entire situation to God.  God, in turn, uses the situation to change more than just Grant's life.Several minor characters in this film deliver a strong impact. One is a school employee who walks by each locker daily and prays each student. Another character, a football player's father, is a Godly role model for his son and for those watching the film. A couple of football players have a change of heart in the movie and one makes a decision that impacts his life for eternity.On the cover of the DVD, the words at the bottom state: ""Never Give Up; Never Back Down; Never Lose Faith."" This movie delivers a touching and realistic look into the lives of a man struggling with the difficulties in life.  It's a winner in more ways than one and I highly recommend it for your next family night.

Unfortunately, Facing the Giants was a major letdown in face of the hype.  I seriously believe that most people who love this movie only love it because of its Christian message.

When you learn how this movie came about (see if you can also find a copy of Flywheel, their first film), you'll come to realize just how God has worked through this film and Sherwood Baptist Church.  Obviously the Kendrick brothers, Tracy Goode and the gang have no doubt that with God all things are possible.

But for crying out loud, watching this movie will show you why the secular world doesn't take Christians seriously.  It was so full of cliche situations and responses it isn't funny.  The acting is absolutely HORRIBLE---why in the world did they use church members to populate the cast?  A little realism would be a much better testimony---things don't always work to perfection for believers in the real world.  The absolute low point of the movie is the shifting wind direction that allows the little guy to hit the state-championship-winning field goal (of course, coming after he prays to God for help in making the kick)---spare me, please.	1.0	Talk about cliche....	2007-02-21	74	19	55

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A37MHZV6MTXDTN	Rachael Zoe Buck	How often does  a movie  depict the dependence on God of a man and how The Lord cares for us  and directs our paths.  I thought the scene where the protagonist prays and seeks the Father's will was most Biblically accurate  of any I have seen depicting God as a loving Father who helps those who depend on Him.  I thought that using  the football game victory was a bit immature to show the display of God's power and love, but the other successes such as the son asking forgiveness from his father for being disrespectful was quite thought provoking.  Fireproof, produced by the same company was also a  great example of how God can help us especially if  we give him our all.  The incorporation of the extremely supportive parents and coworker made  this tremendous effort of a man to save his marriage, believable.  This movie may be instrumental in bolstering people's faith.

I saw it approximately one year ago at a family reunion. It so inspired me that I purchased a copy. This movie shows how issues in life will come and often times deal us a ""bad"" hand.Though a bad hand might be dealt,one must deal with the hand that has been dealt.Many scenarios happened in this movie which appeared hopeless, but ultimately resulted in committing situations to prayer and some accepted Christ as their Savior. Wow, the miraculous works of Christ were illustrated in this movie whereas hopelessness turned into hope, the impossible became possible,and blessings granted because of God's unmerited favor.

"When the football team from from Shiloh Christian Academy goes on the field to face the unbeatable Giants (the opposing team) the FIRST football player that confronts the Giants is named ""Joshua.""I love it. In Exodus, Joshua was Moses' successor and the one who eventually led their people into the Promised Land, despite the very scary reports of all those giants.There's another scene where a character is driving away in a shiny red truck and the license plate on the truck says, ""Jay Austin Motors"" which was the name of the used car lot in ""Flywheel.""It is details such as this - the little things - that make this movie such a treasure. And it's also the realism. Like ""Flywheel,"" the actors and actresses are real; they look real and sound real and their dialogue is also deliciously real. There are no words to express how delighted I am to see these Christian films getting their due. They're low-budget, but well produced and interesting. They're quiet (nothing explodes and there are no grisly murder scenes), yet they're completely engaging. And their message is compelling and memorable.And perhaps best of all, it shows men and women down on their knees, praying to God and giving their lives wholly to Her (or Him, depending on your perspective). Throughout the movie, I was touched - really and truly touched - by the portrayal of our deep human need and longing to feel God's presence in our life and give ourselves wholly to Her.And - on a more secular note - it's interesting to note that this movie was made on a $100,000 budget.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1Q5QC7RVFFM19	R. Ratcliffe	...then don't buy this DVD. BUT -- if you're like many families that are sick and tired of paying big dollars for PG-range movies only to be surprised by unnecessary vulgarity peppered with sexually charged themes that weren't revealed in the trailers, then this film is PERFECT for you! I cannot stress the following enough: This movie is not about football...it's not about oscar-winning acting...it's not even about cutting edge 'cinematography' or high-budget special effects; It's about a MESSAGE of surrender and laying down one's life for the Creator of all things so that He can do a great work in you. It's that very MESSAGE that caused me to pause and think about my own life's priorities. Long after the credits scroll across the screen, you'll be thinking about this movie. You'll see it dozens of times because its impact is so profound. That's REALLY what people are buzzing about from this film. Like other customers, I do value opposite points of view to balance my own. In this case, most of them I've read are not at all justified. I doubt anyone in Hollywood could storyboard a film for the entire budget that Sherwood Pictures had to film, edit, and produce this one. Skip dining out this week and purchase this DVD!

There are a lot of nuances that can be overlooked about this movie that actually add to its value in my opinion.  The fact that the team had had 6 losing seasons and in the seventh were triumphant (much like God creating the world in 6 days and resting on the 7th).  If they had relied and rested in God's hands and allowed His control before the 7th season they would have won sooner.  The small player who doesn't know if he can face the &#34;Giants&#34; name is David (David and Goliath).  There are many more but I will let you watch the movie and find them for yourself.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	AW7SR6A7UQ13Q	"SAG ""Scott"""	"There is no doubt in my mind that God can do all that He did in this movie. He lifted up a broken man. He met the needs of His servants. He answered multiple prayers. He lifted up a struggling football team and enabled them to accomplish the impossible. He gave an infertile couple children. Not only did He do these things in this movie, He does them in real life all the time. Thank God for a movie that reminds us of this and encourages us to serve Him no matter what.I did not give this movie four stars. For I wonder about the man or woman of faith who really do believe, have an unshakable faith, and are broken before God. But God, in His providence, does not seemingly move. They don't get the miracles that they are looking for and would give God glory for. They do not get a new truck. They do not receive a baby. They do not get seeming victory. What about them? Is their faith any less? Is God any less powerful?I worry that sometimes folks could get the wrong message from this kind of movie. Sometimes you serve God and you don't get wealth. You don't get health. You don't get seeming victory over the Giants. At least it doesn't happen in this life time. ""It was in faith that all thes persons died. They did not receive the things God had promised, but from a long way off they saw them and welcomed them, and admitted openly that they were foreigners and refugees on earth. Those who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of thier own. They did not keep thinking about the country they had left; if they had, they would have had the chance to return. Instead, it was a better country they longed for, the heavenly country. And so God is not ashamed for them to call him thier God, because he has prepared a city for them."" Hebrews 11:13-16Watch the movie and know that God is good.

If you're looking for a well made Christian-themed movie, this is a great selection.Some reviews note that the simplistic nature of the message (that if you devote your life to God, all things will work out) is disturbing and unsettling enough to detract from the overall quality of the movie.  I disagree with that.  Here's why:  this is a movie, it's not supposed to portray actual events...even though it might.  With and through God, ALL THINGS are possible...this movie just gave examples of the many positive changes and effects that could (but aren't guaranteed) to occur; ones that played out well theatrically.  In contrast to those reviews, I think the film made an effort to point out that devoting your life to God is not just something you can do on the surface or just for the blessings to be bestoyed.  Regardless, still a great film.If you liked this movie, you should also see ""Flywheel,"" ""Fireproof,"" and my favorite by far, ""Courageous."""	5.0	Great Movie, Great Message	2011-12-19	0	0	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2SYVX3Y00EE0M	"S. Denny ""Lobo2006"""	"I have to say I really enjoyed this movie.  I was pleased to see such indulging into the Word.  Did every showcased character propser in one way or another?  Yes.  Is that always the case with God? No.Did the movie have a fairy tale feel?  A little.  ""Can"" God provide a ""rain"" of blessings in your life?  He sure can!Some negative critics have beaten up this movie because they see a message of prosperity.  I personally have experienced God's ""rain"" and know it to be true.  I have also experienced God saying ""No"" and my having to accept it.  This movies touches on that in a few case but does not stick that point home.  It would be nice to have seen one of the ""issues"" not met by God and the person(s) involved demonstrate their loyalty to God despite the answer.Is this tiny concern enough to call this a Satanic Film? (One Reviewer actually called it a work of Satan) I think the answer is no.  You see...the Enemy wants to turn anything from God into something bad or negative.  The Enemy does not want God getting any air play, and when he does he wants to turn into something bad.As Born Again - Spirit Filled Christians, I think ""Giants"" is a wonderful work of God.  Amidst all the garbage out there in ""Moviewood"" this movie not only brings a ""God Theme"" to the table but addresses quoting of scripture, prayer, faith in God, lifting of hands, and many other aspects of Christian living that many other movies do not come close to.If I tell you to turn around right where you are sitting and find something blue, you will find it.  Why?  Because you are looking for it.  Same with this movie.  If you are looking for something to belly ache about you will find it.For you negative critics out there...get over yourself...it is not about you...it is about God.  A church and those in this movie have taken a step foward to spread the Word of God and do it a major scale.Before you write a negative review and cast the first stone...look at what you are doing about spreading and living God's Word.  Regardless of some minor technicalities you should be standing by your Christian Brothers and Sisters that have made this film.This is an excellent film with an excellent message!  Is the film perfect?  Nope and neither am I.  Can God work through this film?  He already has!!!Thank you."	4.0	"A message of what God ""can"" do."	2007-09-05	2	2	0
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1HJX6U6QG6XNE	S. D. Stuntz	"Let me start by saying that the creators of this movie had their hearts in the right place.  To write, direct, produce and circulate a full-length movie using only church volunteers and a budget of $100,0000 is a grand achievement in itself, and the folks at Sherwood should be proud of that.  And as a Christian, I do honestly admire their intentions.That said, in my opinion, this movie is lacking in just about every way.  First, the writing.  I understand that the Kendrick brothers wanted to be upfront about the religious themes and not shy away from the movie's message, but seriously, a little subtlety goes a long way.  The script seemed determined to beat us over the head with the message at least once per scene, for fear that we'd somehow miss it otherwise.  Also, there's very little actual development in the story.  For all their focus on the coach's life-saving spiritual awakening, the writers feel perfectly happy to sidestep it; the coach pretty much jumps from being depressed and unfaithful to being fully devoted to God in a few short scenes.  It's as though the directors were so eager to show the coach's new outlook that they didn't want to waste time showing us how he got there.  A shame, since a spiritual journey of that sort is fascinating and would have added some much-needed complexity to the screenplay.The rare attempts at humor just feel forced, particularly a dialogue about Charles Schultz that might have been funny had it been edited down to one or two lines (instead, it recycles the same joke for what feels like several minutes).  And the plot...well, if you've seen ANY sports movies (or any kind of inspirational movies, for that matter) this movie will hold no surprises for you whatsoever.Second, the acting.  I know the performers were all volunteers with little to no acting experience, so I wasn't expecting Brando.  But at the same time, it IS  a movie, and the performances matter.  For me to care about a character, he/she has to feel like a real character, rather than an actor performing a stale series of line readings.The reason I gave the movie two stars instead of one is that all in all, it actually looks pretty good.  The cinematography and film quality, while nothing creative, is professional and polished enough to never be distracting (which I understand is largely due to the paid services of a Hollywood cinematographer wisely brought in for the football scenes).But my biggest complaint, for a movie that so many are using as an evangelical tool, is the frighteningly shallow and limited version of Christianity it displays.  Before anyone starts flaming, yes, I know the film's message is all about how with God anything is possible, and that we should give Him our all whether or not things work out in the end.  And yes, I'm aware that these sentiments are shared by the characters every five seconds or so (with the aforementioned lack of a sense of subtlety).But it's one thing to have the characters SAY these things -- it's another to see them played out in the unfolding of the story, and the story of Facing the Giants is highly inconsistent with the message its characters claim to preach.  God doesn't magically ""solve"" all of our problems the second we turn ourselves over to Him.  Would it have hurt to show ONE of the coach's many struggles not being solved with a neat little bow and matching puppy?  If the Kendricks cared so much about trusting in God even when things go wrong, why didn't they offer a single picture of that?  Here, when ever anybody starts trusting in God, NOTHING goes wrong.  Sure, the team loses a game, and they praise God -- two seconds later, we learn that they didn't really lose the game, but that the ""evil"" opposing team cheated.One of the most powerful messages in the Bible is the idea that all things work together for the good of those who love Him.  God's ways are not ours.  Therefore, His blessings don't always come in ways we would expect.  What may seem at first to be hardships are often blessings in disguise.  It would have been wonderful and encouraging to show that the main couple's infertility could turn out to be a blessing in disguise; they could either glorified God by adopting a child in need (they hadn't been able to afford it earlier, but the coach did get a raise), or what about starting a foster home?  Instead, the couple's problems are neatly and abruptly solved by the wife miraculously getting pregnant, in a shallowly predictable turn of events bound to offend those who have actually had to struggle with lifelong infertility.  Come to think of it, that's the way most of the plot points in the film came off -- offensive to anyone who's ever suffered and not had their prayers answered exactly the way they wanted.  You know what movies like this say to them?  ""God didn't help you -- you must not have been praying or trusting in Him enough!""  Is that the message we want to send to fellow Christians in need of our encouragement?Overall, this ""little movie that could"" has its heart in the right place but just doesn't measure up, spiritually or technically.  If you want to see a better football movie, watch Remember the Titans -- just as predictable, but with a better, more complex script and much better acting.Also, I feel obligated to say that I'm sickened by some of the comments to the negative reviews here.  People who profess to be believers have criticized this movie for valid reasons, and consequently been told that they ""must not be true Christians"" or that they ""clearly need Jesus in their lives.""  Last I checked, the Bible forbids idolatry, and Facing the Giants is a fallible movie that does not deserve to be worshiped.  It saddens me that Christians nowadays must have their faith judged by their willingness to heap praise on any family-friendly movie with a Christian sticker."	2.0	Misses its own alleged point	2009-01-15	15	12	3

This preachy movie has the worst actors in a cliche of a film which would have been too long if they cut it by half.  I can think of nothing good to say about this movie, if you want religious inspiration, read your Bible, Torah or Koran.  My son wanted a football movie and we were stuck with this drivel.  It should carry a parental advisory so only the born again religious cheerleaders who filed the other reviews would rent or buy it.	1.0	ZERO STARS! Amazon won't let you rate less than 1.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A4NV43IV5OPA9	"S. Leckron ""An honest opinion"""	I was very disappointed in this movie. I have read the background of this movie that it was a small budget film put on by a church but that does not excuse bad theology and even poorer writing/acting.  Facing the Giants uses every incorrect (in my view) poor Christian cliche there is.  This movie falsely depicts that if you become a Christian all these good things will happen to you and all your problems go away.  That is just one of the many failings of this movie that I will not go into detail about.  But watch the movie if you'd like a good laugh and you'd like to see how a Christian movie should NOT be made.  I will say that it is family friendly and the football playing sequences weren't that bad.	1.0	Very disappointing and bad theology	2007-05-07	56	19	37

I just fell in love with the whole scenerio of football through God's eyes.I just had to buy it. This movie reminds me of how  we tend to forget that God is always in control of things around us. In our home, our jobs,and with people we come into contact with.The trials that this couple had to endure when they took their eyes off of God. Grant Taylor was seeing everything around him falling apart one after another. But no matter what his wife Brook stood by him with great support and undertanding she loved him, even though she couldn't bare children. This movie shows us how God can change things in our lives by walking with him in faith and trust.	5.0	Touching from the heart and soul.	2009-08-23	0	0	0

You won't find cursing, violence, sex or gore.  What you will find is strength, determination, humility, courage and inspiration.  One of the plethora of powerful scenes in particular that occurs during a football practice session with a player blindfolded touched me so that I will NEVER forget it and will ponder it often in my mind when I face difficulties or obstacles. I am buying this movie to add to my collection.  All believers and ""want to"" believers should see this movie.  God's Spirit penetrates this movie.  It's just beautiful.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A16QJ649N8PRV	S. Peek	This is an inspirational sports movie with a much bigger message.It is about a mediocre high school football team coached by Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick).  The Shiloh Eagles have not had a winning record in many years.  There is a movement to fire Coach Taylor.  Along with the job stresses, Taylor has many more.  He and his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) are struggling financially, their car barely runs, and they are unable to conceive.In the midst of all of his troubles, Taylor decides to surrender himself to God.  He decided that regardless of circumstances, good or bad, he will trust in God and submit to His will.  He ends up touching lots of lives and making a much bigger impact on and off the field.This is very well done.  It is a compelling story that will keep viewers entertained throughout.  In the process, they will likely have a lot of food for thought to ponder.I recommend this to anyone.	5.0	Fabulous	2009-04-12	1	1	0
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A233KADV4TPYPA	"Spot ""woemcat"""	"I rented this movie because my mother recommended it.  The movie's not bad.  It is refreshing to see a movie void of profanity and sex scenes.  When I went on the official website, I learned this movie was shot with an incredibly low budget by a church on a camcorder with volunteer actors, etc.  It rivals Hollywood produced movies.  The script's not too bad, even if it seems a bit cliche and has an after-school-special feel.  The messages that all things are possible with God and no matter what the outcome, give God the praise and glory are great messages.  However, the ending seems neat and tidy.  I would've liked to have seen the team still have a losing season (as far as scoring goes), but a winning season in attitude and God and self-confidence.  To me, that would have been a stronger message.  Life can be harsh both for those who follow God/a higher power and those who don't.  So, it would have been nice to see a team who ""lost"" the season but kept their heads held high.  At any rate, even with the gospel of prosperity type message it seems (to me) to portray somewhat, it's still worth watching.  Kudos to the church who made the movie.  I hope they produce more."	3.0	Not bad	2007-06-27	3	3	0

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2K2MYQGBKVKST	Stanford Gibson	Why does the evangelical community have such a hard time making a watchable film?  I think that it is because we (yeah I'm one of them) are confused about what art is.  Art is about beauty not propaganda.  It's about exploration not polemic.  It's about experiencing the creative act not about slipping the three sentence platitude that has come to be know as the gospel into a tired narrative.Facing the Giants piles clich&eacute; upon sentimentality interspersed with actual sermons.  All of the characters prospered beyond their wildest dreams and all of the sacrifice talk was en route to self promotion.  That is not the narrative I resonate with, nor the one in the Bible ubiquitous in the movie.  Football is at the same time appallingly trivial to build a story of God's glory around and just trivial enough that we are not supposed to mind them casting God as a character and writing a part for him.  I can only hope that these are early misfires for a community that I know has the capacity for beauty.  Perhaps our Flanary O'Conner or Walker Percy is just around the corner.	1.0	Art or Polemic?	2007-05-30	73	28	45

I'm sorry, but a movie can't coast on it's message and it's good intentions alone, and in almost every way that matters, ""Facing the Giants"" is mediocre at best.The acting was either wooden, laughably bad, or a combination of both, while the script seemed to forget that subtlety is sometimes the best policy.  The writer and director constantly pummel the audience with the message which, while respectable, would have also benefited from a more professional, subtler approach.  The only thing uplifting about the film was the end, when I could switch off the TV and move on.Simply by being a so-called ""religious"" flick, ""Facing the Giants"" will earn a large following of people who can not and will not hold it up to the same standards as any other form of entertainment.  I'm afraid that, in the end, I was left hoping for Mel Gibson's more professional approach to such an uplifting message."	1.0	Mediocre	2007-01-22	75	17	58

Despite being low budget (you can see the microphone strapped to the actor's back in one scene) and not the best acting, this movie is truly about the story and the message.  If they would have had 100 million dollars to make this movie it would not have been any better.  It was not about cinematography, special effects, or even football for that matter.  This movie was about God working in people's lives, and allowing Him to do so.  Christian or not, this movie will tug at your soul.	5.0	100 Million Dollar Movie	2006-12-15	24	21	3
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2I4A4WGWII18Z	Sunny Sewing Honeybee	"I looked forward to watching this movie, but was left with a feeling of disappointment. As other reviewers have alluded, it seems possible that the church that created it believes in the ""genie God"" mentality, where God gives people everything they want as long as they have enough faith. Ironically, one of Max Lucado's examples of a genie god in his book Traveling Light is one who grants you football favors.This type of theology leaves a bitter taste in the mouth of non-Christians and Christians who do not have perfect lives. It also causes many Christians to hide their problems so that they look ""blessed."" But God's version of blessed and our version of blessed are not the same. Do you know what happened to the man God considered ""blameless and upright"" in the Bible? If not, the book of Job is an interesting read. The Bible is full of examples of blessed believers who suffered on Earth (Jesus was one of them, Paul another). While I applaud the efforts of this church, sadly, Facing the Giants' theology is a fairy tale fumble with a modern day belief that all good things come to faithful Christians."	3.0	Theology and football don't mix	2007-03-30	8	4	4

After watching it with my daughter, she asked to borrow it for her boyfriend's two sons.  I think this movie should be shown in schools.  It's not just about football or any other sports.  It's about believing in God and learning how to believe and seek out the real, special person He made each of us to be.  Sure wish I had this when my sons were younger.  Because they never really had an earthly father for guidance, I did the best I knew how to do, with the good Lord's help, but I never found anything, book or video, that explained what life's truly about as well as this DVD.Give yourself time to truly absorb it and then watch it with your children and friends because there will be questions.  Please, please give your children time and listen closely to what their feelings are on the subject.  I believe that even though we work hard at raising our children to follow God's leading, it's very easy to get caught up in the cares of this world.  No matter how side-tracked they may get, there's always a way back.Let's try it His way; it's just not working out our way.  You think?Absolute best movie I've seen in a very long time.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2T72OGCGUQYBZ	TamiSue	"We watched this movie in our church last Sunday...although I did see the advertisements for it when it was first released, I have to admit it did not appeal to me--not because it was a Christian movie, but because it was about football.  I didn't even look forward to watching it when our church announced they would be showing it.  I am so glad I took the time to watch it!  This was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time: not because of the acting (the actors were volunteers, this was obvious) but because it was a clean, uplifting movie that didn't have any violence, sex, or swearing in it.  Yes, the movie was predictable, but aren't +95% of all movies?  What is that old saying,""it's not what's at the end of the road it's how you get there""?  This movie had our youth pumped up and on fire for God and the positive changes He can make in your life if only you allow Him to.  That right there is reason to give it five stars!  When teenagers get excited over a movie that doesn't have sex, drugs, violence etc. in it, that tells you a whole lot-more than any review in the world could do.  This film appeals to all ages: my six year old son loved it, the older folks in our church loved it (I am talking about senior citizens), parents, teenagers, etc., I just can't recommend it enough!And if I can address some of the comments about this movie being racist: WHAT!?  That is something that never crossed my mind while watching it.  Maybe those people that posted those reviews don't understand that many, many schools in America are not 'equally mixed' when it comes to representing all races.  There are so many schools in America that are predominately white, black, hispanic etc., it just depends where you live.  This was a state championship they were playing for--a small Christian (private) school against a much larger public school.  What got me was the Giants had 85 players on their team where the Eagles only had 31 or so.  The whole race thing never once crossed my mind, and it was never played up to be like that.  I wonder if the movie would have been based in a Northern state (such as New York for example) those same comments would have been made in the few reviews I am refering to.  Instead,it is easy to bash a movie made in the South as being racist and having a hidden agenda.  The movie was made up my many volunteers from the church that helped create it,they didn't have a huge budget to hire actors, they used the people in the church to make it.  Had it been a church with mostly black people in it most likely would have been the opposite...more black people than white people.  Either way, it was a great movie, and it is a shame someone had to drag the race card in on it.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1QG1C80A5ZWG7	"Tehila ""praise139"""	I just recently watched this film, though it's been in our house for awhile. I was pleasantly surprised with the straightforward and unabashed statement of faith it presented.The movie has surprisingly good production values that lag in only a few places (some sound editing problems, amateur acting (which is really excellent considering none of the actors have professional experience) and a few script holes) but it carries the viewer through to the end with its wholesome and hopeful message. I am no great fan of football, but found this movie a pleasure to watch.One of my favorite parts of the DVD is the additional features section, which include a behind-the-scene segment on the making of the film. I was surprised and inspired that such a great film could be produced by a group of people with vision and drive, not financial backing. It was inspiring and touching to hear the stories behind the film.To sum up, yes, this film has some technical issues, but these are far outshined by a message that is far superior to anything Hollywood is producing (which is usually offensive drivel) and is unabashedly family-friendly. I went to sleep gratified and thankful for our God, who makes the impossible possible.A great movie for a lending library.	4.0	Great family film	2008-10-30	0	0	0

It's refreshing to watch husband and wife interact with each other in a loving way. The encouragement and support that young, small David received from his father is an example that every dad could learn from. When we humble ourselves before God and trust Him no matter how many giants we face He reveals his great love for us and begins to work miracles in our lives. The football events are exciting to watch...and each message is vitally profound. This is just the type of movie that the whole family would enjoy.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A17YQ0KGJK010G	"Terry ""quartet-man"""	There is a tendency for Christian movies to be low budget, cheesy and far removed from current times. I am a Christian and a Church Music director, so I can say those things. :) Times have changed somewhat, but we have a way to go. However, this is one is top notch. Everything is well done and rivals the best of Hollywood stories like Karate Kid, Mr. Holland's Opus and other inspirational films, but without the language and other things they may have, but instead God. Although God is the center of their lives and a vital part of the film, do not confuse this with films that might beat you over the head with it. However, they do not deny Him either. My understanding is that this was put down by some in the business because there was too much Christianity in it, but remember, we are talking Hollywood. If they were getting inspiration from any other source than God, it would be fine with them. I would say it has about the right mix. You are reminded that God wants to be in everyday life with you, but it is not too preachy.In this film you see the team strive to give their best in every aspect of their lives, and see the rewards. You see how hard work and faith can make a big difference. One concern I have for this movie is that some might think that when they give it all to God, only good things will happen and their lives will be trouble free. This just isn't true. God doesn't promise us a life without pain or troubles, just that He is in control and that things will work out for good in the end. So, in other words, we will be battle scarred and maybe even lose some battles along the way, but in the end will prevail. This movie did show at least one setback that I recall which tested their faith and I did appreciate that. With that being said, many movies have tidy, wonderful endings and people are smart enough to realize that real life doesn't always work that way.I think here they were going for the feel good ending too which as far as storytelling is the way to go with a feel good movie. Had the ending been different it would have been like the Karate Kid or Rocky (I presume I never saw the Rocky films) not winning at the end.I do pray that people realize that even in a Christian's life there are wins and losses, and not expect God to be a genie or Santa Claus who hands out every thing they want. I think most people will hopefully not take the fact that the ending was a good day for the team and that it was in God's will that it be that way and not a guarantee that all days will be like that.Even with those concerns, I highly recommend it. I do not think you will be disappointed.	5.0	Now this is a great movie	2007-03-03	13	11	2
1424810248	Facing the Giants	A335YAUB8CMNUF	The Actor	"Overall, I was very impressed with this movie. I am glad to see that the ""Christian film"" genre is finally breaking out of the stereotype of being low budget and low quality.The story is generally very good (underdog stories and sports tend to go well together and tend to be favorites) that seems rather inspired by ""Remember the Titans."" It is definitely inspiring. The story and script were pretty impressive overall in spite of some flaws. It is fairly predictable in many places, especially towards the end, so don't expect too many surprises in the story. The story also tends to lack subtlety and complexity; it primarily sticks to the main plot without subplots or too many complicating factors, and some of the metaphors were rather transparent (such as the one at the very end of the movie, but I won't give it away). There were a lot of impressive things too though: for example, unlike many other Christian movies, their references to God, the Bible, etc. didn't seem forced or contrived. Often Christian films will try to impose the Christian message on a script that does not lend itself to that (""let's pause for the Gospel presentation"" type films), but this film avoids that pretty well. The story also remained engaging the whole time.I was generally impressed by the acting as well. In spite of many of them being inexperienced I thought they generally did a good job. There were a few places where their lack of experience showed, but overall I thought everyone did a good job, including many of the minor characters. I would definitely like to see a lot of them in stuff in the future.The cinematography was very impressive as well. Sound and picture quality were very good.This movie was definitely worth watching and I strongly recommend it."	4.0	Definitely worth watching	2007-07-24	2	1	1

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2GYGNQG45GW6Y	theberad	"Some may say this story has been done before. There is a long history of ""underdog finally triumphs"" films that show how, through hard work and determination a team can work together to accomplish unsurmountable odds and come out on top. These are ""feel-good"" films that bolster our beliefs in the human spirit and the man-vs-man/man-vs-self struggle that is, we hope, a metaphor for our own lives. If this is the template, then on the surface, Facing the Giants falls into the mold, but that mold is quickly broken with the following lines:Coach - ""What's the purpose of this team?""Player - ""To win football games?""Coach - ""What happens next?""Player - ""We win a trophy?""Coach - ""Then what?""Player - ""People talk about us?""Coach - ""For a while, then what?""Player - ""I don't know, we go to college, then coach little league?""The point is then driven home that football is too small of a thing to live for, which is most certainly true, but not in the minds of a teenager who perceives the future in seemingly infinite terms impacted dramatically by a winning football season. The victorious win is generally not too small of a thing for a moviegoer to experience at the end of a two-hour viewing, as evidenced by so many similar movies. The flaw in other kinds of ""triumph over odds"" movies is that, while they embolden the human spirit, it's a temporary victory. Also true is the fact that for every winning team, there is a losing team. While winning should be a goal, it should not be the be-all-end-all of goals. If this were the case, then what of the unmentioned losing teams whose hard work and determination are never mentioned? In order to receive the most impact out of our human endeavors, we should work for something much larger than ourselves, or our team.... something that transcends the mere outcome of a football game.It is this realization that life is bigger than us that packs such a powerful punch in ""Facing the Giants"" and is, perhaps, the reason why so many people are divided over its effectiveness. The human-centered philosophy of some critics are diametrically at odds with the idea that a team whose individuals worship God and place his glory above their own will see this movie as a ""goody-goody"" example of Christian propaganda which seemingly states that we will win if we trust in God.The victory in life, however (which is so poignantly demonstrated in Facing the Giants), is that when we stop living for ourselves and instead live our lives for something larger than ourselves, a sport, or even a team -- when we embrace the reality of a God that loves us and do everything we would normally do for His glory and not for our own, then we experience a win far greater than temporary fame... we experience and have the honor of participating in the eternal glory of God Almighty.Facing the Giants was not favored by the press at large, whose business it is to either lavish praise or denigrate the work of the individuals that craft films: giving full responsibility to its effectiveness to the vision of the producers, the ideas of the script writer, the interpretation of the director, and the portrayal of the actors. The idea that a theatrical film could be created by amateurs for the glory of something other than themselves is completely foreign to their careers nitpicking the technical nature of films. How else can you explain the contrasting panning by critics and praise by moviegoers?Make no mistake, ""Facing the Giants"" is not perfect, but it is an excellent moviegoing experience -- obviously crafted by men of God... the God who delights in the applause of the film's many audiences. Its message transcends an uplifting afternoon and fully achieves its desired effect: to profoundly impact lives."	5.0	A Victory Celebration	2007-01-24	43	40	3

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2H0YG7NEPG724	Thom Bean	The struggle to make things work for yourself and others can seem to be impossible.  The easy way is to give up and continue a mediocre life.  There are times that you need someone else to push you beyond the self-imposed limits you put on yourself.  Whether it is something internal or something external or a combination of internal drive/embarrassment and external pressure I find the one unifying force surrounding it all is God.  More specifically a loving God who is willing to drive me by various means to achieve well beyond what I believe is possible for me.  This is what this movie is about.  God pushing a team of people well beyond what anyone including the people felt possible, but first the distractions, the crutches, the dependencies, the things that they feel they need to succeed are removed which is very painful so that God is the only thing left to depend on and of course themselves.The reason I rate this high is I have seen this in my life in what I do.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A2EJQZJM4N7OTP	Tom Hobbes	Certain Christian churches and organizations in North America preach something often called the prosperity gospel. In a nutshell, this refers to the idea that God wants us to be rich, physically, emotionally and materially.It's a pretty controversial message, but also a very attractive one. After all, what could be better than marrying Christianity to the American dream?Facing the Giants presents the gospel of prosperity in a high school football movie. Before I get into the film's plot and its many heavy-handed messages, I should say that this DVD represents a pretty impressive feat. You see, this movie was produced by a southern-U.S. church. The director and leading man is a church pastor. Much of the cast is made up by volunteers from the church's congregation. They shot the film with just one camera on a shoe-string budget of $100,000, with a crew of volunteers and only a few film professionals. To date, they've grossed about $10 million.Like I said, pretty darn impressive. That information also provides the all-important context for this review, context which has presented me with a dilemma; do I apply a handicap and praise the film for what it does accomplish, or stack it up against the big budgets and seasoned talent of Hollywood's best? With the handicap, I could say some good things about Facing the Giants. Without it, I feel compelled to attack the film for weak acting, awkward scripting and an outlandish story that takes its own messages too far.Here's the plot. If you don't want any spoilers, skip down a couple of paragraphs. Shiloh Christian Academy's football team hasn't made the playoffs in six years. Head coach Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) is a down-trodden guy; his job is in jeopardy, he's poor, his car barely runs, and he and his wife, Brooke (Shannen Fields), have been trying for years to have a child with no success, because, we learn, poor Grant is impotent. Heavy stuff, right?Not to worry. By putting his faith in God, Grant accomplishes amazing things. He leads his entire football team to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior, which has the added benefit of turning them into a powerhouse team in less than a month. With the team winning games, Grant gets a big raise -- there goes the poverty concern. Obviously, his job is no longer at risk, because the parents who were scheming to have Grant fired do a full 180. One of them even anonymously buys him a brand-new Ford F-150, all decked out with leather interior. So no more worries about the rust bucket he's been driving. But wait, there's more. With God on his side, Grant leads his team to win the state championship against a far superior team. And if that's not enough prosperity, it turns out that maybe Grant isn't so infertile after all, because his loving wife becomes pregnant. By the end of the film, child number two is on the way.An important message that's stated several times in the film is 'we praise the Lord when we win, and we praise Him when we lose.' That's a great message for Christians, but unfortunately the story doesn't practice what's being preached. I don't have a problem with the team winning the state championship. That's expected. But when Brooke manages to become pregnant, I lose all respect for this film. I wanted to see coach Taylor and his wife praise God even in the midst of the heartbreak of having their hopes for a child crushed. The juxtaposition of that pain with the glorious success of Grant's football team and his coaching career would really have driven home the aforementioned message.Instead, Facing the Giants tells viewers that God will make everything perfect if you have faith, respect your parents, and not surf porn on the Internet. Sorry, did that last part come out of nowhere? It does in the film, too. In the middle of Grant's TSN-turning-point speech to his team, when he explains his new faith philosophy for football and everyday life, he says they should honour God on the football field, in the classroom and when they're at home surfing the Internet. Nice. And subtle, too.As a Christian, I would be hesitant to recommend this film to a non-believer, because I think it really sends the wrong message about God, faith and prosperity. I don't agree with the promises made in Facing the Giants, and I don't want impressionable people getting the wrong idea. But hey, it's a free country, and obviously I have no say in what people want to watch, and how they'll react.Now I've really digressed. I'll conclude with this: Facing the Giants is an impressive feat of filmmaking for such an amateur project, and regardless of my complaints about the quality of acting or the script, the truth is that this film is at least wholesome entertainment for all ages. For some people, that alone will make this film a must-watch.	2.0	Impressive project with a seriously misguiding message	2008-04-21	36	27	9

After a few years of losing seasons, Coach Taylor is informed that his job is on the line.  Concerned citizens don't think the school administration is moving quickly enough and begin implementing their own agenda to get rid of Taylor even sooner.  Taylor is also facing marital tensions with his wife, Brooke (Shannen Fields) because after several years of marriage they have yet to conceive a child.  Taylor is a strong man of faith, but he finds it difficult to remain firm when his entire world seems to be crushing down around him.  At the pit of despair he seeks guidance from God and is filled with peace.  Later he receives a message from an unexpected visitor that provides him with the encouragement he needs to rebuild the football program around a strong purpose.  What follows is a moving and dynamic story about facing one's fears and boldly living a life of faith.FACING THE GIANTS will probably be pigeonholed into two distinct sub-genres of movies:  a football movie and Christian movies.  In being a football movie, FACING THE GIANTS isn't all that different from other successful football films, such as REMEMBER THE TITANS or even THE LONGEST YARD.  Most successful football films revolve around a team that overcomes huge obstacles and diversity by merging together to form a unite fighting force and then go on to either win or at least make it to the big game and play well.  REMEMBER THE TITANS and THE LONGEST YARD are two examples of football films that work well.  FACING THE GIANTS might not be as good of a football flick as those two films, but it's not too bad either.  The game scenes seem much better, grounded, and realistic than many other football movies, such as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY for example.But like most football movies, FACING THE GIANTS also fits into another sub-genre, that being a Christian movie.  I have seen many, many Christian movies that were well intended and which seemed to have been created with deep passion and commitment, but almost all of them have been horrible.  Usually what happens in a Christian movie is that the movie's protagonist reaches a turning point in their life and decides to become a follower of Jesus.  Once that decision is made their lives dramatically change usually for the better, even if the world is in an apocalyptic state, e.g. LEFT BEHIND or THE OMEGA CODE.  FACING THE GIANTS is able to avoid the conversion scene because Coach Taylor is already a Christian.  However, though the conversion is avoided, the life-changing events that follow the conversion are not.  Coach Taylor's life dramatically changes in many, many positive ways.  This isn't to say all of the positive things that happen shouldn't happen.  However, even though the events are possible and are filmed realistically, so many good things happen all at one time that it makes some of the events seemed contrived.  I believe I understand why the filmmakers did this; they wanted to show how God rewards faithful people and helps us in our time of greatest need.  It's a great message, but the fact of the matter is that there are many, many faithful people in situations similar to Coach Taylor's that never have everything turn around.  That's not to say that it doesn't happen, because sometimes it does.FACING THE GIANTS is better than the majority of movies released each year.  It has a great positive and uplifting message.  It's also a well-produced film.  After having seen the film for the first time, I was surprised to learn that the film was almost entirely made by amateurs, mostly of members of Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.  It's incredibly difficult to produce a film with a mostly amateur cast and crew and most attempts aren't very good.  However, for an amateur cast and crew to create the quality of film that is FACING THE GIANTS is a major achievement.Overall, a well made football and faith movie that is completely family friendly.	4.0	Well Made Faith-Based Football Film.	2007-05-14	2	2	0

It was not only inspirational but entertaining and interesting as well. I first felt like a previous reviewer stated when he said that he did not think he would be interested in the movie due to the sports content. But when I saw it, I was so glad because it was a great movie with a strong message. I was also impressed with the quality of the movie that it did not seem like one of those cheesy christian films. I don't despise those beginnings for christian films(in fact I have a few in my library)for they used what they had in their hand at the time and it still ministered, but it's good to see improvement in the quality in regard to the acting, scripts and overall production without compromising the message. Just think, all this done by a church. It's simply incredible to me that they pulled this off. It just goes to show you that there are no limitations with God when it comes to getting His work done.

It was a small budget film made by two brothers on staff at a church in Georgia. The actors were not seasoned professional actors, and yet they pulled off believable performances. This faith based film is a wonderful family film every teen should see.  This high school football tale reveals life is about more than merely winning football games.

1424810248	Facing the Giants	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	"Alex Kendrick wrote, directed and starred in this story of a high school coach and his losing football team, the Shiloh Eagles, overcoming adversity to become state champions of Virginia - with God's help. A very strong script and a non-preachy tone overcome the deficits of a small budget, such as low production values and amateur actors. It's hard to believe that a Baptist church in Georgia produced this film, or that its associate pastor of media conceived, wrote, directed and starred in it, but they did - which goes to show that faith and a strong vision, as well as a good story, can overcome anything. Even though weak cinematography and music, as well as a cast of all volunteer actors, threaten to pull the film down, it not only manages to stay afloat, but bursts through all barriers to leave the audience emotionally satisfied in the end. Like the characters in Facing The Giants, the cast and crew end up believing that ""With God, all things are possible.""Two themes are intertwined: Coach Grant Taylor's inability to produce a winning football team, and his inability to produce a family. These two failures, as well as the everyday disappointments of life, devastate him and his wife. The scene when the couple break down in tears over the results they've been getting is one of the strongest in the film. But they don't get angry or bitter. Instead, Grant goes to God and lays his problems before Him. And God hears and answers. Grant teaches his football team that we honor God, not just when we win, but when we lose as well. He also works with the boys to honor their parents, as well as obey all of God's commands. He teaches them to always do their best, and leave the results to God. This change in attitude carries the boys to a new level of living, and the state championship.There is an interesting scene, right before the state playoffs, in which Mark Richt, head coach for the University of Georgia, makes a cameo appearance to wish Coach Taylor well, having apparently been his former coach. Visually, Richt contrasts sharply with the rest of the film because he is poised, polished and professional, as well as very charismatic and photogenic. He causes one to wonder what the rest of the film would have been like had the producers had the budget and knowledge to hire a more professional cast and crew - say along the lines of Remember The Titans. Perhaps instead of Facing The Giants being a phenomenal little film, it could have been a great film. One can only wonder. But maybe it is all that it was supposed to be: inspiration for now, and inspiration for greater things to come.Waitsel Smith"	4.0	LOW PRODUCTION VALUES DON'T HURT STRONG SCRIPT - TOO MUCH	2007-01-31	11	5	6

Unfortunately, all the 5* reviews seemed to be voting whether God is good or not, not whether the movie was well done.  If I were voting for God or giving my life to Christ, I would vote 5* too.  But, I was very disappointed in the slow, low quality movie I got after I paid.  The movie was definitely substandard as far as quality.  The message may have been good at the end, but I didn't get this far.  I wanted to review so others, looking for a good movie, wouldn't spend their money.  I feel like a church congregation got on and voted this up, hoping to spread the gospel message.

You'll probably will want to physically harm whoever is making you watch it.Facing the Giants teaches you that faith is more important than skill when it comes to playing football, amoung other things in the students' lives.  I found myself not caring about the characters nor the team as a whole.  The coach bothered me because I don't think he ever got the memo about no preaching in public schools.Oh, and one last thing.  The ending is no surprise at all when you know that the main football player is a little guy named David and he has to go against the Giants. Hmm...
