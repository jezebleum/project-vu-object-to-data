B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A13G33EI52T6LN	Aaron	&quot;I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than to enter heaven without you.&quot;Enough said. I criticize this film for the many times that it seems to focus on technical wows and high wire antics, often at the expense of potentially great drama.  Chow Yun Fat's words in his final scene all make up for it though.  This would be a truly great movie with less hidden wires and more Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together.The only thing that bothers me about the DVD is that you have to watch the same scenes over and over before accesing the menu.	3.0	A movie that has everything	2001-11-01	1	0	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A32JKNQ6BABMQ2	"abe ""starman"""	ive seen this movie three times.the 1st time it was spoken in chinese with no words at the bottom.the 2nd was the same deal but with the english translation at the bottom.the 3rd was in normal english.thank god!in it,a thief steals a relic and some people go to get it back.it has breathtaking backgrounds like lord of the rings.beatiful music like amadeus and martial arts effects like a pre-matrix but similar.the kids could watch it.theres only one bad part.it is definately a artsy and classy type film.ang lee is the director.he also did the hulk.the hulk is better.it is not emotional per say but more inspirational.there are some chicks  but they are not portrayed in a sexual way.one guy,in the less than apropriate part gets his hand down ones pants.i dont care what anyone says,if you get this in english,it is one of the best movies youll ever see.the special effects are cool.the fighting is outstanding!	4.0	good and classy	2004-07-12	4	1	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A4MQ75RMLWTS4	A. Bouardi	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon along with The Matrix are the two best movies of the last 5 years.  Both have amazing depth in terms of dialogue, humanity, and important human experiences and desires and both have some of the most spectacular fighting sequences and technology used.  I keep seeing so many claims that Crouching Tiger is not a martial arts film and that it is a drama.  Well, I don't know about those people...but the martial arts were very very integral to this story in my book.  I do go to scenes 20 and 21 just to watch them, after all!  After the years invested in watching men fight, it was nice to see a few women involved.  I very much enjoyed the few lines sprinkled in by the bad guy (girl), Jade Fox about how she couldn't get training...and the line about &quot;Poison...poison is an 8 yr old girl full of deceit&quot;...even though we can't relate with these characters fully, we get to peek into their life experiences...and all the acting was just amazing.  I like how even when some characters are briefly on the screen, they are not cardboard papercut people.  The fighting scenes are right up there with Fist of Legend and Supercop.  For those who loved the fighting...The Matrix has nothing on the two aforementioned films.  Go see them all!	5.0	Best movie of the last 5 years!	2001-06-11	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3DGB4HN3QCGAL	A. Burchfield	I've seen some of those Hong Kong/Taiwan action movies (bits of them anyway) and generally have not been impressed. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was made in homage to them and does so with class. I thought that it was much better than most of those films and might even be better than most of the so called realistic movies done in this country. I found very little to complain about. The wire act bits were usually very well done, a few scenes did have a little too much bounce in the movements, I thought they were amazing. The plot mostly made sense to me although Zhang Ziyi's flashback segment seemed oddly placed (maybe I was tired when I saw it)but good otherwise. The end scene where Jen (Zhang Ziyi) jumps from the bridge was the low point in the movie for me, was that supposed to be a suicide or what?	4.0	Best movie ever?, No, but still pretty good	2001-08-15	2	0	2

The fighting and also the cultural perspective!  this is a great movie if you into the martial arts or even interested in chinese culture!  I recommend it to anyone who fit those criteria!  It was a little hard for me to like the movie when I first saw it, but after the second time watching it through I was able to understand more of the storyline and I have enjoyed it ever since then!	4.0	Great Great Great	2001-09-27	4	1	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1JAJGQN61P941	Adam C. Scarbrough	"This is one of the best foreign films you will ever see! Unless your idea of a great foreign film is a five minute French short where nothing makes any sense and has a crying clown every thirty seconds. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is an epic tale of revenge, love, and a four hundred year old sword that is known throughout the land. Amazing fights, a simple yet wonderfully written story, and beautiful landscapes keep you loving every minute.Let's be honest, you watch this movie for the fast-paced high- flying ass whoopin's, right? This movie has one of the best one on one hand to hand fight scenes and one of the best sword fight scenes ever, and did I mention they are both between two women! That's what I said, WOMEN!! Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are both beautiful and deadly. Every time I watch this movie I am in awe of their skill and performance. Then throw in Chow Yun Fat masterfully wielding the ""green destiny sword"" and the amazement keeps on coming. F.Y.I. Jet Li was originally cast for the role of Li Mu Bai but turned it down to do ""The One"". I don't think even the master Jet Li could have done a more enlightening performance than Yun Fat pulled off. See it to believe it!The DVD quality is perfect with great special effects and sound even if you watch it dubbed in English. Probably the best dubbing I have ever heard, except when the Beijing officer stands ready to brawl and yells, ""I doubt that very much!"" in response to a death threat. I laugh every time.If you haven't seen it, watch it! If you don't own it, buy it!"	5.0	Simply put - AWESOME!!	2004-07-22	4	3	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3O2JYO7QZ4CD3	Adam Goldberg	In addition to the unforgetable film, which most planning to buy have probably seen, the dvd comes with several extras.  The commentary feature is nice but I think the real selling point in terms of extras is the behind the scenes footage.  You get an extra containing special effect creation and one featuring Ang Lee and the major stars.  The final, meaningful extra is an interview with Michelle Yeow.  She is such a gem that watching this will make you want to rush out and see supercop and wing chun, her other main movies.  I think this movie was the best of last year and the dvd is a fine addition to your collection.  The story is great but the ballet like action will keep you watching time after time.	5.0	A Wise Purchase Grasshopper	2001-06-15	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AAYW1H4SMNOI	"AFP ""AFP"""	What were the makers of this film smoking when they made this, this is just another kung-fu style fighting movie , nothing is different from this film and the ones I watched 10 years ago,except this has a dumb story. The only thing is the people can fly higher. Who can't make a movie like this. Make people fly and fight each other and lets say they have to find some jewls, there you got yourself another award winner. How can anyone like this. If I wanted to watch people fly i'd watch Peter Pan!	1.0	Worst movie ever made next to plan 9 from outer space!	2001-07-27	40	10	30

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AT6O2RC4GX1WR	"""ahd01"""	I couldn't tell from Taiwanese Chinese to mainland Chinese but this is a pretty cool movie with excellent fighting sequences.  The flying parts are a bit far-fetched but that is why this is a movie.  The drama parts can be shortened but I guess Ang Lee wanted to make this more than just a martial art flick.  Not too many of my friends understood the ending, I only accepted it as the way of ... Chinese Bushido.All in all, it's a good movie, despite of the hype.  I get the DVD so I can understand the dialogues, subtitles just made me missed lots of scenes.	4.0	Great movie!!	2001-04-25	1	0	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1DTCJV6KOMJOA	A*	I truly love movies i mean on a level where most peolpe seem to just appreciate the story as it appears I constantly find myself defining and picking apart every nuance on the screen to see if the film is truly magic and it has been a truly long time since a film Like this one has captured my respect. Crotching Tiger... stands as one of those filmes with an epic story and a beautifully written script. The dialogue is so marvelous that if you watch it dubbed it actually affects the emotions u feel as a viewer!! But what truly puts this film above everything else that has been placed on the screen in the last 20 years-yeah I said 20!(few exceptions granted). Is the message and the world upon which you are placed. Crouching tiger allows women to soar, fight, feel and still remain women. The female characters are not butched up and made into hulking animals and that's the beauty of this film. Its like Brontye with fight scenes!! And for all the punches and sword slashing the film never once masks the beauty of the martial arts allowing the fights to take place in an almost dream like settting. This film is magic and stands in my dvd collection along side such amazing films as Rebecca, The Third Man, The Spiral Staircase and numerous other perfect masterpieces!	5.0	A RETURN TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF MOVIES!	2001-06-07	4	3	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A24YME33WJ71LY	AJ Starling	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stands tall as one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I first saw it in the theater, where it was in Mandarin with English subtitles.  It was a very moving film, and I think that is why even with the DVD in my collection I still prefer to see it that way.Everything about this movie is absolutely second to none.  All of the actors performances are outstanding.  The story is romantic, heartbreaking, and adventurous.  The backdrop is breathtaking.  The music is hauntingly beautiful.Others have written full length reviews providing a detailed map of this movie so I will not bore the reader with that information.  Instead, I will say that this movie had me glued to the screen the first time I saw it and I have seen it several times since purchasing the DVD.  Although many scenes involve superhuman feats and lots of great martial arts work, the movie's strength is in its story and it was a success because of the great work of all the actors and production crew.I was disappointed that this picture did not win the Best Picture Oscar because I really felt that it was the best movie I saw that year and one of the best I've ever seen.  I think perhaps it failed to win only due to being a foreign language film.  Now you can enjoy the picture without that minor hinderance, should you choose to.If DVD extras are you're only reason for wanting this film, you will likely be disappointed.  If you're looking for a good film to add to your collection, this would be a good addition.	5.0	Should have won the Best Picture Oscar	2003-04-05	11	9	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1A4DEENGHK51T	Alan Attebery	I almost never saw this movie. Growing up, my dad had a fascination with those really awlful martial arts film. Between the bad voiceovers, the horrible dialogue, and the laughable fight scenes, I swore that I would never watch another one again.However, as this movie began to garner more and more praise in the United States, I began to pay more and more attention to the previews I was seeing in the theaters. Finally, I went to see it.And I am very glad I did.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon raised the bar on martial arts films. The choreography was absolutely stunning and fluid. The special effects were awesome. And the acting, dialogue, and poetic feel of the movie was second to none.I have seen this movie several times now, and each time I develop a better appreciation for it. It took a couple of viewings to be able to take in both the English subtitles and the action on the screen without getting lost. But it was well worth the effort.Indulge yourself with this movie. It is well worth the calories it will give you. :)	5.0	And The Oscar Goes To...	2002-06-07	5	4	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3R2H8ZBI75R5C	Albert	This film is fantastic.  Well worth a look.  The fight scenes are shot in a way I have never seen in any other film.  Matrix offered a new notion of cable work, and in some of the fight scenes you could see the actors grabbing invisible cables whilst doing spins in the air.  The fight scenes in this film are far, far better, obviously there are cables involved, yet the actors make it look so smooth and flowing you could almost believe they can actually fly.  The story line is really good, when I heard it was a love story I prepared for a sleep until the fights started.  The story is gripping and delivered in a way that keeps you interested all the way through the film.  I wish I had watched this on the big screen, I feel I have missed out on the amazing settings this film was made in.  The colours are sharp and clear and the dubbing is practically invisible, just remember to switch on English in the audio settings before you start the film.  Ignore the bad comment on this list, buy this film now.  You won't regret it!	5.0	Awsome!	2001-07-03	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1LBMDHBZJGJ44	Alberto Diaz	I liked this movie, a lot, finally, this is a very artistic and different film, this film, it has great special effects, amazing martial arts, plus the thing the thing that makes it great, a good story, with great performances, customs, and the nicest soundtrack. The story is beautiful, the characters are believable, the actors did great, as well as the director and I did not mind that much that people could fly with out a proper explanation. It actually gives it a nice touch, specially in the fight in the forest. What really surprised me the most was Zhang Ziyi who played Jen, she was great, not to mention beautiful, she was a perfect character, believable and alluring, plus mysterious, funny, everything you could want from a character. This plus everything else makes this movie a great experience, I don't mind that it is in Mandarin, actually I liked that, makes it unique. The DVD is fairly good, some featurretes, trailers, music videos, comments, the least you expect from a regular edition. The sound and picture are good. Plus, this beautiful love story, which is weird since most of the times I can't find good love stories, is strong, real and beautiful, with a strong and sad but fulfilling ending, at least to me. But see for yourself, if you don't know what to see, and want a good love story plus action with great special effects, don't search Titanic(BAD), search for Crouching Tigger, Hidden Dragon(GREAT) You won't be disappointed.	5.0	NICE OUT OF THE ORDINARY FILM, A GREAT MOVIE	2001-12-19	2	2	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ALNGHUSR812T7	"""alexdiaz"""	If you watch only the trailers relating, and decide that this is not the movie for you, then you are depriving yourself of one of the better and recent releases that has come out of the orient. There is a good balance of drama, comedy, and yes some stylistic martial arts but always subdued and complementing the plot lines involving the main characters. These are characters that have flaws and desires to be sure, but making them human and with depth. In other words, you will care what will happen next. Even the immidiate supporting cast show enough of their feelings that allows you to enjoy several, not one plot line. This is not a run of the mill Kung Fu in the Chop Souy expess line that you tune on cable TV during an insomnia spell. Also, you would problably enjoy the soundtrack as well.	4.0	Love Story, and Tragedy then Martial Arts	2002-03-02	1	1	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A33AFRVRA02BAK	alexliamw	This film paints such a vivid spectrum of colour, such a wonderful storyline and has such a beautiful, in-tune script, that it was the only film at the Oscars truly fitting the word 'picture' and therefore it is certainly the film to deserve the award of 'Best Picture'.Blending traditional Chinese martial arts, an intricate storyline, romance, character connection and the features that make what many call an 'artsy' film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is much much more than just a martial arts movie.For a martial arts movie its compassion is something unreached, its beauty is unmatched and its depth is unheard of. For never before has a film appealed to the masses in such a way, to those wanting simple pow-pow martial arts and those looking for philosophical, inner depth.And for those who love both it is a dream. The storyline is action-packed, the cinematics are untouchable.For someone not to have seen this film is pretty amazing. But they have to. It's wonderful.	5.0	Beautiful, A Masterpiece.	2001-04-20	26	23	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AZK0NMSPKGNJO	Allen D Sabio	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is simply a masterpiece. A brilliant film with great performances by its stars, Michelle Yeoh, Chow yun fat, and especially Zhang Ziyi. Director Ang Lee along with his choreographer tell this epic story in a stunning and creative visual way that makes this film one of the greatest ever made. The action scenes in this film are jaw dropping, and are unmatched by any action film ever made. Along with the action, is a great story and great characters that reflect influences from Lord of the Rings, and parallel the Jedi of the Star Wars trilogy, but remain consistent with the eastern culture and philosophy which permeates throughout the story. In fact, the main characters, especially Jen, portrayed by the talented Zhang Ziyi , seem to question that philosophy and culture throughout the film, almost rebelling against it. This is foreshadowed in the beginning of the film when Yun-fat's character describes how his meditation leads him to a place of sorrow instead of enlightenment. In a later scene, Yeoh 's character questions the buddhist teaching of Fat's character in relation to their suppressed love, pointing out the touch of her hand is real,not an illusion, even though it is of this world. However it is also the discipline of this eastern spirituality that gives these knights their power. the main character Jen, abuses this power, along with the power given to her when she posesses the Green Destiny, a magical and powerful sword, owned by the wizard -like, or jedi- like, character portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat. The Green Destiny, much like the ring of power in lord of the rings, or the force in Star Wars, becomes a power that threatens to consume Jen. Throughout the film , Jen rebels against the traditions of the easten culture and philosophy. Even during the action scenes, as Chow Yun-Fat's character scolds her, she responds by telling him to stop talking like a monk and fight. Her rebellion is also reflected in her love for a barbarian that lives in the desert. Jen's rebellion is an extreme one, however,  that leads to such deep despair, that it leaves the viewer to question if even the true love she found in the desert can save her.  This movie has everything one wants in an epic, great story, acting, cinematography, directing, score. This film should win an Oscar for Best Picture... Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is truly a great film.	5.0	A Masterpiece	2001-02-12	294	259	35

The flying was unrealstic.Sure! i know it's an Wuxia film, and it's suppose to have flying in them. but the part with the standing-on-bamboo stuff is just too much. other than that, everythings pretty much okay. The musics cool, the filming(in terms of art and photography) is pretty good too. but still...not my favorite action movie. Personnally, i prefer Jet Li's action movies. like the&quot;Once upon a time in china&quot; series. And plus, Jet Li fights alot better than Chow.  (sorry)	3.0	Very unrealistic.	2001-11-14	9	1	8
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	APD2VE5UTWG1P	"Alter Ego ""alter ego"""	I've come to the conclusion that there are really two films by this name; the one critics ooh and aah over, and the one I paid to see. What I saw was the most overhyped and pretentious film in decades, a thowback to the women's liberation films of '70's Hollywood, dressed up as an action thriller. Yes, the fights scenes are artistically done, with characters defying physics (and logic) to soar over rooftops. But the director is so devoted to his story of women's roles in old China that he treats the plot as an afterthought; a crutch to lean on when he has to explain why the characters are involved with each other. And Chow turns in some painfully wooden scenes, perhaps to counterbalance the scenery-chewing of other actors. I have to wonder if this film received it's critical praise primarily because it is the first wuxia (martial arts fantasy) to hit U.S. theatres with a well known star, attracting the attention of critics (and a public) who were dazzled more by sights they'd never seen before, than by the actual quality of the movie.	2.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Plot	2002-09-12	25	9	16

I won't go into the quality of the film. You can read this from someone else. But I will tell you something about my release, hoping that it's similar to the US one. British voiced dubbing! It's fun. You can also watch this one in Mandarin &amp; Cantonese. All three languages also have sub-titles. Extra features aren't that impressive, so maybe the US one'll be more full-featured in this regard. I have to say that on my 27&quot; TV it's a little depressing though. The majesty of the picture just doesn't come across on my little box.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A30YD1DF7OR61O	"Amazon Customer ""achumillennium2001"""	One of the best movies of 2001, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has great scenery and martial arts. The flying is spectacular, the romance is exciting, and the movie has a feminine, not masculine attitude. One example is the scene when Jen Yu fights a huge group of men in a restaurant with the Green Destiny sword. However, the movie isn't really that great. The design of the film. Instead of listening the characters speak English, you have to read the subtitles and keep your eyes open. That takes out the excitement of the film. The plot and storyline was terrible. It could have been more exciting if Chow-Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi used these sword skills against a Ninja clan rather than a professional witch like Jade Fox.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1E32S6Q9KI1VP	"Amazon Customer ""adamnz"""	First the good points... the martial art action scenes were impressive, and the romance had a kind of bittersweet edge not found in many Hollywood movies.But in overall terms I have to agree with those who say it was overrated - I am really not sure why this film won several Academy awards.To me, if you're going to dispense with reality (all that inexplicable flying left me wondering if Chow Yun Fat was floating amongst cannibis rather than bamboo), you might as well go all the way and produce something as visually spectacular (though nonsensical) as A Man Called Hero.  But this film fully achieves neither the fantastical nor the believable; as mystical fantasies go it is half-pie, while preventing the saving grace of suspension of disbelief.  The Matrix at least gave a semi-plausible reason for its characters' ability to fly.If you are into Wu Xia films this may be for you, but the fact this film was not particularly popular in asian countries confirms for me that it was not anything particularly special.	2.0	Top for its genre, but otherwise, stick with The Matrix	2002-05-09	15	5	10

The story is a fulfilling tale, that most everyone can relate to,  of chafing against the societal boundaries that hold one back and rebelling in order to break out of them. and also at the same time a story of those same boundaries.  The gender inequality of traditional far eastern societies is highlighted, in that the person chafing agains the bonds imposed on her is a well-to-do daughter of a local official who must marry the man her father has chosen for her.

I was truly entertained by this film.  I've seen many other chinese movies with the flying people running along rooftops and trees, and I've seen tons of kung-fu flicks with romantic story lines, but this one just seemed to hit it off beautifully on a grand scale.  I was surprised to see Chow Yun Fat in a martial arts role, I'd previously only seen him in dramas or action films where he's always toting around firearms.  His fighting scenes were brief, but it was nice to see him playing something different.  The fighting scenes of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi were so much fun to watch, they definitely stole the show!  The dual love stories circling the path of the Green Destiny make it all the more interesting to watch.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3BI7CZFW7N1FD	Amazon Customer	"I actually saw this movie in 2001.  I hadn't planned on reviewing it on Amazon until I noticed so many recent, positive reviews.  Here's my entry, to offset the imbalance created by those positive reviews:This is the type of movie which would be best to watch on a Saturday morning when you're extremely ill and have neither the energy nor desire to find the remote so as to change channels or, get up and manually do so.As with the Blair Witch Project, much hype accompanied this film, none of which was deserved.  The ""fight"" scenes were touted as the best ever.  What you actually get is a lot of sword and sword-like play filmed at close quarters for the most part, so that you are unable to see any artistry in the choreography. Since it is a period piece, they use reproductions of Chinese clothing from way back when so it's hard to see any action as the long robes and sleeves whirl about.In addition to the swirling robes which obscure the action, the film is waaay too long and, it seems to employ all the old, shopworn plots used in the majority of martial arts movies:  the good guy's master is killed and his death must be avenged, there is a sacred object which has been stolen and must be recovered (in this case, it is not stolen once, but TWICE!), there are two schools of fighting - one is evil and one is good, the good guy comes across an extremely talented fighter and wants to serve as master/teacher (Hey!  If this person could kick the good guy's butt, why would this person need a teacher?), the person whom everyone thinks is a tough guy is actually a tough girl (Yo! Add some carrots to your diet - you didn't notice the arched eyebrows, soft skin and small hands on your masked toughie?).My number one complaint (and as you can see, I have many) is the use of that stupid Matrix-like technique in the fight scenes.You know, the one where people run in mid-air and fight in mid-air and simply hang in mid-air.  It looked stupid when it was first used and now, several movies later, it looks just as lame.  We have people flying all over the place and walking among the treetops. Gimme a break!  Everything else is done on the up and up, then they want you to suspend ALL belief in gravity and reality.The film is in Mandarin Chinese which, luckily, I am fluent in (just kidding). I have no quarrel with movies which must be ""read,"" but I DO have a quarrel with movies like this one which simply stink.One good point: The scenery is beautiful.  The trees were especially attractive...until people started walking all over them.My rating: 1 star (a little something for the trees)"	1.0	Just because you CAN make a movie doesn't mean you SHOULD	2010-04-05	155	6	149
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1WRZXEYP6T671	Amazon Customer	I've read a few viewer reviews regarding the flying fighting scenes and how some viewers thought they were silly and funny. Some can't fathom flying people in a fictional fantasy movie if it isn't from Hollywood. Superman? Got flying covered there.If there is one mythical western character that can be correlated to this movie, it is Peter Pan. He fights, he protects and falls for a girl, he has a fairy as a protector, and he flies.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1AHFIGBYPZTXC	Amazon Customer	If there's one image that defines Ang Lee's masterpiece of a martial arts film, it's that of the solitary Chow Yun-Fat standing on a slender branch in the treetops as it sways gracefully back and forth. Slowly bobbing around the frame, he has a Mona Lisa smile that might as well say &quot;You know this is the coolest thing you have ever seen in your life.&quot;'Crouching Tiger' is a film unlike any other. John Woo tries to meld emotion and action in a similar way (maybe most notably in 'Killer') but never has he brought the kind of grandiose drama to the screen that you will see here. The choreography is stunning, the acting first rate, the drama heart-wrenchingly real.Chow Yun-Fat plays Li Mu Bai, a Wudan warrior who's decided to lay down his sword. Giving the ancient weapon called the Green Destiny to a friend, it's almost immediately stolen and he's forced on one last mission to recover it from the Jade Fox, a self trained Wudan who murdered his master. This may sound straight forward enough, but the problem is that he really wants to settle down with a fellow warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) for a life of peace. Shu Lien is having the same feelings of ambiguity about her life of combat, heightened by the arrival of the young Jen (Ziyi Zhang) who doesn't want to go through with her upcoming marriage. She'd much rather live the warrior's life that her new friend Shu Lien embodies.I can't say much more without giving away the intricate plot, but suffice it to say that both Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien develop a complex love-hate relationship with the thief that comes to great depths and inspires some astonishingly emotional scenes. Not to mention the continuing frustration between the two warriors at their inability to admit their feelings for each other.The other side of this coin is the action and it's simply astounding. The fight scenes in Crouching Tiger are mostly performed with wires that allow them to nearly take flight, walk on water, run along walls and up trees, and all with a grace and realism the like of which has never been seen on film. I heard an interview with Michelle Yeoh who said that this wire work was definitely the hardest thing to accomplish - to make it look realistic, as if the character is jumping and not just being pulled. In all but a couple of scenes, the illusion is flawless and the camera compliments it wonderfully. Credit Yuen Woo-Ping, choreographer and martial arts instructor for such films as 'Drunken Master' and 'The Matrix'. He's reached an entirely new plateau with 'Crouching Tiger.' Alongside the wire work, the more standard fight scenes are accomplished with such unabashed skill (especially from Ziyi Zhang) and sometimes a hint of comedy, that they never wear out their welcome - even for those of us who aren't martial arts fans.Sure to get Oscar nominations and already on most critics '10 Best' lists (including mine), 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is simply a film not be missed. And don't be put off by the action scenes that dominate the trailers. While being a groundbreaking action film, it's also a gripping and emotional drama.

And if you're expecting to see a Matrix-style science-fiction/fantasy film, I definitely advise you to look somewhere else. This is not a good film to watch if you're looking for vicarious thrills.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(CTHD) is a serious drama wrapped in the guise of a Wuxia martial arts film. It deals with issues such as love, devotion, honour, duty...many concepts that our modern society seems to have devalued or simply forgotten. No wonder this film got such a panning from internet critics - I guess this film doesn't really deal in anything modern audiences would consider ""important"".I felt that this was a film where the 'special effects' such as the wire-work stunts were secondary to the real special effect - the actors. Zhang Ziyi is the obvious standout, she's received plenty of raves for her outstanding performance. However, I feel that not enough credit has been paid to Michelle Yeoh and Chow-Yun Fat. Both have roles that require measured, understated performances. Their characters may not garner as much attention as young Jen(Zhang Ziyi), but they (and their relationship) are the foundation of this film.Every aspect of this film is a credit to its creators - Ang Lee and his collaborators should be proud to have produced such a brilliant film. This is not the kind of film that will win instant accolades from everyone. It challenges every single stereotypical element we've come to expect of Asian martial arts films...and succeeds brilliantly. If it were possible to give ten out of five stars, I would. If you're a viewer that's sick and tired of unoriginal, dull and boring cinema, and want to be challenged and invigorated by something totally different, then I definitely reccommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	This is one of the first `foreign language films' I'd ever seen, and while it didn't strike me immediately, it wore on me to the point where I now an enamored by it.  It's a truly universal and commercial film.  Everyone that I know likes it, even if they refuse to watch films with subtitles as a rule.  This seems to be everyone's exception.  I haven't seen this much universal appeal for a foreign film since, the only one coming close would have to be `Pan's Labyrinth'.Personally, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a film that gets better with time and certainly lives up to its rich reputation.The film is really a richly detailed amalgam of cinematic influences, each strand of the films fibers coming together effortlessly to weave an unforgettable experience.  Part epic love story, part mystery, part Asian kung-fu movie, part dramatic social commentary; Ang Lee marvelously shifts the film `ever so slightly' so as to capture everything needed to convey every thought and emotion without coming across awkward, choppy or forced.  The film has a needed `breezy' appeal that carries you from scene to scene, but it never makes light of the films weighty subject matter.While catering towards the emotional resonance of the film (the film may be about the pursuit of a legendary sword, but the focus is not on the sword at all) Ang never forgets the films he is paying homage to, and so he beautifully renders each scene with an edge and intensity that establishes this film as one of the best martial arts pictures ever made.Certainly the best of this past decade.With a powerfully effective cast (both Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi are Oscar worthy here), these fight sequences are elevated from brainless fun to startling emotion driven works of art.  You can understand why these battles are taking place and you can see the personalities of these characters taking shape throughout.  Ziyi is marvelous here, and her character development some of the best of the year (that character was a goldmine).  Her arrogant tonal shifts are just mesmerizing and unbelievably focused.And let's just take a moment of silence to bask in our awe of that brilliantly choreographed bamboo tree battle (one of many breathtaking fight sequences in this film).Yes, `Wo Hu Cang Long' is a stunning film that totally lives up to the hype and delivers more and more with every viewing.  It is one of those films that I grow more and more in love with every time I watch it.  For all the edge and attitude it possesses, this film is one of the most graceful and elegant films I've ever seen.	5.0	Breathtaking beauty meets poignant material in this spellbinding masterpiece...	2010-03-15	5	5	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3VB3XTIL2PDQ8	Andrew Kim	I'll probably be repeating the praise already lavished on this film, but since it absolutely blew me away, I feel compelled to write a review.This movie was like nothing I have seen before.  I knew the fight scenes were going to be worth the price of admission alone, but the movie had much, much more to offer.This movie is layered with many things happening at once.  We see a passionate romance interlocking with a tragic one.  These all play out amidst a double-sided revenge plot.  Throw in breathtaking cinematography (which garnered a well deserved Oscar), a perfect soundtrack (another deserved Oscar), acting that really conveys the complex emotions of the characters, beautiful set designs and locations, AND THEN the greatest action scenes I have ever seen, and you have a superb film.Other aspects of the film have made it rise to the level of great films in my mind.  The film does not cater to the formula of box office success.  It actually takes time to set up the first fight.  The characters don't speak English with a Chinese accent.  There is minimal blood or gore, few deaths, no nudity, and no obscenities.  Ang Lee strives for the old-fashioned method of storytelling, devoid of the easy gimmicks mentioned above, and lets the story and sincerity of the characters move us (plus killer action).This movie is also very unique in terms of its genre busting aspects.  It blends kung-fu and drama like no film I have ever seen.  The women are just as strong as the men in the film, and the kung-fu is shot with an attention to detail that is usually absent from such films.  Things like this have been waiting to be done for a long time, and Ang Lee has done them right.I gained a huge amount of respect for Ang Lee because of this.  I think it is quite a challenge to make a film without the typical R-rated material in films today, and still present a beautifully told, mature movie.  He took on the challenge head on and succeeded through his perfectionism.And a word should be said about the fight scenes.  Amazing.If you haven't seen this film, or have only seen it once, I suggest multiple viewings.  It is very hard to catch everything that is going on in the film, and once you understand what they are saying, you can begin to really savor the film making craft of Ang Lee and company.	5.0	Instant favorite	2001-06-04	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2SBGTE825H1N3	ANDY COLE	When a mystical sword is stolen it sparks a quest to find the thief, who may or may not be the mysterious Jade Fox. This not only causes the unrequited love between Master Bai and Yu Shu Lien to be further postponed by duty, but also signals the development of Jen Yu and her romantic discovery. As the identify of the thief is gradually revealed a showdown looms with both Bai and Lien representing the good and the thief representing evil.A wonderful film in that it managed to make a whole generation of multiplex-only movie watchers that not all good things only come out of America. However there is much to enjoy in this film that still will have been lost on such an audience. The film mixes a raft of subplots around the main focus of the theft of the sword. However we also have the development, romance and envious greed of Jen Yu, the conflict between Yu and Yu Shu Lien and of course the love between Master Li Mu Bai and Lien that has been put off due to duty.The stories all work well - the mystery surrounding the stolen sword and the search for Jade Fox make for a compelling mystery while the romance between Master Bai and Lien is beautifully observed throughout. The story surrounding Jen Yu is very good as it follows her development throughout however her desert romance is perhaps a little too slow for a martial arts movie. The only complaint about the stories is that they are a little heavy for a martial arts film - or maybe there is too much fighting for a well plotted movie? Actually it's probably a brave mix that has some of the best of both worlds.The martial arts action is sensational - Yuen Wo Ping excels himself with one stunning visual treat after another. The wire work is great even by Hong Kong standards - imagine the impact this had on an audience who thought that wire-work had been invented by the Matrix! The standout scenes are the battle between Lien and Jen Yu and the Jen Yu's battle in a crowded barroom. The only complaint I did have is that the treetop fight near the end was not as exciting as other scenes and was also the least realistic and came across as silly at times. In terms of visuals, the film is beautifully shot and picks up the gorgeous Chinese landscape well - the only problem being that this seems to distract from the main story.Michelle Yeoh is as impressive and as beautiful as she is in everything else I've seen her in - you can keep your Julia Roberts rom-coms, I want more of Yeoh's acting talents rather than pure star power. Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as Master Bai and he works well in his scenes with Yeoh. He even manages the martial arts really well despite not having made one before but I would have liked to see first choice Jet Li in the role. The standout is Zhang Ziyi in only her second film. She shines in the most difficult character and manages to convey so much and still be excellent in complex fight scenes. And how does Hollywood reward her? By sticking her in Rush Hour 2! That's like taking a beautiful flower and trying to plant it in the middle of a concrete slab!Overall it's a little slow for the martial arts crowd but it is a wonderful mix of Lee's art house films and the martial arts genre.

There was NOTHING in this movie that would make me recommend it for Best Movie?? Hah! The new Star Wars was much better, and a better legend to boot, and I didn't even like it!!

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AWN3O2TR484ZA	Anita L	Having grown up in Asia, I have been exposed to this sort of movies at a young age. Therefore, when this movie came on the big screen, I went to see it hoping that it would be of the same calibre as those i was accustomed to. Unfortunately, apart from its big name director and Asian A-List actors, this movie was just mediocre in its genre. However, the special effects are still quite enjoyable on the big screen, but once transfered to DVD, unless you own a screen large enough to see all the flying and martial arts scenes as it was meant to be seen, the whole aspect of the movie is lost.Perhaps as a movie targeted at Western audiences, it serves its purpose to be rated such high acclaim. But when classified and rated with similar types of movies, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, to me only crouched and hid and did not live up to the potential it could have become.	3.0	Over rated for its category	2002-05-29	9	6	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AISCV7YOC448J	ankh fire	After watching too many poorly made martial arts movies, with actors trained for two weeks in martial arts prior to the filming, I had a mediocre feeling about this movie before I watched it. Then I was blown away! First of all, all of the actors in this movie are experienced in martial arts, it's not fake or purely choreographed. And considering the astounding choreography of this movie, that's saying quite a bit.Beyond the mind-blowing fight scenes, however, this is not the normal martial arts movie. It departs in the fact that most of the main characters are women (and every fight scene has at least one woman). There's also a slightly fantastic element that is tastefully contained; it is easier to believe the almost-flying ability of the characters than it is to dismiss it.What most impressed me about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, however, was the concentration on spiritual and mental aspects. Instead of showing martial arts as a merely physical exercise, it addresses the teachings of martial arts to become mentally and spiritually in control of oneself, and more in tune with the outside world. Its message of love and being true to oneself is subtle and moving, as supported by an outstanding musical score (with Yo Yo Ma on cello.) As for the ending, if you think it is only about death, then I suggest you watch it again.Deeply moving, both sad and uplifting at the same time, this is one of my favorite movies. I hope others can appreciate it for the same qualities!	5.0	Blew me away	2001-11-12	4	4	0

There is a coming of age element, but it doesn't drown out the rest of the story. Lastly the matter of love is disscussed and attended two in two diffrent veins, but does not overpowere any other part or element of the story. The ending was slightly disapointing, but the middle made up for it.Some people are bothered by the flying in the fight sceens. Yes, if you are a purist, then it is most likely going to bother you.

When I opened the package and played the DVD I was very excited to see all of the options associated with this DVD.  The original english sub plots in the movie were great, but for those of us that don't speak Mandarin, the DVD offers the English voices to go with the movie.  The best part about it is that the English voices actually match the lip movement of the characters!!!  But the movie is so great, with the special effects and fight scenes, you can turn the subtitles and voices off and watch the movie over and over again with enjoyment!!

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2VRAKJRZZFP0J	Antonio Brunson	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is an incredible tale of two interwoven stories of love. Not only that, the movie features phenomenal cinematography in some the best fight sequences ever filmed. It's hard not to love CTHD, with it's beautiful scenery and epic tale. The film centers mainly around Zhang Ziyi, who plays a beautiful girl being forced into marriage to benefit her family's social status while secretly harboring deep feelings for an outlaw. She's also fascinated by Michelle Yeoh's character, a seasoned warrior visiting her home. Michelle Yeoh also has hides a secret love, Li Mu Bai (played by Chow Yun Fat), whom she cannot marry for fear of dishonoring his late husband. Zhang's quest for satisfaction will bring them all together, but at their risk of their own lives.But enough with the plot. CTHD features some of the best (if not THE best) fights ever seen. As the characters effortlessly bound across the screen on rooftops and treetops to escape their enemy or fight passionately in face-to-face. The movie is of the &quot;martial arts fantasy&quot; genre, meaning that characters defy the laws of gravity and physics with ease. This accentuates their story, but never overtakes it. These epic battles are an expression of their strong emotions and the burden they feel for peace. The fights include one actor against an entire bar, a chase through the rooftops followed by some insane hand-to-hand combat, and one fight involving so many weapons that you'll watch it over and over again.If you don't like subtitles the DVD offers an option for dubbed playback, but I enjoy it better reading the text.Buy this movie. Now. Then have some friends over and take in &quot;one of the greatest movies ever made.&quot;	5.0	The Best Film of 2000 -- bar none!	2001-06-25	4	4	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3R9022S14RI2S	"A. Perschbacher ""thegreatfizz"""	Originally I had hoped for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to slay the transparent forces of the predictable Gladiator at the Oscars, but, naturally the Academy gave the award to the one that was R-rated and much too fantastically violent for any one with a certain degree of taste.  Fortunately for our friends in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they were able to win at least a couple of awards they deserved.  Unfortunately, I felt that the movie offered little more than beautiful scenery, asthetics, and direction.  Obviously the action scenes scattered throughout the movie are astounding and deserve a permanent place in the history of entertainment, but I found nothing unique about the plot of the movie, and not much beyond the rather simple rythym of the soundtrack.  That aside, I must say that the movie is amazing and earns its right to have been in contention for Best Picture at the Oscars.  The position of the camera throughout the movie offers an awe-inspiring view of this almost whimsical world of martial arts that director Ang Lee has invisioned for the tale.  The vibrant colors of the cities and wildernesses (even deserts) display that they did not cheapen themselves or the audience with art direction.  By all means this is a fantastic movie to purchase, I have not found as much in it as most probably have (I'm not a real action fan), but I can easily suggest that anyone who purchases the DVD is in for a treat.	4.0	Action at its definite best	2001-06-12	2	1	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A23GCYI07TVYUJ	a reviewer	The movie was very good in my opinion, not great, but very enjoyable. It kind of elevated the genre to where it should be. However, the movie still belongs to a genre and therefore it has all the problems that are associated with it.  I haven't really read a negative review here that was written by someone with an ounce of brain.  On the other hand I feel like the majority of people that are giving -six- stars have been somehow &quot;brain-bleached&quot; by the super reviews that this movie received.  Once again someone has somehow ascended (or descended) to the level of &quot;american sweetheart&quot; foreign personality. It's now Ang Lee's turn.  All you got to do is fuel the american fashination with the super-hero through the right mass-marketing scheme. Top that off with  an oscar nomination and there you have an instant classic that americans will eat right up. The fighting scenes were superb, when they remained at ground level.  The flying scenes got on my nerves very, very quickly.  It would have been more fun to see the harnesses since it looked like people were hanging by their buttholes ahiahiahi!  I found the the story line, the love stories, and the depiction of imperial China, of which I know nothing about, very enjoyable and captivating.

It was often slow and itcontained the sloppy sensibility of foreign films that try to dovetailslap-stick with emotional serious scenes. They fail on anybut the most naive audiences. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; wassimply a very slick representative of a well-explored genre with apretentious title designed to exploit the race guilt of the Academy.If you're not expecting much, this is a fun, stylish romp throughChinese cinematic symbolism.

The story line is good, but I liked it more for the great character development.  I really appreciate the depth of emotion and nuanced personalities and the fantastic directing work.  The characters struggle with the 'right and wrong' in their lives, the complex decisions they have to make and must walk the tight-rope of obligation to their loved ones which are in direct conflict with their own happiness.  Underneath the facade of an action and adventure movie lies and even better love story - in reality multiple love stories.  If you were to strip away all of the fantastic action scenes, this movie would be a real tear-jerker.  The cinematography is fantastic, the fight sequences are great, but not over the top.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AOY6PKCNVP9RJ	"Barbara Nostrand ""Barbara Nostrand"""	While this film may on the surface appear to be a martial arts film, it is not really part of that genre. This is why East Asians frequently pan this film. It is not a martial arts film despite what the trailers may lead one to believe. Rather, it is a multi-layer psychological love story involving several different people. It is also highly atmospheric. In this manner it combines some of the best features of European character oriented films and Japanese films concerning either atmosphere or emotion with plot elements sufficiently strong for North American markets.Regardless, this is a fine film. However, do not be surprised if your Asian friends are not taken with it in terms of the martial arts genre. In those terms, the film is a bit shop worn and even a bit hokey. The fact that, unlike a Jackie Chan film, this film takes itself very seriously, makes its deficiencies as a martial arts film more pronounced.	5.0	Great psychological drama	2001-07-27	3	1	2

And the man,played by Yun-Fat Chow, ultimately pays the price with his life.  Sounds familiar?  Yes the typical story of a MAN with his mid-life crisis.  What I call it "" a butterfly syndrome"".

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A28T2PVHJJWXLO	"B. Duff ""nightfox1977"""	This film has everything for everyone.  Excellent acting, great storyline, and very awesome action scenes.I think this is the movie that would cross the gender boundaries in what movie you want to watch some night.  Going for the stereo-typical route: Women want romance... Guys want action. This movie has both!  There should be more movies in the future made like this.  It'll make those movie nights at home much better varied in selection.I was surprised to find out that this is Chow Yun-Fat's first martial arts film.  I'm not much of a foreign film buff, but I figured that most Asian action film stars started off in either martial arts films or gun-based action films and getting to do both as they grew as an actor.I've only seen a few films with Michelle Yeoh (Crouchin Tiger, SuperCop 2, a James bond film).  I just love watching her kick butt and have a passionate emotional side to her acting.And since Amazon.com failed to add her to the &quot;Cast list&quot;..  Zhang Ziyi (say it like it's spelled... there you go!) is a really sexy actress.  I swear she's gonna do some very awesome films in English once she's learned the language a bit more.  I think everyone should keep an eye out for her films.  It's a shame about how her character in Rush Hour2 came to a conclusion.  I would be nice to have some hope she'll come back and beat down on Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan some more.I just love martial arts films.  I used to watch the horrid, but entertaining martial arts films on the USA Network when they had a &quot;Kung-Fu Theatre&quot; type show.  I wish they'd bring it back.  I haven't gotten to see the other movies Ang Lee has done, but after watching this masterpiece, I'm going to go rent some other movies directed by him.Putting in this DVD the first time was funny.  The standard language is Mandarin/Chinese with English Subtitles.  I'm sorry, but I prefer the voice overs in english with no subtitles.  One day when I've learned more than one language, or when I'm bored.. I'll put it on Mandarin/Chinese with no subtitles.  Probably even teach me to speak the language.  heh.My other little problem was the wire work.  Could have done a bit more in fluid movements of the actors as they're being pulled around on the wires.  The kicking in the air like you're running on it isn't all that great to see.  The actors should go from a crouched position to a entended jump pose, then on the way to a solid object to &quot;bounce&quot; or land on, have some sense of gravity and weight to the landings.  The way it is in the movie, it's more like a fighting game than something that's more real.This title is a must for anyone who owns a DVD player.  It's a sad thing if you don't have this in your collection.  Everyone should get this movie so that their collection will grow as scarily large as my own.

Jackie Chan has done much better and from my perspective he could kick their butts anyday of the year!!!  All they do is talk and the flying doesn't look real at all.  You can also see the cables they use to do their stunts.  This movie was unrealistic and you can't picture anything in real life with that!  I thought it would be so much better if they did more realistic stunts and did not talk as much.  I hope that Ang Lee can do a lot better if she works on a new movie.	1.0	Horrible and Boring!!!	2001-10-14	17	2	15
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1F7POGFEAO6PE	"BeckleMic ""michaelbecko"""	I approached Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with great trepidation; after all it was a martial arts film, right? It turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. The cinematography, the cast, the plot, the dialogue, the fight scenes, and the acting were first class. Normally I do not enjoy movies with subtitles, but in this case the subtitles seem to add to the mystic of the film. There has been much debate about the floating effect of the fight scenes, and for the first few seconds when I saw it I was first taken aback. Then as the film progressed, this special effect just added to the mystic of the film, and it seemed to fit naturally as any other special effect. Pay-per-view ran a dubbed version of the film and I watched it for about half and hour before giving up. Believe it or not, the version with the subtitles is better. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a truly remarkable film.	5.0	One of the all time great films	2001-12-07	5	5	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3JZY87FQKAT4I	"""beergod"""	I watched this movie with a nagging feeling of disappointment. This isn't the best movie in the kung-fu genre, nowhere near the best movie of 2000 and I strongly doubt that it's even the best foreign movie of 2000. It makes you wonder whether or not this film would have gotten the notoriety it received had it not the special effects budget and the established Chinese-Hollywood actors at it's helm.That said, visually this film is quite stunning, but cinematography can't completely glaze over a thin, meandering plot and flimsy script. You have to also wonder how many reviewers who gave this 5 stars skip past the reams of dialogue and straight to the spectacular fight sequences. Hmm...	3.0	Nothing special	2002-07-22	11	5	6

That was all I liked about this movie. The story did not carry well, the teenage girl really began to annoy me almost immediately with her perpetual psycho trip. The special effects were pretty cool the first time you saw them but for the rest of the movie the ""flying around"" got quite old.My idea of what makes a good movie are examples such as ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator""; this movie however was a sleeper.

The acting is plastic throughout and the (ahem!) &quot;plot&quot; if you want to call it that, is so far-fetched and unexplainable...I can't explain it! I tried this film in English and then, in Chinese with English subtitles but- still - it misses, badly. Either I'm just not able to connect in a cross-cultural way to a story that has deep meaning or the critics are crazy! I kept on waiting for Woody Allen or one of the Python boys to walk in and halt the proceedings with a laugh and pratfall. The English dubbing actors voices and performances are dreadful. I swear they sound like two actors from &quot;Godzilla&quot; or &quot;Rodan.&quot;  The &quot;love story&quot; between the two &quot;heroes&quot; is flimsy and acted with inexcusable wooden gestures and melodramatic delivery. In fact, every &quot;character&quot; in this film is just that - a character. I know this puts me in the minority but - geez - what a stinker!	2.0	Weak	2001-07-07	6	2	4

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2Z2FDA8O6PN9O	Bill	This is probably the best film i've seen for ages, it's up there with the matrix as my all time favourites. I might even like this film more than the matrix for first impressions, but it's debatable. There was one thing that dragged the version i watched down though, so please take note if you are buying the VHS version. The dubbed version is pretty awful, you can tell that what the characters are saying in mandarin chinese is so much more intelligent and natural than the english that has been superimposed to try and fit into the lip movements. Not that i can understand mandarin chinese, but the subtitled version allows you to appreciate the actors and actresses talents. As usual the english speaking actors stress and tone some of thier lines as if they were in a play or clearly reading it from a script. This clashes rather dissapointingly with the obvious acting talents of yeoh and Chow yun fat, and come to think of it, most of the actors and actresses in the movie. Although it is still possible to appreciate this movie and be astounded by it as a dubbed movie, the subtitled version is so much better. So my advice would be to buy the subtitled version, it's like a different movie altogether.  The movie itself is a masterpeice. It's 5 oscars are well deserved. The cinematography is breathtaking, beautiful landscapes, as well as beautiful people and buildings. Ang Lee has carefully blended a number of things into this film, which is predominantly a film which centres around a couple of romances. The fight scenes are incredible. Lee and Pau have worked together to successfully recreate and illustrate what the old martial arts movies used to try and do for example crazy flying kicks, and well, flying in general. But in this day and age, the technology is available to make these fight scenes believeable. Therefore we get a taste of how the old school movie makers wanted thier movies. Be careful though, because after the movie the natural progression is to turn to your nearest friend and try and Karate chop him, or try and fly across the room! Get this movie, and if you can't afford it, rent it, and remember to get the subtitled version every time. Later Johnny Bravo	5.0	Best film i've seen for a long time	2001-06-29	1	0	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1BRN7F3WW9WZU	"""billydylan"""	Even the movie's simplistic plot is not enough enough to drag this movie into medeocrity.  In fact the simple plot, which largely consists of the fight over sword for reasons of heroism, revenge, and pride, gives the movie an interesting 'common, everyday' feel amidst a magical mystical time and place.In short the movie is about the battle between a prideful confused apprentice searching for something to make her truly happy, a vengeful washed up master aiming to get back at Chow Yun Fet and her own apprentice for becomming better, a noble hero (Michele...), and a would be master torn three ways between his desire to teach young talent (the apprentice), his devotion to truth, righteousness, and heroism, and his secret devotion to a long time love (Michele.)  Other characters enter the scene merely to pull the apprentice in a different direction of &quot;happiness.&quot;  The prime example is a robber she meets in the desert who becomes her lover after they fight over a stolen comb.The movie is magical.  You will feel as though you are caught up in Chinese folklore.  The battle scenes are heroic and astonishing as well as tasteful and graceful: a quality other action movies lack.	5.0	A wonderful mystical magical tale	2003-07-18	2	1	1

It is beautifully shot and the art direction is wonderful- this does not make up for a boring story and endless tedious martial arts. A great disappointment considering all the fuss that was made about this movie. I appreciate the choreography of the action scenes but enough is enough-the flying sequences were not properly realised-you  could not see the wires but you knew they were there!

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A9TVOSI10QGBV	"""black_velvet"""	before anyone decides to write me hate mail, let me first say that this was probably the most well done kung-fu flick i've seen, and yes, that is what i consider it.the acting was great, as far as i could tell, being that i don't speak a word of chinese (be it mandarin or otherwise).  and i concede that some of the scenery was very beautiful.  but, in all honesty, anybody can pick a pretty spot to film a movie.  the story itself was a bit dry, and as far as directorial insight, well, i thought that half-hour long desert flashback smack dab in the middle of the movie was utterly useless and unnecessarily interrupted the flow of the plot.i'm not saying this was a horrible movie, but i certainly don't see what was so remarkable about it.  it was a kung-fu film with a slightly higher budget than normal, i think the fact that it was the first of its kind to be imported specifically for the american (and international) audience somehow made the critics feel obligated to laud it as some great masterpiece, some crowning achievement for chinese cinema.nice movie to look at, fun to watch at times, but it for a movie that was nominated for so many academy awards, it lacked substance, fluidity, and anything remarkable overall.  didn't win any awards with me...	3.0	HIGHLY overrated...	2001-06-19	6	0	6

From the story, to the cinematography, to the directing to the editing it truly lacked nothing.  This movie is an epic film that will be timeless.  It is a delicate balance of mysticism, romance and action.  Ang Lee has put together a masterpiece and established himself as an artist.  I highly recommend this movie; however the viewer may understand the story more and appreciate it more if they have background knowledge about Chinese culture and the obligations of the classes.

Fantastic scenery, scene-settings, buildings. Exquisite chinoiserie. The fighting looked more like some sort of balletic dancing performed to some exotic kind of rhythms. With strings attached. Unfortunately I couldn't follow anything of what was going on, and I was unable to sustain the interest and concentration necessary to say that I even halfway enjoyed it. It must be for buffs of this kind of thing. Perhaps if it was explained carefully all the way through, but I haven't retained enough energy or commitment to listen to the commentary.

It definitely stands out in my mind as the only action movie that ever brought a tear to my eye.The plot can get a bit confusing at times, due to smaller sub-plots that pop up.

Ang Lee is a powerful director and combines the worlds of drama and martial arts gracefully.As for the DVD, I own the Region 3 DVD and most likely the Region 1 DVD will have all, if not more, of the features from the Region 3 DVDs.

This movie is complete with action, compeling story, and beautiful camera work.  It has some of the most unique action work done since The Matrix.  While some might argue that since wires were used for them, I do not believe that it detracts from the movie.  I believe everyone should view this movie at least once to see what it is all about.

Not only does the movie tell a great story, but any fan of action sequences will be awed by the fights.  The martial arts are amazing, and when you combine a kung-fu style of action sequence with unbelieveable swordplay, you get jaw-dropping battles.  The fight between the two women towards the end was particularly amazing as Yeoh used a number of different weapons in the long fight scene.  I had to import the DVD from Malaysia because I could wait for the American release, and couldn't afford to see it in the theatres as often as I wanted to watch it.

If you grew up watching Kung-fu Theater like I did, you will recognize many of the comic homages Ang Lee pays to the genre.

All this makes it very difficult to understand what is happening. The plot is also somewhat confusing at first. Why Yun-fat Chow's character wants to give up the Green destiny sword  was unclear. While I can admire most of the graceful fight scenes involving wire work, too much of it seemed to have no basis in reality. There should have been some plot concept to establish the concept. In the theater that I was in, much  of the audience was laughing in an embarrassed manner during the opening fight scenes involving wire work. The second half of the film was much better. Zhang Ziyi was sensational.The fight scene in the inn and the sword fight scene between Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi were two of best that I have seen. The outdoor cinematography was indeed beautiful, particularly the desert scenes. If the first third of the film had been done better, I would indeed give it five stars.	3.0	Good, but not great.	2001-02-17	33	7	26

So, is this title also editable?  Is farter a bad word for this movie?  I don't think so, and the somehow the Hollywood media hid the stench of this movie by elevating it.  First, the sword, BFD.  Unbelievable the sword (green destiny), happened to be the whole point of the movie.  Second, the stupid peter pan flying effects don't cut it and are an eye-sore.  And why in the heck are all the fight scenes so dark?  I almost went blind trying to watch this movie.  Yes, it is boring, plotless, and an eye-sore, but that's just the beginning.  The characters have nothing to offer in addition to a script that is comparable to Eye of the Beholder.  I totally just lost it with this movie when some questionalbly placed flashback into the princess's life (more than halfway through the movie that is) just dragged on and on.

She has not seen many subtitled movies and wasn't crazy about the idea when I first proposed seeing this film.  The fact that it was martial arts didn't set her afire either.  I assured her though that I normally hate martial arts movies but we absolutely had to see this film, that this director, Ang Lee, made no junk films.  Joyce was absolutely as enthralled as I was from beginning to end with this epic film.  There are two love stories that are quite involving plus it features two women as incredible warriors in storyline that verges on fable or myth. That you see the 2 women in action throughout the film, made our day.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2YXMN40D7WTGP	casualsuede	Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a Wudan fighter of Legendary Status. He is also the keeper of Green Destiny, a perfectly crafted sword that is 400 years old. One day he is surrounded by a circle of light and believes it is enlightenment, but it's not. This motivates him to give up his life as a fighter and search for more enlightenment. Yu Shu Lein (Michelle Yeoh) is also a crafty fighter and a love interest for Li, but it has never materialized. However, she is an independent woman, owner of Sun Protection, a service unlike Brinks Security and is well respected. However, she is missing Li from her life and we see it, when she discusses it with her mother, early in the movie.Yu agrees to take the sword to Sir Te, whom Li has chosen as it's guardian. He is in search for Green Jade, an assasin who killed his master years ago (a common theme in Martial Arts movies). However, on the first night in Sir Te's care, it is stolen.Yu meets a young woman named Jen, who is supposed to be married to another house to forge a stronger alliance for her father, a regional governor for the Emperor. However, on the night of the theft, it seemed that the thief came from the governor's mansion. Is it possible that Jen was the thief and even perhaps Jade Fox?As the story unfolds, more and more detail is added to each character's richness. (Spoiler)The relationship between Yu and Li is also poignant. In Asian culture, unrequited love is a common theme and it was not rare to see a man and a woman who have hidden feelings for each other, never end up revealing their love. However, the yearning that you see in M. Yeoh's performance is Oscar Caliber in my book and the regal-ness that Chow Yun Fat showed as King Mongkut in Anna and the King is reproduced and increased infinitely because I easily believed him as a old fighter, who has infinite wisdom from his years of experience.And the scenery. This is one of the most beautiful movies ever. The scenery, from the panoramic shots of the Forbidden City, to the sweeping grandeur of the Bamboo forest, the eyes are not forgotten in this tale of justice, loyalty and independence. Nor is the region of the brain that likes action. While the fighting in the movie serves as a vehicle to the characters, it takes a life of it's own. It is concept of classic Chinese storytelling that students of Wudan or Shaolin gain an enlightenment so great, that it gives them near superhuman powers. That is why you see so much flying. However, to those many westerners, this concept would probably not make any sense. Still, while the effects are wonderful, the flying was a little too liberally used to maintain dramatic effect. However, since this movie was originally meant for the Asian market, I'm not one to complain.I think that the break out performance came from Zhang Zi Yi. While she appears fragile, she had the hardest and most demanding role and she pulled it off magnificently. (spoiler)(Spoiler)The extended fight scene over the hairpin was overdone. I know that Ang Lee wanted to extend the scene to show her determination and defiance, but it felt like a joke that has gone on too long.Those were minor complaints to the excellent storytelling, magnificent performances and awesome action in this movie.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A17N23WXA7EAF	"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter"""	&quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; is misunderstood by most, including those who love it and those who hate it. Crouching Tiger lovers believe that this is the quintessential martial arts movie or that it is a profound reflection of Chinese history, culture, and drama. While the fighting scenes in this movie, are thrilling and fun to watch, they are more acrobatic and fantastic than anything else. I think that's what Ang Lee intended, and I'll explain why in a moment. As to the cultural significance of this film, there really isn't one unless you are interested in obscure academic topics such as the sociological significance of Chinese martial arts soap operas.And there lies the key: this film is essentially a supped up martial arts soap opera. Martial Arts soap operas are wildly popular throughout Asia and on many American TV stations with Asian language programs. I've seen many of them on Chinese TV programs in the US and China, and my wife used to watch them every weekend in the Southeast Asian city where she grew up.Martial Arts soap operas often feature the same themes as Crouching Tiger, such as avenging the master's death, restoring a treasure to its rightful owner, rescuing a damsel in distress, unrequited love, etc. They also feature many of the same combat scenarios including fighters flying at each other through the air, roof top chases, sword duels, ambushes, miracle healing, and so forth. These films are neither meant to showcase true martial arts performances like some of Jet Li's earlier works, or countless Main Land Chinese Kung Fu movies, nor are they intended to bring Chinese history to life. Instead, they are genre-driven, formulaic, fun, and often absurd.Does this mean that Crouching Tiger is a bad movie-absolutely not! I think Ang Lee quite deliberately set out to make a high-end, jazzed up martial arts soap opera. The first time I saw this movie in San Francisco, the largely Chinese audience enthusiastically applauded after the first fight scene, as did my wife and I. We had all seen this sort of thing hundreds of times before but never on such a magnificent scale with so much realism, grandeur, and suspense. Ang Lee pushed the martial arts soap opera genre to the limit, and he did so superbly.As the months went by I usually heard one of two responses to this film. The majority of people liked it but often claimed that it was deep, profound and revealing to them-that it taught them something about Chinese culture. The film's detractors on the other hand found the fight scenes unbelievable and the plot too melodramatic. I think both sets of people failed to realize that all they were watching was a really well done martial arts soap opera.	5.0	A well done martial arts soap opera	2001-06-25	2	1	1

The fact it happened to be foreign (insert ""I have to read it?"" now) didn't help my eagerness to see it during its initial release--but I did and, man, what a ride!

The story is solid and the filming is amazing as well.  Crouching Tiger is one of those movies that possess something magical.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2Q8F4EEEUD35E	"""celophaine"""	"Don't get me wrong. This was a fun, fun, fun movie. I just don't think that it was Academy Award material. The cinematography was good, I admit, but was really that mind blowing ? When I say cinematography I am talking about cinematography. Many people confuse cinematography with effects and/or the final results of careful digital compositing. Look at some of these sences. Some are pretty washed out and very flat. The interior shots, especially the bar fight, are almost amateur (again, seperate in your mind, the great action sequence from the actual quality of the lighting).As far as the story goes, I feel that the two stories - the story of the older couple and the story of the younger couple - could have been better integrated with more creative editing. It is as if you see one film for an hour and all of a sudden you are yanked into another for 40 minuites and then returned again. But you know that Ang Lee that wanted to integrate the stories more smoothly or else he would not have tried to include flashes of the caravan scene  earlier on. He tried, but he didn't quite get. Again, don't get me wrong, Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh have great chemistry, but I'm talking here of the flow of the movie.This film was touted as a great ""woman's lib"" film. I can understand how someone might think so, but Ang Lee is no progressive ! Think about how the movie ends. It shows that a woman can't actually have it all. In fact the story is: when a spoiled young girl rebels, a really cool guy who was trying to help her gets killed. Just because you have heroines jumping around and kicking ..., it does not make it a  ""woman's lib"" film.I'll say it again. This is a good film. I liked this film. Go see this film. But don't let the hype make you see more in it than there is.

The entire cast is excellent without having to resort to some white guy moseying on the set to find the missing sword. In the hands of others, this could have been another ""The Golden Child,"" or a Pauly Shore vehicle (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wea-sel,"" anyone?). Instead, we get an actual plot, full of characterization, long flashbacks, and a story that moves.Those seeking nonstop action scenes were probably disappointed (like Bruce Lee's films never get slow?), but the film makers should be applauded for sticking to their guns and telling a story without overwhelming it with constant action set pieces that do nothing but stop the plot and employ a herd of stunt people, like any Pierce Brosnan 007 film. The sword fights here will go down in cinematic history as some of the greatest, the ballet-like rooftop chase scenes were wonderful to behold, and the ending that I did not see coming (or maybe did not want to see coming) left me shaken. ...

Hollywood's themes become old and tiresome with time and something new, something inspiring is needed to break the molds.In this action-packed film, men are not the best fighters, the man and woman do not live happily ever after and the Christian ethic does not support the themes. Instead the ethic of the Buddhist monk provides the subtle webbing that holds the ideas together. Exciting new concepts of spiritual enlightenment make the gravity-defying flying (like Matrix) somehow nearly believable. The sense of honor and the sense of a person's place within the greater universal expectations make this movie unique, refreshing and much-needed break in the Hollywood monotony and monopoly of the movie industry.

At the end, along with the rest of the audience, I was applauding madly. This is an exquisite film, requiring little effort to suspend disbelief. Its fight choreography (accompanied by perfectly appropriate drumming) is breathtaking, as are the cinematography and the special effects. The cast is wonderful, acting their parts with restraint appropriate to the setting; Yun-Fat Chow has a peerless onscreen presence.My only quibble is with the end-title music, which is modern and a little silly and makes one wonder why-after a score performed by top-tier artists (YoYo Ma, for one)-this (astonishingly) academy-award nominating song (which didn't win, mercifully) was tacked on to a thoroughly authentic period piece which is otherwise all but flawless.This is a film very worth viewing.	5.0	A director who can do no wrong	2001-06-09	4	3	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ	Chris Fung	"This was definitely the best movie of 2000.  How Gladiator got past this is way beyond me.One thing I'd like contribute is some thoughts about the overall themes in the movie.  In the end, I think, Ang Lee sets up several different zones of tension: Between youth and age, between men and women, between discipline and desire and between love and duty. In order to get to some sort of satisfying interpretation of the meaning of the end of the movie, we really have to understand all four tensions and the nexus that this creates in the plot.When Jen asks Li Mubai ""Is it the sword you want, or me?"" this is one of the critical points in the movie. On the one hand Li Mubai and Yu Shulian are inextricably linked.  On the other, Li is being offered a chance to revitalize his earthly life through youth either sexually as the lover of a younger woman, or as a teacher if Jen would agree to become the ""ultra-disciple"" that every true teacher longs for.  Ang Lee saves Li Mubai from making this decision by having Jen faint.  As in other incidents in the film, this incident highlights Li's major character flaw, indecision or weakness of will.Something that a number of people have noted is that the climactic fight scenes in the movie are really between Yu Shulian and Jen. An explanation of this conflict might come from the ways in which Jen refuses to accept either Yu Shulian's path of discipline (thus subjecting herself to authority) or a life of total anarchy on the run with Jade Fox. As a younger woman she is trying to establish an independent way for herself on her own terms.  This is perhaps one of the things about her character that endears her to western and younger audiences in particular.The tension between men and women is something that has been remarked upon by many observer. One example of this is the background story to Jade Fox and her rebellion against Wudang (as a woman she could be the lover of Li Mubai's teacher but could never be a student).  Ang Lee does not resolve this conflict either.  He certainly raises the issue of androcentrism in the Jiang Hu world and one notes with dismay that the characters which challenge the patriarchal system (Jade Fox) are cut down or self-sacrifice (Jen and perhaps even Yu Shulian).  Nevertheless, the sympathies of the film in both narrative and affect lie firmly with the women:  While the women are generously drawn and rendered as fully three-dimensional characters, the men (even Li Mubai) seem more hesitant or unidimensional.  Wudang is not a sheltering company of brothers but a flat and rather chilly place.The last two conflicts (between duty and love and discipline and desire) might at first seem to be the same.  However, they differ in one important way:  Duty and love are relationships between peoplewhereas discipline and desire are interior states that apply to individuals.In the relationship between Li Mubai and Yu Shulian, duty is manifested in social obligations to one's sworn brothers and sisters (relationships upon which one's membership in society rests), whereas their love for one another conflicts with their obligations to others (in particular the dead) and their own reluctance or fear to speak openly of how they feel.By contrast, discipline and desire are much more individual. Discipline requires the voluntary submission of the individual (as in the case of Yu Shulian's self-imposed fidelity to her dead fiance or as represented by Li Mubai's repeated offer to Jen to become his student). On the opposite side of this relationship, desire is the gratification of individual needs. Ang Lee suggests, in true Buddhist, Confucian and Shakespearean form that the consequences of uncontrolled desire are ultimately disastrous. Jade Fox's desire for martial arts abilities and for revenge motivates her ultimate descent into evil.  Desire for autonomy and her own caprice leads Jen to steal the sword Green Destiny and finally causes the death of Li Mubai and Yu Shulian's loss of the love of her life.Within this context, I would suggest that Jen's final decision is an attempt by Ang Lee to respond to these contradictions within the movie.  She is finally free but free to do what?  She cannot go back to her old life.  Her mentor is dead, and she can no longer be a daughter in her father's house.  But just as clearly, she cannot become a traditional wife, nor, without Li Mubai, can she enter Wudang, even if she wanted to. In a sense she began the movie reacting to others (resisting her marriage, resisting the roles laid out for respectable young women, resisting the restraints of the Wudang path).  In the end she is freed of those restraints but it is clear that she must now carry the burden of the consequences of her actions.In the end, one is left with a number of  questions. Did Ang Lee intend to say that women who challenge the authority of men must inevitably lose something they hold dear?  That youth without guidance causes destruction? That experience can become crippled by regret or propriety?  That the price of freedom is terrifying isolation?  Maybe there was a little of all of those in this  movie.  I totally see why a lot of mainstream US responses were ""I really liked this movie until the last 2 minutes""  This is because the last two minutes can really only be understood in the context of Chinese notions of duty, obligation and freedom as nothingness.I suspect that Jen's surrender to nothingness as she falls marks a transformation for her.  She has become enlightened (in a Buddhist fashion perhaps?).  My sympathies however are with Yu Shulian who has to pick up the pieces after everyone else has died and moved on. If Jen represents transcendence then Yu Shulian represents the ability to make your own way forward in a hard world with generosity and courage, one step at a time."	5.0	it's not an action movie, it's a drama	2003-03-29	10	9	1

I was aware of the hype coming in but I was still not prepared for the sheer, irresistible beauty it bestowed the screen. This is a film you have to embrace and let yourself be swept by its magic. This is what films are all about: make you dream and marvel at the way the world is presented to you. And the world of &quot;Crouching tiger...&quot; is a most exhilirating one with characters defying earthbound conventions with enthralling movements that make the expression &quot;poetry in motion&quot; come to life. And never has poetry been so universally spell-binding. But for all its magical, superhuman possibilities, the film is deeply rooted in raw human emotions, so that the &quot;flying&quot; (more like long-stride jumping) becomes a beautiful metaphor for the inner desires of the characters yearning to break out of societal &quot;gravity&quot;, to be free to love at will. &quot;It's a state of mind&quot; says Li Mu Bai.

Ang Lee is able to take the adrenaline pumped art of martial arts and add passionate romance into the Academy Award winning film.The story blends perfectly with the fight scenes that occur from time to time during the film. There are also memorable scenes, such as the battle between the wise warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and a politician's daughter Jen (Zhang Ziyi.) All of the parts, including Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Lo (Chang Chen) are portrayed wonderfully. I heard that Jet Li turned down the role for the film.

Yun Fat Chow and ZHang Ziyi's fight scene in the forest near the end was one of the scenes that I thought was very memorable..)It is not a typical Hollywood comedy-martial arts film like Rush Hour or anything, but I think the director did a fantastic job with this film.I highly recommend it for anyone.	5.0	One of the best movies I've ever seen	2004-09-25	4	4	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2NX99GVAX4TRP	"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover"""	This JUST RELEASED SPECIAL SUPERBIT version of the film (10/09/01), means that all available disc space is used to present the film supposedly at the very finest visual quality possible. The disc space is devoted to improving the resolution of the film.  That means no extras, no bells and whistles, behind the scenes documentaries, commentaries, nothing, nada.  Perhaps an extra disc of extra's would have been nice. . . but this release is not geared to please everyone, only the pickiest DVDophiles amongst us.The difference will not blow your socks off.  The picture is a little better defined, and a little crisper.  You'll see a few more details in low-light situations. The DTS sound is also a little better.SUPERBIT TITLES are produced by a team of Sony Pictures Digital video, sound and mastering technicians and engineers.  Superbit DVDs are encoded at twice their normal bit rate which improves video resolution and gives you a choice of both  Dolby 5.1 and DTS audio. They are fully compatible with DVD players already in use. There is no room on the disc for any extras.However, the print used for this film is exactly the same print used for the other version.  There's still some dirt on the print and there's still some grain.  In fact it's a little more clearly defined and accentuated. It's minor.. but here's a disc that is put out to please the pickiest amongst us and they have started the process with a print that is not as good as it possibly could be.I have extensively reviewed the film elsewhere. To Recap:The most successful foreign film of all time is an action packed martial-arts fantasy that is also an epic romance.  It won't satisfy the baser instincts of chop socky fans since there's little gore, breaking of bones or thud-thudding sound effects, but for most filmgoers it's a pretty impressive film.This is an Asian martial arts film with a bigger budget, production values, better actors, better direction, and one of the best choreographers in the business to propel it over anything in its class.  It also means it's a more artistic film and not as over-the-top or as frenetically paced as films it resembles often are.This is a film about emotions, romantic emotions.  Like so many martial arts films there's a long romantic sequence in the film-- but unlike most martial arts films... I found myself caring about the romance and the characters.  The acting and script were way above average.  I never felt like I was in some kind of endurance test (fighting to stay awake) waiting for the next action sequence to begin.  In fact there's enough production value in this film we get some truly epic film moments  a beautiful  desert sequence, and several  breathtaking establishing wide shots which sometimes includes hundreds of extras (or so it seems).The martial arts scenes of characters leaping in the air, running across roof-tops, dancing over water, fighting from tree top to tree top  are not silly... but mesmerizing and beautiful.  Theyare fantasy ballets celebrating the beauty of form and movement utilizing some of the best choreography you'll ever see.The film is about love, betrayal, and honor (of course).  It revolves around the destiny of mercenary swordsman and the Green Destiny sword.  We have charismatic performances from Chow Yun Fat, and Michelle Yeoh, and relative new-comer Zhang Ziyi.The fight choreographer is Yuen Woo-Ping (who is best known for his work in The Matrix). Here his always-superior wire enhanced acrobatic choreography is utterly stunning because computers have erased ever trace of the wires and director Ang Lee has filmed the movements at various speeds and with wide angles with the help and eye of cinematographer Peter Pau. * * * *The chase scenes up walls, across rooftops, and even over water , shot in a graceful slow motion are magical to watch.  There are fight scenes as well which are stages with a grace rarelyseen in martial arts film.  One fight scene in particular ,full of various traditional weaponry is one of the best-staged and exciting fights you'll see on film.Martial arts fight fans won't get blood and gore, and there's only a few moments of humor in action sequences so it won't compare to the Keatonesque comedy of Jackie Chan either.  It is also not the old type of chop-socky highlighting the hand to hand combat of a Bruce Lee.The music and sound effects of the film are wonderfully conceived.  At times we hear only wood blocks drumming, wind chimes, water trickles, the snap of clothing during chase or fight scenes,wind moving through tree tops, through bamboo, the scraping of metal sword against metal sword or bamboo or wood.  Sounds of the elements which sometimes are joined by the slowstrokes of a violin or other string instrument being played with deep longing emotions.The rather spiritual ending  of the film can be interpreted in several ways.  All of them valid. Some may be disappointed by it however.Director Lee takes the time to show us glimpses of Chinese culture and the strong sense of morality and fair play the characters maintain despite their activities.  We get some spirituality from the film, which winds up playing out very much like a Greek tragedy.--Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A256F7E787F5SG	Christopher Nieman	With this film, Ang Lee and his team have created a masterpiece that deserved every accolade and award it received, and more. It's ideal entertainment that doesn't get old after repeated viewings, and it is the convergence of many genuine talents and career-best accomplishments in one package.The DVD is also an excellent addition to any film fan's collection. The widescreen image transfer is outstanding, with bright, sharp detail and vivid color, and the 5.1 surround sound is excellent. It's also generously stocked with extra features, including a very nice extended &quot;interview&quot; with Michelle Yeoh.I liked the commentary track by Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus, although they get a bit too cheeky and aimless at times (especially Schamus). I also felt there should have been more discussion of several key scenes, but that's a common weakness of commentary tracks.The film's credits include Coco Lee's Oscar-nominated song, &quot;A Love Before Time,&quot; which can be heard in either Mandarin or English -- a nice touch.However, the DVD's weakest link is the English dubbing, although on the whole it's well done. At least some of the bad reviews here are from those reacting to the dubbed version. Anyone who chooses to view only the dubbed version is making a mistake.Why? First, the characters are best heard with their natural voices, which lends credence to each scene. I want to hear Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, not fill-ins (Chang Chen's English-dubbed voice makes him sound like a used car salesman). Second, some of the dubbed scenes lack the nuances of the original screenplay. For example, the &quot;legend of the young man&quot; lacks continuity in the dubbed version, so that when the legend is referenced again late in the film, this key scene has none of the impact the subtitled version has.In another scene, when Jen tells Lo to leave her, her mother announces she heard a noise. Jen says in dubbed English, &quot;It's just a bat.&quot; But the original line in Mandarin refers to a &quot;cat&quot; (i.e. Tiger), so the careful irony is lost in the dubbing.But the inevitable faults of dubbing should not harm anyone's enjoyment of this monumental film. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is truly gorgeous and breathtaking -- it's one of those rare moments where every cinematic element comes together just right. Stick with the subtitles, and I think you'll fall in love with it, too.	5.0	A genuine martial arts romance	2002-05-04	5	3	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3E1F4S55JO7DH	Chun-Ta Peng	I've seen this movied for 3 times.  First, I saw the videotape of the movie before it even came to states.  Since it's a copy that didn't come with great quality ( no background music, differnt voice talent ), I was still shocked by its martial sequences.  Second, I saw the movoie in a theather which locates closes to 3rd street (Santa Monica, CA) when CTHD was only released in a limited amount of theaters, I was totally overwhelmed by the score and sound effect that i missed in my first experience.  Third, I finally got to see the movie in a big stadum theater which is close to my house.  All I could hear were &quot;wow&quot;  and &quot;incredible&quot; through the entire movie.Ang Lee again delivered his &quot;kung-fu&quot; (for directing, not for fighting) in making this movie.  As he did in his previous movies, he successfuly added some emotion-conflict touches into this movie.  Unlike other martial-art movies, Ang Lee magically transformed fighting parts into dancing-like scenes with the help from martiak-art director Yuen Wo-Ping ( who earned reputation in America with his success in Matrix).  Some viewers think that the story line is not rich enough.  I think the writeer did a pretty good job at arranging scences, cuz' the movie's just about a TINY section of a Chinese novel. Some viewers think that the subtitle is too annoying.  As a Taiwanese, I think the subtitle palys a big role to lead no-speaking-mandarin viewers to experience the beauty of Chinese culture and  the script  writers Ang Lee and  James Schamus did a heck of job.  James Schamus actually flied back and forth between China and America to meet AngLee for several times to make the subtitles.  Whoever you are, you gotta see this movie.  Rent it, but it, steal it, I don't care how u get it.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2G4G46FUBY3VN	Cortez	With as much praise as this film is getting, any detractors will be accused of 'sour grapes'. But people are making this film out something it isn't -- A serious artistic work. Sure, the productions values are great for this type of film, the acting is sincere, and the soundtrack is beautiful, but the film should have been alot more fun than it actually was. After all, Ang Lee's film takes place in a 'mythical' China. To summarize the complicated story briefly: two warriors, one male (Li Mu Bai, played by Chow Yun Fat, one of the biggest stars in the world) and one female (Yu Shu Lien), have had a long friendship, although they have suppressed their desires for one another out of respect for her dead fianc&eacute;. Li is having second thoughts about his life. A young woman (Jen) comes into their lives who has immense talent as a fighter, but is rebellious and troublesome and keeps company with Li's old enemy, Jade Fox. Jen has an old love (Lo), a bandit, who shows up unexpectedly.One battle or trial follows the other. The various combatants fight on rooftops, in treetops and on water. Some of the effects are impressive, much of it is cheezy. Along the way, Li in particular walks around pompously distributing bits of Taoist wisdom. The director Ang Lee describes it thusly: &quot;The internal strength, which in essence is searching for nothingness, the void, to find your strength.... If you can lose all the tension and direct all your energy to one channel, you create tremendous power and wisdom.&quot; Oh please....this is the kind of stuff one can find in the average self-help guide. The astonishing thing about this film, set in &quot;feudal China&quot;, is the thoroughgoing absence of social commentary or protest. Certainly that was a common feature in Kurosawa's samurai films, for example. Even in the cheezy martial arts film one comes across on late-night television the hero is often defending oppressed villagers or opposing some evil lord or other. Not in Ang Lee's film. The subject matter is borrowed from every trivial, self-absorbed story of the middle class in recent years: a girl struggles with her identity amidst a world of pressures and temptations. The lower classes are kept properly in the background.And then there are reviewers who say that because the women are given equal opportunity (or more) to perform as fighters, that Crouching Tiger makes an &quot;important feminist statement.&quot; Yeah, right, as if those weren't a dime a dozen. Females of the upper classes have lots of defenders. After all, there are women studio executives making millions of dollars and stupid movies just like the men. What a step forward for humanity! Who speaks for the poor and the oppressed in contemporary filmmaking? This is the Ang Lee's own self-important description of the film: &quot;Some may have thought it strange that I could just drop what I normally do and make something like a B-movie. And as I was doing it, there was no escape, I had to bring in drama, I had to bring in women, I had to bring beauty and whatever I felt added quality to it. It became an Ang Lee movie.&quot; And what precisely is that you may ask? A rather amorphous liberal sensibility, combined with a certain technical skill. I find his work insipid. A devotion to the fate of humanity, which one sticks to under all circumstances, is a precondition in our day for serious artistic work. This is NOT what we find here.	2.0	Smug and Self-important	2001-03-20	65	15	50

When you watch this movie, you will notice some weird stuff when the fighting scenes go on. People will start flying like Peter Pan from building to building. If you look at the making of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (it's on the &quot;Special Features&quot; menu), they weren't using computers to make them look like they're flying...they were actually using a group of people to pull on the string so it can look like they're flying (sometimes they use a truck). I don't really find the flying scenes stupid. People say that they look stupid when they fly, but to be honest, It was actually pretty cool. At least they do more fighting than flying. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon focuses more on fighting and drama, and thats a good thing, considering that Chinese movies have good drama in the first place. Now let me change the subject ! When I heard that Chow Yun-Fat was going to be one of the main characters in the movie, I was so desperate to see him in action again, including Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. When I saw them in action, I was very amazed with their fighting routines, including the part when Chow Yun-Fat practices with the Green Destiny sword. If I were you, I'd get this movie before they're fresh out of copies. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a must have !	5.0	The best martial arts movie ever made !	2001-06-20	4	2	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"This film is Ang Lee's homage to martial arts films, and he does a good job.  We follow two aging experts - one male, one female - as they try to find a quiet life for themselves together.  Unfortunately, their old nemesis reappears with an apprentice.  The apprentice has stolen the master's legendary sword and has taught herself (from a stolen manual) the secrets of the Wudan, the martial arts society that is the pinnacle of skill, instructing its students in the art of swordplay, unarmed combat, and ""flying.""The film is visually spectacular.  The scenery of the desert, the bamboo forest, and a recreated 18 century Beijing are all beautifully filmed and provide an epic backdrop.  The fight scenes are also beautiful to behold, well-choreographed, exciting, and oddly realistic, considering the belligerents can defy gravity at will.  The soundtrack, with its staccato drums to emphasize the action and haunting cello meoldies (by Yo Yo Ma), is a perfect accompaniment for the images.Unfortunately, the story itself does not hold up the sections between the fight sequences.  Usually this is not a problem with martial arts movies, as the plot is secondary.  However, in this film more time is spent in exposition than fighting, so we must assume the plot was meant to be important.  There are two glaring problems (for me) that detract from the enjoyment of the film.  The first is the nature of the ""main"" character, the apprentice evil-doer.  The screenplay seems to keep changing its mind - is she the rogue with a heart of gold or a selfish brat that deserves what she gets?  We are left wondering why the old master keeps forgiving her faults, and how she could have made the brigand chief fall in love with her.  Secondly, there is the problem of a 20-minute flashback sequence explaining the love between the apprentice and the brigand chief.  It comes out of nowhere half-way into the film and disrupts the whole flow.  Surely the script should have been reworked to ease into this subplot; as it is, it seems forced on us and we resent it.It's entirely possible that a native Mandarin speaker would not agree with my criticisms.  I know when I watch English movies subtitled in French (or vice versa), the subtlties and nuances do not always translate well, and I'm sure it would be worse crossing a cultural barrier from Euro-American to Chinese.  However, Lee's own ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" was wonderful and had the same potential issue, so I have to think the subtitles are not totally to blame and the fault lies in the script.The commentary on this DVD is quite fun to listen to.  There are tidbits of information that explain why and how the film was made and explaining scenes.  There are also some funny moments, where Schamus is pointing out ""cheesey shots.""  There's also a making-of featurette that is interesting, showing how the stunts were performed with wires.  However, the commentary is the jewel of the DVD edition, aside from the superior sound and video quality that is inherent to the format.Overall, I enjoyed the film, and can see why it was so successful.  However, I was disappointed by the inconsistencies with the apprentice character and the plotting in general, which lowered the film's rating."	3.0	Look ma! No wires!	2002-02-21	7	3	4
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A6D1F7ZEVJK12	Craig Simpson	In Joseph Campbell's classic study &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces,&quot; the author argues that the need for myths lies deeply imbedded in all cultures, and that these myths are, at their core, the same story told over and over again. (Hence their universal appeal.) This argument proves smashingly persuasive in light of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; which is not only the best movie of the year, but a film that taps into classic myths and legends so beautifully and powerfully that it's easy to see why so many viewers are falling in love with it. Much has already been written about the film's links to the Chinese &quot;wuxia&quot; tradition, by people who know much more about it than I do, so I have nothing to add there. I would only say that Arthurian legends, Arabian Nights, witches, Kurosawa and Sergio Leone pictures, and American Westerns also echo throughout this film. Those who claim that &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is based on &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot; are missing the point. All three films derive from the same tradition, and tell, with variations, essentially the same story.Ang Lee has called his film &quot;a dream of China.&quot; He has made a dream of a movie.	5.0	Year of the &quot;Dragon&quot;	2001-01-16	15	15	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2FSCUQP83LP66	CrowTurtle	'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is basically nothing more than cinematic fools gold.Why (seemingly) alot of people and critics were so taken with this movie is really beyond me. For crying out loud - get a grip!!Apparently, at the time, the exotic, sensual and flashy quality of the movie really charmed some people.But don't be swindled by all the razzle-dazzle prettiness of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' - this 'fools gold' is really nothing more than a dreary trip that takes you nowhere.Now if that was the 'moral'/message of the movie - well, it succeeded.p.s.if you decide to see 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' - try seeing 'Support Your Local Sheriff' after (for a good laugh) - you'll need it!!	1.0	Fools Gold	2006-02-10	22	6	16
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AOMD90U7TEAP6	"C.

I am a big fan of Jin Yong's WuXia (KongFu) novels. This movie took KongFu film to a complete new level. People think that this movie is not much different from those they watched before obviously never read any of those novels that attract millions of Chinese.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2L7PSWCY4Q6CG	"C. Yang ""tcky"""	Ang Lee really outdid himself this time. As did the superb cast and crew (both actors and choreographers alike). Always mindful of his role in developing trend-setting works (The Wedding Banquet, Ice Storm, etc.) Ang Lee strives to create a masterpiece that gradually sinks in, like a perfect three-layer cheesecake. And the result is a concoction unlike any treat (or visual feast for that matter) you've sampled.Another interesting aspect of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is the smooth incorporation of martial arts into a tightly-knit, engrossing plot. The crux of the movie is a sword, the Green Destiny, an ancient saber wielded by a hero, and the circumstances surrounding its continual theft and return... (even the subtitles cannot detract from this film's wry humor). With the invaluable sword as the bone of contention, Love, Honor, and Sacrifice are all prominent figures in this struggle, and it is indeed a beautifully epic story.Chow Yun-Fat as the Hero Li Mu Bai has never performed with more zest or passion. Engaging the talents of many many gifted performers, this movie crackles with wit and energy. Chow's supreme mastery of martial arts is not to be understated. Relative newcomer Zhang Ziyi marks the unusual but fresh perspective never-before-seen in a Hong-Kong-style action flick: a female's. Established actress (and accomplished stuntwoman, whose credits include Supercop with Jackie Chan and a superspy in a Bond flick Tomorrow Never Dies) Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien is the perfect foil for the feisty Jen Yu (Zhang), and their relationship is a key focus of the movie. Cheng Pei Pei's performance as Jade Fox is not as heralded as the stars' but essential nonetheless to the thickening of the plot and the wizardry of the action sequences. The connections between the characters is among the most redeeming qualities of this movie. Each scene forwards the plot and keeps the steady momentum going... and makes for great storytelling. The fine acting is one of the most noticable parts of this outstanding movie, and the script is commendable as well.Action- the amount of unbelievable sights and stunts must be seen to be appreciated. Normally, in an action/martial arts film, romance is usually of the sexy-brash variety, not here. Chang Cheng's turn as the leader of a rebel tribe is noteworthy, in that he is seen both in positive and negative lights. Love is a subject constantly broached in this movie- in fact, even a marriage is filmed. Love is what really drives this movie, and there is almost a tenderness to it that contrasts the bitter fighting throughout the movie. The fighting is magnificent, and the excellent choreography by Yuen Wo-Ping  (choreographer of The Matrix) is truly a sight to behold. If you're not a fan of chop-socky action, this fantastic twist on martial arts may change your mind.Adventure is the middle name of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon- as the title suggests, there is always the unknown and the dangerous, but there is also familiarity and beauty. The China this movie portrays is, as Ang Lee himself says, &quot;never existed,&quot; but it is a dream captured on celluloid, and a great achievement. You may still be skeptical. You may not read fast enough for the subtitles. You may even be afraid that it won't be worth the 7 or 8 bucks you shell out or the time it may claim- but I guarantee you, if you have a pulse, if you have an imagination, and if you have a brain, don't pass up one of the best movies of the year~ check out Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon today. You just might end up wishing you had the Green Destiny as well.The reason I bestowed a 5 stars on this particular movie is it's utter breathtaking vision. The directing, acting, martial arts scenes, cinematography, music, and even the elaborate and richly decorated sets are reason enough. Combined, the true grandeur of this movie shines through, and it is a classic, among the best of its genre, and a tremendous achievement.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, is, in a word, Awesome.	5.0	Awesome with a capital &quot;A&quot;	2000-12-26	33	29	4

While some of it was entertaining, it is not a movie I would ever care to watch again. Admittedly, I do not know the folklore involved, but a movie should be able to stand on its own.

However, everyone I know was trying to get me to see it; I thought I'd give it a try(Even though I normally don't go by hype, I still haven't seen &quot;The Gladiator&quot;.) &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is more than an action film but can still be enjoyed that way. It has special effects which aren't just amazing to excite the audience but very beautiful to look at. It has a good script and story line. It has a somewhat spiritual connection. It has many aspects that can work with the average film goer to people like me who go more for Arty films.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ	"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius"""	I'm not sure why I waited so long to watch this critically acclaimed film.  As a martial arts fan, I suppose I was afraid that the actual martial arts action would play second fiddle to both the storyline and the sweeping cinematography.  I needn't have worried because not only is the fighting fast and furious, it involves a style of fighting and use of assorted weapons that aren't typically featured in most of the films I am acquainted with.  The Wutan school of fighting and philosophy holds sway over these characters, making for some of the smoothest and most impressive moves I've ever seen.  The story itself is exciting and compelling, working its themes of duty, maturity, passion, romance, and tragedy flawlessly into the presentation.  The film even managed to be quite unpredictable, and the surprise I felt at the end only added to the emotional effects of the conclusion.Chow Yun-Fat gives a masterful performance as Master Li Mu Bai in this, his first martial arts role.  Michelle Yeoh is equally brilliant as Yu Shu Lien, Li's ally, friend, and true love.  Yu is the heart, Li the soul of this story.  The most impressive and most important performance, though, comes from young Ziyi Zhang; she is simply incredible and brings energy of the rarest form to the big screen in her performance as Jen Yu, a young aristocratic lady with unmatched charms and skills.  A number of dramatic subplots weave a tapestry of magnificent wonders in this martial arts fantasy.  Even I initially questioned the gravity-defying abilities of the characters, but as you watch the film you realize that Ang Lee has in fact given us a work of fantasy, and I can't deny the majesty and rare beauty that the incredible wire work adds to the cinematography.  Of course, the most impressive scenes are the fight scenes.  You don't see a lot of swordplay in martial arts films, but here you have swords, curved knives, poles, and all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons in play.  The actors worked very hard in order to make their performances as realistic as possible, and it shows.While gorgeous, dramatic, and awe-inspiring, this is not a perfect movie.  There is one important flashback in the film that lasts entirely too long, in my opinion, and a second viewing raised a number of questions in my head, particularly in regard to the Wutan traitor and murderess Jade Fox.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, though, a unique motion picture experience, and it has some of the most distinguished cinematography, special effects, and accompanying music ever to grace the silver screen.  The DVD extras are nice, although I was disappointed to find no interviews with Zhang Ziyi included, and I personally gave up on the commentary half-way through because it did not feature a very serious discussion.  This is basically a martial arts film that everyone can enjoy, and the experience is not one you will soon forget.	5.0	A gorgeous, compelling, unforgettable motion picture	2004-03-14	4	3	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2L4DX4AHHCU82	"Danielle Joachim ""avonleabelle"""	This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  This all has to do with the director Ang Lee's ability to create such a moving and visually stunning picture. Also Lee, in a thing never done in a martial arts film before, has the women as the most powerful characters. Now back to the picture aspects of the film, while the picture quality isn't as good as it was on the movie screen I still recommend this movie to anyone.  The extra freatures on this DVD make the less than big screen quality enjoyable.  One nice feature it has is that you can watch the movie in Chinese or in dubbed over English.  Now the dubbed over version kinda makes me think that I'm watching an eposide of iron chef, it is great for kids that don't want to read the subtitles.  So please do your self a favor and watch this movie.	5.0	Don't this great movie &quot;crouch&quot; or stay &quot;hidden&quot; any longer!	2001-07-07	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3KOVFORKXQ2U9	Daniel McInnis	Being as I'm Irish and extremely stubborn, I hate to admit when I'm wrong but in two prior reviews I referred to American Psycho as &quot;the best movie of the early 21st century,&quot; and of Gladiator's Oscar hopes I proclaimed it would be &quot;a more than worthy recipient.&quot;  As it turns out I must recant both of these statements because as of the date they were written I had yet to see the Ang Lee masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It's a film so exquisite that to compare it to even the best of our American movies would be downright insulting.Chow Yun-Fat stars as a legendary warrior preparing for retirement, presumably to settle down and start a family with the sister of his slain master Shu Lien (Michelle Yoeh).  And though their love for eachother is obvious from on the onset, they can't quite summon the courage to speak of their hidden passion.  So Lu Mu Bai (Yun-Fat), unalbe to express himself to Lien, entrusts her with a sacred sword that's to be passed on to a friend, symbolic of his retirement from rouge life. She willingly obliges only to have the sword stolen that very night by a masked intruder.  It's then that we're treated to our first of many fight sequences, so breathtakingly fluent in their beauty that they are literally awe inspiring.Our masked intruder is later revealed to us as being the daughter to the governor, Jen, whose martial arts training has been repressed by her family because of her sex.  Despite this she finds training from Jade Fox, a corrupt disciple of Bai's master whose death he's sworn to avenge, as is customary in their culture.  So the battle lines are drawn, from which the story unfolds, but Lee doesn't bother labeling his characters as &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys.&quot;  It's almost insulting to even suggest, given how multifaceted they all are.Even Jade Fox has her reasons for being as she is.  The daughter of a sexist society, she was denied training, as was Jen.  So she in turn taught herself, secretly observing until her skills were such that she enabled herself to take the life of Bai's master.  To her it seemed a fitting demise to a man who saw women as inferior to himself, and all men for that matter.As the story continues to unfold we come to discover that Jen had an affair with a theif whom she'd met while he and his gang were robbing her.  Being as she's such a great warrior, she gives chase to the gang but their leader, Lo, wants her to himself.  He leads her out into the desert to spar, and it's through their fighting that they're able to express themselves.  As they trade blows their relationship materializes into love, their quarreling an unspoken courtship.Romance, honor, self-respect, female empowerment.  These are universal themes, the power of which can be felt even without subtitles.  The actors faces, which are so expressive, combined with the movies score tells the story as well as any of it's dialogue.  This is important because the rhythmic flow of their exchanges are so absorbing that I'd catch myself getting lost in the moment and forgetting to read the subtext.  But that doesn't diminish my appreciation for a film so engrossing that it seemingly transports you to a time and a place the likes of which you've likely never experienced before.What I find most amazing about this movie is the fact that it's adapted from an obscure Chinese novel.  To think that their heritage is so rich that one of the greatest love stories in the history of literature can nearly be lost forever is simply mind boggling.It's been a humbling task for me to attempt and write a review to a movie which there are no words to describe, at least none that would do it proper justice.  All I can say is that I consider myself lucky to have seen a movie as intensely satisfying as Crouching Tiger come along in my lifetime.

Some of the best on-screen combat I've ever seen with hot, fiesty, sword fightin' chicks and Chow Yun-Fat at his absolute best. The only way you can be underwhelmed by this movie is if you do nothing but watch the greatest fighting movies available or actually live in Hong Kong and get to see them released. I thought Ang Lee's film ""the Ice Storm"" had great potential and beautiful cinematography, so when I heard...that this visual genius got hold of Chow Yun-Fat back in 99, the drooling commenced. When I saw it opening night with my friend Jessica, I refexively blurted out ""Why do American movies suck so bad??"" as I watched that crazy Hong Kong Brit Lee destroy my vision with some of the greatest story telling Chicago's McClurg Court theater had ever seen."	5.0	Easily One of the Best Major Releases of 2000!	2001-08-13	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2DZ73ZOTXXZEJ	Dani Goodnight	Grossly over-hyped and grossly (in my experience) under-whelming, Crouching Tiger is truly this year's American Beauty. Yes, it has its moments. The desert love sequence stays in the mind long after the film has ended: near silence, rich reds, widescreen landscapes and, best of all, not a wire-flying scene in sight. A whole film of that and I'd have been happy. Sadly, I found the rest of the film far too thin - visually and emotionally - to be rescued by the admittedly impressive ground-based fight sequences. (Wire flying, on the other hand, took me straight back to Spielberg's Hook: a horrible place to be taken back to). Yes, a fantastic cast, but Chow Yun Fat had none of the centred threat that he had in, say, The Replacement Killers and Michelle Yeoh had too much plot work to do. In fact, everyone had too much plot work to do. With a film that had the feel of something hacked down from 3 hours, the plot-hole count mounted horribly as the film progressed and the exposition got increasingly frantic. In the end, incredibly, it felt like such a tiny film - incredibly because Ang Lee has shown he can do the wide sweep of narrative and history, Ride With the Devil was truly a gem. This is just cut (hacked?) glass.	2.0	Holes to the left of me	2001-04-03	70	13	57

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1B57JE1UY5P76	David256	This is a hard movie for me to review since I was a big fan of Ang Lee before I saw this for Sense and Sensibility, Eat Drink Man Woman and a couple others. I liked those past 2 movies more, but this is a very good movie. Zhang Ziyi is great in this film actually all the actors do a very good job in it. There are some very good action scenes also with a nice soundtrack. The DVD is good just picture quality isn't the best but this was suppose to be a small film that got produced by sony pictures classic and just got popular on word of mouth. The dvd has good extras Ang lee comentary and making of and others. I think the film plays better with the original Mandarin audio track which you can select with subtitles, since it's all the actors real voices. But some may prefer the English track without subtitles, at least you are given the choice. There are some amazing scenery shots in this film also.	4.0	worth seeing	2004-03-30	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1T633YVOAU1YN	David C. Glebe	"There are scenes in this movie that are so breathtaking, so agonizingly beautiful, and so downright amazing that it's hard to believe that they could have even been conceived, much less realized on film, and with such perfection.  I can see why this film won so many major awards for ""best visuals.""  The subtle framing and depth of shots, the exquisite color, clarity, and composition, and the use of silence or the use of the haunting solo cello or the use of percussion alone, were as mesmerizing as any similar effects I have ever seen.Sure, I know that a lot of people liked this movie mostly because of all the martial arts sequences, including the fantasy scenes where some of the characters have the ability -- because of their advanced Wudan training -- to bound through the air as if floating or flying.  To me, all of that was amusing and exciting, but secondary to the story and to the visual experience.My main problem with the film was that I thought the opening storyline (and long-stifled romance) between Mu Bai and Shu Lien was much more interesting and compelling than the later storyline involving Jen, the young princess/spoiled brat, which is where the movie puts its primary focus.  (I know there was talk of a prequel after this film was released, for people who felt the same way as I do on this point.)At the very beginning, for example, Mu Bai quietly confesses to his true love, Shu Lien, that his advanced meditative training did not lead him to enlightenment, but rather, unexpectedly caused him to become enveloped in an overwhelming sorrow that he could not endure.  And the defeated expression on his face at that point conveys with crystal clarity the deep emotional pain, disappointment, and despair that resulted from his philosophical training.  I wanted to hear more about that, and wanted to see less of the younger Jen and more of these two ""older"" actors, who talked and moved together with such brilliant and understated grace.In any other film, this defect in the movie's focus would have resulted in the bestowal of fewer Amazon ""stars,"" in my boundless subjective wisdom.  But this is no ordinary film.  The visuals were so stunning that, to me, they made up for all other such defects, thus raising my ex cathedra judgment back to the full five stars.I truly hope that this film, which was made in China with Asian actors and crew, will be studied by directors and cinematographers in the years to come."	5.0	"""Soaring"" cinematography"	2012-09-15	4	4	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A19BG1R6YO4SWG	David Chandler	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon goes well beyond the realm of a simple martial arts film, it is an epic that should be held as a classic.  From the landscdapes to the action sequences, the film is beautiful.  Chow Yun-Fat's performance as Li Mu Bai is fantastic.  Michelle Yeoh is his equal, and Ziyi Zhang's star making performance was worth the praise it received.  And as usual, Ang Lee's direction was spot on.I loved the presence that he brought to the screen as the mythical warrior.  He is so in control of every scene that he is in (particually the action scenes).  I recommend this film to any fan of the genre or as an introduction to Asian fimmaking(or Iron Monkey).  As with other Hong Kong films, it may seem a bit schizophrenic, as it goes from action to drama to Greek tragedy, however thats how films are there as the economics of the average film goer in Hong Kong means that they want every thing in a film.  Deserving of all accolades, this is a must see for martial arts fans, cine-philes, and anyone looking to see anything outside of the realm of a predictable Hollywood action film.	5.0	One of the finest Martial Arts films ever made	2002-05-30	3	0	3

The DVD DOES have an advantage over the theatrical version, in that the subtitles are in the black bar and not overtop of the print, so you can see the entire print during the film.  There is also an English subtitle, but I haven't listened to that, because I assume it is not that good.  Don't worry, the film is very accessible with the subtitles.  The extras are decent as well.	5.0	An amazing movie and a great DVD	2001-09-23	3	3	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1UV4599X91PKE	David E. Nedrow Jr.	When Laserdiscs came out, we finally had a format that was dedicated to high quality presentation of movies and other programs. When DVD was introduced, it was hyped as being as far above LD in quality as LD had been above videotape. I wouldn't say the difference was that dramatic but the form factor certainly was better. Then DVDs were coopted by the &quot;Extras&quot; crowd and quality began to suffer badly. By quality, I mean the quality of the only two important features of DVD - video and audio.For each extra added to a title, some amount of space must be subtracted from that left for the video stream. The more extras, the less space you have to encode in. Now, it's pretty common to see even high profile titles with mediocre bit rates. Many former LD people have lamented this shift and have frequently petitioned studios to provide DVDs without extras and WITH high bitrate video (as well as DTS).At least Sony was listening. Even without a &quot;giant screen TV&quot; the enhanced quality of the new Superbit CTHD is evident (I own both versions). By dropping the materials that few viewers watch or use (multiple foreign language tracks, script materials, etc.) Sony has raised the bar on what can be done with DVD. As a longtime LD user who has suffered the DVD format for several years, I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully, other studios will respond with similar releases.If you are planning on purchasing CTHD, the Superbit edition is the way to go.	5.0	Superbit definitely worth the extra two dollars	2001-10-15	6	4	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A5VQF11UIJTHU	David F Sullivan	This has to be the dumbest, most over-rated movie of the 00's so far. People said that it was a lavish spectacle with stunning fight-coreography. Then comes the best part, the emotional side of this film. What the fu...? I must be the only person in the world who missed that part. If I only had this movie to go by, I'd conclude that the Chinese do not have emotions. The dialougue was basically recited, with no inflection or detectable emotion. As for the fights, well there's stunning moves and then there's physically impossible.  We all know that there are some things that you can't learn from Martial Arts.  But with a harness, some pullies, and a blue screen, the sky's the limit.  Joke.Oh yeah, the title. This isn't a new phenomenon. Titles frequently don't translate well into disparate languages. When I was visiting Spain in 1997, &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; was called &quot;Un Pueblo Llamado Dante's Peak.&quot; Now I'll bet &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; sounds brilliant in Chinese. But in English, it just sounds silly. Much like the whole movie.	1.0	WHAT GARBAGE!	2001-09-19	34	5	29
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A36L1F0YECOAW8	David Grant	Many people label 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as a martial arts movie. It is not. Director Ang Lee (the man responsible for such sweeping dramatic films as 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'The Ice Storm') has crafted a moving love story set against mythic lore. The numerous fight scenes are not the basis or definition of this film. The exist because they are within the story, not because they are the story. Lee has always paid fine attention to characters and this is no exception. There are two tales of forbidden love (one through profession, the other through status) and the way it's characters not only reflect but compliment each other is extrodinary. It's actors are startlingly excellent. Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh play two warriors who share feelings for each other, as well as a past hinted at though never explained. They are in love but dare not speak of it to each other. Both are compelling screen presenses who chill and fascinate even when they not speaking a word. Zhang Ziyi plays the delicate governor's daughter who may or may not be more then she appears and Chang Chen is her love, a wild desert pirate who once kidnapped her (their first encounter takes place in a long Sergio Leone style flashback sequence that could serve as a whole film itself). The story involves Li Mu-bai (Yun-fat) who wishes to retire from his warrior ways. In his possession is the sword of the Green Destiny, which he gives to an old friend as a gift. The film kick-starts into high-gear when a thief makes off with the sword, with Yu Shu-lien (Yeoh) in hot pursuit. What follows is pure cinema magic, equal to anything Kurosawa has ever put on the screen. And Lee holds it all together crafting each scene into a masterwork. And what about the fight sequences? They are AMAZING. Characters cling to tree tops, scale walls with the greatest of ease, defy gravity as they leap through the air... all without sacrificing the crucial human and realistic element of the film. Even though they are clearly out of the realm of human ability, we accept them because they are not only very convincingly done but also very fluid and masterfully shot (the scene in which Jen, played by Zhang Ziyi takes on a whole slew of fighters at a saloon could very well be the greatest fight scene ever filmed). 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is an exceptional film that will no doubt be imitated, but it will never be equaled. It is a fantasy film with a human side, a look at pride, love, and honor. And it is the greatest film I have seen in a long, long time. Not only the best film of 2000, but also one of the greatest films ever made.	5.0	One of the greatest film ever made.	2001-03-15	22	19	3

I had no idea of what Monty Python was but when they did it, it was funny. When I saw finally did see a Python skit it seemed flat and well... stupid.I am afraid that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon directed by Ang Lee, and starring Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh had the Python effect on me. The fight scenes I had heard so much about seemed more childish than fanciful and the chases across the rooftops and trees were little better than Peter Pan (where you could see the wires).In addition I had heard that the story was moving and classic. I don't think characters circling around a petulant princess as classic. I found it tiresome and was hoping throughout the film that something awful would happen to her. The only satisfying aspect of the story was the wisdom given to the older characters which was refreshing.All in all Crouching Tiger doesn't please. It leaves you disliking the young heroine and wishing they had spent more time on a truly classic story and less on wires and questionable effects. Listen to the stories from your friends about this movie but don't feel compelled to see it or own it.	3.0	A Victim of Hyperbole	2001-06-07	19	1	18

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A23GFTVIETX7DS	Debbie Lee Wesselmann	I disagree with the reviewers who complain that this movie is nothing more than another martial arts movie.  This movie combines its own mythology with the atmosphere of ancient China and the timeless themes of honor and love.  There's plenty of action for those who like fast paced films, but there's also depth and excellent acting/characterizations for those of us who want to take more away from a movie than a few entertaining hours.To greatly simplify the plot: a business woman who is also a warrior (despite the taboos of both) arrives in Beijing with a legendary sword entrusted to her by the man she loves.  When the sword is stolen, a heart-racing series of events are set into motion.  The sword must be recovered, the culprit caught, order restored. Beneath the surface, the unfilled love between the aging business woman and the owner of the sword simmers, especially as the story of a headstrong young noblewoman unfolds.Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeon, as the platonic and honor-bound couple, play their roles with quiet confidence, giving their characters extraordinary range with the smallest of gestures.  Even newcomer Zhang Ziyi carries her role as the stubborn and talented daughter of a dignitary with aplomb.  Ang Lee has directed a winner that deserves a place among classics.  I am completely amazed at his ability to stage the dramatic battle scenes, evoke an ancient culture, and still inject a tremendous amount of humanity in what is, at its most basic, an action film.  The result is a warm and lyrical tale, visually stunning and heartfelt.I know much has been made of the special effects used to animate the fighting.  To those who say its lack of realism detracts from the movie, I say you missed the point.  The gravity defying leaps and the straight-up-the-wall running highlight the mythology.  We are meant to take these events not only literally but as symbols of something greater.The DVD provides special features that are all well done and interesting, although, as with all DVD's, I wish they were more substantial.I highly recommend this movie.

It is really diverse and entertaining.  I find it odd that no critic seems to have noticed the Star Wars parallels (Or maybe it is more appropriate to say that this movie continues the tradition that inspired Star Wars) which include 3 distinct climatic regions, several cantinas filled with a variety of exotic people, and a mystical warrior with special powers.  But apart from the stunning visuals this movie offers an increadible philosophical position.  Much like the recently released novel &quot;Glorious Failure&quot; by Ben Jonjak, &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; espouses a theory of self-actualization that sounds so perfect that it must be true.

My favorite movies all have something in common:  I can grab the DVD and play it anytime I like and will be thrilled or moved or delighted at least as much as I was the first time I saw it.CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON misses my list because its pacing makes me cringe at the thought of watching it.  Specifically, the extended flashback plastered over the middle of the story just brings the whole thing to a halt.  Parts of it are amusing, and the backstory of Jen and Lo is important to the tale, but it just feels like it's not the same movie to me, especially given Lo's relative unimportance in the bigger story.The ending's a bit anti-climactic, and the most crucial fight scene is too distant from the ending to carry it through on momentum, but the performances are wonderful (avoid the dubbed version--subtitles help preserve the nuance), the cinematography is gorgeous, and the action is unparalleled.Definitely worth renting and maybe even owning, but I don't imagine there are many people who watch this over and over.	4.0	Marvelous film, but something doesn't click.	2002-04-12	8	2	6
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1IO3LVYV5ZMK8	Desmond Chan	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is Lee Ang's one of the most visionary and laudable efforts since Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility. The movie boasts an well-ensembled cast with sublime performances especially from the feisty Jen (Zhang Ziyi) and the subtle, mellow Mu Bai (Chow Yuen Fatt). It is an epic of swordsplay in virtuoso and the bitter legendary world where honor collides with passion, obligations and trust. At first glance, it is not difficult to notice its prime attractions - beautiful cinematography from the award-winning Peter Pau and the energetic and sleek martial arts movements supervised by Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix). However, it defies categorisation of the Wuxia fable to reach deep and dissect each character's emotional trauma and restraint. Michelle Yeoh is casted as Yu Shu Lien, a dignified swordswoman whose destiny criss-crossed with the infamous &quot;Green Destiny&quot;. There she joins forces with Li to find the sword - only to be obstructed by Jen, who aims for power in the Wuxia world.Lee Ang's adaptation of the fable by Wang Du Lu focuses distinctly on the character's development. Jen is trapped by the betrayal of her mentor and her duties to her family; the dramatic tragedy of unrequited romance between Li and Yu - their fates are intertwined by the sword which is the centrestage of the movie. It is at once a human drama tinged with bittersweet regrets for the warring hearts. Enhanced by the poetry of the cinematography and the enchanting score by Tao Dun, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can probably roar and spear ahead in the race for Oscar. It is unequivocally the most refreshing piece of work this year.	5.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is mesmerizing and poignant	2001-03-17	17	12	5

My favorite scene is the one where Jen is spinning upwards two stories in the air. I thought the best acting performance in the movie was by Michelle Yeoh. If I had a dvd player myself, I would get my own copy of this movie just to watch some more of my pretty ziyi. She must have been 19 or just turned 20 when she made this film.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A22BYXPEOOCESM	"Diane Bennack ""karategirl"""	I must say I knew nothing about Chinese Films or Martial Arts, and my husband brought this movie home several times from the rental place before I took the time to actually watch it.  But boy was I surprized!  What I expected to be a long, tedious, boring Chinese martial arts film with subtitles (yuck, I said), turned out to be one of the most beautiful, action-packed cinematic treats I'd seen all year!I must say I was initally taken aback by the almost immediate display of roof-top flying and acrobatic martial arts ( I recognized Matrix-like effects right off the bat--but I couldn't stand that movie because I couldn't follow the story)--in Crouching Tiger these fighting scenes become a wonderful medium to showcase the talents of the stars and the unbelievable techniques now being seen in quite a few films (called 'wire-work').  In CTHD the wonderous ballet and martial arts displays highly enhanced the intricate and sublime emotions surrounding honor, women's roles in 1920's Peking (could be in ANY time), and the intense grip that love of a magical sword and Chow Yan Fat has on each of them.  Once I realized that the movie centered around obtaining the magical ancient sword and it's incredible powers it became much easier for me to understand and I could focus on the charismatic performances and breathtaking scenery.Someone had said that the sequence in the desert depicting Zhang Zi Yi's romance with the wild bandit was boring--far from it!  I thoroughly enjoyed this small slice of romance/love-making!  It reminded me of the old westerns or perhaps Clint Eastwood meets Katharine Hepburn...a tough, beautifully smart and tough well-bred woman with the spirit of a unbroken filly takes on a wild-west gunslinger (no guns, here actually) and falls in love with him despite her hell-bent intent NOT to. Their love story is just a tangent off the main story surrounding the sword, but once it is introduced it becomes an integral part of the movie and the backbone of the intense emotion of the girl and her desire to keep going, keep the sword the win out in the end.All in all I was throughly delighted with this movie, and became oblivious to the Mandarin and didn't mind reading the subtitles at all.  I almost forgot about it, actually...which is proof that the movie is so well made that the language barrier becomes completely insignificant and shouldn't scare off people who think they would not appreciate a Chinese movie with subtitles.  It is sooooo much more than that!  If you like action a la Indian Jones, love stories and beautiful cinematography--get this movie!  Being a woman, I also must say I was entirely pleased to see a movie about incredibly strong women and loved the fact that it centered on these women and their strength, emotionally and PHYSICALLY.  No wimpy women here, or men either.  This movie kept my attention the entire time and I was still thinking about it for weeks after, entranced by it's beauty and magic. It was probably the only foreign film I saw all of last year, and it had to be the best.  A beautiful experience!	5.0	Beautiful Masterpiece	2001-08-03	6	5	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2198FZZMTJ38H	D. Litton	I really hate it when people hype movies up for me. I'm not talking about public hype, or critics reviews or things of that sort; what I'm referring to is the people that tell you that a certain movie is the best movie ever made, and then divulge into the elements of it, drawing you into a conversation about everything that the movie is and what it stands for, and everything that they felt watching the movie, so that after they finally shut up, all you can think about is going to see that movie.This, believe it or not, happened to be the case with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; a movie that everyone and his brother kept telling me about. Now, before everyone starts hounding me for not liking this movie, let me clarify to all of you that I did like it. I found it to be a very good movie, one of the better martial arts films ever. Instead of providing a lame story for the purpose of using the martial arts formula, the backbone is one of passion, adventure, all of which has an overall fantasy-like appearance that draws us in and keeps us in its clutches. But I did expect a little more out of it.Set in 19th century China, the movie begins with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), a well-known warrior, giving his legendary sword, known as the Green Destiny, to his longtime friend, Sir Te. Just as quickly as it arrives, it is stolen from Sir Te, and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who delivered the gift, suspects that the new arrivals residing in Governor Yu's home are responsible. Mu Bai has his own suspicions, which are confirmed when he realizes that the thief is Jade Fox, the powerful female warrior responsible for the death of his master long ago.With her, Fox carries a disciple, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who possesses great fighting capabilities. The movie ventures into a long continuous memory through her eyes, recalling her past love affair with a bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), who returns to rekindle their love. Meanwhile, as the battle for the sword and justice swells, Shu Lien and Mu Bai also recognize their mutual feelings for one another, all mounting to a very emotionally powerful climax where the unexpected suddenly becomes a reality.The movie certainly does prove a point that American-made martial arts films pale sorely in comparison to the grandeur of the stunts and action sequences performed here. Choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, best known for his work on the stunts in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; brings a highly-stylized visual flare to the stunts performed by the actors themselves in this film. While the action and fight sequences are meant to be stunning, they are never totally suspenseful, however, nor do they need to be.This is not a film that's all about swordplay and running across rooftops, even if most people will remember it for such scenes. It's also about the intense passion between the characters and the love they share for one another. Lo and Jen's encounter and budding romance is better than anything I've ever seen in a movie in a very long time; Lo's one line, &quot;I am a man, and I've found the brightest star of all,&quot; sells us on their romance and it's believability. While the romance between Shu Lien and Mu Bai takes a backseat to the heated passion of the aforementioned couple, it is still no less captivating once the final third of the movie plays out.The setting itself is worth the price of admission. China, or nature for that matter, never looked so beautiful and exquisite. The night skies cast blue hues on everything they touch, adding to that dreamy look and feel that the movie gives off. Scenic shots and panoramic views add to the beauty and texture of the setting, while also giving off that fantastical feeling.The movie also portrays a very dignified Chinese society. Their use of common etiquette, even in some fight scenes, is quite intriguing, while their calmness and sense of peace is also portrayed through the characters. Actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi portray their characters with all of these emotions and traits, exuding a peaceful demeanor even in some of the more physically charged scenes. And director Ang Lee made an excellent choice of keeping the movie from ever getting too fast-paced or over-the-top; he knows his pacing, and it's right on the money.So what is it about this movie I didn't like? Nothing, really. Everything about it is epic in nature, the performances are stellar, the martial arts impressive and well-done, the setting lush and breathtaking, and the overall effect tear-jerking at certain moments. What ruined this film experience for me was not the movie itself, but people making it out to be something more than it is, which is no fault of the filmmakers at all. Still, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is an impressive and beautiful achievement.	4.0	Not knowing is the key to total enjoyment.	2001-06-08	7	6	1

Yes, it has incredible martial arts fight scenes, and I'd watch a movie with Michelle Yeoh anyway, but what's the deal with the desert prince.  I'm reminded of another movie that had a COMPLETELY extraneous character in it . . . Star Wars Episode 1 and ole Jar Jar Binks.  You could completely delete the entire desert prince and desert scene from the movie, and it would make absolutely no difference to the outcome, character development, or anything else.  Here's my recommendation, get the movie, edit out the middle 45 minutes of the movie, and then disregard any references to this love interest, and you'd have a pretty good movie.	3.0	A disappointment	2001-09-16	5	0	5

Ang Lee [EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, THE WEDDING BANQUET, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY] did a brilliant job with this modern day masterpiece.  Inspired by the wuxia genre of Chinese film, we see beautiful action sequences, featuring ""flying"" actors and actresses [suspended from seemingly invisible wire], fighting scenes high in the canopies of trees, and even a love story.  This is truly eye popping entertainment and features a wonderfully dynamic and charismatic cast (including Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Chang Cheng).  CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON began a tidal wave of wuxia style film releases in the United States--including THE HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS.

As an individual with Asian descent, I remember hearing my mother talk about stories and tales about martial artists that could climb walls and even fight in a pseudo-flight. Well, this film portrays that fairy tale well and the subtle differences, such as Mandarin versus Cantonese languages, enhance the movies credibility. Most of us Americans might not understand nor appreciate this, but it is important and not to be discounted.The movie is done in sub-titles so it adds to the authenticity. Many of my friends scoffed that the martial arts were faught in the trees and on walls and that the characters could fly. I had to re-explain to them that this is a legend, a tale, a story just as we all have our tales of various heros that are surreal such as Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, etc. If you understand that China has an extremely long history filled with their own mythology, you'll appreciate what this movie strives to achieve. If you want realism in todays world, forget it, you'll not like the movie.I believe that this movie is the best of its kind. If you look at what I've rated, you'll see I do not give many 5 stars out. I reserve those for what I feel are the very best in class. This movie achieves that.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3BHYTRD6OK43N	Dude	People need to stop comparing Matrix to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as if Matrix was the first movie to have fighting scenes with flying people.  Chinese martial arts movies have been doing fight scenes with people flying for years.  Look at Jet Li's earlier movies such as Tai Chi Masters, Last Hero in China, My Father the Hero, and all his other films and Iron Monkey.  Which has similar scenes to Hidden Dragon such as anti gravity jumps over roof tops.  Even though Matrix and Hidden Dragon had the same fight scene coordinator, the difference is that Matrix used computer genrated special effects, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only used ropes and man power.  The reason why people in the US hasn't seen fighting scenes like these is because they will get confused.  They wouldn't understand why people are flying or what makes them fly.  Americans believe that the only reason a person could fly is if he had special powers like Superman or the person is not human or the person has some kind of fairy dust.  In conclusion, stop comparing Matrix to other martial arts movies because Matrix didn't start these type of fighting scenes, Chinese martial arts movies did.	5.0	I like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon	2001-03-11	7	6	1

Though historians have for centuries tried to bury it, the Sticky Rice has for eons played a big part in the development of Kung Fu.  For example, the Shaolin Monks used the preparation of sticky rice as part of their training.  Each monk would individually kick every grain of rice to each other so as to get that soft, gooey texture, go around kicking and punching the ingredients which made the stuffing and even shave their hair off so they could wrap the leaves around their heads to get the right shape when it came to wrapping it all together.So it was a massive disappointment when the Sticky saw the final result.  Sure, the action sequences were cool, them flying around kicking and punching everyone but there was no mention of the Sticky Rice!The only consolidation was that Ang Lee made homage's to classic Sticky Rice movies.  When Chow did his funky healing techniques it was reminded me of the Sticky Rice kid, when Mr Miyagi healed Daniel-san in similar fashion.Let's hope Ang Lee corrects the situation as he embarks on the prequel - Sticky Rice, Groaning Stomach.	4.0	No mention of the rice	2002-02-14	8	0	8
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3TJA90AS6WF9	"Eboucher ""phntmsheep"""	Okay, I am one of those people who did not care for a certain other recent &quot;critically acclaimed cinematic epic&quot;, so I was worried if I would enjoy this film because of its hype....and I honestly did.The action sequences aren't as gratuitous as I had worried prior to watching, they flow nice and you instantly accept the fairy tale flight of these warriors. The plot is very intricate, but easy to follow, as the tale itself is sorta timeless. There are wonderful female characters in this film too and Michelle Yeowh (sp?) does marvelous acting (remember, this is all judged from subtitles and the power of her body language and eyes!).The introduction of characters is nice and the pace of the story flows very nice with the exception of a 20+ minute flashback, however it all ties together in the end wonderfully. You won't find many twists or surprises per se, but the storyline is enough to keep you interested and ponder upon.This is not a fancy kung-fu film. It focuses a lot on emotion and character desire and uses the ninja action to progress the plot.The DVD itself is quite nice and has lots of basic features. The &quot;Making of&quot; documentary was a bit dissapointing if you are looking for how the special effects are done. Apparently, there is also an English over-dub track for those who don't want to read the subtitles. (I discovered this later, but have no regrets for watching the original manderin version). There are also a few basic interviews and filmographies.Special features is not a reason to buy this DVD, the beauty of the widescreen cinematography and score is. When the film ended, I just sat there for a few minutes with a nice film to soak in.	4.0	a rare thought provoking film	2002-01-11	2	2	0

(THAT'S CHINESE, NOT JAPANESE -- I actually read a review that claimed the latter). Anyway, I share the feelings of the majority who recognized that this movie was an elegant,woman-affirming triumph! Beautifully shot, well acted,and THANK GOD for the subtitles! Kudos Ang Lee for allowing us to experience the language of the characters. It added another layer of depth that would have been sorely missed had it been dubbed.Come on guys, ease up on the 'English only' bias.

That said, it is important not to lump the film into any particular genre, in order that it might really be appreciated.If you are just wanting to see Kung Fu, this movie probably isn't for you.  Similarly, if you are counting on the love story to carry the picture, you may also be let down.  To be clear, both the action and love story are wonderful and provide a clever contrast as the action is so exaggerated and the love story so subdued, but neither alone comprise the meaning of the story.I won't spoil that for you if you haven't seen it.Words really cannot describe how much I love this movie.  The cinematography is breathtaking and the score by Yo-yo Ma is perfectly thematic.  Occasionally a movie comes along that is able to make you view your whole life in a new way.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A257VR85JUMSYE	"E. Garcia ""Ozymandias"""	"I have the DVD version and saw this movie in the theater too.  Recently I got the Blu-ray version.  The subtitles of the Blu-ray are very suspicious.  They are significantly different from the DVD/theater.  Why is that?  Also, the subtitle translation for Blu-ray seem very ""Americanized"", as if the studio wanted to make it more accessible, perhaps, to U.S. audiences.  But having got used to the DVD subtitles, and not speaking Chinese, I can't say the subtitles for the DVD or Blu-ray are correct or not, or that one is better than the other.Example: The scene where Jen meets and fights with Li Mu Bai for the first time.  Jen executes a move that astonishes Mu Bai, who exclaims ""Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn the 'Xuan Piu' move?"". Jen's response in the DVD: ""I'm just playing around"".  The blu-ray: ""Piece of cake.""  Now which reply by Jen seems more realistic for that time period, in that part of the world?  It seems more likely that Jen would say she's just playing around, or improvising.  There are two English translations on Blu ray, and they give the same translation, so there's no hunting for the ""better"" version on Blu-ray.Throughout the Blu ray, there are many differences in translation compared to the dvd to make one wonder: which version is more correct, given that something is always ""lost in translation"" from one language to another?  These are glaring differences.  What's on the Blu-ray is very different from the DVD, and just feels wrong.  Anyone else notice this?"	3.0	Blu-ray subtitles suspect	2010-11-24	101	96	5
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3KVOH2BWRI0WW	EGsimi	I have read several of the reviews of this movie, both the good and the bad.  I understand the good, as I gave it 5 stars myself.  I do not understand the bad.  Those that ripped it obviously have a very Immature mindset or were unable to suspend disbelief for the sake of a great movie.  The movie was Deep, moving and very very entertaining.  Sure the warriors in it could fly, so what!  I am quite amazed that the professional ctitics gave it such good reviews because of the fanciful nature of it all.  But of course most all Martial Arts Movies are Fanciful in one way or another, in fact, all movies are fanciful with very very few exception.  If movies were realistic then nobody would go and see them.  We go to the movies to escape reality for a few hours and this movie does that for you brilliantly.  The Acting is beyond adequate but I will not say it is Great, it is simply Very Good.  The action scenes are fun and intense, not overly violent but they depict the struggle of the characters.  The Plot is deep and layered but only if you choose to see the depth, fortunatly that is not necessary to enjoy the movie.  The scenery is breathtaking.  I do not know how much I can say that has not already been said in the reviews before me.  Just that If you hated the movie then you simply did not get it.  It is an action/romance/drama/fantasy movie.  If you want nothing but fight scenes then get a Bruce Lee movie, you will be far more pleased.  I think that for the mature mind open to fanciful expressionism then this movie will please you on all levels.  If you want to see people just getting beat up, or have no interest in the fantastic do not even bother.	5.0	Horrible...if you have no Imagination!!	2001-10-11	5	5	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2NHNFXGL84STJ	"""einmench2"""	This movie is not so great at all.  As a matter of fact when I saw it on video I was only too glad that I did not waste [money] to go see it in the theaters.  It's basically a cheap, and shallow movie.  The characters are all very shallow, you dont really get to know or sympathize with any of them.  In the end I coulda cared less who killed who.  And special effects in the movie dont even make sense.  In some of the fight scenes, they float up into the air, fly over trees and mountains, and are able to run vertically up walls.  Sure these effects where awesome in the Matrix, where they actually made sense in the story line, but this is not the Matrix.  Really, I do not see how or why everyone thinks this is such a great movie. I do not see it at all.  I have no idea how it won those academy awards.  Save your money, there are many better movies out there with some actual depth and meaning to them.  If you haven't seen it yet, dont just go and buy it, rent it first and save yourself the dissapointment from having spend [the price] on such a lame movie.	1.0	Save this movie for when you catch it on a flight.	2002-01-25	19	5	14
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A29TKSIWA3JKF3	Einsatz	Considering all the hype this film has enjoyed over the last decade, I had great anticipation before finally viewing it.  Perhaps that was part of the problem, I expected too much.  I was led to believe this was a masterpiece.  I found something entirely different.The Oscar winning cinematography and art direction were of course superb.  The Oscar winning score supported the story expertly.  I loved Michelle Yeoh, arguably the star of the film (she certainly had the most screen time and did the most with it).  The plot itself though, was a bit limited, in spite of all the talk of a sweeping romance, squared.  Two couples doomed never to be together all because of a sword, revenge, and justice: that about sums it up.  The infamous sword came and went with alarming frequency.  I kept thinking, just let the sword go, it's just a sword.  And as anyone knows, it's the one who wields it, not the sword itself, that makes it a weapon to be reckoned with.  The thief, of course, was obvious.  The ending was expected.  The fight sequences were long and repetitious (their `flying' looked more like skimming).  The abrupt desert flashback completely blocked the flow of the story up to that point.  The character of the spoiled aristocrat (Zhang Ziyi) was obnoxious, difficult to watch.  Maybe I blinked and missed it, was it ever explained why she was so desperate to have the sword?  What was her plan, other than not to be married?  For the most part that's all I did while watching this film, wonder why they were doing half the things they were, most of which felt contrived, flimsy excuses to set up another gravity defying fight sequence.I didn't hate this movie, that's something anyway.  I did admire a lot of it, but not enough to want to see it ever again.  Not a keeper.	3.0	Fly as you might, sooner or later you have to come down	2011-06-16	3	0	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3CN11WFE5FT8H	E&J's Mom	Definitely one of my top ten movies.If you are one of the few people that has not seen this incredible film, please give it a try. It has everything: action, romance, culture, good vs. evil with shades of gray, magic, and mystery. If you start off with viewing this film as a Chinese fairy tale, then you will be in the right mood for the surprises. Recommended for men, women, and even children 13+ (there are only two gruesome moments, no swearing, no nudity, and the sexual content is limited to kissing with implied sex). Watch it and be swept away!- side note: I personally enjoy the subtle themes of honor, heroism, and apprenticeship.	5.0	Amazing!	2014-05-31	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A29K5IBSUJAJOB	Elizabeth A. Schuster	THE GOOD: It looks pretty and...well, I guess it's an epic, if by epic you mean long and set in midevil times.THE BAD: Where shall I start? The dialouge...it's really bad. Sure, it's a dub, but this isn't a Godzilla movie...this is a HIGH PROFILE movie (or so I'm led to believe) so I don't feel guilty about ripping into it for that. There were a few good fight scenes, but the flying was just stupid! When I heard that the actors &quot;flew&quot; I figured it just meant they jumped a lot higher than most people can, like scaling small buildings or flipping over people. Stuff like that. No, they really FLY, like Peter Pan. It's really stupid. The fight scenes also just aren't...adrenaline charged. There's no fast-paced backflips and people getting countered and jacked with awesome punches and kicks, it's mostly fighting with aluminum swords. The movie looks pretty, but it looks like a pretty B movie. The plot is too long and it wanders all over the place. There's no real pressing problem, just a few minor annoyances that people are trying to patch up. The villain does nothing to redeem the sad state that the movie villian has fallen into. I like to think that I'm more patient than your average Joe moviewise, but...this movie was too long and too bizarre. The director was either trying to create a personal vision, or it was for people with radically differant tastes. Most likely the latter. But that doesn't change the fact that I don't like it.	2.0	It's hard to be objective, but...	2001-09-17	17	4	13
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3L1BSFXRMCJE4	elizabeth herrin	"This epic is the best movie I have ever seen. I had my doubts about it. It is in a foreign language and it was only my second time to see a foreign film with subtitles.  I noticed that some persons writing reviews did not care for the movie. Their number one complaint was that the film was/is boring. It is too easy and too comfortable a response but a predictable response. We are conditioned to be instantly gratified by movies that contain gratuitious acts and if something is not blowing up then our attention is lost.  Not to say that I don't enjoy movies where there is hot passion and things blowing up. Die Hard, Animal House and the like are excellent movies. But, we need to let ourselves pick up on the nuances of romance, and the intuitiveness of movies as well. They don't have to smack us in the face with explosions and predictable love stories in order to hold our attention. Or, I guess for some of us, they do. If those of you who were ""bored"" by this movie would only stay home and watch All My Children and reruns of Hunter and TJ Hooker, you would be much happier.  I read that one person actually thought this was an action movie and based his opinion from that perspective.  I found so many aspects of this movie touching,magical,appealing. I will admit that you have to pay attention to details and nuances of the characters in order to get the full experience.  This movie is a mix of Gone With The Wind meets The Matrix."	5.0	Best Movie Ever	2001-05-18	26	20	6

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1WQ2PMJKCHY4T	Emma	This is my favourite film of 2000 I have to say. I've heard that many people found the plot of this movie very confusing but I think if you concentrate on the movie and pay proper attention to it you shouldn't have any problems. This movie has elements of many genres in it and would suit practically anyone's tastes. It's a love story but don't worry if you're not into that sort of thing the action scenes more than make up for it. There are many people who think that the action scenes aren't up to scratch with the action scenes of a traditional Hong Kong martial arts fantasy film. I disagree however but if you haven't been exposed to many of these films it wouldn't matter at all. Also, I wouldn't miss seeing this film just because it doesn't fit in with the traditional conventions of the genre. I guess as a person who does not speak Chinese I can't place a judgement on the acting in the sense of the general expression of speech of this film but to me it didn't seem to matter, the actors were able to convey all of their emotions not with their voice but with their facial expressions particularly their eyes. Everything about this film is beautiful from the costumes right down to the harsh scenery of the desert. The action sequences are great and I enjoyed the magical/fantasy element of the film, ie the flying and the ending of the film which I don't want to spoil for people who haven't seen it.  This DVD hasn't got a particularly fantastic treatment to it, although the making of featurette is good for fanatics of the film or people who tend to have an interest in the making of films. As per usual the actors bios aren't really great at all but once again the interview with Michelle Yeoh is good for people with an interest in the behind the scenes of the movie. The DVD also comes with a fairly informative booklet with a plot synopsis, quotes from Ang Lee and from the actors as well as some great stills from the movie as well as stills from the making of the movie. I think though if you want to get the full widescreen effect of the film buy it on DVD. It's well worth it and Ang Lee has done a fantasic job, so have the actors. Also, just so you get an idea of what type of martial arts sequences there are, the martial arts choreography has been done by Woo Ping, the same man who choreographed the sequences for the Matrix.  A lot of time and dedication on behalf of the crew and cast has obviously been put into this film and it's definitely been worth it. Warning for parents, there is a sex scene in the film, so cover your kiddies eyes! Happy watching!	4.0	Fantastic Film!!	2001-08-17	3	1	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW	Eric Anderson	It is great to see a subtitled film get so much attention. Hopefully this will serve as a precursor for a broader interest in foreign film as so few theaters are able to take them up for any amount of time. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great success because it is able to combine so many elements of what make a good film so seamlessly well. It is a perfect mixture of comedy, adventure and romance. The acting, cinematography and directing are stunningly good.  The lush landscape is a perfect backdrop for the mythic feel of the story. The fights are excellently choreographed and breathtaking to watch.The story is simple. There is a legendary sword called the Green Destiny that is stolen. It is subsequently regained and stolen again. A legendary fighter wants to become the mentor of a temperamental but talented upper-class girl who is secretly the student of his archenemy. The story focuses on her misadventures and emotional growth.  There are side stories including the revenge of a slain mother and the life-long romance between the legendary fighter and his skilled female friend. Such coming of age stories of female independence have begun to be tedious, but the mixture of comedy in the story line and intense excitement of the action scenes proves this story to be tremendously engaging. The flashback scene to the desert has been criticised for being misplaced in the narrative, but I found it to be simultaneously a great piece of comedy and a heartfelt romantic union. Certainly the scene of Zhang Ziyi slicing the pompous names out of the men in the public drinking house is one of the funniest in film. You may be wondering at first when the action is going to start with all the initial back-story, but once it starts there is no stopping it. The scene of Zhang and Chow fighting amidst the bamboo branches is beautifully done. Whether you are a fan of martial arts or not you will find yourself swept away by the adventure and romance of this tale.  It is nothing but a masterpiece.	5.0	Crouching Subtitles, Hidden Beauty	2001-01-11	14	12	2

There was so much visual beauty throughout the picture, I was sometimes annoyed that the screen was cluttered with subtitles and I spent more time reading than being immersed in the story.The dub was actually the best I have ever heard (I mostly watch asian films in their native languages, anyway), and at no point was I bothered by the lack of synchronicity between mouths and voices.  In fact, I watched many parts repeatedly, confused by the way the voice over seemed to match their facial articulations so perfectly.  While I still enjoy the movie in Mandarin, the English version allows me a greater level of immersion and wiling suspension of disbelief.  I highly recommend watching it in this format at least once, and would advise first-time english viewers to watch it this way to give greater attention to the visuals.	5.0	English voice over actually enhanced enjoyment	2001-12-13	2	2	0

But it is a real masterpiece (not a term I use lightly), using action sequences reminiscent of the Matrix with a story line that seamlessly blends intelligence, tragedy, romance, and breathtaking cinematography. It combines to produce a film that won't easily be forgotten.The DVD package helps make up for some of what must be lost in not seeing the film on the wide screen. The director's comments played over the film show Ang Lee's enthusiasm for this effort, the 20-minute feature on the making of the film shows the unbelievable amount of work that went into creating a film that appears effortless, and the short interview with Michelle Yeoh -- which is probably the weakest of the special features -- is nonetheless informative and entertaining. It's even worth checking out the various trailers to see how the film was packaged in different markets, though I blame all the PR people involved in the marketing of the film for focusing too much on the action and too little on the film's finer elements.	5.0	Any more where this came from?	2003-08-02	4	4	0

I'm not a martial arts expert, but I can tell that this is simply a masterpiece. It's brilliant from beginning to end: the fight scenes, the breathtaking scenery, the haunting music, the realistic sets/buildings, and even the occasional bits of humor. This is not your usual Bruce Lee martial arts flick, where silliness pretty much plays a dominant role in the action. Here the action scenes, as well as the dramatic scenes, are done with beautiful skill and are taken very seriously. Every single actor in this film (Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei, etc.) do an extraordinary job, while director Ang Lee tells the story with his own uniquely artistic craft. It's safe to say that I really like this movie, even if it isn't really one of my personal favorites.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2SRZQU1SZG4RR	"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower"""	"Quite the perfect film ... So many elements combine to keep the viewer mesmerized. The exotic scenery of ancient Chinese cultural life hook the imagination. The forces of good and evil battle directly in society and within the souls of the characters. There are underlying esoteric elements which make the story mysterious and provide for surprises and unexpected but deeply satisfying viewing moments from beginning to end. The yin-yang conflicts between various characters provide the romantic see-saw that captures the reader's interest. A highly regarded warrior who defends against evil has reached a point in his life where he relinquishes his famous and feared sword, ""The Green Destiny"" to discover and explore deeper aspects of himself and life ... At some point, he had gone into a deep meditation and arrived at a place his master had never mentioned nor described. Later, his master had been murdered and the warrior could not ask him to explain this experience. He has a female protaganist who is also a warrior and accepts the solitary nature of this fighter but clearly they share strong emotional bonds. This repressed chemistry promises their paths will continually cross as they explore the depth and meaning of strong feelings throughout the film. She delivers ""the Green Destiny"" as a gift to the local magistrate/governor of the province for safe keeping. The magistrate has a daughter who is being prepared for an arranged marriage ... to consolidate the interests of two ruling families ... Hidden aspects of the daughter's character provide for unexpected adventure and romance ...Secretly, the daugher had learned warrior skills and longed to express this independent aspect of herself ... but she lacks the personal understanding of the esoteric nature of this lifestyle. On a carriage ride with her family through the mountains and arid deserts she is captivated by an invading group of bandits, especially the leader who is young and handsome and has a mysterious reputation. He grabs her ivory hair comb as she leans fearlessly out the carriage window to watch the assualt. She unexpectedly jumps out, mounts a horse and shows remarkable skills during the chase scene ... all to retrieve back her hair comb. He captures her and takes her to his mountain cave home ... they fall in love. He tells her stories and allegories which serve to bind her even closer to him ...The forces of evil are embodied in the form of Jade Fox who was a servant and nanny to the wealthy Chinese daughter in the past. Jade Fox had acquired a book from which she learned the warrior skills but she failed to use the skills wisely. She lashes out with vengeance at the forces of good. The author's creativity and exceptional talents come alive on the screen. The hair-pin curves and twists in the plot are executed with perfection.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1T0Z4J5PPLTC7	"Erik F ""Master of Funk and Evil"""	I regret having missed this when it was in theaters, having avoided it assuming it would just be &quot;Merchant Ivory goes Asian.&quot;  Bummer!  This is one of the most astounding things I've seen in a long time.  It's part martial-arts/date movie, part courtly love story/martial-arts movie, if that makes any sense.  The fight scenes have to be the most incredible I've ever seen, and they're couched in such a great plot, and with some of the most beautiful settings.  For all the fighting, none of it comes off as gratuitous because it's all choreographed like a ballet, and there's conspicuously little bloodshed.Oh, and at some point, Chow Yun-Fat grew straight out of his annoying Hollywood sneer and into the role of a wise master.  The real star, however, has to be Ms. Zhang.  The restarant scene (&quot;I am the invincible sword godess!&quot;) is worth the price of admission alone.On dvd, this film looks just spiffy.  The picture is good and clear without any visible edge enhancement, and the colors (which Ang Lee uses to great effect) are vivid without being over-saturated.  The audio, especially the really cool music by Yo-Yo Ma, is perfectly clear.My only gripe, and it's a small one, is with the relatively anemic extras.  The commentary's nice, but it mentions twenty minutes of cut scenes, none of which are on this disc.  There's a neat television documentary that shows how some of the choreography was done, and there's also a suprisingly good English-language dub, although I prefer the Mandarin with subtitles.  What I would have loved to see, however, are extra-angle options for the fencing scenes, especially the treetop scene at the climax (which looks beautiful on this dvd, btw).  Still, this is a good solid transfer of a great film.	4.0	A beautiful film on so many levels...	2001-08-20	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1ROYTFVKXZUY5	E. Smith	"I enjoy Martial Arts films. I like them. They're entertaining. I will admit, however, that many of them lack a decent plotline and good acting. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", however, is not one of those films.It is, quite simply, a work of art. A masterpiece. It's fantastic.The plot is strong, and relatively easy to follow. The acting is superb. Chow Yun Fat is great, but I'd say the real revelation of this movie is the great Michelle Yeoh. The emotion that is found in her eyes in unreal. The entire story is right there in her face. She expresses everything so beautifully and is the ultimate heroine of this movie. She's incredible. I feel that she really carries this film. The ending is fabulous, and Yeoh couldn't have done a better job.Zhang Ziyi is also very good, and pretty young in this film. She comes off as a bit of a brat, but she redeems herself, and the chemistry between her, Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat is excellent.All three actors really make you feel the emotion and tension, which is important, seeing as how you're reading subtitles the entire movie.The cinematography can't be beat. It's gorgeous. Ang Lee is a master, and he proves it in this film. The fighting in the bamboo trees is unbelievable. The way the movie is shot/edited etc. seems very artsy to me, and very beautiful.As for the stunts, well, what can we say? Michelle Yeoh herself is a master, so already you know the stunts are going to be great. People are bouncing on rooftops, flipping off of walls, jumping through the trees, swinging huge swords around, it's unreal. The stunts are pretty jaw-dropping at times, and there's no CGI involved. It's all real action with wires and all of that. It's amazing, and honestly, even if you don't like the story, it's worth it to watch for the action and the cinematography.Joel Siegal of Good Morning America stated that this could be one of the greatest movies ever made. Joel, I'd have to agree. All in all, probably my all-time favorite movie, and most definitely my all-time favorite martial arts flick. Great story, fabulous acting, jaw-dropping stunts, it's all there. The movie has it all. No wonder it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards(nominated for 4). It deserved it."	5.0	Simply a work of art.	2006-04-01	5	5	0

If at all, it should have been for best actress! Hers was the character around which the others revolve.I could see this film over and over again: Once at least, to soak in the drama, action and atmosphere; once to savour the poetic Mandarin dialogue (such as: Jen, ""And this little boy who fails to find his star turns instead to stealing my comb."" Lo, ""I'm a man now, and I've found myself the brightest star.""); once just to wallow in the haunting score; and once to focus on Zhang Ziyi alone ...... her sweet curious innocence as an aristocrat's daughter ...  her poise yet potency in battle ... her tearful defiance under the strain of force from her pursuers ... her petulant pout ... and her feeble resistance to submission while in a drug-induced stupor - I just love that scene of her eyes welling in tears as she was on the verge of being unveiled.No, the Oscar will not stand up to your talent, Ziyi, and this is only your second film!

Others do it for its art. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; comes to remind us all that a motion picture can perfectly combine these two elements, can both entertain and enchant.Director Ang Lee maestry takes us to a journey through a visionary world of tigers and dragons where our imagination, our emotions and dreams come true. The cinematography is magic and sublime. The soundtrack epic and triumphant. The performances truly emotional, specially by Michelle Yeoh. And the story is simply extraordinary.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AEMF8YUXYN6W5	"""fan-review"""	Vexed is a good word to describe my initial reaction after seeing it in the theatres.  After having purchased the DVD and having watched this wondrous movie several times, I've come to the conclusion that this movie is a true EPIC, in the purest sense of the word.  This is a tale of parallel love stories.  Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's love is tragically romantic.  Eastern cultural laws force their passion to remain unfulfilled.  This subplot really did break my heart.  Just when it appeared they may ignore tradition, tragedy strikes in the third act of the movie.  The Young couple's love is heft with potential yet unfulfilled due to one's greater love to fulfill her destiny as the &quot;Hidden Dragon&quot;.  A mix of confuscius, Aesop and &quot;Love Story&quot; told through Ang Lee's remarkable cinematography and near flaw-less fight sequence direction.Oh and lest I forget...the action sequences are amazing.  The two female leads have the most incredible swort fight shot in a &quot;MORTAL KOMBAT&quot; videogame camera-angle.  The fight-sequence execution by the stars are superior to any movie I've seen.The DVD has the standard features of a premium DVD: featurette on the making of, commentary, and some other tid-bits.  Not as remarkable as THE MATRIX for features, but more than acceptable.I recommend this movie to EVERYONE.  But do watch this movie many times over to truly capture the greatness.	5.0	The more you watch, the better it gets.	2001-06-30	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1D22QO0QX9WSH	"""fellinigreenaway"""	First of all, I would like to say that I am a major fan of foreign films, and to see one grasp the public's eye and make as much money as CTHD did, is a thrill.However, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that this didn't feel foreign.  Exotic, perhaps, but influenced by Americans.  Ang Lee is a great Oriental director, but he is ironically better off portraying 70's American suburbia (in The Ice Storm, his masterpiece) and English Austen territory in Sense and Sensibility.  I didn't feel that his direction of CTHD was nearly as tight as it was in his other films.  There were scenes that seemed excessive, significantly dragging down the pace of the entire film.All that said, this film is exciting and radiant.  I've never seen better performances from the leads, and the much-discussed action sequences are just as breathtaking as you've heard they are.  But it still isn't the best film of the year, and I'd give the Foreign Award to Yi Yi, a film that I feel is much more &quot;foreign&quot; in its origins than CTHD.	3.0	Overrated	2001-06-07	8	2	6
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3EMNL3ANIXLNC	"""fgranath"""	I do not know whether Columbia TriStar will distribute this title in the States when the time comes, but they distributed the Hong Kong version of this, 2000s most original, beautiful, exciting and breathtaking movie.  The features found on the Hong Kong disc are plentiful and also very well produced. There is a 15 minute interview with lead actres Michelle Yeoh, an extensive gallery of pictures from the making of the movie, a very informative and fun commentary by director Ang Lee and producer/scribe James Schamus.  The menus are animated but it takes slightly too long for them to finish, which can be annoying. Beside the usual trailer, the DVD also features the music video for &quot;A Love Before Time&quot; by Coco Lee, both in Mandarin and in English. There is an English voice track for the movie, which is not recommended, listen to the original instead and use subtitles.  So please, here my plea: Keep these features on the American disc, and add some things that are missing, like a making-of featurette and more extensive talent files.All in all, a great disc and a great movie.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3I08KKML19HC6	FilmMan	Ok, I am here to praise and to criticize this movie. First, let me make a very clear point. This is a &quot;Wusia&quot; (martial art fantasy) film, not a kung-fu movie. If you expect to see Jet Lee or Jackie....go to another place. We are talking about &quot;Fantasy&quot; here. I believe most of Chinese have seen Martial Art Fantasy novels. Characters in those novel not only can fly, can jump higher than Michael Jordan, they can also break rocks by their Chi (Internal Power). So judging this movie with some third-graded Hong Kong Martial Art films (well, there were some nice ones I wouldn't deny, but lots of them are just like Die Hard, but with a hero who can fight in style).........you got to be kidding me.This movie is about the art of motion, background music and poetic dialogue (not including little tiger, he is the worst actor I have ever seen). It is hard for people to understand, not even today's Chinese (they have been &quot;hollywoodized&quot;). I also like the conflict between each characters. For example, how Little Dragon (Yu-Jiou-long, or Jenn) struggled with Little Tiger, then Li, Mu-bai (Chow, Yan-fat) and the Sho-lien. For Little Tiger, Little Dragon hated him for stealing her stuff, then accepted the affection. For Sho-lien, Little Dragon first admired her, then fought Sho-lien because of different belief, jealousy and embarrassment......(tired of explaining, just watch the film few more times)No film is perfect, including this movie. First, the accent of Chow Yan-fat, Michelle Yeoh (from Hong Kong) and Chang Jan (from Taiwan) are soooo bad compare to Zhang's. And the suicide at the end, Little Dragon was trying fake death (at least in the original novel) and the film said nothing about it. Then horrible acting by Chang Jan just made me laugh. Also, the bamboo scenes were not very good, because both of them were not balancing well (even a real wu-shu master will scare of height?)Otherwise, this film is very entertaining and poetic. Even some parts are so disturbing, I will still give it a four-star. By the way, wanna see a really good movie from Asia, check out Taiwan owned Confuscion Confusion (Du li shi dai), and City of Sadness (bae ching chun shi).	4.0	You see no Tigers and you won't see a dragon	2001-07-18	10	9	1

I just thank god that this wonderful masterpiece wasn't dubbed into  english like many other foreign films, because that would've been a low blow. The acting is marvelous and the fight scenes are off the wall (pardon the pun). Not always do wild visuals work in movies, but this isn't your regular martial arts film! It's more like a Martial WORK of ART! The performances by the three leads and a co starring performance by an elderly, but dangerous woman make this film a breathtaking thrillride! ... but the only thing in this film that I didn't connect with was the flying aspect. Sometimes the stars jumped a little toooo far for my taste when hopping building to building!

I don't, so I didn't. At some point I was misled into thinking this movie would appeal to me. Can't remember why, other than the fact that it features Chow Yun Fat. But this film in no way resembles ""Anna & the King"" (huge understatement). The cinematography is quite good, but that's not enough to sustain my attention for two hours.Sometimes I fear that when this Boomer is too old and frail to be anywhere but in a nursing home, I'll be stuck in the dayroom watching movies such as this, as I'll be too confused and feeble to protest. At least with the non-English dialogue, however, it will be easier to ignore. In fact, I'm ignoring it right now as I type this. I found myself hoping that Idina Menzel would suddenly appear singing ""Defying Gravity"", but despairing of that likelihood, I've given up on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""."	2.0	Crouching Under the Sofa	2005-09-12	5	2	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3CWH6VKCTJAD	"""flickjunkie"""	This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon).  There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can&#8217;t seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, &#8220;Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.&#8221;On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).  By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn&#8217;t commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li&#8217;s desire to mentor Jen, Jen&#8217;s relationship with Jade Fox, Jen&#8217;s relationship with Yu, Jen&#8217;s progress as a warrior, Jen&#8217;s adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen&#8217;s pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn&#8217;t add that much to the main themes.The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its ... U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like &#8220;Scary Movie&#8221; exemplify).  Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing.	4.0	Jackie Chan meets Peter Pan	2001-07-29	3	2	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2M33FZFD3LYMH	Fredric Pierce	"OK, where do I start? Crouching Tiger was a totally new kind of film, for me. It is a martial arts movie, and yet, it is so complex and deep. It really can't be put in the same category as Bruce Lee or Van Damme. The fighting scenes are somehow more dance-like, dreamy, actually very artistically interesting.I think it falls more into the category of fantasy, but , like any good art, is really hard to classify.The characters are complex with deep conflicts, powerful motivations and difficult choices.  It's never clear exactly what each one will do, or why. The story is full of twists and turns all presented in a beautiful Chinese fairy tale.  I am not a film scholar, but I am a fan of great films, and I really enjoy watching this.I have only seen Michelle Yeoh in this film and Tomorrow Never Dies. She really shows her acting ability here. She is quite good! Her character is full of pain and regret, yet driven by a deep sense of commitment and duty. She is strong, tough and vulnerable. Nicely done.Yun-Fat Chow is a fine actor and does this part well. His strength and resolve are beautifully touched with a genuine tenderness.Ziyi Zhang is brilliant. She is proud, spoiled, strong and foolish. She thinks she knows so much and really understands so little. The story really revolves around her. She is the eye of the storm, so to speak.Chen Chang is wonderful as the carefree, ruthless bandit who falls hopelessly in love.There is vastly better acting here, than I expected in a martial arts movie. The story is infinitely more absorbing than could be expected in that category. Ang Lee is clearly a major master of fine film making.One other thing I want to say, is that I wish more fine films were available in the Superbit collection. I am really getting tired of all that ""bonus material."" I find it all so boring and distracting. After I spend a couple hours watching ""The Making Of...,"" or ""Deleted Scenes,"" or ""Behind the Scenes..."" I feel like I've wasted so much time. Superbit eliminates all those pointless extras and concentrates on presentation quality. I find that refreshing.  When I put the disc in the player, all I want to do is watch a great movie.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2Z1K2I2EYSKFA	FrontPage	Over 948 reviews for CTHD (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) means that this review may reiterate what others have probably written.The scenes in this movie can be appreciated for their beauty by trying to find a large screen projection monitor to view this epic story on. I feel that the Chinese culture can easily be kept from western eyes, but Ang Lee's vision and sensitivity gives us a sense of the passion and pride that is felt towards traditional Chinese customs. I was impressed with the way Lee directed how the players' very glances and expressions showed feelings that words could never explain.It's quite difficult for me to express how moving CTHD was to watch. I love a good action flick, but I was amazed at how subtle glances draw out a subplot of two people struggling to express their feelings. As the movie progressed, I became more interested in the relationships that the different couples involved had developed. And shockingly, it was a love triangle, with the Green Destiny sword playing the part of the desired object of affection.The music of composer Tan Dun wound up placing CTHD onto a higher plateau. It's quite a unique and special score for the movie. And Yo Yo Ma's cello performances are stellar. Overall, the sound quality is pristine, and can be enjoyed on most speakers, so don't worry aboout needing reference equipment to enjoy the DVD. Stereo separation with the Dolby Digital 5.1 is quite remarkable. If you do have quality speakers, you'll be blown away.The video quality is well- transferred from the original print, which is necessary with the number of night scenes that were filmed. The blacks are deep, the highlights are not washed out and the colors and hues are rich and wonderfully saturated.For those of you who haven't experienced CTHD in a theater, find someone who has the largest television or projection monitor that you can find and watch it there. You can appreciate the details in filming, including the exquisite landscapes and textures, but you miss something if you're watching on a smaller unit. Heck, bring your DVD into a place like Circuit City or the Big Screen Store and ask a worker to pop it in a player to let you see the video in a larger screen.A parting word of advice: Yes, the stunts showing people running across water, along the sides of buildings and amongst the tree tops is impossible. Keep in mind that this film is based on stories of ancient Chinese folklore and legend, which is larger than life.

There are plots and subplots all melded seamlessly. The graceful ease with which the actors fly about makes the action all the more surreal. The women are treated as equals and more, their fierceness in battle shatters the stereotype of asian women. The scenery is simply incredible, the director obviously had a wealth of settings to choose from and the choices are spectacular.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2A7SO6BBYM13F	Garvinstomp	"Now, I know a lot of people don't love this movie. But hear me out before you disagree.I acknowledge that this film was made with a western audience in mind. That means that as a typical wuxia film it is watered-down by comparison. It was also apparent that they tried to do a lot with the script, probably too much, so as to please the arthouse crowd.Because of those things I can't review it as a traditional HK film. Also, this movie was the final part in a three-part process that was absolutely critical to American cinema.Part 1: The introduction of Jet, Jackie, Michelle, John, Chow, Tsui and Ringo to American audiences. It got them used to seeing the kung fu, the wires, and stylistic, kinetic bullet ballet.Part 2: ""The Matrix"". ""The Matrix"" took HK choreography, wires and all, and made it mainstream acceptable. Sure, a lot of our directors tried it and failed, but at least the audience was ready for it (and even now anticipating it).Part 3: ""Crouching Tiger"". A full Asian film, starring Asian actors, loaded with HK choreography and stylish wirework. A film that 5 years prior would have been an arthouse flick, at best, was now a mainstream, widely accepted, critically acclaimed, award winning film. This film finally made it acceptable to import more and more of HK to our shores.Look at what has happened since this film came out. Look how many more Asian action films find their way to our theaters...and not just the little theaters. We've been given Dragon Dynasty so we can get great picture quality, no editing to our movies, subtitles that actually mean something, and extras that have translation to them. Asian re-makes are all the rage in the US. And on and on. . .As an up and coming filmmaker who grew up watching all the great classic asian action films, it is now acceptable for me to incorporate a true HK style into my work. When I tell the studio I want to hang 2 of my actors from wires and have them fly around fighting one another, there's no fights or strange looks. Hellboy 2 was loaded with wire work. And we owe it all to CTHD.Besides that I do enjoy the film immensely. I got a little choked-up during the first fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi when people in the theater were cheering, watching something I'd known existed for decades. Better late than never.Wo Ping is a true artist, and CTHD gave him the talent and the leeway to create- talent and leeway that the Matrix was lacking. The visuals are spectacular. The performances are incredible. I always liken Chow to Morgan Freeman. No matter what role they play, they always bring a certain degree of respect and sophistication, with just a hint of the regal, to it.It is a fantastic movie. And more than that, it is an important movie. No, it is not pure HK. It is watered-down and it does have its flaws. But I love it and I will always be grateful to it for the doors it opened."	5.0	Very accessible with a broad appeal, deeply influential in bringing asian style to western films. . .. . .	2008-09-14	3	2	1

In order to enjoy art one must have at least a minimal level of imagination....and if you cant suspend yoru disbeleif for 2 hours then dont bother, go see pearl harbor and Hannible and enjoy your mindless fluff in peace.Secondly id like to respond to all thos pretentious &quot;martial arts&quot; coniseurs.  yes its true that movies in this genre have been made before but to say that there have been superior ones is  just awful.  Every single Wuxia film and i mean EVRY SINGLE one had some of the worst acting, storyline and effects ever put on screen.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1KSYAJ922464Q	gb	My experience with the film-  I saw the movie twice in theater and recently purchased the DVD.Initial impression-  I was blown away by the whole concept of the movie.  The movie is based on a very familiar martial arts theme.  The way the movie was conceptualized by the creators and actors brought out the best in martial arts and cinema.  The story line is very nice, not to complicated, and easy to follow.  There are various themes woven into this film which demonstrate and create conflict and action during the movie.Sound-  The music to the film is excellent and assist in creating the overall ambiance to the film.  Between the drums and cello action, space, and time are creatively balanced.Quality-  Film quality and DVD are top notch.  The DVD is nice with the extras that are provided, especially the ability to choose between subtitles and dubbed.Bottom Line-  The movie has some of the best martial arts scenes I have seen on film. Story line, plot, quality of picture and sound excellent, actors are all class act.  You will not be disappointed.I also recommend &quot;Circle of Iron&quot; also known as &quot;The Silent Flute&quot;.  This is the best martial arts movie ever made considering the period it was made, concept, martial arts, lesson of introspection, and theme.	5.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	2001-08-15	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AHU0J3VOEO1KY	"Gengie ""genghizkhan66"""	The Rooftop chase, the witch attack, the guardhouse duel and the bamboo top duel are only the garnishes and toppings, but to watch the entire movie is like savouring the entire entree. And that is major delicious big time.This movie also covers everything, love,betrayal,loyalty,duels,rebellion...from majestic Beijing to central China to the scorching desert of Xinjiang. From the Mongolians to the Manchurians , Hans and Uighurs..representative of the few major ethnic groups of China. This movie is a virtual feast, buffet.Personally, I find that the scene of the desert romance is very important. Remember in a much earlier scene when Zhang Ziyi mentioned to Michelle Yeoh about her &quot;one true love&quot; and the appearence of Zhang Zhen later on in her bed room? First we don't know &quot;who&quot; her true love is, and second &quot;where&quot; did Zhang Zhen(Lo-dark cloud) suddenly appear from? Thus the desert sequence explained the whole thing, and boy, what an exquisite beautiful explaination that was.One note: These maybe of interest to some, if not all.  The architecture of imperial Beijing is of Mongolian architecture. Chinese rooftop design was infuenced from the Mongolians during Mongol rules of the Yuan Dynasty under the rule of Kublai Khan. Old Hollywood made the mistake of calling pigtail &quot;Chinese&quot;, The pigtail and the shaved forehead, of the men, is infact very Manchurians. It is during the Qing dynasty &quot;Manchu empire&quot; that  the standard pigtail, shaved forehead becomes the rule and must be adopted by all men.  But, the Manchus adopted themselves to speaking Mandarin and writing in Chinese Calligraphy as main form of communication.  Confusing? It is. Dont ask me why. Ask my ancestors.In the role of the actors. Chow Yuenfatt is ambiguous. We don't know if he is Manchurian or Hans. Zhang Ziyi is Manchurian, from her 1 feet high head gear and her sharp pointed metallic finger covers she wore during her marriage. Michelle Yeoh, policeman Tsai and his daughter are Hans and Zhang Zhen (Dark Cloud) is Uighur.Hope some may find this interesting.	5.0	This warrior honours CTHD.	2001-07-06	18	16	2

This movie consistently ranks in the highest categories of cinematic excellence. Crounching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a fantastic tale rich in story, beauty, and character.Together, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh provide a terrific performance which focuses on love, honor, and devotion. The tale is both simple and complex. The story revolves around a sword called the Green Destiny. This weapon's strength is as well known as its owner: the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). When this sword is stolen by an anonymous skilled fighter, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lein (Michelle Yeoh) track down the thief only to discover that the rogue is actually the daughter of a high ranking Beijing official with a very unique past of her own. Overarching all of this is Li Mu Bai's quest to avenge his fallen master, killed at the hands of a wicked sorcerous named Jade Fox.While the story does revolve around a sword: the Green Destiny, the focus is on the nature of power, the danger of reckless use of power, and the need for discipline to obtain true strength.The cinematography sets a strong mood for the film with overtly fantastical martial arts that is both a joy to watch and is yet another way in which the film stresses it's main points. Points which are narrowed down fairly succintly in a quote by Li Mu Bai:""No growth without assistance. No action without reaction. No desire without restraint""A simply superb soundtrack overlays the film which is orchestrated by the great Yo Yo Mah. The music acts adds not only to the dramatic moments of the scene, but carries the viewer along during the more leisurely transitional moments of the film. I highly recommend not only the movie, but also this soundtrack.I can not stress this enough: Buy this movie. The story is great, the environment is rich, the music is superb, and the acting is superb.

When I saw this movie, it blew away that experience.  This movie was unlike any other that I have ever seen.  Not only did it take coreographed fighting scenes to a new level, but the acting was amazing, and the story was enchanting.  (Not to mention that Zhang Ziyi was both stunningly beautiful, and frighteningly deadly on screen.)  Any one who has told me that this movie was boring based on the fact that they had to read the subtitle needs to go pick up a book and practice so they can keep up, it really wasn't that hard!  In fact, I found that for me the subtitle added a whole new deminsion to the intrigue of the film.  This film is foreign, and the fact that we have to read and listen, adds to that effect, making us feel like outsiders.  This makes the audience have to pay attention which is brillant because of the intricacies of the story line.  If you don't pay attention you will probably miss important information.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1A9WXPQVE7D87	GFX	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is such a great movie on so many levels. The fight scenes are incredible. Many people might say they are silly but they are ignorant of Chinese mythology and stylization. As my ethnic Chinese wife says, kung fu masters can just do that (re flying, jumping, etc). It takes that whole canon of film and encapsulates it nicely.My favorate part was the bittersweet inner-play between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's characters. It is sad when two people truely love each other but never know it...it is sadder when they do but will never realize it. They are both at the twilight of their careers and too much history had past for anything to change but the realization of their feelings.The direction by Ang Lee was superb, but given his catalog of movies to date that is simply expected. The number of oscars Crouching Tiger garnered is testament to how good his direction was and how good the movie is.Don't watch this movie with English dubbing. It frankly is not good dubbing and it really takes away from the experience. Also some of the translations are subtly different than the subtitles of the Mandarin dialogue. While I had no problems with the Mandarin spoken, my Mandarin speaking wife chuckled that it was VERY poorly spoken. Fat and Yeoh are not native Mandarin speakers so that is to be expected I suppose. An intertesting side bar that takes nothing away from the movie.	5.0	Kung fu fantasy for occidentals	2003-05-18	0	0	0

Then Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon was released. The epic tale of two women whose lifes change dramatically quick during a fight-race over an ancient sword is a once-in-a-lifetime movie experience. Ang Lee was clever enough to place his story in it's naturall homeland,China , a country with one of the  richest martial arts culture in the world. He also let his actors speak their mothertongue , making what we see on our screens feel even more true and geniun . Beautifull landscapes are being combined harmonically with over-the-edge fight sequences . Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have never been better but do pay extra attention to newcomer Ziyi .

Switch the Chinese actors to Americans and made the sword fights into gun fights, then this is not a special film by any means. I think Americans are so excited about this film because they rarely get to see this genre in the states that is very common in many Asian countries.This story is built around relationships. Mubai with Jen, Jen with Xiao Lone, Mubai with Michelle Yoeh's character. One thing that this film manages to do fairly well is the intertwine these stories seamlessly. I loved the score by Tan Dun and the song featuring Coco Lee. This film also has several major fight scenes. Although these are well choreographed, they seem a bit implausible (too much flying. and that toe on water was ridiculous). I felt the characters' madarin were a little off(no offense, because they had to learn it in a month or something).I don't believe this film deserved an Oscar nomination. Soon, more Asian kung fu films will be flying into the U.S. and the population will be jaded and tired of these as they have tired with the Western.	3.0	Overrated, but has its moments	2003-03-31	12	4	8

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1CIW2OEVAJRM2	Godly Gadfly	"The martial arts film traditionally has attained its own unique niche in the domain of film.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a Chinese-language film that works within the parameters of the old cliches of this niche, but changes just enough to make it stand out and create an appeal that reaches far beyond the limited circle of the average martial art film enthusiast.  It doesn't lack the action that one might expect from the typical film in this genre, but it adds something new: the soul of tragedy and romance.An adaption of a Chinese pulp-fiction novel, the story concerns two secret lovers (the male Li Mu Bai and female Yu Shu Lien) who are warriors on a quest to recapture a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, which has been stolen by a masked bandit.  The thief turns out to be the beautiful princess Jen Yu, who is in the middle of trying to avoid an arranged marriage, because she is secretly in love with the desert bandit Lo, whom she grew to love after being abducted in the wilderness.  Behind the intrigue and romance of these two forbidden loves, lies the dark cloud of mastermind Jade Fox, the evil woman responsible for the deaths of Mu Bai's former master and of Shu Lien's fiance.  This sets the stage for a poignant drama, warm romance, and breath-taking action.Despite being a martial arts film, the movie breaks the traditional Eastern mould by incorporating romantic elements one would expect from Hollywood.  It has well been said that stylistically, it is ""a blend of Eastern action and Western psychological drama."" I think this assessment is correct, that while on the one hand the film is clearly inspired by martial-arts mysticism and action of the East, underneath the window dressing of the foreign aspects of the film lies the romanticism and drama that one is accustomed to from the West.  By catering to what appeals to the modern Western mindset and incorporating subtle criticisms of traditional Chinese culture, it's not surprising that the film was somewhat of a flop in Asia, and that its concessions to contemporary themes of love and feelings made it a breakthrough success in the West.  Stephen Greydanus puts it well by remarking: ""Ang Lee has here crafted a masterful synthesis of various forms of Chinese mythology and Taoist philosophy that brings a broader perspective to its subject matter than many Asian films  including some aspects of more typically Western sensibilities and ideals  and, in the end, embraces a gently romantic humanism that is more life-affirming than the esoteric way of detachment and denial characteristic of Eastern thought.""  Certainly there are allusions to Taoistic mysticism, but the Taoism is in the end rejected in favor of realism and romanticism - which perhaps explains why the movie worked for Western viewers and not for Eastern ones.The movie has also been the subject of scathing criticism for other reasons, not least from conservative Christian quarters, where offense was taken primarily to the implicit endorsement of extra-marital sexual relations, and the rebellious attitude of Jen toward her parents and her arranged marriage. For the most part, I share this concern, and it's good to be reminded of it. Watching too many movies which advocate the moral laxity of modern culture can dull sensitivity on this point, and unfortunately there aren't enough films on the other extreme to act as correctives.But perhaps most discussion has been about the ambiguous conclusion (*spoiler warning*), where Jen leaps into the unknown.  Lo has just expressed the wish is ""to be in the desert, together [with you] again"" and then Jen jumps off the cliff into the mist of uncertainty.  If it's not suicide, what is it?  And what happens next?  We don't know.  Some have optimistically seen this as a Christological leap of faith and sacrifice with the hope of resurrection, but it seems to me that interpreting this as a message of atonement and resurrection is being too generous and overly charitable.  Perhaps the point is that we don't know the ending, and that the movie can only leave it up to us to decide for ourselves. And isn't this typical for a Western culture without absolutes?  Maybe this is a reflection of our post-modern culture more than anything.  Not only does contemporary culture delight in being morally ambiguous, but as a result it also has an ambiguous eschatology. The best that modern Western film can offer is a nebulous promise of a hope for the future. In other words, our world today doesn't really know much about the afterlife, so it can't really tell us much about it, except offer paradoxes and try to make us come up with our own happy endings. The best promise it can give is a blend of hopeless romanticism and eastern mysticism, where suicide is romanticized as an genuine escape and a leap into another world where perhaps dreams might just come true.Despite being critical of some of these underlying themes and moral ambiguity, I have to admit that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is stimulating in raising these questions, in a way that few popular films today do.  It remains a fascinating film in what it says about a clash of cultures, and in what it says about our time.  The discerning viewer is sure to find some measure of profit and entertainment from this highly regarded and award-winning film. - GODLY GADFLY"	4.0	East meets West, and West comes off best.	2007-02-15	9	4	5

The fight sequences could be ridiculous and childish, still director Ang Lee injects a sense of style and beauty in most of them and achieves something unique. This is a well-crafted story that manages to be compelling and thought-provoking. It`s also a good alternative to most Hollywood full around, presenting something that tries to innovate and deliver a somewhat surprising achievement. The characters are tragic and flawed enough, and the basic concept of good vs bad actually works here. The ending is particularly poetic and moving, providing a memorable finale to this enticing epic.Recommended."	3.0	The Power of Love	2004-04-23	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A16FUU8WW76QFY	gork57	The one thing that really stands out about &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is the way that it &quot;flows&quot;; that is, the dreamlike quality that simply radiates from it.  Beautiful imagery, excellent acting, and spectacular action make this a one-of-a-kind experience.I found Michelle Yeoh in particular to be marvelous; her performance is the one that really ties the whole film together.  Chow Yun-Fat was very good, as were the entire cast.  As with any good foreign film, after a time the viewer gets caught up in the plot, and language really becomes a minor issue.  Good acting is good acting-period.Some of the other reviewers seem locked into the Western film tradition, and expect all movies to fit within preconceived formulaic categories.  While influences from the West are certainly evident in &quot;Tiger&quot;, it is not rife with cliches, as so many recent films are.I for one have a generally negative view of modern cinema; perhaps one film in twenty really hits me in a positive way.  Poor writing and the substitution of special effects for same are all too common today.  All this being said, I found &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; to be simply mesmerizing, and with the all-too-rare plot that requires some thought to follow...terrific!	5.0	Like Nothing I've Seen Before	2001-06-13	1	1	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2O1YO4MQ02TG0	Greg K	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one of the first DVDs I purchased along with my DVD player.  At the time of purchase, the Superbit version was the only type available at the store.  I'm still not 100% sold on being able to notice the difference between a Superbit DVD and a non-Superbit one.  I think DVD quality is enough as it is.  Granted it's much better than VHS, but I think that unless you have a high-end DVD setup, indluding sound and display, you're not going to notice any differences.Also, one thing I didn't like about this Superbit version is that you don't get any of the added bonuses that are on the normal DVD, such as commentaries, interviews, etc...  The only options you have when playing this DVD are what language to see the subtitles in (if any), and type of sound output.Overall, I'd prefer the non-Superbit version only because of the added features.  I think that DVD quality in general is enough, and that Superbit is only for those folks with high-end systems.	4.0	Excellent DVD, yet 'Superbit' feature worth it?	2003-01-11	7	6	1

If you've seen ANY Martial Arts flicks like the old Run Run Shaw pictures, you've seen fight scenes like the ones in this picture, done better in some respects to boot. If you want to see a real martial arts flick, buy a Jet Li film or go with the &quot;Classics&quot;, like Enter the Dragon, but I doubt people who rave about Crouching Tiger will ever see one of those films.The &quot;drama&quot;: Nothing's worse than a talky martial arts flick. Boring talk too. I would'nt sit through the subtitled version of this film if my life depended on it. Blah-blah-ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....The cinematography: Yeah, its well filmed, but so what? That's not enough of a reason for a 5 star review, there is alot of nice looking garbage on DVD.So why all the hoopla?

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2R3PKXH818QWT	HaleySingkhami	Americans want to see movies that are realistic, and this is the opposite of Chinese movies.  Chinese movies are about a fantasty, magical world where anything can happen and this does not appeal to the average American movie audience.  If you are not used to the tradition of Chinese movies, PLEASE don't see this movie!!!!  Not only will you hate watching the characters fly around because it seems too unreal, you will hate having to read the subtitles.  I suggest this movie for those who are familiar with the tradition of Chinese movies and have an appreciation for it.  If this is going to be your first time watching a Chinese movie, skip it! Those that did not enjoy this movie tend to be first time viewers of a Chinese movie, and tend to the be typical American who hate subtitles and probably does not know anything about Asian culture.  Personally, I thought it was a beautifully made movie, although not the first great Chinese movie (there are awesome ones that do not receive recognition from America).  The soundtrack was really great, the music moved me.  The acting was top notch, the cinematography was beautiful.  I also thought the story line was great.  Takes a mature audience and an open mind, even an appreciation for Asian culture to appreciate this movie.  I saw lots of older Caucasians in the theater who seemed to enjoy the movie while the younger teenage Caucasians walked out halfway through.  Keep an open mind American viewers.	4.0	Don't Watch This Movie	2001-07-10	4	4	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2HQ9VTZXKQ3BF	"hannibalsmith ""hannibalsmith"""	Crouching Tiger is a very good film with a lot going for it.  The recreation of mid-evil China, the cinematography, the gorgeous fight choreograpy, a sweeping story and its focus on the role of women in society and the cultural expectations that are placed on them all add up to a fine film.  But above all else it is the film's acting that makes it stand apart from the crowd, particularly the performances of its two leading ladies.Michelle Yeoh is amazing in this movie.  Loyal and hard edged, Yeoh's character is the ultimate example of internal conflict, torn between a friendship and the truth, and between a deep respect and an even deeper love.  There are several scenes where the subleties of her facial expressions say more than most actors manage in their entire careers with actual dialogue.As good as Yeoh is, its newcommer (at the time this film was made) Zhang Ziyi that steals the show.  Never mind that a good argument could be made for her as the most beautiful actress alive today,  Ziyi manages to portray Jen as a complex duality of fragility and power, of nobleman's daughter and thief. At times bratty and spoiled, at other times indigent, self-assured and cocky, and at all times someone who will, in the end, do what she pleases to do, cultural expectations, protocol, laws and even common decency be damned.  Jen wants the world, but she'll only accept it on her own terms.Even though the DVD defaults to english, I recommend watching the film first in its native Mandarin with the english subtitles turned on, as the film was presented during its theatrical release.  Too much of the subleties of these great performances are lost when the english audio is dubbed in.  At the same time, it is worth watching later with the english audio, as the spoken english words are more elaborate and convey more than the much briefer subtitles can.I would also like to briefly comment on the use of wirework in the movie and the widespread criticism it has received for making the movie unrealistic.First, please realise that the movie is meant as a fairy tale / fantasy.  It was not intended to be fully realistic.  If you realise this, and allow yourself to enjoy the movie, you will.  Just as we allow ourselves to enjoy films like Kill Bill, Rambo, and James Bond, even though they too have fight scenes that are completely unrealistic and would in reality leave the participants chalk full of bullet holes or beaten to bloody pulps.Second, there is something of a point as to why the characters can fly.  Yeoh hits the nail on the head in the accompanying documentary on the DVD when she points out that the flying is meant to be symbolic of the character's relative freedom from social obligation.  Yeoh's character, who runs a business and cannot speak her love for Li Mu Bai due to social standing, is also the least adept flyer of the major characters and often struggles to do so, weighed down by her obligations.  Jen certainly has social expectations placed upon her, but has escaped most of them through her secret life.  She is able to take flight far more easily than Yeoh's character.  Finally, Li Mu Bai is a warrior who is at peace with who he is - he flies most effortlessly of all three of them.	5.0	A magnificent film...	2005-08-05	3	2	1

Maybe this is the first time all the fancy style gongfu is shown on screen ( not the Jackie Chan nor Bruce Li), and this gains enormous public attention. But is the movie really as good as it gets?Ok, the music is nice, the scene is beautiful, the story is simple with some romance in it, and the ending is something like justice has come, good defeats evil. Yet the movie seems shaky to me. The actions were interpreted in a way that it is not pure gongfu, it is like, hmmmm, let's put it this way:watching Ballet dancer performing Disco. Ah, you can always claim it is artistic, but I consider it funny. As to the acting, I used to like Chow YunFat very much, but definetely not in this one. The romance story does not match any theme of the movie, the young actor talked like he did not eat for several days. The intimate moments of the young actress and actor looked so unnatural, and they are the biggest failure of the movie.No doubt that croughing tiger is entertaining, yet it cannot just get away from being another hollywood style movie.	3.0	A Hollywood style Chinese Gongfu movie	2003-12-24	7	1	6

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A39QEKNEFSJ34Q	hrladyship	In the early 70s, many TV stations carried &quot;Kung Fu Theater&quot; by one name or another.  Because of the fascination with Bruce Lee and TV series, &quot;Kung Fu,&quot; movies were being ground out by the dozens, much as the Hercules movies were in the 1950s.  Some of the martial arts movies were interesting or downright silly.  But they were almost always fun.&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is a delightful homage to those earlier movies.  Beautifully filmed, it presents some of the most fantastic (in every sense) fight scenes ever filmed.  In addition, the plot includes two love affairs, one young and consummated, the other older and platonic.The action begins when Li Mu Bai returns from meditating in the mountains with his sword, the Green Destiny, whose blade has ended many lives.  Mu Bai wishes to give up the life of a warrior for a more contemplative existence.  He gives the sword to the woman he loves, Yui Shu Lien, fiance of his best friend who died many years earlier.  Shu Lien, a warrior in her own right, delivers the sword to Sir Te, a powerful friend in the capital, for its safe keeping.  That very night the magical sword is stolen.Enter Jen, the daughter of the new governor Yu, a passionate young woman on the verge of marriage, dissatisfied with the path set for her by her father.  She longs for the bandit Lo, with whom she spent many days and nights in the Gobi Desert.  And lurking somewhere behind them all is Jade Fox, the woman who taught herself the skills of a warrior usually denied to women.  It was she who murdered Mu Bai's master and for whom he has searched in vain for many years.All of these characters come together in tragedy and longing and hate.  Yet, at the center of much of the story lurks the sense of humor one usually finds in Kung Fu movies.  The impossible flying, running from roof to roof, walking up and down bamboo trees and walls, all part of the flights of fancy.  The skills of the actors are serious.  For those of us who remember the old movies, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is great fun and might bring fond memories.  For those too young to remember, this is a fun introduction to the genre of movies.	5.0	A beautiful homge &amp; just plain fun	2004-01-26	4	3	1

I have seen that some westerners don't admire the fight scenes and don't understand the philosophy of the movie. Like that, I, as an Asian, am not so excited about western knight tale movies in which knights fight against notorious monsters and rescue a fair lady, either.

In my opinion, a good kung fu/wuxia movie (or book) has to have these four essential ingredients: an invincible swordsman, an invincible sword, an unfullfilled love, and a restaurant brawl scene with flying chairs chopsticks and all! This movie has got them all. plus Michelle Yeoh is just incredible, both in her character as well as her martial arts prowess. All of her fight scenes are just incredible - out of this world. The scenery is breathtaking, the drum rolls etc are spectacular. There was not a better movie, nor there has been anything remotely close to it since.

Ang Lee combines a touching romance with well choreographed martial arts fight scenes to develop an excellent movie.Many detractors argue that Croutching Tiger is nothing new in terms of martial arts films from Asia.  Having seen a number of HK movies, I would have to both agree and disagree.  The action sequences are not as extravagant as some other Asian martial arts movies, but it was also more realiztic to watch.  In addition, I would argue that the plot is much more robust.The fact that this movie was subtitled does not detract from this film at all.  At times, the translations do not fully convey the meaning of what was spoken, but most of the information is conveyed.Strong acting performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, breathe-taking cinematography, and exciting action sequences make Croutching Tiger a movie to own and watch multiple times.	5.0	Excellent Story, Action and Cinematography	2001-04-30	5	4	1

As Ang Lee already said in the DVD's interview, we grew up watching this kind of fantasy movies with struggling heros, fantastic fightings and flying around and he always wanted to put something on screen.  BUT Lee set a new view that not only new to western audience, but we also see it as something we have never seen before in such &quot;wu xia&quot; movies: the fighting and chasing scenes by the girls in the palace, the chasing scene on the lake and forest by Chow and Zhang, are really really refreshing experiences to us.  Added bouns are Tan's music arrangement and Yoyo Ma's performance, this is not only a fantastic but also an artistic movie.But all Chow Yun-fat fans alert, this is not a Chow's movie.  His acting in this movie is just ok (limited by the character)and he only appears in a few scenes; the main characters, are Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, who performed very well and deserve a big hand.Oh but I like the front cover of the HK version of the DVD, at least we can see Zhang Ziyi. haha.	5.0	Definitely a must see!	2001-05-07	4	1	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2XFF5HYNGHKBU	Ihazo	----------------------------------------------------------------Despite the (over)hype, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is very simply, very easily overrated. Although it has moments that are truly great, these are few and far between. This is hardly the best Martial Arts movie of all time, that's for sure. And I don't know why people are praising the FX. Digitally erasing wires is NOT a great achievement. Director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm) has come up with the least interesting film of his career, though Crouching Tiger IS more entertaining than Ride With The Devil. Based on the (over)reaction to Crouching Tiger, I expected magic. Instead, I got a tedious and pretentious film that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of brilliance. According to my watch, with which I become well acquainted during the screening, I believe that there are about 20 minutes of a great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one.----------------------------------------------------------------	2.0	Crouching Tiger.......	2001-03-27	52	15	37

I don't know what kind of movies these other reviewers have been studying (and I say studying not watching because they must be too involved trying to figure out if the area under the curve of the roof on the buildings is sufficient to support the snow) but, the fight scene in the temple has got to be one of the best I have ever seen. Beautiful acrobatics, graceful strikes and fast-paced edge-of-your-seat action meld seemlessly into a true masterpiece of martial combat.  The only thing that keeps this movie from earning five stars is the overly-dramatic, overly-long, and completely pointless desert love affair. I skip these scenes when I come to them. Other than this, the movie is a true masterpiece of FICTIONAL ENTERTAINMENT that was never meant to, nor ever promised to, obey the mundane and drol laws of physics.  It is a movie that takes you out of your daily life into a beautiful world of adventure...if you want a movie about every day ho-hum life where people are limited by reality watch yourself!	4.0	Great Movie, if you remove the desert love affair	2005-06-28	3	2	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A22D9S1KTYNXV9	Iris	As a huge fan of hong kong/taiwan/chinese films, I've seen countless martial arts movies/tv series. And really, i don't see what's so great about CTHD. Yes, I admit, the cinemtogrphy, art direction, casting, and music were great. It's eye candy if nothing else. But I feel this films lacks a decent plot, and substance. The only part I liked was the 'fantasy' side of the film, where the girl dives off in the end. Other than that it's really not that profound. There are better novels to make films from.Oh, I was also repelled by the flying actions in this film. That's some BS if i've ever seen one! Okay, I'm starting to sound like a snob, but people can't fly! I don't care if you are great masters! Bruce Lee didn't fly didn't he?

Given that there were a lot of amazing action sequences and the story was more than that of your regular run of the mill action movie it stands well in some places.  It's the middle that sends me to sleep everytime I watch it.  The love story is carried out to long and caused me to go, &quot;Yeah I get your point...she likes him and he likes her but she's a princess and he's a renegade.&quot;  I've seen it a million times and it still plays the same as it did with Shakespeare...this one doesn't even have a twist.  That is why I feel that the film doesn't hold its own and is in fact very unoriginal and boring.  A vailiant effort by Ang Lee but not good enough.	2.0	Why love this movie?	2001-07-20	8	0	8

Or rather, the excutive directors made a hash of it.I recall when watching &quot;Henry V&quot; in a theatre that the projectionist &quot;fell asleep&quot; and failed to setup the reels causing the the movie to come to halt right in the middle of the battle of Agincourt. CTHD has transitions just as bad, the worse being after the romantic scene where ShuLien and MuBai are re-connecting; there just isn't enough &quot;linger&quot;.The bamboo forest scene also seems rather hurried through, in contrast to Kurosawas reed survival scene in &quot;Dersu Uzala&quot;; you never get to feel the bamboo.As far as marial arts and chinese culture, this film might be crisp, but is no less entertaining than, let's say, &quot;Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin&quot;, a vintage Jackie Chan (acted, not directed) movie.	3.0	The editor stayed home	2001-07-10	2	0	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3S325BNDBO2XD	j3067	It does not appear that there is a difference between China and Krypton in this horrible film.  If great camera work consists of two actors flying about dressed in black at night then this movie had that in spads.  This movie was simply awful.  If only that bratty &quot;Herroine&quot;  had jumped from the ledge at the begining we may have been sparred all that undo hype.Now if you want a good movie of this genre, you should buy Charlie's Angels.  Charlies Angels was a superior film in every measurable way.  Three Heroic Heroines that we could get behind. A clasicand sweep tale that is now part of our american culture. Compared to Charlies Angels you will inevitably see that Crouching Tiger is inferior in many respects.  The first is sound track.  Tupac Shukr, was a pivital figure in American music culture.  on this sound track you have a song that captures his talent at its peak, That song is the Humpty Dance.  This was a song that challenged the Rythem and the Style taht we were used too.  Also superior in Charlie's Angels is the MAle lead.  Compared to watching Chow Yung Fat mope about for the whole movie, we have a true hero in Bill Murray's Bozley.The fight scenes are equally convincing except that when these Characters fly they explain it with heliocopters and Airplanes and such not just being from China.  and if you really need to have subtitles you may select this as an option the DVD.  In conclusion,  compared to Charlie's Angels Crouching Tiger looks like the work of a film student well on his way to a promising career a mickey dee's.  Actually compared to Crouching Tiger most tape worms look good, but I digress.  anyway I hope that you have found my review helpful.Thanks,JimPS- I regret that I have to this movie a star, were it up to me I would give it a -5 on a scale from 1-10.	1.0	Is there a ifference between China and Krypton?

Probably not much, but here goes nonetheless...I think Webster is going to add this as a sub-text definition to &quot;over-rated&quot; in the new edition of his dictionary.  I swore this was a joke when it first came out.  There is nothing more significant about this flick then any other kung-fu-karate-ninja-master-warrior-jeet-kune-do-tae-kwon-do-chow-fat-yun-woo-lee-hi-ya movie.In fact, watch the 7-UP commercial by the same director.  It will save you 20 bucks and you'll get the same effect.  Better yet, get the AKIRA jap-animation DVD and then you'll see something that, although completely non-sensical, took far greater effort to create.  Even better, just get a Bruce Lee movie and call it quits.  At least Bruce had talent, style, humor, wit and dignity.My theory?  This is just another Academy Award created-hype flick.  Last year it was the Italians with &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;  This year, this garbage?  Who next?  Mexico, I'm looking in your direction....how about a full-length feature of &quot;Sabado Gigante&quot;??To even place this movie in the same sentence as &quot;greatest,&quot; &quot;movie,&quot; &quot;of,&quot; &quot;all,&quot; or, &quot;time,&quot; does thousands of movies a horrible, horrible injustice.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AHB6RAJ33HYOU	Jacques Antoine	A very beautiful movie--but be warned, it isn't a typical kung-fu movie of the Hong Kong variety. It's much more beautiful than that could ever be. If chopsocky is what you're looking for, this may not satisfy you. The fight sequences are wonderful, but they're less about amazing feats of martial athleticism than they are about revealing the dreamy underpinning to the martial arts--as an example, consider the fight among the bamboo treetops. Also, the double plotting requires more attention than kungfu movies usually do; and it is truly difficult to fathom the significance of the girl's sacrifice. It has an air of enigma that may seem authentically Chinese to some, even if some Chinese don't recognize it. But beyond all the paradox and enigma and visual excitement, don't forget to just bask in the sheer cinematic beauty of the film. Enjoy!	5.0	Romantic, lush, luxuriant and exciting	2001-07-14	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3UDYY6L2NH3JS	"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say"""	"This is a magical film and the magic of it is so purely Chinese and so purely Mental that we do not even have any problem entering it and believing it. It is the story of a very special sword from very ancient China, a sword that carries fate and destiny in it for the person who controls it, because it is not enough to own it, you must control it and when you control it, it controls you. That sword is stolen and tamed by a young woman who is to marry some nobleman though long before she was both abducted and saved by a wild young man roaming in the mountains and distant deserts, far from everything. They fell in love after much fighting.When her marriage arrives, the young man comes to Beijing to claim the young woman but that is impossible because her father is the governor. So he manages to escape and she decides to steal the sword and to go after him. The story becomes complicated then and yet very simple. She is in love with a middle-age woman she calls her sister and who was the owner of the sword. Hence a rivalry for who will control it develops. That middle-age woman was in love with a man her age who was in  love with her but both could not go through their love for various honorable reasons, for various pledges they had taken to their masters, the woman her fighting master, the man his Buddhist spiritual master.These two go after the escaping girl and finally find her in the hands of a witch who has drugged her. They bring her back to consciousness but the witch comes back from some errand and the fight will poison the man and the witch with the witch's poisoned darts. Then the younger woman learns from the middle-age woman where the young man she loves is and she goes there to meet him, to share her love with him one single night and then escape anew in the most Buddhist way possible by flying into the mountain mist and finding enlightenment and merging with the cosmic energy of the mountains. The young man will remain behind and mourn her forever.A love story film with two love stories crossing and in both cases love can be at most exchanged for a very short period of time because of full dedication to a wider and deeper objective, be it the loyalty to a sword and a martial art, or be it a Buddhist pledge to reach enlightenment. In both cases attachment is impossible, love is possible but cannot become an attachment, hence a permanent relation. Everything is impermanent and has to be impermanent not to enslave the person on the way to mental and spiritual liberation.I just wonder though if that attachment to these principles is not an excessive attachment too and hence a blocking element on the path to ""nibbana"" with a trace of Tibetan Buddhism with the middle-age man who dies in the arms of the middle-age woman he has loved all his life without ever saying so: he declares his love before dying which becomes a blocking element on the path to his liberation and he knows it and chooses at this moment to be a ghost caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead, unable to escape this state till at last a rebirth, a reincarnation makes him a man again for him to have a second chance to reach ""nibbana"", enlightenment.The beauty of the film is in the spectacular landscapes and mountain scenery, in the extreme power of the mental and spiritual sentiments and even passions, in the depth and faithfulness of their love and their friendship, and the impossible merging of this with Buddhism and martial arts that both require a pledge to total detachment and absolute dedication to a spiritual ideal.This film has to be enjoyed like some extreme elixir from the most refined and intense essences and liquors. Then flying will become natural and the battle in the bamboo copses or groves will be a fairy show of intemporal human luxuriance.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"	5.0	Chinese heritage is both martial and spiritual	2013-07-19	2	2	0

An invincible weapon or a beautiful girl?In most Kung Fu movies, power is in one's Kung Fu skills. In the real world, however, power is in those who can control others in power.Li Mu Bai (Chow YunFat) is a celibate monk who has devoted his life to becoming the highest warrior.  He holds the Green Destiny, a mythical sword that can make its yielder almost invincible.Jen (Zang Ziyi) is a beautiful young girl who fascinates all men. They are willing to do anything for her, including risking death to be with her. Yet, she isn't satisified. She wants the Green Destiny to become even more powerful. She can attract or kill anyone. How exciting this must be for a young woman seeking adventure.Despite his status as a monk and his love for Yu Shu (Michelle Yeoh), Li Mu Bai finds Jen irresisitible. He continually uses the Green Destiney as an excuse to follow Jen. He wants to make her his disciple even though his Kung Fu sect does not accept women.  ""Is it me or the sword you want?"" asks Jen.Jen sees no need to be Li Mu Bai's disciple. Perhaps she  realizes she can control Li Mu Bai with her sexuality.When power is in those who are selfish and reckless, the consequence can be tragic. The Green Destiny, even in the skillful hands of Jen, does not kill Li Mu Bai. But it is his fascination with Jen which kills him."	5.0	Far deeper than appears.	2006-02-01	5	1	4

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1RHS05BUOPRQ8	James	Once again Ang Lee brings his stunning imagination to audiences across the globe.  &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is one of the very best movies I have ever seen, with its art-house quality story and its exceptional visuals.  The cinematography in this movie is simply breathtaking, capturing the splendor of the bamboo forests and the majesty of the mountains.  This is one of the few movies that makes the audience feel as though they are really a part of the environment, so much in fact, that you can almost smell the intoxicating fragrance of the lush landscape.  Aside from the cinematography, Crouching Tiger also numbs the senses with flawless martial arts.  Even if you are not a fan of martial arts films the ballet-like movements will hypnotize even the most timid person.  I believe the best scene in the movie is a fight scene that takes place in a beautiful bamboo forest, high up in the tree tops.  Of course a film could not recieve so much praise without haveing an exceptional story.  The love between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat seems real and powerful.  The movie also has genuinely funny comic relief, not the usual obnoxious humor found in mainstream Hollywood productions.  Most of the comedy flows from the stunning Zhang Ziyi as she gracefully and effortlessly destroys a Chinese drinking house!  This movie will not be easily forgotten.  I predict Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will be kept in the hearts of millions for years to come.	5.0	A Masterpiece in Art and in Entertainment	2001-02-09	13	9	4

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AU7PWG1EJIQB3	"""jamralla"""	Whenever I tell people that &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is a drama, they look at me wide-eyed and amazed. Truth is, the martial arts in the film is the icing on the cake, the filling is in its script. Having seen this film in its true original form, mandarin, I fear that many aspects of teh film would be lost in the subtitles and translation. The script is beautifully written and filled with metaphors that compares both modern society with that of the imaginery, the martial arts world. To the chinese, Wu Lin, is a term used in all martial arts world. It signifies the period in China's history where the kingdom is ruled by emperors and martial artistes dwells. However, the modern notion of Wu Lin is the society we live in. Like the Wu LIn in the film, modern men are trapped by duty and reponsibilities. The love affair between Zhang Zi Yi and Zhang Zhen, is a symobolism social barriers in traditional families.  Unlike traditional martial arts films, look to Jackie Chan's eariler works such as &quot;Drunken Master&quot; for comparison, Lee Ang's piece is uniquely silent with many compelling scene. Hence, I am with the firm believe that considering the film an A-typical martial arts film would be nothing less than insult. What Lee Ang has created is a genre unique to its own and will be appreciated in years to come.	4.0	It's not a martial arts film, it's drama	2001-04-15	14	12	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1Y34Q15XST3I8	"Jane Lane's Twin ""see jane write"""	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a cinematic masterpiece (it holds the record for the most Academy Award Nominations for a foreign film--ten). The cast is incredible, the landscape breathtaking, and the direction inspired.So prepare to throw Jack Chan in the trash bin as you watch Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi battle it out in the mountains (a girl who chases down a bandit who stole her comb--who knew this would end up in romance?). And even though the action was choreographed by the same guy, CTHD's fighting sequences kick the butt of Iron Monkey's. The finest example of this are the fights that take place between Zhang Ziyi (Jen) and Michelle Yeoh (Shu Lien), in Yeoh's house and on the rooftops of China.Crouching Tiger has a story that will get you so involved, you'd rather wet your pants than have to stop it to visit the restroom (trust me; I'd know--only the ending credits came just in time for me to run to the bathroom w/out embarassing myself). You will care so much about the characters, whether they are hero, villain, or impressionable young citizen led astray. No matter the case, this is one of the most amazing films to come out of China, and undoubtedly Ang Lee's master piece.	5.0	Call me a sucker for Chinese film, but u gotta c this one	2004-07-24	5	2	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A34CXLS24ETLMO	"Jan P. Dennis ""Longboard jazzer"""	. . . perfectly describes my reaction to this movie.  I don't usually come away from a film without a clear-cut sense, but I just couldn't get a handle on CTHD.  There were many things I admired about it.  Despite what many reviewers have described as cheesy action scenes, especially the air walking/running, I found these sequences to be very convincing.  Ok, maybe all the technical aspects such as the lighting weren't perfect, but Ang Lee managed to evoke the perfect sensibility with them.  In fact, my strongest impression coming away from this film was that cinematically it depicted an authentic, deeply realized cultural sensibility.  What that sensibility was, I really don't know.  It remains a mystery to me.  If I watched it a lot more times, I think I could begin to tease out exactly what it is.  However, the movie didn't engage me thoroughly enough to want to watch it over and over.I also admired the performances of Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi, and I thought the pacing was brilliant.That's about it for the positive elements.  On the minus side, I found certain aspects of the story quite difficult to follow.  Character motivations often seemed opaque or murky.  I'm willing to concede that this may be because as a westerner I had trouble getting on board with what to an easterner may be perfectly clear.  On the other hand, maybe the movie just isn't very well done here.  I've seen lots of other films by oriental film makers and generally haven't had this problem.  I thought the ending was gratuitously open-ended.  Here again, it just may be that I didn't fully discern what was going on.  But I doubt it.  And althought the desert scene was quite remarkable cinematically, as well as providing important character motivation/information, there seemed a faint whiff of exploitation about it.All in all, my heart would probably want to rate CHTD four and a half or five stars and my head one and a half or two stars.  Unfortunately, I can't get my head and heart together on this one, hence the three star rating.	3.0	Ambivalent . . .	2001-07-26	4	1	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3DE1IYJGU5HPW	Jason N. Mical	Because Crouching Tiger was released in Taiwan before it came to the States, it is only natural that the DVD was released there earlier, too.  Nearly identical to the proposed Ameican release (the US version adds the &quot;making of&quot; documentary), I purchased a copy of the Region 3 version of this great movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon itself is a gorgeous, sensual story, boosting HK action movies to an entirely new level (although it is doubtful that many will be able to or even want to follow this act).  The story is fairly straightforward: a master swordsman searches for his lost weapon, stolen by an enigmatic thief.  Add to that a healthy dose of unrequited love, another love story that may very well become unrequited, and of course the legendary fighting scenes, and you've got a great film.Subtitles don't really matter here, unlike some other films.  After 5 minutes, you won't even notice you're reading them.Now, for information on the DVD.The commentary track, in English, is one of the best tracks I've heard.  Rather than the usual back-patting (so-and-so was SO GREAT to work with!), Ang Lee and James Schamus discuss the difficulties behind making scripted scenes come to life, the risks they took in making the movie (10 minutes before the first fight? A 20 minute flashback?), and other aspects of production.  For those who like an educational commentary, this one is great.The interview with Michele Yeoh is pretty much the standard movie-promotion fare, and the music videos are interesting as additions (for some reason, they seem really grainy, too).  This DVD looks and sounds great, and even the animated menus (if they keep the ones that are on the Region 3 disc) are clever.There are very few DVDs that are &quot;must-own.&quot;  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of them.  Do not hesitate, and when it comes, savor every minute.	5.0	You've heard about the movie, want to know about the DVD?	2001-04-25	8	7	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2RU4YLF7MIUDX	Javier	What makes this movie so good ? I think it's basically a good integration of elements. It has splendid Art Direction, amazing scenery, great acting and of course a fantastic story which is very well told and directed.It's a story of love but is also a journey into a place where the eternal fight between good and evil takes unexpected twists and kidnaps your attention from begining to end, plus it's surrounded by incredible scenery of mountains, bamboo forests, waterfalls, mandarin castles and villages which makes it delightful for the eye.The fighting scenes ( which i think are not the main merit of this movie ) are very well done. I know there will be people who think they are stupid and far removed from reality, but if we criticise this movie with that perspective, we can end up saying every epic and mythological story is worthless just because they talk about fantasy and unintelligible situations....My recommendation is to see this movie,if you dont like it, dont worry, perhaps you'll get a chance to exchange it for The mummy returns or the last Arnold movie.	5.0	Sorry Arnold	2001-06-04	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3O6WZS3VO5NK5	jblack	&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; brilliantly shows the Chinese culture dealing with the martial arts. The flying scenes during battle exemplify the belief that once a martial arts student has reached mastery, they gain extraordinary powers. This belief has been handed down through centuries of stories depicting the great martial artist of China.Also, the use of the straight sword by the protagonist is correct. According to ancient beliefs, the straight sword is the weapon for masters. However, this mastery not only deals with martial art skills, but also a mastery of moral character. This is shown in the film by Yun-Fat Chow who is a moral and upright citizen who demonstrates the proper way to live. This is the main reason why the Green Destiny must be returned to Chow.If you are looking for a wonderful film that shows part of a great Chinese tradition, look no further!	5.0	A masterpiece of culture.	2001-11-27	3	3	0

I cannot believe the shallow-minded reviewers who thought this movie was all about martial arts. The martial arts were great to watch but they were secondary to the story. CTHD is a tour de force which combines a terrific plot, two love stories, mind-blowing special effects, cinematography so exquisite it is almost off the planet, great directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful acting by everyone, even the minor characters. Zhang ZiYi as Jen is awesome to watch, but as great as she is, it is Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien who really carries the film. Chow Yun Fat is excellent as the lead actor, Chang Chen is a delight as Jen's exuberant young lover who, in the end, can't hold onto her, and Cheng Pei Pei is total perfection as the evil Jade Fox. I saw this film in VHS, which, thank God, is in Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles (it's a crime to mess up the purity of this film by dubbing it into English), and unlike the DVD version, the VHS edition has kept all the scenes of the original. The hatchet job Sony did on the DVD edition just goes to show that some things are worth waiting for. The VHS edition is the version to get.

The acting is high quality, which is the movie's strong point but the direction is woeful. Knowing nothing about the film prior to watching it, skimming the reviews here on Amazon confirms the impression I got while watching the movie that it is the Cliff's notes version of a much longer work. It simply too bad it has been condensed so much because I think the longer version I would have enjoyed. The result is that many of the dramatic lines, especially at the end, fall flat because the movie doesn't take the time to lay the proper foundation for them. It tries to cram to much into too little time.	3.0	Powerpoint version of a much longer film	2013-07-12	2	0	2

This is nothing like that at all, and what is left is breathtaking and beautiful to behold.  Trying to relate this movie to the American Culture will leave you empty inside, especially with the ending.  Trying to understand a different culture, one from at least a hundred years ago, will leave you with something entirely different.  America's desire for a happy ending has left us spoiled, and this movie offers us something unusual that many do not want to accept, that in the end, it's not all roses and honey, and the ending is not always happy.  One persons life may alter so many others, as the young girls life did here.  Kudos to Ang Lee for bringing back a style and artform that many here in America have never seen, and should see more of.	5.0	Beautiful, Wonderful, and Unusual	2001-09-11	9	9	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	Crouching Tiger is not really a Kung Fu movie. The fight sequences are stylized and interjected with gravity-defying feats, flying, fantastical jumping, and flips. The fight scenes become almost a 3D ballet. I liked it, but don't come into this movie expecting Bruce Lee action sequences. The fight scenes are more of a dance. The fights are mainly sword fights, although there are a few hand-to-hand battles as well. The acting is superb. The story line is more of a fairy tale than straight fiction, but the movie works superbly well.  Michelle Yeoh's physical acting are displayed as well as her emotional range. Chow is great as the swordsman and Zhang Ziyi is very good as well.The movie tells the story of several stories of love, of revenge, of loyalties, and of duty. It concerns duty to one's family, to society and to one's self. A fairy tale is used to tie the plot lines together. The movie has a great medieval setting. The scenery switches from deserts, to Peking, to bamboo forests, and to mountains. In every case, the views are breathtaking. The bamboo forest fight is very strange, but it works.My wife didn't like the movie because if its fantastical elements, but it is one of the best movies I have seen for a long time. I don't know much about the superbit technology, but my DVD looks great and the sound is good too.	5.0	Exquisite fantasy	2008-06-16	3	3	0

By that I mean get engaged in the story and the characters.  If you are thinking this is an action movie, yes there is action, but again, you will need to engage your brains, as opposed to letting it pummel you with FX.It is truly a movie that isn't easily categorized or chopped from the typical Hollywood cookie cutter approach to movies.

I was disappointed with the release.  It is dubbed in English, which makes it easier to watch, because you aren't always reading subtitles.  However, they deleted at least 15 minutes from the film, and didn't include them on the disk as extra or deleted scenes.  One of the deleted scenes was one of the best fight scenes of the whole movie, I don't understand why they did it.  The theatrical version was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, with story twists, and fights, that really enriched the movie.  I loved it in the theater, and couldn't wait to own it on DVD.  I don't know why they'd edit these great scenes out, other than to make more money with a 'director's cut' release in the future.	2.0	Crouching Tiger, Missing Scenes!!	2001-06-13	5	1	4

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3MQZH2JH6O19O	Jen is my ex girlfriend.	CTHD is probably the best movie I've ever seen. This is one of those movies that truly grabs you're heart. After walking out of that theater, I already committed myself on seeing it again. This movie contains so much symbolism and I believe it takes more than viewing it once to appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece. I must admit I never felt this way about a movie before. To me, it feels like any other movie that I will watch in the future after seeing CTHD will totally ... (hehe). Everything in the movie was just perfect; superb cinematography, magnificent choreography, well casted, awesome soundtrack (I wanted to cry after hearing the song played at the end), breathtaking scenery, a great director (Ang Lee), and a well-written plot. Basically a wonderful love/romance/trust/betrayal/justice/revenge foreign film.I overheard some of my classmate's comments on CTHD. Some believe that the subtitles were boring, hard to watch, a hassle to read and made the movie stupid. Well this is what I had to say for them. &quot;First of all, how slow do you read? I mean they tried to keep the sentences to 1 or 2 so it's easy for people to read, and they also show the subtitle ahead of time. If CTHD was dubbed in English, well that would just ruin the movie. I really think it was a good idea to keep the movie in Mandarin to keep its uniqueness. Wouldn't the movie look like one of those old Chinese movies where they talk and the words come out a minute later? If the movie was also dubbed, the actor's tone of voice and expressions of the words will change, and will lose their significance in the movie. The subtitles were poetry themselves, and some words in Mandarin can't be accurately translated in English. For example, a word in Mandarin can sound so engaging, while in English it's just like an ordinary word&quot;.Many may also believe that the &quot;flying&quot; was so unrealistic and the fighting scenes were so stupid that people laughed. Well how about X-Men, Superman, Batman, Matrix, they didn't complain about the flying on those movie did they? All of these Hollywood movies are fantasies and we accept that. But why is it when Chinese makes their version of a fantasy movie (that includes flying) people criticize it? I believe these people should open up their selves to seeing idea from different culture. Because this movie is not from &quot;Hollywood&quot;, you can't assume that it's stupid. I've read that audience from some theater laughed at the fighting scenes. I have no idea why, but my only conclusion is that they probably haven't been exposed to any sort of martial arts, and they probably think that those fighting scenes were a chicken dance. The fighting choreography in this movie is superb. I've seen so many martial arts movie, but not as superior as this one.This movie is so good and was definitely worth every bit of the 7 bucks that I paid, and perhaps another 7 bucks for another viewing. It only happens once in a great while, where a movie can just grab you and just wont let you go, and CTHD can absolutely do that. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie go see it, and if you had, go see it again!	5.0	Why do I love this movie so much?	2001-03-08	39	34	5

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2N72S9S1FLIW	Jennifer Fretwell	For some reason, this movie caught the eye of movie critics across the nation and held these same critics in rapture. Review after review touted this as one of the best films of 2000. I just don't get it.For one thing, the &quot;gravity-defying fight scenes&quot; look ludicrous. The actors dangle and wave their legs ineffectually as they are swung on a wire up walls and over roofs and, my God, even through the TREETOPS. I have heard some critics refer to these as ground breaking special effects. However, they've been hanging people on a wire and swinging them around since the fifties-just go see any musical theater production of Peter Pan. The only difference here is that post-production completely removes the wires from visibilty while creating the visual equivalent of a Chinese Peter Pan on steroids.If you get past the silly, impossible fight scenes you will have to endure a convoluted, ponderous plot that is difficult to follow and even more difficult to stay awake through.Am amusing side note is that the male machismo running rampant in Hollywood's productions of late is adopted by the FEMALE characters in this movie. Most of the main characters in this film are women who kick butt. Nothing wrong with that although the women in this film at times engage in gratuitous violence, violence that has no involvement in furthering the plot. In one scene, the female heroine is harassed by a few bad guys while trying to dine in a tavern. She could have just kicked and punched a few times and that would have been enough to put them in their place. Instead, our heroine has to fight EVERYONE in the tavern and ends up making the entire second floor of the building collapse, all the while bragging aloud about how great she is.As far as the DVD itself  goes the movie does have some beautiful cinematography with gorgeous landscapes and florid costumes that put the picture quality of DVD to good use. The film was recorded in Chinese and you have a choice between English subtitles or an English dubbed version. Trying to follow the plodding story line and the subtitles simultaneously would drive a person to insanity. The dubbing is well done for dubbing but, of course, with the dubbed version the actors' mouths are not sychronized exactly to the soundtrack which is also somewhat distracting The dubbed soundtrack also has that inevitable wooden quality.In short, only hard core martial arts film fans who can suspend logic and forget about the laws of gravity will find much to enjoy here.	1.0	An unbelievably over-rated film	2001-07-17	29	9	20

I wasn't sure if he would be able to appreciate it with the subtitles. I chose to wait and let him find out on his own. We were both fascinated with the movie.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AOR4GK6YKDZEX	"Jennifer ""reader"""	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon centers around the world of Giang Hu (a lifestyle for kung fu masters in which they wander from place to place, touring cities and seeking matches with what opponents they find), the Green Destiny (a mighty 400-year-old sword), and three skilled fighters (Li Mu Bai, played by Chow Yun-Fat; Yu Shu Lien, by Michelle Yeoh; and Jen Yu, Zhang Zi Yi).Li Mu Bai is a &quot;renowned swordsman&quot;, famous as the best kung fu master.  He has had enough of Giang Hu and looks to spending the rest of his days in peace with Shu Lien, his long-time lover.  So Mu Bai turns his sword, the Green Destiny, over Shu Lien, telling her to give it to Sir Te.  But the sword is quickly stolen and as Shu Lien investigates this, she comes to suspect Jen Yu, the young aristocrat she has just befriended.  Jen is a willful girl, somewhat spoiled, but frivolous.  She longs for the adventure of Giang Hu and despises the thought of an arranged marriage.  What she hides is a romance in the desert and her great competence in fighting.  Jen's nanny, the villainous Jade Fox, is her secret kung fu teacher, whom Jen has long surpassed.As things are slowly revealed, the characters are faced with complications of vengeance, prejudices, and true desire.  This film is both captivating has the essence of classical Chinese folklore and Giang Hu.  My only objection is to the flying, though it is part of wuxia.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	Some people here cannot see the beauty of things even when it hits them in the face. Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film and he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colors are rich and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerizing action. Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.Some critics have suggested that the characterization is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth - and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best artistic films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies.	4.0	This film may not Please all but it is Pure Magic.	2006-03-08	2	1	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2PSY821R3ZRA	Jesse Hilsenrad	Most often, picking one single film as a favorite is difficult. There are so many good ones, how can we pick only one? After seeing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (on DVD) for the second time, I believe this could be the best film I've ever seen for these reasons:The fight scenesTo say these are the best martial arts sequences ever filmed makes it sound like there are other films that are close. I believe that these fight scenes are far and above the best ever. Adding to the action is the fact that the women are as good, if not better, than the men. So many films place women in subordinate roles. Not this one.The musicDuring the first fight scene, the polyrhythmic drumming made me realize how sick I am of conventional action music. Many action films now only use rock and techno to drive the scenes. But CTHD used more subtle, dark music to color the scenes. Yo Yo Ma's cello work was also outstanding.The poetic tragedyCTHD's mythical qualities and tragic themes are very well done. Similar to opera and Greek Mythology, the film shows painful lessons without being preachy or melodramatic.The cinematography and sceneryI noticed something unusual watching CTHD the second time. Often during the outdoor shots, Ang Lee placed his camera farther away from the actors than normal. This did two things: it painted great cinematic pictures and it was respectful of the beautiful landscapes.The love storiesSo many film love stories seem unreal to me. The love stories in CTHD were both unique and very real for different reasons. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh's love story was particularly well done. Their long unrequited love was painful and real.	5.0	My favorite film of all time?	2001-06-25	1	1	0

This film has stayed in the top 5 playing in theatres for weeks, and that explains it all. Chow Yun-fat speaks volumes while saying very little. The entire cast and Ang Lee did an incredible job.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2RGK3L6U55KFY	~Jimi~	Director Ang Lee (Sense &amp; Sensibility) has created an epic tale of love, honor, devotion, and intrigue set against a backdrop of 19th century China. When Li Mu Bai (Chow Yung Fat) decides to give the infamous &quot;Green Destiny&quot; sword to his good friend it sets in motion a story of breathtaking passion whether it's a sword fight in a courtyard or a gentle touching of the hands at a table. The acting is superb especially Ziyi Zhang with her porcelein doll looks but lightining quick moves manifesting itself throughout the film especially in the restuarant scene. Chow Yung Fat (Li Mu Bai) and Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) play their roles to perfection on two levels, they are great warriors but understate their strengths due to their teachings from the Masters...and the relationship between them is on the surface benign but we know they are madly in love with one another. Then we have Chen Chang (Lo) who sweeps Jen Yu off her feet like Michael Douglas did to Kathleen Turner in &quot;Romancing The Stone&quot;. Pei Pei Cheng plays &quot;Jade Fox&quot; nicely as the betrayer but deep down inside someone you can feel sorry for. The action sequences were masterfully choreograghed by Yuen Wo-Ping (The Matrix) as he was able to blend the movements like a Kirov Ballet. Add to this the thunder and fury of the  music of Tan Dun for the fighting/action scenes and the beautiful and melodic cello work of Yo-Yo-Ma to bring out the love and passion of the central characters you soon realize your senses are experiencing something special. Only a few films have done that to me in the past...it would be an understatement to simply say i think this is the best film of 2000-2001 since that would be accepting it on just a physical sense but when it touches your mind and soul in ways words can't describe it goes way beyond that.	5.0	Simply a Masterpiece	2001-01-15	36	34	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1LWJIHNLWSRTZ	"Jippo ""Bag Bag Bag"""	I feel the majority of negative reviews are due to simple ignorance! or the inability to accept the conventions of another culture.A lot of people are commenting on the 'flying' scenes - I won't explain the background to this, suffice to say, it is something that is accepted in Chinese cinema.People have also commented (negatively) on the 'unconventional' ending. People need to realise that things aren't always clear-cut. From a Western point of view, I guess this can be a problem as convention dictates that the good guys should always triumph over evil. Chinese cinema is different in that respect. To name a few recent examples: The Banquet and Hero.	5.0	A Masterpiece!!!	2001-03-07	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A8F2AZWB20X1H	JLind555	...to really appreciate it, you have to feel it.  I cannot believe the shallow-minded reviewers who thought this movie was all about martial arts.  The martial arts were great to watch but they were secondary to the story.  CTHD is a tour de force which combines a terrific plot, two love stories, mind-blowing special effects, cinematography so exquisite it is almost off the planet, great directing by Ang Lee, and wonderful acting by everyone, even the minor characters.  Zhang ZiYi as Jen is awesome to watch, but as great as she is, it is Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien who really carries the film.  Chow Yun Fat is excellent as the lead actor, Chang Chen is a delight as Jen's exuberant young lover who, in the end, can't hold onto her, and Cheng Pei Pei is total perfection as the evil Jade Fox.  I saw this film in VHS, which, thank God, is in Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles (it's a crime to mess up the purity of this film by dubbing it into English), and unlike the DVD version, the VHS edition has kept all the scenes of the original.  The hatchet job Sony did on the DVD edition just goes to show that some things are worth waiting for.  The VHS edition is the version to get.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	APRU373UYVK2Y	J. N. Mohlman	"So much has been said about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" already that it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess the ultimate appeal of this movie comes from the fact that it has a little bit of everything, and does it all well.  It is by turns an action/thriller, political suspense, romance and comedy.  And that's aside from the astonishing cinematography and score; if this isn't the most brilliantly filmed/edited movie ever, I don't know what is.  Even the fact that the film is subtitled in no way detracts from its impact.  The dialogue is spare, which makes it easy to keep up, and the Mandarin has an almost lyrical quality that is incredible to listen to.Furthermore, the special effects are simply mind-blowing.  To find sequences that are even better than ""The Matrix"" and that are at the same time artistic, almost poetic is just incredible.  One could easily watch this movie with the sub-titles turned off and still appreciate it.The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extra features.  There is a documentary on the making of the film, but it's short and not particularly impressive.  There is also an option to view the movie in dubbed English (5.1 or two channel), but it would really be a crime to do so.  In the end, the lack of features in no way detracts from the quality of the disc.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a movie that transcends gimmicks; watching it is all the entertainment that one needs."	5.0	Film-making at its best	2001-06-14	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3VV4GUGLUVUP1	Joel R. Bryan	Ang Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is a thrilling experience. Set in a mythical, 19th century China, it's &quot;Star Wars&quot; for adults; part martial arts revenge tale, part epic love story, and wholly unforgettable.Michelle Yeoh plays Yu Shu Lien, entrusted by her longtime friend, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), to deliver his famous Green Destiny sword as a gift to a patron During this mission, Shu Lien meets Jen Yu, a young noblewoman, soon to marry and very unhappy with her impending fate. Played by Zhang Ziyi, Jen eventually propels both Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai on a quest for two destinies: the Green sword, and Jen's.This is one of Michelle Yeoh's finest performances. She imbues the warrior Shu Lien with both strength, and a restrained longing for Li Mu Bai. She says more with expressions than many actors do with an entire scriptful of dialogue. Yeoh definitely needs to be in more movies, martial arts or otherwise. Similarly, Chow Yun Fat makes a redoubtable hero as Li Mu Bai, as his best intentions careen out of control thanks to the impetuous Jen.Speaking of whom, Zhang Ziyi literally steals &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; from the more experienced leads. Full of fierce anger, limitless energy, and an impulsive, headstrong personality, Jen Yu's a tornado of emotions and actions, in contrast to the older warriors' dutiful restraint. As she moves from childhood into adulthood without balance, she makes some terrible decisions, and her final choice lingers, and haunts. Jen Yu, as embodied by Zhang Ziyi, is a cinematic creation easily the equal of Vivian Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara, or Kim Darby's spunky Mattie Ross from &quot;True Grit.&quot;And if the story hasn't flirted with sensory overload enough, the film even finds time for a long, David Lean-esque flashback sequence. In its desert setting and horseback thrills, it recalls &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; and with its romanticism, &quot;Dr. Zhivago.&quot; It comes at a pivotal point for Jen, and would make an entertaining movie by itself.Apart from its emotions and scope, the film's also a kinetic experience. After lyrical character interludes, the plot explodes into several eye-popping action set-pieces. Like cinematic helium, it soars, just as the characters fly over rooftops, duel with a variety of weapons, and clash on the top layers of a bamboo forest. And always, the adventure and action evolve from personal choices and needs, rather than the desire to fill time and space with bombast. This, in itself, is a minor miracle in today's CGI explosion-rocked film culture.The supporting players add to the adventure, as well. Pei-Pei Cheng plays Jade Fox, Li Mu Bai's nemesis; she's more than a one-dimensional villain (to say why would reveal a bit too much). And Chang Chen, as Lo, Jen's bandit-king lover, is by turns hilarious and charismatic.The DVD features a crisp print of the movie (superior to the one I saw in the theater), filmmaker commentary, a &quot;making-of&quot; special, and a Michelle Yeoh featurette (oh yeah!). I'm a subtitle purist, but I've sampled several scenes with the English dubbing, and it's surprisingly well-done; it's adequate for sharing the film with young (or older) people who won't be able to keep up with the subtitles. Still, for the full experience, I recommend the subtitled version, because it preserves the actors' original performances.&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is one of the finest films I've ever seen, and my personal favorite. It's outstanding in every way, and deserves to be in your collection alongside &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; Splendid, splendid stuff, as bold and as beautiful as Jen Yu, as quiet and as philosophical as Li Mu Bai.	5.0	Tigers and Dragons...	2001-06-06	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1KN89EE8GIM4T	John A. Lucero	When I go to the movies , or when I put a DVD or video in, my first intention is to be entertained. After all,isn't that why we go to the movies?  But when the movie can remove you from the everyday grind and leave you with an elated awe of the human spirit, then that's when I put the movie on my &quot;to buy list&quot;.  This movie doesn't need digital enhancements (although it didn't hurt) to make it a great story...The movie speaks for itself.  I'm not a movie critic, but I am a professional entertaier.  At the end of the night when I have people asking me for more, I know I've done something right...I made people forget about the day by having a good time.  I was a brief and pleasant deviation from their lives.  That's what the movie did for me.  Chop - sockie flicks have always had a great series of new and inovative moves combining the skills from such styles as Kung Fu, Tae Kwon Do, Ju Jitsu ect...But they've always fallen short of great acting -until now; and I think that's what turned me on to the film.  Yes it is a love story, and a true work of art considering it's cast of characters.  You couldn't ask for better acting...That was best and biggest surprise of all.  The martial arts sequences were just an added bonus.  Buy this movie, and remove yourself from the daily grind.  But most of all buy this movie because it remimnds us that love is truely alive in all of us, and that it does over come all obsticles.

This is a real mistake!!  If you give this movie a chance, you will love it- I promise.  This is not a martial arts movie, this is a drama/love story set in China.  Speaking of China, make sure to watch this movie with subtitles rather than in English, because whoever translated for the dubbed version ruined the movie.  Stick to the subtitled Mandarin Chinese version and you will be a lot better off.This movie is a real masterpiece!  The setting and scenery are beyond compare, and the acting is first rate as well.  This movie will realy get you thinking about the priorties in you life, and maybe help you reorganize them.  The story is all about love had and given away, as well as love ignored.  The relationship between the characters played by Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh is stunning, and they could not have cast those characters better.  The class struggle between the other two main characters is also brilliant.  All of this powerful story set in some of the most beautiful backdrops I have seen make this movie a instant classic.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3BO21YK08SSV8	John M Walker	Please forgive me, but those reviewers who rate this picture only as a martial arts movie are really missing the point. This is a fanciful and allegorical story told in a way that is absolutely delightful. This film is nothing less than a work of art.The three lead actors (Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi) are all brilliant in their roles. The costumes and settings are stunningly beautiful, and the special effects add magic to the story telling - which is quite different from special effects that are all there is to a story.The beauty of this production is so prodigious that even if beauty, along with the element of fantasy, were all there is this would be a satisfying and very worthwhile film - but there is more, and what is more adds depth to the tale.There is the allegorical element to which I referred; mortals trying to become god-like.  This is the allegory of original sin.The heroes in this movie are god-like beings who possess a great wisdom - a wisdom that is properly understood and held by only a select few.  It is not a power to be accessible to everyone, because only those of great goodness can be trusted with it.  It certainly is not to be obtained by shortcut.  It is the solemn and sacred duty of the good to resist the attempts of evil to gain this power. This is a timeless tale of the human experience, older than the Judeo-Christian tradition.Crouching Tiger is a flawless and captivatingly entertaining movie that ought to delight everyone from children to thinking adults.

It is, claims the ""old skool"" core of fans that make up the base of support for the industry, a complete sell-out, relying on large-scale production values and special effects rather than legitimate fighting skills of the actors (with the notable exception of veteran martial arts female lead Michelle Yeoh) in order to sell itself; it is an act of sound and fury , signifying nothing.To the vast bulk of the filmgoing public who wouldn't know ""Drunken Master"" from ""The Master Of The Flying Guillotine"" from ""The Five Masters Of Death"" from ""The Five Deadly Venoms"", that criticism meant...well, nothing at all.  What is obvious from the first scene of this movie is that the director of this movie has fashioned a labor of love that has resulted in one of the most beautifully filmed movies in the history of cinema, regardless of genre.Martial arts film purists seem to revel within the primative nature of the films that temd to define that genre.  Poor acting, shallow scripts, ABYSSMAL overdubs, hack-and-slash editing...these are not the hallmarks of classically revered movies.  Yet they seem to do more to define martial arts cinema than any other characteristic save that of the action itself.  Yet ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" does not want for action.  The combat scenes (particularly those involving Michelle Yeoh; Ang Lee definitely knew his most talented fighter and exploited her abilities to the max) are extraordinary, special-effects laden or not.  The TRIUMPH of this movie is that is sees fit to actually present a story that draws the viewer in, that allows the viewer to form an opinion about the characters in between fight scenes...as opposed to just wishing that we could ""fast-forward"" to the next combat sequence.What we have is a film more suited to the Classical Age, the Greek Tragedy with better fight choreography.  The levity and sense of comic relief that could be expected with a number of Hong Kong cinema classics (and basically every Jackie Chan film ever made) is lacking here, but it is not missed as it has no place.  Themes such as honor, social expectations, unrequited love (from unexpected sources), revenge (this is a kung fu movie, after all)...portrayed in an unconventional environment in an unusual setting (for Western audiences) make this an intriguing movie that has the bonus of some drop-dead action sequences that most people lacking a background in Hong Kong cinema are going to find quite amazing.The acting is quite impressive.  You will want to watch the Mandarin soundtrack with subtitles for the full appreciation of the effect (particularly taking into effect that the Hong Kong/Canton-based actors do not speak it normally); Chow Yun-Fat is best known for his ""gun fu"" movies made with John Woo, but the depth of his performance in this movie led to his casting opposite Jodie Foster in a non-musical remake of ""The King And I"".  Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zhi-yi (was she REALLY only a teenager when this movie was made???) are amazing and wonderfully strong female roles that aren't typically seen in Hong Kong cinema (clearly a male-dominated genre).  Some people have called this movie the best chick flick since ""Thelma and Louise"", but anyone who would classify either movie in such strictly gender-limiting terms displays an ignorance which must prove to be quite burdensome and suffocatingly limiting.  This is a terrific movie, transcending both genre and gender.  It is the martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies.  It took home Oscars that neither Bruce Lee nor Jackie Chan will ever see.  It is, simply speaking, what going to the movies is supposed to be all about.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're absolutely cheating yourself."	5.0	The Academy cheered, the martial arts film purists HOWLED	2004-11-22	17	16	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AK81WLVD5KGUX	"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan"""	Anyone in the U.S. who has heard of this movie but hasn't seen it yet probably knows of it for one of two reasons: Ang Lee and Yuen Wo Ping.Those are two very good reasons. Director Lee, of course, has gotten some attention lately for his work on the film version of Marvel's _The Hulk_ (which I think is an excellent, excellent film as well as a true-to-spirit screen adaptation of the original Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic-book series). And Yuen, of martial-arts-choreography fame, is especially well known for his brilliant work on the Wachowski brothers' _Matrix_ series (which are among my personal favorite movies ever).If you like their work on those other films, you'll love seeing what they can do together. _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ is a triumph in every respect.The cinematography is, in the literal sense of the word, spectacular. This is one of those movies that you can pause at _any_ frame and see an artfully constructed composition -- the lights and shadows, the colors, the placement of the human figures. And of course the Chinese scenery is magnificent. (Lee, who is from Taiwan and resides in New York, got special permission from the government of China to film his movie there.)The martial-arts scenes, choreographed by Yuen, are more real than reality. If you haven't moved like this in your dreams, I don't envy you your dreams. Physical bodies may not move like this, but minds do.And actually, 'choreographed' is a good description of _all_ the movement in the film, both physical and dramatic. The film (based on the novel of the same name) incorporates elements of Hong Kong wuxia films but takes up these elements into a higher and deeper synthesis. The plot ostensibly centers on the theft of a sword called the 'Green Destiny' by the mysterious outlaw known as Jade Fox (sort of a Chinese Zorro). But in addition to the intrigue and the undeniably cool martial-arts stuff, there are two romances, a whole lot of philosophical/spiritual tug-of-war in the subtext, and some sly, subtle, and subversive questioning of tradition, all of it rolled up into one big thematic package. And -- I'm not exaggerating here -- _every_ 'movement' in the film participates in its Taoist-spirited thematic development.I could comment at length on the actors, but I'll restrict myself here to admiring the work of actress/martial artist Michelle Yeoh. I'm sure people in other parts of the world have known of her for some years, but (like many others here in the U.S.) I first saw her in _Tomorrow Never Dies_ and she was easily my favorite part of the movie. (For this film, incidentally, she had to learn to speak Mandarin. I'm certainly not the person to judge her performance in that respect, but people who know the language have said that she did her job well.) She's well paired with Chow Yun Fat (who here sports a funky Manchu hairdo). I'll also mention Tan Dun's captivating soundtrack.The DVD has some nifty special features (including a commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus, a making-of documentary, and a conversation with Yeoh), but the best part is the set of options on the audio portion of the movie itself. If you want to listen to it in Mandarin and hear the actors' original voices, you'll find the English subtitles quite sufficient. And if you want to listen to it in English, you'll find that the vocal overdubs are _so_ well done that you may not even notice that they're overdubs. Somebody took extra-special care with this stuff.This is a nice package all around, with something for everybody who appreciates fine filmmaking. Don't miss it.	5.0	'To be strong and supple, that is the secret'	2004-01-17	10	7	3
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3SSB7HP50J9F2	"John Stulac ""vikingsjas"""	One of the best foreign language film made (except for any Aika Kurosawa film). This movie was such a surprise. Excellent acting and the martial arts are fantastic (something out of the Matrix). The story is so well done, what you think is a killer martial arts movie turns out to be a something else. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I have to admit that the movie started out a little slow, but picked up rather nicely. The movie also takes on a lot of flashbacks. The main characters that have found their meaning in life while others characters still searching for it. My wife thought this movie was great considering she went in thinking, &quot;Martial Arts movie, worst&quot;.

Pack all the extras on the DVD you want, you won't catch me buying it.  After a painfully slow first half hour, we finally get a fight scene and the action is pretty great (although, some of the infamous flying sequences are over the top).  Unfortunately, the action is always followed by more dialogue and story, both of which are wretched.  How this movie, with its ... dialogue (dumb lines like &quot;I will avenge my master!&quot; over and over) was nominated for a screenplay Oscar is beyond me.  If you loved it, buy it.  If you haven't seen it yet, you might want to rent this first -- I and others I know were excited when this came out in theaters, but thoroughly disappointed by the dullness of it all.	2.0	Thrilling Action, Boring Movie	2001-04-28	33	9	24

Some folks simply refuse to sit through Foreign Language flicks, and ultimately, they are losing out on experiencing a magical epic that deserves a hallowed spot atop any Top Ten list.  The special effects are dazzling as the cast literally flies, straddles tree tops and scales walls at 90 degree angles.  The cast is brilliant, especially the starring female leads, both of whom deserved Oscar nods (again, the foreign language aspect most likely kept them out of consideration).  In every way, Ang Lee completely (and seemingly effortlessly) surprises and engages each viewer.  I found myself gasping, clapping and oohing at the screen, despite seeing it by myself (again, my American friends resisted the Mandarin, though english dubbed and subtitled versions are available on DVD, but never/rarely are they as good as the original.)  I am not one for martial arts, nor for flights of fantasy.  Nor, for that matter, do I attend war flicks or action/adverture movies that often.  But this film has stuck with me now for over a year and is likely to remain in my heart and mind forever.  Read the subtitles, and miss this movie at your own risk - it is far superior to &quot;Gladiator&quot; and completely unprecedented in terms of Ang Lee's past brilliant successes (from &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; - all favorites of mine - nothing ever prepared me for this magical odessey!)  Easily one of the best films released in the past 50 years, and sure to rank high in future AFI lists, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; earns its stripes and its 5 stars in every scene, in every sequence, and in every way!

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2GB5CG77LGQRB	Jublistic	Crouching Tiger, Hidden DragonScore: 98/100Not been a big fan of martial arts movies, I was pleasantly surprised by Ang Lee's gorgeous 2000 release, which is able to mix thrills, action, adventure, romance and dramatic events into an acceptable running time. This universally acclaimed masterpiece has only been released a month or so, and already, it has become a cinema landmark.Set in a mythical China of the early 19th century, a romantic epic is spun about the theft of an ancient sword known as Green Destiny. The owner, renowned warrior Li Mui Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), and female fighter, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), discover the culprit is a young aristocrat, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), whose martial arts skills are unprecedented. As the older warriors attempt to tame this wild spirit, it becomes clear she is also under the influence of an evil force.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the kind of cinema experience that only comes along once in a lifetime and leaves you gasping for air. You can even tell this is going to be a masterful film by watching the opening credits, and you're heart will be racing during all the fight scenes and all the scenes of emotional depth in the film. Ang Lee's direction effort is quite simply amazing, he controls his cast and crew perfectly, and his powerful punch to the film definitely should earn him the Golden Globe he has got, and the Oscar he better get. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh must be credited for their awesome performances, and long-haired romantic touch Chang Cheng has a personality off-screen and on-screen that makes you love him and his character more and more each time he swash-buckles onto the screen. But, clearly the real talent here lies with Zhang Ziyi as the stunning Jen. She gives quite possibly the most convincing non-English performance since Franka Potente in Run Lola Run, and gives a role that will live forever in my memory.By far the best film of 2000, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a heart-pounding adventure, that will surely become a classic in years to come.	5.0	A brain-blasting masterpiece	2001-03-24	18	15	3

But, what an odd movie. It's not a typical Kung Fu movie in that it has an entire substance and gravity all it's own beyond being a mere martial arts flick. And yet, all that aside, the martial arts, mostly Tai Ch'i, are simply breath taking. As a student of Kung Fu, I found the forms and the weapons dead on accurate.  But there are love stories to be told. Stuff of legends, not just superfluous plot fluff to add decor to the story line. There's biting social comentary about the roles of men and women, and class struggle. There is revenge, redemption, and regret oozing from every frame. And more often than not, there are light hearted moments where you can't help but laugh.The fact that the movie is subtitled, in my opinion, maintains the integrity of the film it's self. One is given the chance to hear the dialogue and language in it's pure and natural form. After 20 miutes I didn't even notice anymore that I was reading.This movie is a jem pure and simple.

The scenery and costumes are beautiful, but that's all I liked about the film.Li Mubai is going through a period of soul searching, involving his time in a monastery, his master's unavenged murder at the hands of Jade Fox, and his love for his friend. He gives up his sword and his friend takes it to a lord in Beijing for safekeeping. The sword then is stolen by a mysterious figure in black, and that's the point at which I started to get lost. There's the translation gap and the cultural gap, and beyond that there's bad story-telling. Li Mubai, his friend, the villain, Jade Fox, the outlaw Black Cloud, and a bunch of other people whose identities I couldn't figure out, run around hunting the sword and each other in obscure places. Lengthy flashbacks intrude to disrupt what little story there is. The main characters' motivations, particularly the villain's, are never made clear. The final scene was incomprehensible.I like a realistic fight scene, but a girl who taught herself swordplay out of a book beating all comers and then running away over water? I can't suspend my disbelief that far. I'm perfectly willing to admit there's a lot I wasn't picking up in this film, but between the obscurities of the plot and the action scenes that were so ridiculous as to be boring, I didn't find much to hold my attention.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A26XOOCIJWDITO	K. Cooper	As someone who doesn't frequently watch foreign movies with subtitles, I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie and that it is good. The scenery and the sets are a treat and the 3 lead actors are all good in their parts.Now for the buts: there are some good fighting scenes but all of a sudden, the characters would fly. Everything else is realistic and believable and then we have people flying. Why? But#2: a more upbeat ending would have probably made this a better movie. But#3: The part of the young Chinese warrior is played by an actress who looks like she's 90 pounds. There are scenes where she fights off large groups of 200-250 pound men and it would have been more believable with a bigger person in this part.It is still a good movie - however, for me, the 3 buts prevent it from being a great film.	4.0	Good not great	2006-04-03	0	0	0

If I had not heard anything about the movie I might have given it an extra star but my expectations were high so it added to my disappointment.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A323K36V0CEPRI	Kevin Andrew Bender	Now, I know that a lot of people were really amazed by this movie, but I'm still trying to figure out why. Even though I'm a huge fan of martial arts movies that involve people that can jump 50 feet or more into the air, this one didn't really impress me. In fact, it's one of the tamest martial arts movies I've ever seen.First off, the fights are WAY too slow for a Michelle Yeoh movie. Anyone that's ever seen Wing Chun (the ULTIMATE action movie) would agree with me. I guess it isn't fair to compare Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to Wing Chun in some respects, but Wing Chun IS about 5 years old. In my opinion, though, Wing Chun even puts The Matrix to shame.Now, even though there are some pretty amusing parts in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you could get 100 times the laughs out of Wing Chun. Oh...but what about the romance? Big deal. I thought that the relationship between Invisible Girl and the Doctor in The Heroic Trio was done much better. Of course, if you like movies that involve countless fights to retrieve a comb, I guess Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is all right. Overall, I thought it was a disappointment, though.  Just buy Wing Chun or The Heroic Trio.  You'll be glad you did.	2.0	Umm...where's the action?	2001-09-02	3	1	2

It presents rich scenery and settings of various locales of Old China, including gorgeous natural scenery and weather, architecture with fine detail and traditional human styles of clothing, activity and mannerism. The background music ~ especially via cello and drum ~ is spot-on for mood ~ without ever being overwhelming. The flowing *kung fu* and weapons action is some of the best I have seen ~ even when blended smoothly with the more surreal magical spinning, jumping and flying activity ~ and with equally good human expression, interaction and conversation. The motives and tensions are especially well-done in moderation ~ neither under or over done. I enjoyed all the main characters and actors ~ especially Chow Yun-Fat ~ and most especially Michelle Yeoh ~ who I already appreciated via another interesting movie, *Wing Chun* ~ which is also a *kung fu action* movie with some interesting angles ~ if not quite as grand as *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A324LH8S4C8U4W	Kevin Nieman	This film sparkles with the brilliance of a precious gem, and its appearance on the DVD racks will be a delight of millions.&quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; benefits from many talents, not the least of which is an expert director, Ang Lee, the excellence of acting veterans, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat, and the brazen acting debut by Chinese film newcomer, Zhang Zi Yi. All elements of this film flow together like a fine stew. Drop a dash of Chinese mythology, a sprinkling of martial arts mayhem, and a heaping helping of, possibly, the most beautiful landscapes and images put to film, and you cannot help but like this movie.I know I am not alone in saying that &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; was robbed at the 2001 Academy Awards.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AO461REE0KA4J	keviny01	The movie's title is an old Chinese saying which refers to mysterious and dangerous people (&quot;dragons and tigers&quot;) who are lurking around every corner.  It is also a pun, for two characters in the movie, referred to as &quot;Jen&quot; and &quot;Lo&quot; in the subtitles, happen to be named &quot;Lovely Dragon&quot; and &quot;Little Tiger&quot;.  The irony is that &quot;Lovely Dragon&quot; detests being hidden and &quot;Little Tiger&quot; is tired of crouching and waiting; their youthful rebellion is a perfect contrast against the repressed feelings and demeanors of an older couple played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.  There is also a contrast of people who pursue material gains (one character steals a woman's comb, another steals a sword) against others who strive to achieve a higher level of understanding and enlightenment.  These potent themes are what elevate this glorious martial-arts film from other films in this genre.  The imaginative fight sequences are fantastic and exhilarating, but they do not dominate the movie as they often do in movies of this genre.  Kudos to director Ang Lee and co-writer James Schamus.  (The two had never made a martial-arts movie before, and in fact had made 2 box-office bombs prior to CROUCHING TIGER.)The anamorphic video transfer on the DVD is outstanding -- images are crisp and sharp, colors are vibrant and realistic.  The picture overall looks a bit dark for my liking, but details are never obscured.  This is one of the best-looking DVDs I've ever seen.The DVD includes optional yellow English subtitles and an English dub track.  Although subtitles are almost always preferrable to dubs, this DVD happens to have one of the best written English dubs I've ever heard.  Lee and Schamus worked on the translations for the dub themselves, and the result is literate and polished.  In one scene, the tersely written subtitle reads, &quot;Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption.&quot;  But the more lyrical English dub reads, &quot;We are beset with peril, and it is not weapons.  The real danger resides in the human heart.&quot;  This is not to say that I'm recommending the dub over the subtitles, of course.  The viewer should never be denied the chance to hear an actor's own voice, which is ALWAYS more authentic-sounding than someone else's.The DVD's audio commentary track is informative and entertaining.  Lee and Schamus speak with great self-deprecation when they criticize many of their own choices -- the &quot;cliches' in the fight scenes, the &quot;cheesiness&quot; of some of the dialogs, the lessons they learned during the shooting.  Early in the commentary Lee explains what &quot;Giang Hu&quot; is: &quot;If filmmaking is a 'world', then Hollywood would be a 'Giang Hu'.&quot;  A &quot;sub-world&quot;, so to speak.  Lee also jokes about how he &quot;prayed to the water, which symbolizes money, box office.&quot;  The two also recount various difficulties from the directorial and screenwriting perspectives.There is also a 20-minute &quot;making-of&quot; special that features a few clips of Lee working on the set, sound bites from Lee, Schamus, Yeoh, Chow, composer Tan Dun, and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and a short clip of Coco Lee singing the theme song.  Michelle Yeoh has her own interview segment where she elaborates more on her craft and the movie's themes.The DVD comes with PCFriendly, but web links are the only DVD-ROM features.	5.0	A movie for the ages	2001-07-04	5	4	1

It's as if someone from another culture dismissed science fiction movies as an art form because faster than light speed is probably impossible and will never happen.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1XBHMYPNHIM42	kriess@mega.co.za	Ang Lee (&#65533;Sense and Sensibility,&#65533; &#65533;The Ice Storm,&#65533; &#65533; Eat Drink Man Woman&#65533;) and his long-time collaborator James Shamus (who wrote the screenplay with Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Kuo Long) bring to the screen a breathtaking story of love, adventure, revenge and honor. This movie is based upon the fourth novel of a five-part series by author Wang Dulu. From the very first minute of watching this movie, my senses were galloping to the world of mystical fantasy that was China. I was presented with such awe-inspiring scenery of small towns as in the 19th Century Qing Dinasty (shot in Beijing and Xinjing), to the breathtaking scenes from the beautiful and immense Gobe Desert &#65533; a suitable place to introduce the second of two romances in this story. Some of the desert scenes are reminiscent of shots from &#65533;The English Patient&#65533; and are nothing short of jaw dropping spectacular. I was immediately sold on the romance of China.The story begins with the meeting of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who have always restrained their feelings for one another out of honor for Shu Lien&#65533;s slain husband. Li Mu Bai wants to give up his Wudan fighter days and lay to rest his revenge against Jade Fox, who killed his master. During meditation training at Wudan Mountain, Li Mu Bai encountered an endless sorrow that gripped his heart. He now wants to find peace from that sorrow by giving his master&#65533;s sword, called Green Destiny to Sir Te in Peking. This sets the prelude to a fantastic story, in which the Green Destiny Sword is stolen from Sir Te and the movie follows the attempts of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien to retrieve it. That brings Shu Lien in contact with a wealthy district governor&#65533;s daughter, Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) who leads a strict proscribed life. From here the storyline splits into two plots, in which we get to know some history of Jen Yu and discover that under her quiet exterior there is a yearning for liberation. Yet everything is not what it seems on the surface and Jen Yu harbours a secret that is the turning point of this story.It is indeed Jen Yu who impresses most with her young sparkling untamed spirit and beauty - a girl who longs to be a warrior and demonstrates incredible fighting prowess that leaves me gasping for more. There is a remarkable fight sequence in a restaurant that truly displays the extraordinary skills of Zhang Ziyi. Being only 19 years old, she had no previous knowledge of martial arts at the beginning of filming, and was trained completely on the spot.At the heart of the movie is the contrast of Li Mu Bai, who throughout, uses reflection and meditation to consider his path, versus Jen, who rebels against the traditions of eastern culture and philosophy. This is evident in a fighting scene between the two, where she asks him to stop talking like a monk and fight. It is this extreme rebellion of Jen that leads to such deep despair, which leaves the viewer wondering if her character can be redeemed. It also sets the scene of a beautiful, but haunting love story between Jen and her barbarian lover Lo. For those of you who are wondering where the title &#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#65533; came from, here&#65533;s your answer. The name for &#65533;Dragon&#65533; is embedded in the script of the name of the character, Jen, which makes Lo the Tiger. The &#65533;crouching&#65533; and &#65533;hidden&#65533; parts make sense as they relate to those two characters. However, Ang Lee also stresses that every character in the film is a &#65533;hidden dragon&#65533; in some sense. &#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#65533; is also a quote from Chinese mythology. It refers to hiding your strength from others; advice which is followed too well by the main characters of the film.The action and martial art scenes in this movie are nothing short of spectacular, as they are choreographed by Yuen Woo-Ping, whose signature was all over &#65533;The Matrix&#65533;. The characters defy the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walk along walls and even conduct a sword fight high above 40 feet in the air clinging to the tops of tall, swaying trees, swinging back and forth. What is breathtaking is that the actors are actually there in those treetops and rooftops! Computers were used only to remove the safety wires that held the actors, and they performed the majority of the stunts themselves with their awesome athletic abilities. That is truly awesome!Ang Lee succeeds in putting the long-established genre of Chinese Wuxia films back on the map from their previous B grading in the industry. The Wuxia were a class of knights during the time of Confucius, who, in fantasy based fiction, often have magical abilities like flight (gravity free leaps), speed, reflexes and strength of superhuman levels. China has been making these movies (called Wuxia Pien) for years, but few have had the funds or worldwide exposure of &#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&#65533; Also, Ang Lee turns the tables on the male-dominated martial arts films by injecting it with strong female roles, the likes of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, the heroines of this movie. Ang Lee plans to eventually direct a prequel and a sequel that will address parts of the novel that didn&#65533;t make it to this film. The title of the prequel may be &#65533;Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin,&#65533; depending on translation.&#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#65533; is one of those rare films that grabs you early on and rides your senses until its immense emotional climax. It transcends any martial arts movie and becomes one of a kind, combining action and romance. It&#65533;s glorious, shameless in its escapism and a true epic. The ending scenes are hauntingly wonderful. The movie can be summarised in the final words of Li Mu Bai to Shu Lien: &#65533;I&#65533;ve wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath that I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit.&#65533;	5.0	The True Heart of Romance and Martial Arts	2001-09-05	2	2	0

But although it is a very graphic experience that deserves a place in every artistic inclined DvD collection, it's overall impact is unfortunately hindered by extremely poor wire/fight coordination and an unbalanced, overdone storyline. I believe indeed that this film's success is largely based on ther general public's ignorance on asian moviemaking, and encourage everyone interested in the genre to watch titles like Tsu Hyark's The Blade, a flawless and far more believable experience.

I liked a number of things about it.  I actually did like the fight scenes, and the flying didn't bother me at all; I thought it was rather lovely, really.  Michelle Yeoh's dignity and grace magnified her beauty; I saw her in Tomorrow Never Dies and didn't think much of her but here she was just wonderful.  So much has been made of the strong women in this movie, though, that one of the things that disappointed me was that she is so often the one to screw up and then be bailed out by Chow Yun Fat.  Now, he's another of the disappointments.  I loved him in Anna and the King, but he's a little flat in this.Here's the thing:  it's well-acted.  Many of the fight scenes are wonderful.  But it's clearly supposed to be deep and moving, and for me it was neither of those things.  If it hadn't been billed as a life-changing movie I probably would have liked it more, but because that's how it was talked about, I can only feel like it ultimately fails.	3.0	really I want to say 3 and a half stars	2001-10-09	3	3	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1XSKZN07IG780	Larry Eischen	This movie is truly the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen.  The landscapes and cities are breathtaking in their beauty.  Along with the cinematography, there is an action-packed martial arts film with a romantic film hidden inside, truly something for everyone.  The story is based on Chinese legends-2 &quot;old&quot; (in their 40s) warriors become enmeshed in what may be their final adventure when a thief steals a legendary sword.  Although the thief seems to be young, her methods are those of an old enemy of the warriors.  In addition, they are faced with a princess who is about to be forced into an arranged marriage, but who harbors a secret affair with a bandit chieftain.  For those unfamiliar with Hong Kong action or The Matrix, there are plenty of stunts done with concealed wires, allowing the characters to run across water,  leap from rooftop to rooftop, and setting up a beautifully choreographed battle among the treetops of the countryside. Unbelievable?  No more unbelievable than the the Clint Eastwood characters who never miss with guns that never run out of ammo.  No more unbelievable than Bruce Willis outrunning fireballs from bomb blasts. For those who hate subtitles, on DVD with the English language option, this is the best dubbed Chinese language film I've ever seen.  No bad actors with funny voices here, the dubbing does not detract from the film's quality.  I've now seen it with subtitles, dubbed and, although I don't speak or understand Chinese, plan to watch it in Chinese with no subtitles just to listen to the actors' voices.  This film should have beat Gladiator for best film of the year.  No matter how  you feel about foreign films, you owe it to yourself to see this film.	5.0	A Great Intro to Foreign Films	2001-06-07	3	3	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A4WHMU7URBMPL	Lawrence Santoro	There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&quot;In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart.  They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is.  While it may not be the most wondrous thing ever...it is a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart at the core of all that technical superiority.  The action sequences are the kind that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than the sort that leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.&quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot;, I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's &quot;Lawrence of Arabia!&quot;) to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights.  High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called &quot;wire work&quot; in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot;, Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.  The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.Pant, pant, pant...And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.The center of the film...remarkably...is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  I say that she is remarkable because her story is the binding element of the film.  And she holds the film together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both the dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas de deus (okay...did I spell that right?) that frame the conflicts between them.  She is the &quot;Luke Skywalker&quot; of the piece, if you will...though &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; has everything the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga had: excitement, thrills and magic, but here, it is wrapped in those things Lukasfilm wanted to give, but succeeded in delivering in only the most self-conscious way: heart and deep-placed spirit.By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood onscreen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the &quot;Full Peckinpaw,&quot; if you will.  Here, however, this stylization works beautifully!While there are those who might grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and trick photography...okay...true enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is put in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile burdens of emotions!So there.  Enough?  Just go see it.I can't wait for the DVD!  I'll probably see it again, maybe see it twice again, before it hits the home-market.	5.0	I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but...	2001-01-11	84	74	10

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1KBMCAK7U90K3	Lay Hoon	I have always like swordfighting epics. However, this one was spoiled by the fact that Chow Yun Fatt and Michelle Yeoh speak atrocious Mandarin. It was extremely irritating to the ear. Lee Ang should have just allowed them to speak Cantonese, which would have sounded more natural and fluent.The swordfighting scenes are very enjoyable. The music was great - tense and emotive.I am not that maidens in ancient China ran their own businesees -a protected courier business at that.  In the Sung Dynasty, most would have been required to stay at home, not even to emerge to the great hall if there were visitors. They would not have been allowed to get into proximity with men. The same would have applied to widows, which was the official status of Michelle Yeoh's character. Did I enjoy the movie anyway? Yes, I did. I have always enjoyed Chow Yun Fatt - ever since &quot; Man In The Net&quot;! But CTHD somehow has an &quot;exotic&quot; , almost foreign , feel to it - something I don't quite like as I am Chinese and things Chinese should not feel &quot;exotic&quot;! The irony is that it is also foreign to non-Chinese!	3.0	Atrocious Mandarin	2001-08-30	1	0	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3B5RZM6DP08E0	Leanne Roberts	Well, I was very unimpressed with the work. It lacked any form of reality, which is what fantasy should be rooted in. You cannot throw reality out the window when you create a fantasy film. It also didn't end right. The girl was a horrible person, and the film may have been more believable if the guy jumped. Besides, she didn't jump, she flew. And she didn't have a pure heart with which to make that kind of sacrifice. It was more like a slap in the face. I didn't appreciate it and came away from the film disgusted.It would have been much better if the main character didn't die. That, also, was a cheap shot and a lot of hooey. I wasn't all that sad to tell the truth. By then I was just angry that the film was dragging on so long.The fight scenes were okay, though. They were obviously fake and didn't hold much water for me, but some people were impressed. My friend (who is from Korea and used to watching films like this) was extremely disappointed.So, both of us come off sadly disappointed with the utter lack of brilliance in the film.	1.0	What a Disappointing Film	2001-08-08	24	7	17

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2K97HCY2OLW61	Lee Buchenau	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a rare example of a film that attempts and successfully transcends its genre. The picture is filled with the conventions of the martial arts picture, but it adds visual poetry and effective drama to the mix. All the standard scenes of a martial arts pictures are there from the avenging the death of the master to the big brawl in the two level tavern. Lee's drama sometimes passes into heavy melodrama, but is mostly very effective. It is important to note that the film was made as a fantasy and Lee points out on the supplements.A lot happens in Crouching Tiger's two hours and there are many moments that are memorable. Lee's drama doesn't push the action scenes out of the way, there is a brutal multi weapon showdown between Ziyi and Yeoh and a rousing wire-fu hand to hand sequence. Tan Dun's score drives the action and intensifying the emotions appropriately. The on location footage and stunning sets make for gorious images. The only problem with the structure of the film is an awkward transition in the middle of the narrative that suddenly shifts to an extended flashback scene in the desert. This shift is bad but the scene is one of the film's highlights as Ziyi pursues the charming desert bandit Chen. Chen's Lo character looks a lot like the prototype for Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribean. All in all the film succeeds on many levels and holds up after several viewings.Film 5 out of 5.The Sony Dvd of Crouching Tiger offers a few worthwhile extras, but presents a slighly flawed video. The images is suprisingly shimmer free in the tree scenes, but seemed soft especially in the first half of the film. White specks were quite noticable in dark scenes, for such a recent movie I was surprised the print was not cleaned more carefully. Presented in 2:35:1 ratio the subs are low into the black, so 16X9 tvs beware. The audio is excellent with strong voice and effects. Music and bass come out on good levels making an excellent audio experience.Extras have an audio commentary with Lee and co-writer Schamus. The talk is relaxed because they are long time collaborators and Schamus helps to drive the talk along by questioning Lee. Unfortunately Schamus's smug comments on the film drag down interest in the commentary. Eventually he becomes tiresome and  annoying and it probably isn't worth listening to the whole thing. There is a long interview with Yeoh, but she talks solely about the project from her perspective and her own career. Fans of hers will like it, but others may find it rather one track. Surprisingly she speaks very little Manadarin and was really challenged to perform the dialogue. The Bravo special is much better because it provides her comments with Lee's to give a full picture to the ideas surrounding the film. It is advised to watch this after viewing the film, because it doesn't discuss production so much as and concept and characters. It tells a lot of the plot before hand. There is a cool slide show gallery of on set images from the film with the movie score.Be aware there is a Sony Superbit version of the film. This release is supposed to have better picture and sound, but the extras are removed. This edition costs a few more dollars. I haven't seen the Superbit edition, but an online compairson (check dvd-basen) showed slightly sharper picture.DVD 4 out of 5.	4.0	DVD Review	2004-01-06	1	1	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1VXKNQ5IR9BVH	LEUNG mei-yee Jacqueline	When I saw the film the first time, I thought that Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon is not a proper name for the film as the name implies a lot of &quot;yang&quot; power as derived from a large number of warriors or swordsman fighting in big battles, something like a Chinse Kurosawa samurai film, or an Apollonian epic in the westerners' sense.  So may it I should give it a four stars, I thought, as it failed to be a &quot;real&quot; wuxia epic.Then I saw the film the second time.  I began to understand that it was a better film than I first thought.  And the title serves the film well.  It must also be a qualified five-star film and even one of the classic or masterpiece in film history.  It must be one of the best 100 films if AFI re-counted the best 100, that is, if CTHD could be regarded as a Hollywood Film.First the casting is perfect.  Chow Yun-fat is the best choice as a romantic wuxia swordsman as he could act as Li Mubai a taoist swordsman who knows woman's feelings but on the other hand also a master of Taoist wisdom and Chinese masculinity.  It is also the film of Michelle Yeoh in which she showed she could really act well (the rest of her film wasted her talents, I am afraid), to the credit of Ang Lee who must have given her a lot of acting advice, I believe.  Then Zhang Ziyi is a knockout actress - the perfect Jen - sensitive, sensual and sensational -an upstart Saint Joan whom all masters want to disciple.Second the music composed by Tan Dun and played by Ma Yo-yo is just a magic touch of Michaelangelo - the drum beats and the cello are just like brush of energy and emotions mixed together, a perfect balance of yin and yang; and the film, a balance of action and romance.I have seen quite a number of reviews in Amazon and I think quite a number of western reviewers have misunderstood the movie.  It is not an action film like one from Bruce Lee and it is not a romantic film like Chow's An Autumn's Tale (which Chow showed he could be a real romantic actor).  It is actually a film in which the Director Ang Lee searched for his Chinese orign, a film of Chinese philosophy, Chinese psychology and Chinese art and medicine as embracive as the Book of Change, but intended mainly for the western audience with a message.  In this sense, I finally found the title of the film Crouching Tiger and Hiddren Dragon suits perfectly as it demonstrated the tremendous psyche exhibited by the film - a hidden power for love, hatred, self-destruction in all human being.  This is why, I believe, one reviewer compares the film to a Greek tragedy.See it, and understand more about Chinese culture, and the message Ang Lee wanted to convey: we human being are just the same (be it Oriental or Occidental), vulerable and bigoted as the mortal or may be even the immortal as depicted in the Greek mythology.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2JT39DC94C36D	"Leung Pak Keung ""jasonsib"""	based on an epic novel with the same name, crouching tiger, hidden dragon gets its name from a chinese proverb that refers to hidden heroes that emerge from the fact that nothing is in fact what it seems. as a mythological fantasy, it tells the story of a legendary warrior, li (chow yun-fat) and another female warrior, yu (michelle yeoh). on a mission to deliver li's sword, the green destiny to beijing, it was stolen and was finally traced to a young aristocrat (zi-yi zhang) with a lust for independence.with an ensemble cast of all-star chinese actors and internationally-acclaimed director ang lee (sense and sensibility, the ice storm), it easily becomes one of the most anticipated motion pictures in 2000 and one of the major contenders in oscar next year.unfortunately, crouching tiger, hidden dragon is not able to deliver what i expected. in fact, it is a huge disappointement for me mainly due to the poor script and surprisingly bad acting from the protagonists. ang lee made a very disastrous decision, trying his best to make this chinese legend, which supposes to be serious, to become a comedy. in fact, it would not be a problem if it is really funny and the viewers do feel good. but it is not. what the people would like to see is not some stupid fight scenes but some brilliant and exciting actions from the same man responsible for the matrix sequences.the acting is below par overall, especially chang chen and michelle yeoh. you can hardly say if they are acting or if they are just reading word by word from the script. zi-yi zhang, who recently starred in zhang yi mou's the road home, gives the best performance among all the protagonists.the cinematography is good comparatively. it'd particularly appeal to foreigners as the film captures the landscapes in north-western china and the spectacular architecture of the qing dynasty. music by tan dun is good but not outstanding. theme song by coco lee is worth-listening, though.	3.0	Overrated...	2001-10-15	19	6	13

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A32AHL4QO77OMR	Lex Preistner	When Ang Lee first released Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I sincerly doubt he thought it would garnish so much publicity... the fact that it has is a testament to his almost-magical skills as a director. The movie boasts a consummate cast, including Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King) and follows the life of a young noble woman in china, desperately seeking the adventurous, unrestrained life of a warrior. This film contains many flawless fighting scenes which are at least tantamount to those seen in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, if not excedingly spectacular.One scene in this movie, in particular, astounded me... the &quot;tree&quot; scene, in which two warriors duke it out, flying and peddling through the lush, tropical asian flora in swaying white robes.This movie contained all the depth and breadth of classical greek mythology, all the drama and verve of tragic-romances, and yet, remained very well acted for such a kinesthetic film.Ang Lee's flick deserved much more than 4 Academy Awards, and if you haven't already seen this...

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A17KM0XCD15EE1	L. Fuller	"Leave what you know about China behind and get ready for a China based on Taoist fantasy. Though I have seen many Chinese films (including historical and ""art"" films), I was knocked over by this Chinese Heroic Fantasy. From a cinematic viewpoint, the film borrows heavily from earlier Chinese movies of this genre. However, CTHD ranks amongst the most polished and beautiful to date. The musical score is among the best for the year and the scenery is breathtaking.After the first few minutes, reading the subtitles becomes so automatic that you almost forget they are there. For Mandarin speakers, however, get set for rather heavily accented speech from most of the major cast members. Considering that many of the persons in the movie are supposed to be mercenaries, the accents may actually add to the movie's charm.The DVD version has added an English sound track to the movie.  The English dialog neither matches the English captioning nor is it a direct translation of the Mandarin.  It seems to be written to sync with the characters' mouth movements."	5.0	Polished Chinese Heroic Fantasy	2001-03-14	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3TGSLLCGWP9C9	"""limespider"""	It may be too soon to call this one of the best movies of all time without first having it pass the test of time.  Will I still be pulling out my DVD copy to watch over and over twenty years from now?  I willing to bet the answer is, 'Absolutely!'If for no other reason, CTHD is worth seeing for the scenery alone.  It is the most breathtakingly beautiful movie I have ever seen.  It even surpasses the flamingo scene from 'Out of Africa'.  The musical score meshes perfectly with every scene, my particular favorite being the drum sequence during the first fight between Shu Lien and Jen in the Forbidden City.  And then there is the fighting itself, which is so much more artistic in nature than the mere brawling styles of Segal or Van Damme, that one finds themselves entranced.Many people have been comparing CTHD to 'The Matrix', which is fine as far as the comparison goes,  but that doesn't come close to capturing the whole picture.  This film has the physical intensity of The Matrix but with the dexterity and gracefulness of a ballet, the cinemagraphics of Lawrence of Arabia, the subtlety of Hamlet, and the intrigue of King Lear, all wrapped up in a fantasy of romance and adventure.Yet evidently the film did not do as well in Hong Kong as it did in the U.S.  The reason, at least according to the papers, is that there was not enough martial arts violence to appease the Hong Kong crowd and that flying through a bamboo forest was too unrealistic.  As opposed to realistic films such as Superman?  Indiana Jones?  Star Trek?  CTHD is an elegant fantasy, not some one dimensional John Woo action flick with big explosions for people with attention deficit disorder.  You have to read subtitles (if you don't speak Mandarin), and you have to think, and you have to follow the intertwining lives of four different characters, all of whom give masterful performances and none of which drown out the performances of the others.Heroism, honor, discipline, faithfulness, as well as treachery, guilt, regret, and sorrow, character traits that are so often missing from the shallow plots and cookie cutter roles that Hollywood so often churns out, are in abundance in this film.  Shu Lien, Li Mu Bai, Jen, and Lo are more real, that is say more believable as true personalities, than any of the characters in the more &quot;realistic&quot; martial arts films that the people of Hong Kong seem to prefer.I am a big fan of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and the Hong Kong action genre (John Woo notwithstanding), but this is not that kind of film and should not be compared to that style.We will soon see if the 'academy' has the sophistication to give CTHD the Best Picture Oscar it deserves.	5.0	Best movie in a quarter century	2001-03-20	45	40	5

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A17FLA8HQOFVIG	Linda Linguvic	Shot entirely in mainland China, and using the most modern technical effects, this video has the best martial arts action scenes I have ever seen.  Subtitled in Chinese, the story is simple to follow.  Yun-Fat Chow of &quot;Anna and the King&quot; is cast as the hero who is searching for the killer of his master.  But the film belongs entirely to the women.  Michelle Yeoh is cast as the woman warrior who has not married him because of family complications; not only is she an accomplished martial artist, but this role calls for some serious acting. There's an older woman Pei-pei Cheng, another fantastic martial artist who plays the villain.  But the most memorable performance of all is by the young Ziyi Zhang in the role of the young teenager who steals a sacred sword and flees from her arranged marriage.The fight scenes are absolutely spectacular!  Choreographed with exquisite artistry, they mostly feature the women.  You have to suspend a bit of belief in the real world though, because these sword fighters have the ability to walk up walls,  leap a dozen stories high, and even fly.  But it's all done so well, that I just sat and watched in amazement, the story merely a backdrop to this action.  Feminists will applaud this film;  it demonstrates women's physical strength and endurance like no other.  Yes, it is violent, but the fact that it is fantasy dilutes that effect.  And themes of love, honor and vengeance drive the story forward.  Highly recommended.	5.0	A masterpiece of myth and fantasy	2001-07-29	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AD2BIAIH78QI5	"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal"""	but then it happened AGAIN to me, Incredible Shrinking Movie! Which is to say, some movies need to be seen on the big screen because when you rent them, they seem a lot less significant than in the theatre (see my review of Kate Winslet's &quot;Titanic&quot; for another entry in this category).So that's part of the reason I cannot give it 5 stars. The other reason is that the film goes off on a major tangent when we learn about the Young People's love affair. Time to get out your scissors and edit it yourself to keep the momentum going.All that being said, I enjoyed &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; much more than I ever thought I would. I was curious to see it solely because it was directed by Ang Lee, who did such admirable work with &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, a great favorite of mine. When I tried to organize an outing among my friends, I was met with great resistance because they wouldn't see an Asian movie or a martial arts film starring nobody they ever heard of. The two people most inclined to go declined as they had actually seen it already, but applauded my wishing to see it, as they enjoyed it. So in the end, I went with three people who were more interested in the promised Mexican dinner afterwards. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED to FIND THEY LOVED IT! Yes, it was effectively acted and superbly filmed in breathtaking outdoor locations. Art direction first rate. And the fighting was choreographed in a balletic style which was utterly graceful. The much-talked about flying sequences gave the movie a fairy-tale feeling, like something out of the Arabian nights. And, except for that trip to the Young People's Love Affair, the story line was very good. I was surprised to see that it was really a Women's Picture, with most of the fighting concerning them and the storyline featuring them almost to the exclusion of the male characters.So, I would recommend &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; heartily to folks who think they never could, ever would like a martial arts movie. There's a lot more hidden than just the dragon!	4.0	The First Two Times, I Really Liked It...	2001-10-13	6	6	0

I am thrilled to see my dreams of China on the screen: such beauty, such unique characters, such understated tragedy of Hamletesque screenwriting and characters.Those who do not have a special connection to China will still love this movie (if they aren't Joe sixpack who won't read subtitles.) The on-screen letterbox book format made the subs very readable and were very close to the words spoken by the actors.This is an extraordinary movie, a reminder of the secrets of Asia and the beauty of martial arts when danced, not punched, with one's opponent -- the dance that is the art of Tao combined with the warrior duty of the Emporor's dynasty. Women viewers will be stunned by the beauty and strength of these fluid participants in their destiny. I continue to learn more of the language, the landscape I see in my dreams, the words I hear when reading the sacred scripts.The sheer beauty of the choreography is stunning in the mist that is China. Yo Yo Ma outdoes himself in the soundtrack and I will add it to my extensive collection of his work. Even those who don't appreciate the soul of a great Cellist must have this opportunity to dip their fingers in the water of orchestral beauty. I suggest &quot;The Last Emporer&quot; when adding this to yourwish list and reserving a full evening to find your way to the Oriental mysteries--older than any other great civilization--fresh and inspiring to us.	5.0	Fluid motion in the mist that is China	2002-10-15	8	7	1

I applaud the bravery of these film makers, given a Western market, to make the movie in Mandarin and have the plot Chinese style: no sex, the female lead commits suicide because she understands all her wrong doings, the death of Chow Yu Fat preventing possible marriage with Michelle, and Michelle's loyalty to her belated financee. This is who we are! A mature and deep understanding required to fully understand this movie, especially its' ending. Best picture oscar should have gone to ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' because the scenery is real, unlike all the digitalized graphics of ''The Gladiator,'' but of course, the best oscar has to go to the Whites.	5.0	Traditional Chinese	2001-04-19	22	8	14

I watched it on DVD a year later.In the span of time in which it came out in the movies and when I watched it, I of course heard all the hype and the praise that surrounded it. &quot;Fantastic plot!&quot; &quot;The fight scenes were amazing!&quot; &quot;Ziyi is freakin' hot (which doesn't make a difference to me, on a side note)!&quot; &quot;Amazing actors!&quot; &quot;Best movie ever!&quot;I came to expect a lot from this movie. I was, quite literally, bouncing as the DVD started.Was I let down. The plot, though it tries valiantly to come off as deep and intelligently brooding, was far from amazing. The main plot itself is shallow enough: Lost magic sword. Find magic sword. That's the gist of it. There are, of course, millions of subplots, all of which have been done time and time again. The characters are nothing more than your cliched characters-pseudovillains-protagonists. The love story(ies) have been done more than once, you might even be able to find it in cheesy romance novels.All in all, I would have given this movie 1 star, if not for its fight scenes, which were also highly overrated. They were nice, but they weren't as good as people made them out to be.I suggest The Matrix before this one.	2.0	highly overrated	2002-02-18	19	9	10

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ADJXL0W0RJ7VV	Lord Chimp	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the greatest martial arts movie I've ever seen. Like all great films in the genre, there are reams of battles, but Director Ang Lee has taken things farther. His movie isolates and preserves the pivotal element of personal excellence over the conflict itself. It is uniquely heroic to see a warrior's gravity defying leaps and bounds, conquer his enemy through virtuous character as much as actual feats of combat prowess, and stand triumphant over a legion of his inferiors (individual vs. the collective?).When I saw this movie with a friend of mine who generally derided martial arts movies for their silliness, even she was amazed by the battle choreography and deeply touched by the story. Intensifying the combat is the simple romance which captures an intimate quality often missing from these movies. The skillful translation, combined with the subtle yet effective acting, layers the fundamentals of the story with emotional clarity that conveys these feelings, instead of just telling the player of them. The scenery is often beautiful, capturing the Romanticism of the setting and the story.And the battle scenes... Awe-inspiring in their speed and athletics, I've never seen more exhilarating physical confrontations. I cannot describe the breathless sense of urgency enjoined by these fights, which are tests are character as much as battles. Watching the battles more than once reveals a remarkable level of depth and ingenuity behind the choreography. The greatest combative moment in the film comes in an unconventional setting: treetops. Here, the characters bound across the leafy canopy, trading blows with a shriek of steel that seems out of place in a setting so exquisite. It's like poetry in motion. Just watching it gave me shivers.An amazing film; so much more than a martial arts movie.	5.0	Beauty and battle.	2001-04-24	7	6	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A28MEMEJVWJM00	"Lo Teng-Lung ""Lantern"""	The movie is a masterpiece and has earned worldwide compliment.  The most critical part for Chinese speakers is that Chow (as Li Mu-Bai) and Yeon (as Yu Shiu-Lien) are not speaking good Mandarin.  I would like to see this point in a humorous way: the movie is winner of best foreign film.  It explains all: it is a best foreign film for Chinese and non-Chinese speakers.It is important to accept this point of view, because from 12th century there are people moving in the big territory, it is not possible that everyone speaks good Peking accent, even in the capital, people from all provinces and merchants traveling on silk roads.  The Ching Dynasty was established by Manchu, the race has dialect and writing system from northeast China.  If we have more understanding on the background, it will be much easier to accept the film as a foreign film in stead of a Chinese language film.What does Chinese language film mean?  Crunching Tiger Hidden Dragon was directed by Taiwanese Ang Lee; performed by Chow (HK), Yeon (Malaysia), Zang Ziyi (as Jen, from China), and Chang Chen (as Lo, from Taiwan); photographed and designed by the best art professionals from HK; music composed by Tan Dun, from China and now in US; music played by Yoyo Ma; film published by Sony Classic (Japanese owned, registered in US).  In the Academy nomination list, this is a Taiwan film, but in my opinion it is a global work.If we see things this way, we will not be limited by the language.  The movie is a masterpiece in both art achievement and commercial success.  It shows the Kung-Fu that we Chinese has never seen, brings the magnificent landscape to every theater around the world, and replaces my painful memory of 19th century China with the extraordinary beauty and wonder that is possibly never exists in human history.My suggestion is: take it easy, and relax to enjoy a movie, it&iexcl; just a movie, not a literature work that you need to sit straight and read between the lines.  Remember when Jen escaped from Lo&iexcl; cave and lost in the desert and felt asleep, when she woke up, she is in the cave again.  Everybody in theater laughs, but the whole scene has no dialog.  This is the charming and attraction of movies, and it is the reason why it breaks down and barrier of language and race to be one of the most influential media today.	5.0	An All Time Masterpiece	2001-04-24	14	12	2

I just could not take the whole experience in in one sitting - it left me visually stunned.  Because I was outvoted at home, the first time I viewed the DVD, we used the English version, and although I still found the film to be exciting, it wasn't quite as enjoyable as is the original Chinese version.There is little I can say to add to the multitude of voices that have reviewed this film.  I found the director's vision to be so vast and complex that is was astounding.  The window it opened to the beauty of central China  was incredible.  Lee was definitely in control of the pacing and of the performances of his cast, which are outstanding, but pale in comparison to the texture of the story and the backdrop of what is China.This is one of those films where words fail to describe the experience, and gushing praise just makes others who view the film wonder ....&quot;What's all the fuss about?&quot;.  If you view it as a martial arts film, or a historical romance, or an epic, each view is too limited.  It is all of these things, and more.Crouching Tiger will be in my list of the top 5 films of all time for many years to come.

I have no familiarity with true Chinese culture but it reminded me somewhat of the &quot;A Hundered Secret Senses&quot; by Amy Tan in terms of the introduction is offers to another way of viewing the world.The story begins by introducing two older warriors, Shu Lien (female) and Li Mu Bai (male), members of a fighting underworld. Li Mu Bai has had an epiphany and decided to drop his warrior ways, beleiving that they will bring sorrow. He asks Su Lien to take his sword, the ancient and magical Green Destiny to an old associate in Peking. While there, she meets Jen, the daughter of the local Governer who is soon to be married.The same night, the sword is stolen by a masked stranger who engages in a phenominal battle with Shu Lien for the sword. It is  obvious that the stranger has tremendous talent, of course the mysterious stranger turns out to be the young, impetuous Jen.  The other main characters are the mysterious Jade Fox, a warrior who killed the master of Li Mu Bai and for whom he wished to extract revenge, and Lo, the barbarian lover of Jen.The movie revolves around the delicate love story between the two older warriors and the turmoil surrounding Jen, who causes trouble to all others as she fights against the requirements of her family and position and her own wishes to be free and to develop her talent.The characters are beautifully played, the photography exquisite and the action scenes quite startling. As has been mentioned here previously, American sensibilities may not be satisfied with the bittersweet ending, however, maintaining an open mind will allow those individuals to enjoy the freedom of coming to our own conclusions of what appears to be a necessary sacrifice.	4.0	Wonderful introduction to another cultures philosophy.	2001-09-17	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A21G1HKUQPHFKI	"Luis M. Ramos ""Soundtrack and Film Freak"""	2000 was not the great year in movies.  Almost all the films I saw that year were either so-so or really bad.  But I thank God for Ang Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, the best movie of the year 2000, in my opinion.The story of two legendary warriors (Chow-Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh)who fight to recover a legendary sword is beautifully told by director Lee.  The fight scenes are well choreographed by the same choreographer who did the chops in &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  Many people would consider them exaggerated, especially the fact that the warriors fly over roofs and trees, but Peter Pau's cinematography and Tan Dun's enchanting music make those scenes so subtle, so delicate.This is an excellent DVD, and viewers may find it a good addition to their collection.  At least in mine, it's a great item.  The extras are very good.  Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Personally, The Best Movie Of 2000	2001-08-14	0	0	0

After giving up his sword to a friend of his, corruption begins. Li's lover meets Jen, the governer's daughter, who is being scheduled to be married. The two consider themselves to be sisters. That night, a ninja under the guidance of Jade Fox, steals the sword. From here, the movie takes many twist and turns. The movie is basically an action\romance film that will appeal to anyone. There is also many weapons. In one scene, the two sisters fight using everyone weapon availabe, from spears to a metal rod. Including weapons that you may never have seen before. The violence, as far as gore goes, isn't frequent, but when it comes, its very gruesome. Some were disatisfied by the &quot;Matrix&quot; stlye moves. Those moves are just graceful jumps or running (kinda like a bad stunt), but for the most part, it won't bother viewers. Plus, the movie is subtitled and not horribly dubbed.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2PU6XYXXV87KT	Magic Milkman	I dont want to sound like all those special effects psychos out there but, the effects in this film are some of the best Ive seen.  George Lucas can create all the alien actors and prestine palaces and epic landscapes that he wants, but Episode1's special effects dont hold a candle to this film.  Every effect in this film is only there out of necessity.  They arent the focus.  Chow Yun Fat's leap down the waterfall is the most perfectly executed blue screen work Ive ever seen in a movie_  the way he flies down and the way he appears out of the mist when he lands_ its breathtaking.  For this, I appreciate the flim maker's use of cgi.  Film makers need to learn that its the little things that please audiences, things like the blue screen work in Crouching Tiger, the extension of a finger nail and teeth in Blade, and the tigers of the coluseum in Gladiator.  This film should be a model for directors to follow when it comes to the use of cgi and other effects.  I understand that some films cannot do without extensive cgi.  The film maker just needs to make sure that he doesnt loose his vision in the special effects.  Bravo Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  -A	5.0	Subtle effects	2001-03-26	5	5	0

The man is a pure genius!  there are so many other aspects of this film that ang lee wanted to get across, but the cinematography  was so gorgeous and so was the soundtrack and almost every other visual  aspect of his film that the true lessons and such are sort of pushed into the background.  but the thing with ang lee is that he tries his best to incorporate some intellectual stimulation into his films as well, something that will have the viewers thinking about it hours after they've seen the film.  he creates a world that you feel you can slip into and become a part of.now for the actors.  i have been a long hard core fan of Chow Yun Fat.  what can i say, the man is a genius, the only problem is that he tends to play the same role in every movie, but that's alright because he does it sssoooooo well. the thing with asian actors who have gone and done american movies is that they are usually casted as kung fu fighting machines ( e.g. jakie chan, jet li, sammo hung, etc. ) and they....i'm sorry if it offends anyone...cannot act for crap.  chow yun fat on the other hand, is one of the best asian actors out there.  i've seen his movies and cried! he's sooo touching and he did very well in this fillm.  he should get more recognition in the states!  michelle yeoh did a great job in this movie, what can i say she absolutely phenomenol, she's been in a lot of other american movies as well so she really brought some more media attention when they were advertising this film in the states. and ziyi zang i think her name is? gosh! she was basically the star of the movie okay? she annoys you, enchants you, betrays you, and yet you still love her and pity her all the way through the film. she's just plain great! you see the strength in her, just in the power of her eyes, and yet you see her immaturity and her ignorance of the power she posesses and you feel sorry for her, and yet her actions are so rash and impetous that you wish michelle would just kill her and get it over with. in the end ziyi completely suprises us all!now some critism...the movie did loose a lot of his true beauty because of all the hype it recieved. the intellectual aspect of the movie was completely crushed and destroyed, and the flash back in the middle of the movie completely threw me off: i was like....wait a second..how did they get in the desert again?? *lol* needless to say i watched this dvd a few times in order to understand everything completely.  And if you do get this dvd, definately watch it with the english subtitles, that's how a foreign film SHOULD  be watched....and also watch the director's commentaries there are a lot of things bout the movie that you'll not notice. like foot prints in the desert that AREN'T supposed to be there but they made a mistake. those kindas cool little facts and infos.  this dvd is definately a keeper!	4.0	absoutely wonderful!	2001-07-27	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A102B8D74H64TO	"""malachix"""	I could judge this film a number of ways.  Being a huge martial arts fan, if I had judged this as a martial arts film, I would have been very disappointed.  Simply put, the fights are way over-done.  They are so exaggerated that the characters look silly and robotic and there is none of the grace and brilliance that can be found in Bruce Lee's better films.  I know seeing the characters leaping across the screen is amazing for many but I found it to be simply silly and not very engaging at all.But if Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, disappoints as a martial arts film, it brilliantly succeeds as an epic fair-tale brought to life on screen.  The whole film has a magical yet realistic quality to that is so rarely seen in films.  It's like the audience is experiencing a Chinese fable but realizing that there is far more to the story than is written in books (a good example of this is the fact that the main villain is a fat old woman).  Heros soar across the screen majestically but still feel human.  The cast perfectly exemplify this.  They feel like characters ripped from fables but given real feelings and emotions.  All the actors do wonderful jobs in their roles.It's also worth noting just how amazing the cinematography is.  In nearly every shot we see another beautiful outlook of China.  The fights while over-down are still very well-directed by Ang Lee and are dizzying and amazing at the same time.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a unique film.  As a martial arts movie it may be disappointing but as an epic fairy-tail it is un-matched.  Director Ang Lee and an strong cast successfully create a living, breathing world of which has never been seen in a film.  That alone is worth the price of admission.	5.0	Something Truely Unique	2001-06-05	2	1	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1B05INWIDZ74O	M. A. Ramos	This movie is a new concept for both the viewer from the east and west. What director Ang Lee did was to take a Chinese martial arts fantasy film and add the true dramatic component so that it would appeal to all audiences.  The sets, costumes and sound track are fantastic. The movie is set in 19th-centuary China and the clothing at the beginning of the period are of the correct period, but that soon goes out the window. Though it does not detract from the movie in any way. And the casting is nothing short of phenomenal. With the great dramatic actor Chow Yun Fat staring in his first martial arts film and Michelle Yeoh bringing her acting talents from the heart. An epic movie that is sure to stand the test of time.In this movie two warriors are faced with the duel challenge of retrieving the stolen treasured sword called the Green Destiny and dealing with their true affection for each other. The of course cannot speak of their love for one another for Yeoh's character was engaged to be married and her fianc&eacute; was slain by a woman called the Jade Fox. What we must understand that in China if your fianc&eacute;e is killed, you are considered a widow, so they would be breaking the rules of society if they acted on their love for one another.We then learn the young woman who stole the sword is the disciple of this Jade Fox, but also an aristocrat who is being forced into an arranged marriage of political convenience. We learn that Jade Fox has here own reasons for doing what she did out of bitterness. And we learn the true focus of the film is the young girl. With everything else going on, she is also in love with a desert bandit who she felt duty bound to leave. And once she marries she realizes she made a mistake, so she goes around getting into sword fights.The movie express epic romance, honor and self-respect along with the martial arts wirework we expect from Chinese martial arts films. And though all laws of physics do not apply, the fights are simply wonderfully choreographed. In this movie each warrior battles for justice, they each face their worst enemies as well as their true love. This is a film I highly recommend you watch.	5.0	Ang Lee has a Winner	2007-01-25	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AH0JMMJC7FQ01	Marc	Well, words cannot express how beautiful this film is. I wish Hollywood would make movies like this. Ang Lee thank you for bringing this magnificent piece of art to us. I felt like I was transported into a dream,and I didnt want to leave. How could the academy give it to Gladiator? I believe that this will go down as a classic. If there is anyone who hasnt had the privelege of seeing this,it has everything. But I believe it is about finding yourself in life. And it revolves around two very different love stories,one is tragic,and the other is uplifting.  There is nothing more to say,again Ang Lee,you are a true genius.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AVIV26F6YMTT8	"Marco Carnovale ""writer, photographer, advent..."	I am not a fan of wuxia films, and I believe this film could have done with much less rooftop flying and bullet deflecting. It is an excellent story in itself and it also shows a lot about a dramatic historical period in China (late XIX century). In fact, in my view one missed opportunity of this film is that it could have told us a lot more about the historical context. Also, I think the plot is overly complicated, after a while I gave up trying to follow all its nouances. Yet, it is hard to fault the director for his imprint. It does make a coherent whole and it is impressive. It is also a movie about the endless dilemmas of love and loyalty.The sound track is beautiful as well and comes out well in the BD. Too bad there are no extras, at this price one would have expected some.	4.0	mesmerizing and overwhelming	2012-12-10	2	2	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q	"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;"""	It is should be no surprise that I only just decided to view this film.  As a Johnny come lately to the world of DVD, and a rare theatergoer, my excuse is that I am simply slow on the uptake.  In addition, I am a bit of a rebel which means that I usually thing that 10 million viewers cant possible be right.  It is also difficult to have something interesting to say when you are the thousandth reviewer.Like just about everyone else, I agree that this is an exceptional film, especially in its genre as a Hong Kong fight film, but also as a piece of filmic art.  Certainly, the cinematography is immaculate.  I felt transported to a magical China.  Whether the scenes are panoramic vistas, visions of life in Chinese towns, or close settings in homes or caves, Ang Lee has spared no effort as being breathtaking and realistic.  While the story is not unique, it is well presented, and the actors quite believable.  It has several layers, the most important being the difficult role of strong women in Chinese culture.  Perhaps the least important being the retrieval of the sword Green Destiny, stolen by young Jen who desperately does not want to become a noble Chinese homemaker, although that is the source of the plot.What makes the film special in its genre is the focus on emotions and personal feelings, rather than fight scenes and bravado.  I'm going to be honest though, this is still a Hong Kong fight film, one where the players pause from the spectacular fight sequences to do some pretty professional emoting.  Good stuff, but don't fall for the hype that makes the film sound like the next Doctor Zhivago.  It is a very strong fight film with surprising depths, but it is not a dramatic masterpieceThe thing I liked least was the wirework.  It simply goes too far.  The actors dance across the rooftops like Peter Pan and Wendy, with nary a thump, bonk or rustle.  They never quite touch down and it is rare that someone actually is hit.  Even in anime, where characters float about all the time, a hit is a hit and things bend when you land on them.  It is very hard to take a fight seen seriously when the actors float about like leaves.  One the other hand, the choreography is amazing, and it is surprising that no one ever accidentally does major damage to themselves or someone else.I'm only giving the film a four simply because I disagree with critics like Joe Siegel who declared this 'One of the greatest movies ever made.'  This is hype, and distorts the real values of the film.  It demonstrated that a genre that is rarely treated seriously is capable of being much more than it has been until now.  Hopefully, this trend will continue.	4.0	Float like a Butterfly...	2003-02-12	14	11	3

Even the fighting scenes were much too long to be enjoyable. The story was so thin, that film director probably had to fill the time somehow. Besides that the whole plot is absurd.

Releasing it in theaters subtitled instead of dubbed was definitely the best choice, and the fact that it grossed over $140 million proves it. What other subtitled film can boast that? And if subtitles aren't your thing(ya illiterate bums...:P), the DVD has an English dub. Other than that, the extras are on the slim side, but who cares?

However, upon watching it, I quickly forgot that it was subtitled and viewed it as a &quot;Moving Book.&quot;  It's not perfect, but it is far from horrible.  The story is incredible and the special effects complimented the Eastern flavor of the film.  A superb mix of imagination and story telling.  A suggestion to those who have not seen this film, leave all doubts behind and accept the fact that Hollywood isn't the only place on Earth with the knowledge to put out a truly stunning work.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A18DY7WNB8JTY0	Marta Aretea	I love Crouching Tiger, it's one of my very favorite movies, but it gave me a nasty shock when the first line came out as &quot;Li is back!!&quot; not in Chinese.It got worse from there.  While the voices for Shu-lien and Li Mu Bai were alright (they were probably done by Michelle Yoah and Chow Yun-Fat, who can speak english), Shao-Long's (Jen) and Lo's and pretty much everyone else's were really bad.  It also became confusing. Jade Fox was not only referred to as 'Jade Fox' but as something in Chinese as well, an attempt at retaining bits of the original, I suppose, but a pretty pathetic one.This is a movie that deserves to be kept as close to the original as possible, not Americanized in the slightest.

I got used to them as did most people within twenty minutes, and they added an authenticity feel to the movie.  Without the sub-titles the movie would probably have been a Jackie Chan styled movie. The story of this movie is based around a young girl named Jen.  She is un-happy with her life.  She is forced to marry a man she does not love, and she runs away.  There are many sub-plots to this movie but that is the main story. This movie did an incredible job mixing Asian myth with real people.  The fighting sequences are well done and fun to watch.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A152C8GYY25HAH	Matthew Horner	Occasionally, a movie comes along that captures the hearts and imaginations of a vast number of moviegoers. Often, it seems to come out of nowhere. I say this because it is a movie that opens under the radar screen of the business types in Tinseltown. Such a film creates a 'buzz' among audiences who then discuss and debate it. This leads to more people's wanting to see it, if for no reason other than to find out what all the talk is about. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one such movie. Who would have dreamed that a Chinese martial arts film, in which the characters speak Mandarin, could take in over a hundred million dollars and be nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture?The story is perhaps more about love than it is about fighting. It takes place long ago in a time where myths. legends and magical things were created. Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien [Yun-Fat chow and Michelle Yeoh] are two warriors whose love for each either has remained unspoken. When Li Mu's ancient sword is stolen by a powerful enemy, the witch-like Jade Fox, he tells Shu Lien that it doesn't matter too much because he is no longer going to fight. Shu Lien goes to visit a powerful friend and discovers that a governor's beautiful and mysterious daughter, Jen [Ziyi Zhang], may have had a hand in the theft. Jen's father has arranged a marriage for her, but her heart secretly yearns for Lo [Chen Chang], a desert bandit who once kidnapped her and fell in love with her. The lives of these four characters intersect in some strange and quite unexpected ways.The power of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon lies in director Ang Lee's lyrical approach. The characters practice a form of martial arts in which they literally fly into the air. They run effortlessly up walls and even fight among the treetops. As choreographed by Yuen Puo-Ping, who also worked on The Matrix, the fight scenes are more flights of fancy and breathtaking dances than they are blood and guts. Filmed on location in rural China, the movie contains some spectacular scenery and glorious architecture.While I am praising the film, I must also admit that it did not blow me away like it did many audiences and critics. No movie, no matter how near perfection it is, has universal appeal. I think my problem here is that I am rarely inspired by dialog such as 'a faithful heart makes wishes come true.' Or, 'sharpness is a state of mind.' Such phrases sound good and are often true, but they are oversimplifications of complex issues and are often used to hold power over the gullible and the naive. The movie is filled with such talk, which I found tiresome after a while. Ironically, I am more impressed with Lee's English-langauge movies, especially Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm. I cannot be deny that Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a beautiful and entertaining movie. I simply do not see that it has the depth that others have claim it has.	4.0	Entertaining? Yes!

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A13F9VIDM66JVC	Matthew Lovering	CTHD was one of the finest martial arts films I have seen recently. The storyline was enthralling, the dialogue well written, and the action scenes, to put it simply, were amazing! Another credential this film boasts were the academy awards that it won. I first saw Michelle Yeoh in Tommorow Never Dies and she played a good supporting role to 007. However, she assumes a lead role in this film with Chow Yun Fat which is also expertly done. If you enjoy a mix of action and storyline, I highly recommend this film. Get the DVD.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1X5GTWDZ5RRGM	"Matthew ""suomynona"""	Even though I had seen &quot;Traffic&quot; earlier in the day at 1:30pm, I decided to go see &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; at the 9:45pm showing. The show was sold out (as all of the previous ones were before it as well.) After seeing Ang Lee's &quot;Sense And Sensibility&quot; multiple times (I own it on laserdisc and DVD), and by having heard about the romance in the film between Yun-Fat and Leoh, I knew I was in for a treat.Ang Lee did not disappoint. It's the perfect date movie. The subtitles keep you paying attention to the movie (instead of worrying about where to put your arm, etc.), the romantic, quiet chemistry between Yeoh and Yun-Fat will satisfy her, and the mesmerizing fight scenes will more than satisfy him. (Or vice versa if you hate clich&eacute;s like I do :-) It also has more than it's fair share of comedic moments in the film.I can't think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy this film. If you don't like subtitles, too bad. It's one of the best movies of the year, and deserves serious consideration for being nominated for that Oscar. I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen (even though I have a widescreen television at home) for all of the reasons mentioned above.	5.0	Romantic epic not to be missed...	2001-12-02	3	3	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1YVIZWP2YLUMJ	Matthew Thomas	Let me start out by saying that this is one of the most enchanting, enrossing, and mesmerizing films I have ever seen.  There are many levels to it, and you can honestly say you discover something new about it every time you see it.  This DVD version is wonderful, though perhaps nothing can compare to seeing it on the big screen.  The conversation with Michelle Yeoh is enlightining, and as for the making of documentry, well, it's always nice to see a bit of what went on behind the scenes.Also, I must say that, in my opinion, while the Mandarin sounds better to the ear and adds to the overall feeling of the film, I feel the English dubbing is more rich and fluid in its translation than that of the English subtitles.  If you watch the English dubbing and the English subtitles at the same time, it is shocking how different they are.  My suggestion is to give both a try at least once, and decide which you like better.One last note: while it has been advertised that the music videos for A Love Before Time would be contained on the DVD, they are, in fact, not there.  Though if you look on the back of the DVD case where it lists the special features, the music videos are not listed.  Perhaps they were slated to be included, advertised that way, and then it turned out there wasn't enough space on the disc to include them.  But be forewarned, they are not on the DVD.	5.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Music Videos	2001-06-08	2	2	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ARZQA769W3674	Max F. Exter	This, for whatever reason, is one of the most loved films of 2000.  It has two love stories, and a tale of revenge.  To top it off, there's a girl who fancies herself a great warrior, not unjustifiably so.Any one of these elements by itself would make for a good film.  However, adding them all (Plus those I have forgotten) just makes for a convoluted one.  They shove all of this information at me, and because there is so much, I don't particularly care about any of it.Perhaps a re-edit of the film would have been better.  For one thing, I hate flashbacks.  I wasn't even aware that the flashback scene in question even *was* a flashback until it ended.  The only real reason for it was to add the bandit character.  The film would have been better without him.  Don't get me wrong, he wasn't bad, but merely unnecessary.  Without him, we could have concentrated far more on the relationship between Michele Yeoh &amp; Chow Yung Fat thereby making the ending sequence far better.Now to be fair, as almost everybody has pointed out, the fight sequences were simply amazing.  From a western standpoint, anyway.  The film isn't really out of the ordinary back in China.  In fact, my understanding is that it bombed there on its first release.  The reason it was released here was for the fact that it had at least two lead actors that are known in this country.This is a run-of-the-mill asian film.  If you really want to sing the praises of one, then wait for a good one.  In the mean time, let's hope that the success of this one opens the door for some good ones.	2.0	Stupid, yet beautiful	2001-09-09	6	2	4

Well, to each his own.  I think this movie is brilliant and beautiful and stunningly well-acted.  As someone said, it's a Chinese action film for people who don't like Chinese action films.  The fight scenes are exciting and beautiful.  I agree that Jen and her lover detract from the story, because Jen is so selfish and tiresome.  But every scene between the older characters played by Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are wonderful.  The longing looks and understanding that pass between them is heartbreaking.  To read so much in someone's expression is why I love the movies.  If all you look for in a film is action, don't watch this movie.  If you like a story where real people make difficult choices for important reasons, then maybe you will enjoy it.

There are no movies like this. When I first heard Ang Lee was going to make a kung fu movie I was skeptical, but intrigued. He had never made a movie I didn't like, but they are all so sluggishly paced and focused solely on character. Possibly the polar opposite to your average chop socky film.  Nevertheless the outcome is nothing short of miraculous. After a purposely slow opening we are thrown into a spectaular fight sequence between Michelle Yeoh and a mysterious intruder. From then on the action is constantly mirrored by moving performances from Michelle, Chow Yun Fat and newcomer Ziyi Zhang.  The story is really just a simple fairy tale complicated by real emotions. The action has a grace and fluidity to it that no western film (even The Matrix) has yet achieved. I cannot recommend this film enough. The proof of its power came at the end when normally people stand and leave the second the credits appear. The cinema was almost full yet no one moved, most sat right through to the very end.

Although we all have different tastes in movies, this story is one-of-a-kind compared to all the other American-released martial arts movie.This movie was released in China prior to releasing in the US, and was not successful there.  The action fighting (&quot;flying&quot;) scenes were different in American standards, but is an everyday thing in China.  I grew up in Hong Kong, and every nightly Cantonese/Mandarin soap with a old world feel to it had a couple fighting-flying scenes in it.  It was nothing special for me to go watch this movie.  I expected something more.One of the reviews here stated that this movie is not in Chinese, it is in Mandarin.  Sorry to inform ya - MANDARIN IS CHINESE.  So is Cantonese, Shaghainese, Fukenese, etc.  Mandarin is the official dialect for China.I am glad that this movie brought a lot of Americans to see more of our Chinese culture.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A18RQ2URRGIIEA	"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan"""	Director Ang Lee created, perhaps, the most cinematically beautiful, and dramatic martial arts film ever made with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.  The film weaves a complex web of love, honor, vengeance and justice in feudal China several hundred years ago in which highly skilled, monastically-trained martial arts warriors battle for justice against thieves, robbers, highwaymen and other outlaws.  One of these warriors, the famous Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow, known also for his role as the King of Siam in &quot;Anna and the King&quot;), is the keeper and user of the prized four-century-old sword known as the Green Destiny.  Having found no one worthy enough to be his disciple, Li Mu Bai decides to retire and give the Green Destiny to an old friend, Sir Te (Sihung Lung), via his very dear female friend and trained warrior, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, also known for her role of Wai Lin in the 1997 James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;).Invited to stay as Sir Te's guest, Yu Shu Lien meets one of Sir Te's other guests: a nobleman's young daughter, Yu Jen (Ziyi Zhang), who is very interested in the lives of warriors; but is betrothed to a nobleman.  Initially unknown to Yu Shu Lien, Jen's nanny is an old foe of Li Mu Bai: Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng), who killed Li Mu Bai's master many years earlier.  Jen is a troubled young woman.  During a crossing of China's western desert, the caravan that Jen is traveling in is attacked by highwaymen.  They don't attack the women, but one of them, Lo 'Dark Cloud' (Chen Chang) steals a comb from Jen.  She chases after him, fights with him and becomes separated from the caravan.  Lo admires her fighting skills (since she has received training from Jade Fox) and is attracted to her.  A romance develops between them, but they each eventually realize that Jen must return to her family.Upon discovering that the Green Destiny is in Sir Te's house, a disguised Jen steals it and begins an odyssey of trying to live a warrior's life; but her naive view of an ideal warrior's life changes as reality catches up to her.The highly choreographed martial arts scenes in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; are compelling and emotional.  Rather than being the focus of the film, they enhance the underlying story. The aggrandized abilities of the warriors to oppose gravity increase the drama and excitement, and add a mythological element to the film.  In some ways, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is reminiscent of the 1977 classic &quot;Star Wars&quot;, but without any electronic technology.It is not surprising that &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; won four Oscars in 2001 for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Foreign Language Film and Best Music (Original Score).  The hauntingly beautiful cello played by Yo-Yo Ma in the theme music increases the emotional depth of the film.  The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Song, and Best Costume Design.  Ang Lee was nominated for Best Director.I enjoy watching this film both in its original Mandarin with English subtitles and when dubbed in English.  The English dubbing was done very well and does not detract much from the original emotion portrayed by the actors who spoke in Mandarin throughout.I highly recommend &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; to anyone that enjoys superb acting, tearful drama and gripping action mixed with mythological elements.  This is a film that can be enjoyed many times without becoming tiresome.	5.0	Cinematically Beautiful, Larger-Than-Life Epic Drama	2003-01-05	6	5	1

Obviously CROUCHING TIGER is not a spoof, but a beautifully orchestrated film, lovingly directed by Ang Lee.  Winner of four Oscars, including Best Foreign Film, the movie is an epic tale, reminiscent of greek tragedies and sweeping romantic movies.  The fight scenes are unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking.  Unfortunately, I found the movie rather dull and repetitious, and its poetic fantasia wasn't my cup of tea.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3KRGOII8BUMV9	"Michael Hsu ""Cheeto"""	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seems to be one of the most overly hyped up movies I have ever encountered.  Unfortunately that is only because the majority of people have never seen a Hong Kong Kung Fu movie in their lives.  They have never seen this style of choreography before, they are all used to Chuck Norris or Van Dam (or however you spell it).  The Chinese culture has always valued the martial arts and always glorified it in their movies.  Now the movie wasn't bad, the story was a wonderful integration of romance and action.  However two things bothered me immensly.  1) Wire control.  The fight scenes were great... until they got to flying.  The wire control in this movie was horrible, the roof chase scenes are the best example of this (as well as the bamboo forrest scene), the actors are shown flying across the roofs with almost no control at all.  You see them tripping and pumping their legs frantically trying to get a hold of a surface.  And then Michelle Yeoh even runs into a wall out of control but they quickly cut it to a scene where she's scales the wall to make up for it.  It took the excitement straight out of the movies.  2) Fight sounds... Where were they?  You hardly hear the ruffle of clothes in the wind let alone the sound of a hard hit or a solid block.  All I could hear is them breathing while they fight, we want our fight sounds! Over all I liked the movie but its not something I watch over an over again like Iron Monkey or Twin Warrior.  If you like romance, get this, if you like fight scenes get Iron Monkey or Twin Warrior or Once Upon a Time in China.	3.0	Too Much Hype	2001-03-07	63	18	45
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3QZCA4LTTVGAD	Michael J. Mazza	&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; directed by Ang Lee, is one of the most amazing films I have seen in my life. Set in feudal China, CTHD is many things: two interconnected love stories, a thrilling action film, a sweeping historical epic, a subtle fantasy, a story of female empowerment and nonconformity, a crime drama, and a philosophical and spiritual experience. Superb performances and astounding production details further elevate CTHD into the highest realm of film artistry.CTHD is sumptuous to look at: the cinematography, sets, costumes, and props (in particular, the majestic sword known as the Green Destiny) are amazing. The many martial arts scenes involve &quot;Matrix&quot;-style leaps into the fantastic, but with a more elegant, mystical touch.But enough about the amazing visual aspects of the film. This is at its heart a very moving drama, and the stars are superb. Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen are charming, and frequently fiery, as the young lovers. But it is the relationship between the older, perhaps wiser pair (played by Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat) that I found most engaging. Chow Yun Fat brings a serene dignity to his role as the spiritual warrior, and the luminous Michelle Yeoh delivers a wonderfully multilayered performance as the woman who loves him.CTHD has some sparkling comedic moments. But the film also explores such serious issues as honor, duty, and the quest for spiritual enlightenment. This is a truly great film; I have no doubt that, decades after its release, CTHD will be recognized as a classic.	5.0	An astonishing cinematic achievement	2001-06-01	11	11	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2JU4FUSW1PBEC	Michael Pappalardo	I am not a big fan of foreign films.  I skipped seeing this movie in the theatre...one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made.The effects in this movie are just mind-boggling.  Chow Yun-Fat gives an excellent performance, not to mention the rest of the cast.  The movie is a bit complex, you'll definitely have to see it more than once to understand everything.The movie does not revolve around Yun-Fat's character, yet he is a very important character in the story.  As a member of the Hudan, he is one of the greatest warriors in the world.  When he decides that his enigmatic sword, the Green Destiny, has seen enough blood, he charges an old friend with delivering it to a care-taker.  However, when the sword is stolen, and the evidence points to an old enemy whom Yun-Fat had sought for many years, he must return for one final battle.This is just one sub-plot of the entire movie.  Describing it does no justice...this movie MUST be seen to be appreciated.  A martial arts epic, a love story, a lesson of morality and the deceny of the human spirit...you'll find it all here, brilliantly brought to life through superb acting and amazing special effects.  Some may find the super-human abilities a bit unbeleivable and Matrix-like(considering that the same coordinator from the Matrix was involved, this should come as no surprise), but it simply adds to the unique and flawless perspective of this film.The movie cannot be fully appreciated if you watch it dubbed...hearing Yun-Fat speak in his native tounge simply adds to the film, not to mention dubbing is not a particularly enjoyable feature.  If you can keep up with the subtitles, which move fast at times, you will enjoy the movie alot more.Amazing effects, a great story and superb acting make this one of the best films to ever come from Asia.  Well deserving of its Academy Awards, this is yet another epic that cannot be missed!	5.0	Excellent and Absolutely Amazing work of art	2001-07-09	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3L46ZRKNFN0SG	Michael W. Howe	Up until 4 months ago, i had no idea who Ang Lee was, or the kind of film that was about to be unleashed.  All I knew was that the critics had liked it.  Having taken their word and seen &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; &amp; &quot;Billy Elliot,&quot; I saw CTHD, and the film was even better than i had expected.  Up until the viewing, everyone kept commenting on the martial arts, but what is even greater is this: the martial arts only serve as a small piece of the entire story puzzle.Our story starts with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat, very much like Obi-Wan Kenobi), and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  Both of these warriors harbor secret feelings for the other, but are in such a trivial point as to not divulge them.  Li Mu Bai has decided to give up his sword, the legendary &quot;Green Destiny.&quot;  Upon delivering it to one of Mu Bai's friends, Shu Lien meets young Jen Yu(the beautiful Zhang Ziyi).  About to be married off by her parents, the young girl tells Shu Lien of her longings to live such as the warriors she read of in books, instead of being married off to improve her parent's status.Then, over the course of several days, the &quot;Green Destiny&quot; disappears, and it is found that a rather nimble figure is causing panic throughout the courtyards.  Shu Lien confronts the stranger, in one of the first major ground battles, as they fly over walls, do twirls in midair, and engage in foot and handwork unlike anything many of us have ever seen.Eventually, we are then thrust into the story from Jen Yu's point of view, as we learn her governess is the corrupted Jade Fox, who killed Li Mu Bai's master, and has been trying to train Jen in the ways of martial arts (little does Jade Fox know of Jen's power).  We then learn of a secret romance shared by Jen and a desert bandit named Lo(Chang Chen), which seems much more free than the constrained feelings of Li Mu Bai &amp; Shu Lien.The entire style of the film is worthy of the Academy's 10 nominations.  Ang Lee gives us such impressive camerawork that we believe that this story is more fictional than real (when you first see the characters fly through the air, do not dismiss it as ridiculous.  It is simply fantasy).  China never looked so beautiful, even in the earthen colors of the landscapes.  The editing and cinematography capture the beautiful green hills as the rain sets in, as well as the vastness of the desert along China's Western Border.But what most people will be commenting on will be the sequences that were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping.  Using the tricks of dance and martial arts, these people are more graceful and skilled than anything that most people have ever seen.  The choreography is also as good as the music, with the decidedly eastern flair brought upon by Tan Dun.  Using more traditional instruments instead of synthesizers and high-pitched brass, the music helps us understand the story in some of the most vague areas of plot.This review was written a week before the Academy Awards. Hopefully, it will receive some wonderful honors towards the picture, and it can show that films do not need to be about major budgets, but can also create beauty out of image and sound, as well as pure emotion.	5.0	Great film, just STOP comparing it to The Matrix!!	2001-03-19	18	15	3

Well, actually, it's one of those movies that hovers in the mist between shallow/cheesy and deep/magnificent. Each person must decide for themselves.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A27PSZX2SE0B51	Mike Stone	"The remarkable thing about this movie is not its narrative.  Taken from a book by Du Lu Wang (which has been described in more than one place as ""pulp""), there are elements within that we've all seen before: the headstrong young girl not wanting to go through with her arranged marriage; the smoldering but never realized love between two friends; the ""you killed my master twenty years ago so now you must die"" plot device.  These are not original.  Doesn't matter.Take a look at what director Ang Lee puts on the screen.  On one hand, it's just gorgeous.  Witness the first crane-shot of Peking, the labyrinthine compound of Governor Yu, the desert, the reed forest, and the peasant village.  All are presented with wonderfully composed shots, which calls to mind haiku poetry rather than cinema.  On the other hand, it's kinetic and exhilarating.  I'm talking, of course, of the wonderful fight scenes.  Akin to ""The Matrix"", yes (same choreographer), but different in a very important way.  Whereas ""The Matrix"" was riddled with bullets and explosions, ""Crouching Tiger"" works well with its silences.  The Wudan warriors are economical in their movements, whether they are gliding on air, or wielding a sword.  Thus, the fight scenes are compact and quick, rather than flashy and fast.  And they are just astounding to watch.  My favourite pits Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) against Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) in the reed forest.  If you can suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee you'll see nothing as wondrous in the cinema this year.  The forest bends and sways as the combatants perform a samurai-like duel as if walking on tightropes.  Not to be outdone, Jen has two magnificent fights with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), one at night in the courtyard and one in Yu's training ground.  They are both balletic and engrossing.The actors here are all top notch.  Chow is strong as steel, yet manages litheness unparalleled in my memory.  There's a quiet scene near the middle of the film, where he practices Tai Chi like movements (with a warrior's edge) alone in a courtyard.  It's almost as thrilling to watch his power and grace in this scene than in his fight scenes.  Throw in his thespian eyes and you've got a real charismatic star.  Only he's not really the star, is he?  He takes a backseat in terms of screen time to the two women.  And they surely deserve it.  Yeoh is all quiet dignity, fierce intelligence, and repressed emotion.  Yet she can kick your ass six ways from Sunday if provoked properly.  Contrast this with the determination and passion that newcomer Zhang brings, and you see why Chow wasn't needed all that much.  Throw in a charismatic Chen Chang as Lo (he supplies both the love interest and comic relief), and you have a fine ensemble cast."	5.0	Quick and Beautiful	2001-05-22	8	6	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A22DF48ZHNAAF3	Mischa Nachtigal	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not your average foreign film, or for that matter your average regular film. Ang Lee conveys such an artistic and (there's no other word for it)cool film. He uses ancient mythology to narate a story not of martial arts but of art itself. The flying thorugh trees the romance and the Dialouge, though in mandarin portray why this film is truely excelent.I belived it was the best film of the year 2000 and deserved best picture. But don't take the Academy's Word on Gladiator... Gladiator is a good movie, but it's a classic hero wins, hero dies situation. Crouching Tiger is a new kind of classic, the kind that will WOW Cannes and Sundance, the kind that will make your head spin with the story and look. The wire technique is not used in a Matrix-style way, it is so much better (in my opinion) in Crouching Tiger. The way Michelle Yeoh scales the side of the wall is so profound and really takes you to this legendary world Lee has created (with help from the tales) and portrayed on film.Don't watch this movie thinking of a blockbuster, it's not (spite it's $116 Mil. or some what gross), this film is an artistic voyage that you will not regret taking. Plus the fight sequences are so sweet!!!Enjoy the film, it's all ya gotta do to have fun. Hopefully we will see more movies like this in the future, if we're lucky.

Plot is thin, probably because it would get in the way of the action scenes. The action scenes have to be appreciated for the athletic ability of the stunt performers, not for how they mesh with the story, most of which seemed to fit in like a comercial does when watching a movie on TV. I can't see, and will never understand why this movie ever got a nomination for &quot;Best Picture&quot;. The fight scenes were so long I actually fell asleep in the middle of one toward the end. When I woke up, I never bothered to reset the DVD to see how the end turned out.  The Cinematography, Lighting Design, Editing, Sound, and Sound Editing, Score were all excellent. These are the areas where most movies of this genre fall down; which is why this movie could be rated 5 stars within the confines of the category.

The special effects are good but that is it. I remember I saw similar movies when I was a kid for Bros-lee and other Karatte heroes, but these were kids movies, not ones that compete for the Oscar. The acting was very unnatural and poor. And there was this long flash-back that took about 30 minutes, in which I thought I was seeing another movie.	2.0	Should not take the oscar	2001-03-25	46	7	39
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1JCI0VDF23HS9	"""mohnjorgan"""	An excellent introduction for people to the world of subtitled martial arts film.A high budget martial arts film playing in theaters actually in Mandarian sounded amazing to me, and it actually greatly surpassed my expectations.First off, CTHD is a very good film in itself.  The look of the battles, background, and the plot aren't revolutionary in comparison to older martial arts Hong Kong cinema, but the fact that the production value was extremely high and that this film was being shown subtitled in the cinema really got me.  Add in my bias for Chow Yun-Fat (I have never seen a good film with him speaking English, this was good and it was neither English or Cantonese so I'm seeing for the first time in a good film that's not in Cantonese), and I have a very good experience seeing this movie in the theater.  I've had a terrible run of films for the past year.  Theaters have been so dry, I've been watched terrible films like Valentine, the Watcher, etc, but this film tops Hannibal as the best film I've seen in the theater for quite a while.  If you haven't seen a lot of martial arts films, I truthfully urge you to go see this in the theater quickly, if you don't enjoy it I don't like you anyway.  If you've been there done that with M.Arts movies and this movie doesn't look appealing you might want to skip it.  Regardless, I really hope the film has an extrodinary impact on American movie goers (but not too much).  If the right balance is acheived with its popularity we may be able to look forward to some high quality DVD and theatrical releases.The fact that its a theatrical subtitle release that's 100% class blows my mind.  I personally think its a epic-classic-type martial arts film with beautiful things to look at throughout the majority of the picture (beginning is sort of slow).  I really enjoyed the duration of the entire film and will definetely add it to my collection when the DVD is released.If you do not really like this film you are not my friend.	5.0	Classic, Epic, and Cool but I'd rather say 4.5 stars...	2001-03-08	14	10	4
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3QLAOOTFEHCJI	M. Oleson	"I've seen this glorious Ang Lee masterpiece numerous times but this is the first time I've watched it (Blu ray) with the English dubbed in.  Sacrilege I know, but I was curious as to how they would do this.  Very well indeed.  In addition, I learned a few things that were always confusing.  For one thing, what's with the title?  In one scene we learn that the stunning Ziyi Zhang is Hidden Dragon, so I will presume that Michelle Yeoh is Crouching Tiger.  The movie ultimately is about the two women warriors and their great love affairs...no not with each other.  Set somewhere in the late Qing Dynasty (1880""s?), Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) is part of the secretive underworld society of Jiang Hu.  The other major role is that of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) a fabled Wudang swordsman.  They have a history of unrequited love due to the fact that Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's best friend who was murdered trying to protect him.  One of my favorite fight scenes ever occurs early in the film when Shu Lien chases down Jen Yu (Zhang) who had stolen a sword belonging to Mu Bai.  The scene is not brutal, but a poetic ballet done to the tom toms of Tan Dun.  It is quite hypnotic.  Some have snickered at the tree fights but I see these as elements of fantasy, no different than many movies.  In most cases the actors actually performed these wire stunts in the trees themselves.  While the primary love story is one of halting words and longing glances, the other gets a bit more physical with Jen Yu foregoing an arranged aristocratic marriage for a relationship with a macho desert bandit.  The many fight sequences are choreographed by famed Yuen Wo-Ping who did ""The Matrix"" among other films.  Yo Yo Ma adds his cello work to one of the greatest soundtracks ever.  This remains one of my favorite films of all time.  Its elegant, graceful love story has no faults."	5.0	Elegant, graceful love story with a great soundtrack	2011-11-11	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A20YXUMT2XTP8O	Mollie	I first saw this movie with a friend, then again in coordinance with a class on the image of the hero in popular myth. The first time through, I got a kick out of the fight scenes and took pride in a woman who stood up to injustice and struck out with the familiar bitterness of a star crossed lover. But later while taking a course at a local college, I was angered at the movie's choice potrayal of feminism. Yes, the fight scenes were graceful, elaborate, and well staged, and yes, the Chinese country sure did look purdy, but it showed a totally unrealistic picture of Jen's struggle. If this particular form of martial art was so hard to manage, Jen could never have escaped a fleet of guards instilled by her father. She would never have been &quot;let go&quot; by a skilled and trained master of this art. The director could have just as easily shown Jen, years later, trapped in a marriage she never wanted, refusing to let an unwilling daughter be married off. This would keep the message intended in the plot.  I did however, love the ending and the possibility that lay waiting for the watcher. it did leave a lot to contemplate, one of the reasons I was able to leave both experiences with a love for this beatifully made film.	4.0	Vivid imagery paints a dull and unrealistic image	2001-07-14	1	0	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A25BV1ZIEWORJH	"""momteacher"""	My sons finagled me into renting this, and I was pleasantly surprised. I expected yet another mediocre martial arts film, and found instead a solid story (or rather, two interwoven) combined with ethereal photography and hauntingly beautiful music. The acting performances are solid. We saw the dubbed English version, but the dubbing was so well done that it was practically seamless -- the words matched the mouths most of the time, and the inflections were natural. All in all, this is one of the best pictures I have seen in a long while, and I consider the time (a little over two hours) well spent.	5.0	Surprisingly Good	2001-07-03	0	0	0

It's an amazing mix of action, romance, and incredibly beautiful cinematography.  This DVD has some great extras, like an interview with Michelle Yeoh, Ang Lee commentary, and a photo montage.  The widescreen presentation ensures you see this gorgeous film as it was meant to be.  There are Mandarin and English audio versions...but I STRONGLY recommended watching it in the original mandarin.

It is so well written, so well directed, so well acted, that it is hard to pick which aspect for me to start praising first.  All of the actors do a terrific job, making  this movie far from the usual martial arts popcorn fair (which is usually enjoyable as well).  The acrobatics are simply amazing and unmatched.  There's something to be said for non-computer generated special effects...there's nothing better than the real thing.  The DVD transfer is great, creating a crystal-clear picture and great sound.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1FULNZXYM28IA	"""mooshoo2000"""	The Academy's nominations were released, and Crouching Tiger was all over them! Best Picture, Foreign Picture, Cinematography...etc. The reviewers were glowing, yet people were giving it mixed reviews. I decided I would check it out for myself.I walked into the theater, unsure what I was about to see. As I sat, mezmorized by the beautiful cinematography, I realized that the story had not yet started. The colors were vivid and the story expressive. I suggest watching it in the original subtitle form, you forget that you are reading them after awhile, and you get the whole experience. As the story progressed I looked around  theater...usually there is always one group of people talking and being obnoxious, not this time. Everyone sat watching with deep intensity.The DVD is of good quality, as it was in the theaters. A chinese fairy tale of of wonderful quality. WARNING: This movie is like an hour and a half or two hour long dream sequence. If you enjoy movies where everything is practical, chances are, you won't enjoy this movie. I suggest it to everyone who is willing to take a chance with an odd kind of movie.	5.0	Abstract, yet enticing.	2001-06-10	0	0	0

Now if you were to tell me that Ziyi Zhang was not a martial artist by trade before watching this movie, I would have never believed you.  But when woo ping gets to do the action, he gets what he wants.I was very depressed to see how simple the story was.  Being a huge fan of the Ku Lung novel movies, I was expecting more going on.  The only thing that I got out of the usual kung fu story was a weak character that the great Cheng Pei Pei had to play.So the action is AWESOME but I just like more of a story than a girl who desires to be the top fighter in the martial world and some mystical sword.  I highly recommend a movie like Killer Clans or Deadly Breaking Sword over this.  I just like films where I have to think, and I got nothing from this.  It is all just presented just like it is.And the action I again have to comment on.  Most people who don't like it because  people just fly around.  Well just so you know.  In a movie like this, they put the actors on wires to show what happens when a true athlete is using one.  American movies need to learn the importance of this as I am yet to see it used properly.	3.0	a simple story, but a beautiful movie	2006-07-16	6	2	4
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2UMOGM43FSL2C	"mouseeneer ""mouseeneer"""	"As I wrote in the review for the CTHD's first release on DVD, Columia dropped the ball for not including the Chinese subtitle and omitting two music videos by CoCo Lee.Another release (this time the SuperBit version) of the same movie, Columbia still didn't do it right the second time around. As far as the video quality is concerned, I didn't see too much improvement over the original release. As the video of the original release already looked darn perfect. There is not much room for improvement even with the SuperBit processing.I thought to my self that with the new SuperBit edition, Columbia should give us the ""ultimate"" edition. Sure enough, Columbia did it again - for the second time in a row - dropped the ""BIG"" ball again.The SuperBit version only has ONE audio track by providing just the Mandarin track. Even though the Chinese subtitle is included; however, Columbia dropped the English dubbed track, still omitting the two music videos (in English and Mandarin of the title song), and also not providing the additional Cantonese track which was recorded for the movie personally by Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeah and the rest of the cast members. These additional track and music videos should not used up or occupy too much disc space anywayI would love to get the Cantonese track on this SuperBit version. Columbia should includes all three tracks (original Mandarin track, original Cantonese track - all recorded by Chow & Yeoh and the rest of the cast members, and the English dubbed version). Just let consumers pick their own favorite track. Empowers the consumers and NOT to dictate what they want to choose.(Even though I do own the Cantonese track version of this movie on an official 2-disc VCD set (UPC 4893031007898) I ordered from Hong Kong - put out by Columbia Tristar's Hong Kong arm. It includes both the Cantonese and the Mandarin tracks but no English dubbed version). (Note: VCD is a format widely recognized in Asia but one that has made few inroads into America.)The bottom line is that the SuperBit version is too limiting - only one Mandarin track and seven subtitles (English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese and Thai). I still give the movie a 5-star rating, but the SuperBit features only a 2-star rating."	5.0	Columbia Dropped the Ball, Again	2001-11-21	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2TSNKXQGBMVAQ	Moven	I knew critics were saying good things about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, yet I made sure not to read any reviews so I could get the most out of the movie. Though I was expecting just to see a satisfying movie, I had no idea what was about to come. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I was spellbound with the grace that the action sequences in this movie possessed. I gasped with joy when witnessing the freedom the characters in the movie had that empowered them to leap effortlessly from rooftop to rooftop. The director uses these sequences to demonstrate the awesome powers its characters have. The action in this movie left me paralyzed enough that I could have watched it a few more times just like that, but then I got something else that was completely unexpected. In my opinion, the love stories in this movie sinks the Titanic with one blow. The unspoken love between the two main characters has touched my heart deeply. Another love between the two younger characters was a delightful addition as well. The story is something to be appreciated also. The plot sets the stage for its sequences perfectly, consisting of a master who wishes to train the thief of his legendary sword to wield its power through discipline understanding, and there are a few turns and detours which keep the action rolling. This movie has all of the moves. The story is brilliant, the acting is flawless, the action sequences are breath taking, and the love story is pure and original. You would be a fool not to at least watch this movie. My heart nearly exploded at a dozen different scences in this movie. At times... the movie is almost to much to grasp, too much to handle. This is an epic. This is a movie that will stand out in my mind forever. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a masterpiece.	5.0	One of the greatest film experiences of my life	2001-05-31	37	33	4

The kung fu is incredible and as a martial artist myself I can tell you that aside from the flying its all legit. If this movie had any downfalls it would be the grainy camera work or the crappy lip sinking (or subtitles depending on your viewing experience) but I'm a Bruce Lee fan so that couldn't bother me.	5.0	Best kung fu movie ever.	2013-04-06	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2Z9FXHC1L66EW	"Mr. ""alan5973"""	I just purchased this DVD yesterday and had never seen it before.  But from all the great reviews I was sure it would be tremendous, and it is...depending on how you view it.  I popped it in and was goaded into watching the English Dubbed version.  I must say, I was greatly disappointed.  Just the way certain people talked in English really gave it the wrong impression.  Some fight scenes, particularly the first fight against Jade Fox came off somewhat comedic.  By the end I was shaking my head.  I felt that Jen (Zhang Ziyi) was just a spoiled brat who wanted to do everything her way, with no respect for others.  But right after the film ended and everyone else had left, I watched the film again, this time in Mandarin, with English Subtitles.  I was blown away, to say the least.  It was like a whole new different experience.  Sequences made more sense and this time Jen did not come across as a spoiled brat but more of a lost soul, torn inside and yet full of life and wanting to take on the whole world.  But the scenes I enjoyed the most were the ones between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  When he talks about always wanting to touch her but never having the courage to, it really put things in perspective.  Even great warriors are not always that smart when dealing with matters of the heart.  Truly a masterpiece, and yes the fight scenes are amazing.  I know the idea of sitting down and reading subtitles through an entire movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, but to truly appreciate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon it must be done, otherwise you may never truly understand its meaning, and that would be a great loss all its own.	5.0	Watch In Mandarin w/ English Subtitles For True Appreciation	2001-06-10	6	5	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2ZVERVFM25MJT	"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283"""	There's no other word to describe this film other than beautiful.  Despite that sounded clich&eacute;d, it's very true were 'Crouching Tiger' is concerned.  Ang Lee revolutinises the martial arts film by making it accessible to a much wider audience.  He does this through making the plot similar to that of a thousand films these days - the feminist standpoint, love through the social classes etc.  Conventional this may be, but it's entirely absorbing and you will find yourself mesmerised by the entire spectacle of it.  The tale of love never fufilled is gorgeously played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who proves that she's much more than a Bond girl).  Also impressive is the stunning photography of empty deserts, solitary mountains and lush forests.  Obviously stand-out though are the fight scenes, which are choreogrpahed by the same guy as in 'The Matrix', and it shows.  Especially impressive are the fight scenes between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh and the fight in the treetops.  Yet what is most memorable about this is the fact that it is, quite simply, cinema at its very best.  It goes all out and it delivers in style.	4.0	Stunningly Beautiful	2001-11-21	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1AMZIJRY4YF8H	Mr B T Thacker	It's not the wire-fu, or the Eastern influence, or anything like that. It's that those movie-goers who aren't familiar with the genre were completely blown away by the epic sweep and polish of the film.CTHD is perhaps a fine definition of the term 'epic'. Count 'em: two love stories, both somewhat forbidden, several huge landscapes, characters with dignity, poise, and adult motivations, and enough eye-popping fight scenes to shake a Green Destiny at. For me, at least, it's the kind of film that leaves you staggering out of the cinema, with your faith in the direction of modern film-making at least somewhat revived. In an era of cheesy TV series remakes, pointless big-bidget action sequels and formulaic big-name romantic comedies, there are at least some films which can feel fresh, young, and honest.And for those complaining about subtitles or flying powers: please don't bother. If films were only about real life, no-one would watch them. Suspension of disbelief is why we watch James Bond, Captain Kirk, and Ellen Ripley.

It just shows that Hollywood still doesn't appreciate fine acting, and chooses to nominate hacks like Julia Roberts.Anyway, the DVD could use some more extras on it. There is a nice interview with Yeoh and a good single overview of the making of the film, but I would have liked to have seen more about how the story was conceived, other than what we learn in the overview.

I went to great lengths to reserve a copy at my local video store so I could bring it home and watch it at home on my home cinema.What fool in his right mind would really be amazed by flying monkeys and a down right boring and uninteresting plot.While some of the fight scenes seemed to have been inspired by the currently in vogue film Matrix, it does lend itself to becoming a self-parody of immense proportions.The scenes with characters flying in tree-tops and onto rooftops made me feel extremely uncomfortable when I saw it. It's just so ridiculously unbelievable.If it were made as a fantasy film in the tradition of the X-Men or Star Wars I could have accepted it.This movie failed to impress me at all.

After the 20th time they flew, I felt it really took away from the martial arts technique.  Personally, I'll take Enter the Dragon as the best martial arts film ever made.  As a drama, the movie is good, but the story does begin to drag in a few places.  Clearly, this is a well made, entertaining film... but a candidate for best movie of the year at the academy awards?

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A231CS8KULQLJ4	Myth	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based on a 70-year old novel set in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. Legendary warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) has decided to entrust his sword Green Destiny to a nobleman with the help of fellow warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) so he can turn his back on a life of war. But the sword is stolen from the nobleman's home by a cunning and skilled female thief who seems to have a connection with Jade Fox, an assasin responsible for the death of Li Mu Bai's Wudan mentor. At the time of the theft, the nobleman had the governor and his family as guests. The governor's daughter, Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), is a privileged young beauty who longs to live a life of adventure and be with Lo (Chang Chen), a bandit who initially ambushed her desert caravan but later became her lover. Through Green Destiny, these major characters' paths collide and lead to a haunting conclusion.By focusing on its formidable female characters, Crouching Tiger showcases some of the most exciting fighting scenes ever filmed (for more on the origins of this genre, check out Wuxia). However, this is a movie that does not sacrifice substance for style. It is a delicate balance of yin and yang: epic but intimate, exhilarating but soft around the edges. It focuses on the timeless theme of good versus evil, of loyalty versus betrayal, of honor versus deceit. It celebrates both the thrill of passionate love (between Jen and Lo, the Crouching Tigers) and the grandiosity of a pure long suffering one (between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, the Hidden Dragons).Conventional superlatives are not sufficient to describe this movie. It is just achingly exquisite on many levels. Director Ang Lee masterfully conducts this lyrical symphony: from Yuen Wo Ping's martial arts choreography to Peter Pau's cinematography to Tan Dun's musical score (accented by the haunting cello solos of Yo Yo Ma) to the remarkable performances of its actors, Crouching Tiger is a surreal experience that will leave you breathless.	5.0	A lyrical symphony	2001-09-05	6	4	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2Q6U28QEMHHCK	"Nara L. Watson ""Shadoxcat"""	I am a big kung-fu movie fan. However I also like weird beautiful movies like City of Lost Children.  Most kung-fu movies (with the exception of the Once upon a Time in China series and a few others) are kind of well... cinematographically challenged? But scrap that thought for THIS one!  this movie has GORGEOUS cinematography, beautiful sets and costume designs (a wide variety too!) not to mention kick-butt action sequences AND a captivating story to boot!  This movie is what I call dream-fuel.. the imagery stays in your head and gets recycled in your best dreams.The story is mostly romance.. but not in a bad way fellows! because you still have the awesome fight scenes.Its the story of a master martial artist who gets tired of fighting and tries to resign, handing is his magical jade sword to a friend for safe-keeping.  (This friend being the love interest.. well, SHEs in love anyways, we dont know about HIM)  unfortunatly the sword gets stolen, the master goes after the theif who turns out to be a young woman with great skill and even more potential, this interests the master and he starts chasing her because he wants to teach her.  Unfortunatly this girl is rather confused.. wavering between the brainwashing she received since childhood to hate the master  or the hunger to learn more. in the end theres a showdown and choices of life and death are made and I shan't say anymore.  watch it :)	5.0	action AND beauty.. it dont get much better than this!	2003-02-13	3	2	1

Chandran ""vpcnk"""	"""one of the best movies ever made""?you better believe it!i'm as strong a movie buff you can find. i normally watch anywhere between 15 to 20 movies a month - hollywood to foreign. and CTHD is easily one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. this movie has so much depth in it that you simply cannot comprehend its depth over a single viewing. you've to see it multiple times. there're so many things to understand and appreciate here. ang lee's labour of love for sure.i first saw this movie in london in the year 2001. the first time i clearly enjoyed it but didnt perceive any special greatness. but over the last 4 years i've seen it atleast 15 to 20 times and with each viewing the exquisite details in this work of art have slowly unfolded.the greatness in this movie doesnt merely lie in its remarkable photography of such beautiful locales or the brilliantly choreographed action sequences or stirring music (all of which are fantastic in themselves) - but in the emotional depth that lee is able to mine out of the characters.the story is about a rich albeit troubled girl who is secretly tutored in martial arts by an outlaw called jade fox who's posing as a nurse/tutor. jade fox has multiple people on her trail each seeking to avenge several murders by the former. one of these people is li mu bai (chow yun fat) considered the greatest swordsman alive (in that time and space) whose martial arts master was murdered by jade fox. fox decamps with a secret manual and takes up the position of the nurse of the rich young girl jen and secretly tutors her in the martial arts. growing up jen being highly talented soon outstrips her teacher in fighting skills though hides her talent from her teacher so as to not offend/hurt her feelings.jen's father is a governor and in her travels with him she meets and falls in love with a desert bandit, but still leaves him and returns home to her parents.li mu bai tired of fighting gives his famed sword the green destiny to yu (michelle yeoh) who inturn is supposed to give it to an old friend for safe keeping. but jen sees the beauty and power of sword and steals it one night.thus li mu bai enters the scene and slowly all the characters are brought together into the play.the greatness of the movie lies in subtlety of the expression of emotional depth between all the actors - the despair of jen against the tradition which she considers stifling, her unattainable love, the forbidden love between yu and li, the troubled teacher-student relationship between jen and jade fox and between jen and li, rivalries and jealousy between jen and yu - the emotional intricacies are mined to their full potential in all these relationships.two of the scenes which struck me are :1. when jen goes after the bandit (soon to be lover) who has stolen her comb and her unexplainable frustration and angst in her relationship with him is suddenly ended when he puts his hand into her pants! (remakable scene - believe me)!2. when jen fights li mu bai (who wants to teach and guide her) there's a scene when he tells her that she's undisciplined and should first learn to hold the sword in stillness and suddenly slashes his sword staggering her, saying that expertise should come without effort! typical zen (in contrast to the undignified foolery of yoda in the climax fight against count dooku in the attack of the clones)!remarkable movie this. with this movie, you need the eyes and mind to appreciate its greatness!"	5.0	film making as art	2005-09-26	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3P1GDMIXJ4E5S	Ned Coker	I went into the movie not really knowing what to expect, other than it was going to be up for a bunch of awards.  I came out with a whole new respect for Asian cinema.  Not only was the scenery spectacular and well shot, but the costumes were well done too.  But, by far the most important and fetching parts of the movie are the action scenes and the character development.  All three main characters have surpassed the kung-fu genre and put Bruce Lee to shame with the help of a few special effects.  While this movie kicks ass, it also survives well WITHOUT the action.  Ang Lee touches on many basic human emotions through the characters, who have depth despite their robot like precision with martial arts.  The DVD is well made, with neat seques in menues.  This film deserved best movie far and above the poorly acted (with the exception of Russel Crowe) and written Gladiator.	5.0	Best epic action ever.	2001-07-03	0	0	0

For the life of me, I cannot find any meaning or contiguous story at all. There are some great visuals if you are into wire stunts and ""tree-hopping,"" but nothing to write home about.Aside from the lack of plot and over-hyped stunts/visuals, the movie also lacks the classic ""Kung-Fu"" vibe that old martial arts movies have. That would at least make this film watch-able but alas, the audience is not that lucky. This film tries to be high-brow and deliver a meaningful bundle of left-field stunts and vague symbolism that intends to appeal to the cinematic connoisseurs among us. I don't paint myself a professional critic but I have a decent taste in artful movies and this still doesn't add up.Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this unless you want to gaze at it through a monocle and sip brandy all while pretending to understand the pedantic crock of a story this film fails at delivering."	1.0	Crouching Tiger Hidden Plot...	2013-05-06	12	2	10

I was actually quite surprised to find I liked it. The production was very good and the English dubbing was well done (enough so that you don't have the classic asian movie mouth moving while no speaking). Some of the martial arts things were over the top, though.This movie is an adventure wrapped inside of two love stories. Each love story takes a different ending at the end. One that was definitely engineered to make people sad. The other was tough luck. :-)This movie is enjoyable for both guys and gals. Enough action and character development to keep everyone watching.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AM0G4IO57D2Z4	"""ninetwob"""	This film was quite famous in the world this year even it obtained several prizes at the Academy Awards. However, it was particularly unnoticed in Asia countries. What is the reason of this? The reason is this film was not a fresh film for Asia people. They have already seen many films like this style. It was just a well-made one. However, it attracted public attention and people acknowledged it as a splendid film especially in the Western countries. Furthermore, it won a prize for foreign language film at the Academy Awards. Director Ang Lee who came from Taiwan made it, but Columbia Pictures presented it, which is America Company. Therefore, an American film is why it can receive a prize at the Oscar.The title of this film means the name of characters; there are four main characters in this film. Among these, two young man and woman&iexcl;s name are tiger and dragon. These names are very common in Asia countries, especially in China and Korea. Two men and two women, they classify into young and old. It has many meanings. First of all, the best warrior, Li Mu Bai and a woman who loves him. They love each other, but they do not appear above the surface their love. On the contrary, young man and woman, Dragon and Tiger, they do love passionately. Therefore, they do not care about anything for their love. Li Mu Bai, he does not like to be proud of his military arts and actually, he wants to retire in the public. The sword is no meaning for him any more. However, Tiger, she likes to be boast of her skills and want to be the best warrior. Therefore, she wants to beat Li Mu Bai. She does not care about anything just for the best.Four main characters describe this film as they contrast each other. Frankly speaking, I have seen this pattern from the films, which made by director, Kar-wai Wong. For example, &iexcl;Ashes of Time (1994)&iexcl;, &iexcl;Chungking Express (1995)&iexcl; and &iexcl;Fallen Angels (1997)&iexcl;, like these films, they have a same pattern. Four main characters, two men and two women, they are all related to each other. I do not know exactly what Ang Lee thinks about it and why he creates four people. Nevertheless, it looks like similar style compare with Kar-wai Wong&iexcl;s works.In addition, gorgeous martial art scenes, especially the scene whichLi Mu Bai chases Tiger in the bamboo forest, and standing on the bamboo tree. This is the best part of this film. In fact, it had been shown at the films of director, King Hu who was the most famous director like these kinds of film. In his film, &iexcl;A Touch of Zen (1969)&iexcl;, there is a bamboo scene like this film. Anyway, this film was good for description each character and beautiful scenes of landscape in China. The most impression scene was a last scene; Tiger jump into the cloud on the cliff. It was like a freeman who throws away every bonds of human. Finally, she found a freedom.	4.0	What a wonderful martial art scene !	2002-03-14	3	3	0

I wasn't disappointed.  I liked the menu sequence and the ease of switching from subtitles to dubbed soundtrack (they did a good job with matching the English dialogue to the actors' mouth, not at all like the stereotypical &quot;kung-fu&quot; b-movie dubbing).  The sound and picture clarity of the DVD was exceptional.  There is a decent selection of additional features, including a commentary by Ang Lee (I haven't listened to it yet but am looking forward to it).  Too many DVDs of great movies are a disappointment, poorly transfered  sound or picture, useless added features, or badly packaged.  This one was good across the board.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AK5YTG74EW6PI	"""nonsense-fiend"""	I really like this film now that I've had a chance to watch it a few times. On the first viewing, I just didn't get it. It bored me, and I felt that I was missing something that the Oscar judges hadn't. I mean, like many reviewers have rightly observed, people simply can't fly; wiry women, no matter how tough, can't throw bails of hay ten feet into the air, and if someone stands at the top of a bamboo tree--well, you get the picture. Then I heard Tarantino talking about his homage to the martial arts genre, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. He said something like, &quot;This movie isn't set on planet earth&quot;. I must say that when I heard this, I had a bit of an epiphany. I'd been looking at these films all wrong. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is not supposed to be watched as an action film--it's a fantasy! Accept that, and it's easy to understand why this genre is so popular. The only adventurous twist that Ang Lee brings to the film is the pallet that he uses. This movie positively glows, betraying the massive budget that brought it so easily to a mainstream audience.We're moving into a new era of cult movies, not surprisingly being led for the most part by people like Tarantino. What we've been crying out for is a codex. If only Kill Bill had been around the first time I watched CTHD, I may well have been an instant fan, but instead, all I had as a precedent was that rather less subtle venture, &quot;The Matrix&quot;.You see, I reckon people were stunted rather than informed by what the Wachowskis put on the table back in '99. We were thrilled by what we thought was a new way of making films, but now I for one see that in fact, the film and it's sucessors dumbed down what was originally a beautiful and subtle form of cinema (even taking into account all the flying malarky). The tone, once you've tuned into it, is far more like &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; than &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, especially when accompanied by an orchestral score (Yoyo Ma displays some beautiful cello playing) that sounds very similar--surely intentionally--to Moriconi's music for &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot;.What most of the bad reviews of this film have to offer is, &quot;Go see The Matrix if you want a REAL action movie&quot;. Again, these guys think they're going to see a different kind of film than what they actually end up paying for. Pity.Buy this DVD if you want to see a splendidly over-the-top fantasy, beautifully layered and exquisitly choreographed. If you want an action film for which you definately shan't need a codex (or a fully functioning brain), then by all means, buy &quot;Die-Hard&quot;!	4.0	stunning...	2003-11-29	3	1	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3H2SEAOYTGKFE	Norm Caffrey	Let me start by saying that mere words will not do this movie justice. It must be seen to be appreciated. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is quite simply a masterpiece. As such, you(as the viewer)are sown into the very fabric of the main characters one thread at a time. This story is far more than the classic battle of good vs evil, more importantly it is about the battle fought between duty and desire within ourselves.Many of the scenes are visually stunning, accompanied by a moving musical score that blends perfectly. The fighting sequences are spectacular, with the finest choreography ever done, yet it is never excessive. Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien, Chow Yun Fat as Li Mui Bai, and newcomer Zhang Ziyi as Jen are all brilliantly cast. Young Jen will simply steal your heart.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon transports us to a time and place where honor, duty, compassion, wisdom and selflessness are the ideals that our heros, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mui Bai live by. In fact, they are so endearing that we want to possess them as well. Virtually every human emotion comes into play here, with performances so effortlessly portrayed that you feel as the main characters feel.Think of this movie as a wonderful fantasy. As such, you will witness supernatural abilities beyond the realm of mere mortals. (and it will help you to come to an understanding with the main characters ability to defy gravity.)I believe that subtitles add immensly to Crouching Tiger, HiddenDragon. Reading them engages you more deeply into the story. My advice to someone not used to subtitles is to read them quickly. This way you won't get frustrated. After a short time, you will hardly notice them.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is no ordinary movie, it is an experience which comes around only a few times in ones lifetime. If you have not yet seen it and it is available on the big screen where you live, run...don't walk to this incredible work of art. Like the wind, it will be gone before you know it.	5.0	MUST BE SEEN TO BE APPRECIATED	2001-03-29	25	21	4

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z	Octavius	"The only thing distinguishing this film from your average ""D"" quality Hong Kong kung-fu film is the state-of-the-art cinemtography and slightly above average directing. Apart from that, the screenplay is whimsical, the acting dull and shallow, and the script is inundated with those generic Confucian/Dao proverbs already overused in the 70's Kung-Fu series with David Caradine.Yes, Chinese kung-fu cinema often has the characters floating in the air or doing other motions that defy the limitations of physics: this reflects their notion of how the channeling of chi through mental and physical concentration can overcome natural laws. Although I'm not disturbed with such reality gaps in film, I don't see why it would be worthy of an Oscar or the amount of praise it received. The screenplay presents a story that is just as absurd as the one for Rambo II where Rambo bravely defeats an entire entire North Vietnamese regiment using just a knife. Rambo II wasn't Oscar material and wouldn't have been Oscar material even if it had a better script, an added love story and enhanced cinematography: Why? Because the story line is generic and unimaginative. The same goes for Crouching Tiger: the story is essentially no different than every other generic kung-fu film coming out of Hong Kong. This is not to say that there aren't any good films coming out of China but, kung-fu films are essentially the Chinese equivalent of our Shwarzenneger or Stallone films. Have either of the latter actors or their action films won Oscars? No. So why should Crouching Tiger: just because it's foreign?Check out 'Red Firecraker, Green Firecracker', 'Farewell My Concubine', and/or 'Raise The Red Lantern' for good Chinese drama; not this overhyped and revamped generic kung-fu fiasco."	3.0	Crouching Oscar, Hidden Failure	2004-07-29	9	4	5

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2WZ1B92F81LJJ	"Olly Buxton ""@electricray"""	This is a terrific film, combining the once-again-fashionable grandiloquent, epic sweep, stunning choreography (never before have fight sequences so resembled classical dance) and most remarkably, a stiffly extended middle finger to conventional blockbuster wisdom. Martial Arts movies typically obey pretty rigid conventions - they're not especially challenging on the cognitive functions and they're macho, violent and action-obsessed to the exclusion of all else (in particular characterisation and plot).So in putting together this piece Ang Lee got his box-office smash the hard way: Not only did he film in Mandarin (which might explain to the perceptive reviewer below why they &quot;couldn't get the lips to sync right&quot;), but he has as the two lead protagonists and fighting extraordinaires, women. And while there's action to do you Tuesday next week, for all the sword play, there's not a great deal of *violence* (the swordfighting is more like ballet than combat), and the voguish brutal realism is replaced by surreal, liquid movement and total disregard for gravity.Theme-wise, for once there really is something happening - a subtext of struggle against social convention, no small irony given the revolution against cinematic convention which the film represents. There are two love stories, but for the most part they're airily sketched - having said that, the climatic scene, involving one pair of star cross'd lovers, has all the weight of Shakespearian tragedy.If anything is underdone it's the exposition on the bad guys; It's not clear (in the dubbed version, at any rate) what Jade Fox has done, nor why she's gone over to the dark side, nor why the Diplomat's daughter should be siding with her (other than on account of a wild streak). To my mind Jade Fox could have been left out of the film altogether - it would have required minimal re-writing and perhaps closed off a number of side plots (such as that concerning the police chief) which were not properly developed in the end anyway.While it's not perfect, it's a landmark film, for if it achieves nothing else it provides an ideal compromise at the video store when *she* wants the English Patient and *he* wants Die Hard II.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3D926XQ9UAAHT	OpenMind	I truly understand that everyone has a different taste. But some of the negative reviews given to this film are simply ridiculous.I find it very revolting that people across the world can take their time to understand and appreciate Western culture, and subsequently enjoy our films. But, some of us, on the other hand, could be so ignorant. Making a comparison between Hidden Tiger and Indiana Jones, or Peter Pan is simply absurd. While Western culture is generally more outspoken and straightforward, old Eastern culture is generally more reserved and very subtle and delicate. That is the reason why even fighting can be so beautiful that it's a form of arts.  That kind of explains the final scene too. In the old days, Chinese often oppressed their feelings and any breach of cultural norms was deemed a major problem... what more being rebellious.Some find the flying scenes to be ridiculous. Hello~ this is not supposed to be a non-fiction film. In many Chinese martial arts novels, people can do many other extraodinary stunts.I'm very glad that US has been such a developed country as it is right now.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3J1BRVN7GXC1E	Optimistix	I would've given this movie 4.5 stars, were that possible - it is excellent on several counts, but the feeling that i had at the end of it all was one of dissatisfaction - basically, it builds up expectations, but then lets you down towards the very end.Also the middle portion of the movie tends to drag a bit ....First, the many pluses -(1)Direction : Of the highest order, for the most part.Ang lee  has done a near-perfect job of most of the movie, but for the minor flaws pointed out below.It is only fair to say he's created a 'near-masterpiece'.Not to forget the fact that he's delivered the biggest ever blockbuster from China, no mean feat in itself.(2)Performances : Outstanding - All the main characters have excelled themselves.Chow Yun Fat has essayed the role a great Wu-dan master with a quiet dignity, making his presence felt effectively without resorting to any theatrics.Ditto Michelle Yeoh - both have played mature, 'evolved' , heroic figures. All their talent &amp; experience is on display here, but sadly underutilized, in my opinion.The surprise packet of the movie is Zhang Ziyi, who plays a challenging part with panache.Her prowess at martial arts belies her frail appearance and even overshadows her emoting.And she's quite an eyeful, too :-)(3)Cinematography : Excellent.The film is chockfull of breathtaking visuals, and a delight to behold, frame after frame.(4)Special Effects : Literally so.The master craftsmen responsible for the stunning sequences in 'The Matrix' are at it again, coming up with dizzying action, though some of it does require a 'suspension of disbelief' in order to be digested.(5)Music : Good - blends perfectly with the flow of the narrative.Wow, i'm really raving about the movie, right ? Then why only four stars ? This is why - after really raising your expectations with all these pluses (not to mention all those glittering reviews, nominations and awards that already had you expecting the moon before you even sat down to watch it ), the movie lets you down on at least two fronts :(1)Characterisation : Zhang Ziyi's character, which gets the maximum footage by far, is not really developed properly.There are no plausible reasons for the extreme angst so clearly experienced by her character, making some of her acts seem almost mindless.The viewer is left guessing as to what possibly could her motives be for several of her decisions/acts ....... also the character of the desert robber who becomes her lover seems both irrelevant &amp; poorly etched.(2)Continuity : The middle portion, which concentrates on the affair between Ziyi &amp; the robber, is way too long with respect to its contribution to the story.Not only does this disrupt the flow of the narrative and make the movie too lengthy, it also takes us away from the other two chief protagonists for far too long.It would've been far better to develop the roles of Chow Yun Fat &amp; Michelle Yeoh more fully, and perhaps explore their complex relationship.(3)Ending : While i don't want to give it away, it did leave me feeling unsated.All in all, definitely worth a watch, but do keep your expectations within realistic levels :-)	4.0	Very good, but ..........	2001-07-20	3	2	1

Watch it with a sound system (there is particular scene that needs to be played a bit loud to appreciate the intensity it adds to the said scene).

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2TASWIAKMPAE9	Paper Man	"This movie was easily the best of the 2001, with superb special effects, good (if not Oscar-worthy) acting, solid directing and scenery that is varied and gorgeous.The story concerns a master warrior, Li Mu Bai, who wishes to retire from fighting, but must embark on a final quest when his legendary sword, The Green Destiny, is stolen. His quest is undertaken with the aid of the love of his life, Yu Shu Lien who is an accomplished warrior as well, who was married to his brother, and so the two cannot consummate their love. The movie has two parallel love stories, the second concerning Jen, a noblewoman, and a young bandit; both stories end tragically.The plot and romance seem blase, and though they are somewhat ordinary, they are told with suprising skill, drawing the audience in. But the power of this movie lies in the superb action scenes, which are not simply fun for the average action fan, but for people who enjoy well-choreographed, balletic, almost-poetic duels, even one with some humor injected in. All of the major stars are very graceful and the digital removal of wires and harnesses, leaves the audience with seamless scenes.Some reviewers claim the fight scenes in ""The Matrix"" were superior, but I would call to your attention the dojo scene with Neo and Morpheus. Their range of motion does not match those found here, and one can tell the stars are not trained in martial arts. For me, at least, it detracts from the movie--with the mindset that they should have the fullest range of motion, it is disappointing to watch them painfully stretch to exectute low kicks (I can personally kick higher and have had no training in the martial arts).Highly recommended."	5.0	Robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture...	2002-02-18	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A14966F0OZRUZ	Pasha Supreme	"What else needs to be said about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? It is the most amazing action film in years. It is the single most imaginative piece of fiction to come to the moving going audience in a quite a ling time.But what about the DVD? Well sadly it is the most dismal piece of work to come from Sony DVD center this year. Sony was on a streak of superb discs recently but this hack job put an end to that.The DVD was clearly rushed to market. The transfer is not very clean at all. The MPEG2 artifacts are terrible. Those of us who are fortunate to have a widescreen TV are going to be the most unfortunate this time. The Native widescreen presentation is oh so dismal of an experience! The colors are clean but the pixel jaggies does enough damage to distract the viewer.The Audio tracks are not at all well managed. There is no reason what so ever to waste valuable data bandwidth to do a Dolby pro-logic track. I love the fact that the disc comes with both Mandarin &amp; English 5.1 Dolby Digital but the bass is so weak. The audio was not at all enhanced. The commentary track is nothing new, it's above average.The Extras are well... lacking, the making of documentary is pure PR fluff sadly, and the trailers are not even the original ones that Sony was using to advertise the film. The photomontage is mediocre at best.So why all these complaints? Sony has a masterpiece on their hands and it's pretty clear they did not give it the proper treatment. In a market place where we will have ""Patch Adams: Ultimate Edition"", and Bring it on: Super Special Extra Spectacular Widescreen Edition, one would assume the big guys at Sony will release a DVD of monumental standards of their big film of 2000. But NO!So what they miss? First of all the Video was mediocre and should be redone. The Audio needs a lot of work; they should be enhanced to take advantage of all the speakers. A DTS track is perfect for this film I would say. How about a Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat &amp; Ang Lee commentary track? Most of all a Score Only track would be prudent since the film won best score at the academy awards. I am sure there are deleted scenes they could have put on the disc. How about some real making of docs, discussing the stunt work, the novels, or even the production in a larger scale. There are a wealth of pictures on this film, why not include them in user control slide shows? What happened to the music videos?Sony rushed this disc to the market to capitalize on the films fame. The product is average at best. This film deserves a superior DVD job. Come on Sony, stop giving us special editions of Center Stage and give us a true Collector's Special Edition of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon! (Like Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on River Kwai, Men In Black, and so on... Hint Hint! )"	3.0	5 Star Film! 3 Star DVD! Sony Rushed this one!	2001-06-11	74	67	7
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AL2K5GSTRUIY	Path To Wisdom	"Two stars. Don't be too harsh. If you watched halfway into the movie and didn't leave, it deserves 50 out of 100 points or 2 and a half stars. The movie is not worth $10 US dollars. It should be worth $3.I give one star for scenery. A second star for the final fight scene between the ladies. A half star for the funny scene (yes there were two) when all the injured fighters complaint to the two protagonist regarding the young lady dragon.  The 2nd funny scene: the ladies were fighting at the end, and the older lady chose a monk's stick and dropped it because it was too heavy for her to swing it.There were many problems with this movie. Some of which other critics here mentioned. 1. Wires were obviously used in special effects, and 90% of the ""flying"" and ""running"" were not good. I have seen better. 2. Unsettled relationship between the daughter of the murdered policeman and the guard, and the protagonists. 3. Suicide at end needs explanation. The girl just jumped. No explanation.  4. The young dragon was in love with Yun-Fat Chow(protagonist), was that obvious to everyone? 5. Missing conflict between lady dragon and tiger (the old lady who died at the end) 6. The scene at the top of the tree was not good. Yun-Fat Chow is testing the leg strength of young lady dragon. But it looks like he has trouble himself balancing on the tree. Is it leaning against something for support? 7. In the fight scene between the ladies at the end, a thick bar was able to withstand the sword's strength for a while, but finally cut in half like all the other weapons. There was no explanation as to what that was made of. That traditional weapon, if any still exist, should be made of gold. A type called purple gold."	2.0	Could be better	2001-07-09	7	0	7

That said it had a great director. Ang Lee, not sondberg was the years best director. he has a true eye for detail that saves the film. and lets not forget perhaps the greatest fight scenes ever put to film. amazing to see. overall the movie aint perfect but is pretty cool and entertaining.	4.0	Flawed but amazing.	2001-04-11	15	5	10

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AWPFDWFKYYIF4	Paul H. Rich	I sat through the entire show in the movie theater, but only did so because I was there with others. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. There is no real character development, the plot is entirely predictable and cliche', the action sequences are either funny or just plain boring. The special effects weren't cool, just dorky - it would have been no worse by having the actors flying through the air by the &quot;invisible ropes&quot; of years ago. Kids might like this, though I've seen almost every Disney film made and this was far less entertaining than anything Disney has released in the last ten years. I can only imagine that folks that like martial arts and kooky special effects will find this movie entertaining. I could find nothing of redeeming value here.	1.0	This movie stinks	2001-11-30	19	5	14

It's sort of a tribute to a style of film-making that's a staple in Hong Kong...so maybe that's lost on some people here?  I think it's a delight to watch!  I prefer the Mandarin audio with subtitles, but DO watch it at least once with the English dub audio...you'll be surprised at some of the differences in the dialogue, (and I've been told by an aquaintance that speaks fluent Mandarin that the English dub is actually a more accurate translation than the subtitles...hmmmm..)  I just like the sound of the Mandarin.  If you don't have any appreciation for this style of fantastic, over-the-top martial arts film, don't buy this; you probably won't like it.

CTHD is a beautiful, epic film that takes its time in reaching each different climax within the film.This is a rare film in which I can actually understand why 'the critics' felt it was an iportant film.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1XVQ30CUQC7BI	Peter Lin	Having read a lot of reviews about CTHD, a lot of people miss the whole point. Many love the movie and find it breath taking, but I can't help feel sad some are missing the message. In chinese culture, flying around, supernatural martial arts and walking on bamboo is an integral part of the culture. In the same way comics permeate American culture, martial arts touches every part of dailey life. The deeper message of personal vs social, good vs evil, and order vs chaos are universal conflicts. Although the names, powers and costumes are different, the conflicts are the same. I love the movie and find it paints a delicate portrait of what it means to be an individual in chinese culture. Individualism is always tempered by society, but the manifestation depends on the location. A lot of reviews criticize the movie's long dialogs on taoism, but it would be like a movie about jesus christ that never mentions christianity. Within the dialog is the subtext of repressed emotions and hidden desires. Many people find it pointless and stupid because American culture believes in individual expression. The poetry of the dialog is aparent to those who know the language. Translating chinese poetry is nearly impossible, even though some of the greatest American writers spend their entire lives striving to achieve it. The structure and syntax of chinese language is completely different. Things like conjugation, past perfect, present perfect and past perfect do not exist in chinese. CTHD provides a glimpse into chinese culture better than any other movie to date.	5.0	A master piece and view of Chinese culture	2001-07-31	4	2	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3R7X0U0TGWOOB	Peter Sherrill	I felt sorta bad about giving this movie only four stars, because they movie itself is so awesome.  The fighting is lightning quick, the weapons and costume detail amazing, and the actors do very well. The story line is pretty cool too, this girl(a governors daughter) wants to become a warrior, and she steals this special sword, The Green Destiny, and with it she is an almost unbeatable fighter.  These two other people, one of whom the Green Destiny really belongs to, go after the girl, in hopes of getting the sword back and possibly even taking the renegade girl as a student.  There is also romance, though it is rather unlikely in the case of the governors daughter.. a bandit in the desert takes her comb, so she runs off to try and get it, and while fighting for her comb they, out of nowhere, just start kissing eachother and then they fall in love.  Its really just a pretty much basic story.  The movie was done very well, though with some rather cheesy parts in it.  I got the dubbed version just due to the fact that I didnt feel like reading the subtitles, but that was a mistake.  The dubbing is moderately well done, but in some parts it doesn't work well at all. For example, the resturant scene, where the girl is talking the whole time while fighting.  It worked very well in Mandarin, but with the dubbed voices it didnt look at all like she was speaking it, and that really sorta ruined the scene.  But, like i said, other than the disappointment with the voice-over this was a really cool action/lovestory movie, and I would reccomend it to most everyone.	4.0	Awesome movie, but dubbing could use work.	2001-06-22	1	0	1

If you want to get a grasp on how ineffective the educational system is in the United States, just read some of the reviews posted about this film. It's fine to not like a movie, but to dislike it because A) it's in Japanese!?!?!; B) the subtitles go by too fast!; or C) it's boring, are ludicrous at best.First, it's in Chinese (Duh). Secondly, if you can read beyond a second grade level, the subtitles will be fine for you (not to mention the fact that a dubbed version, though not great, is available). And thirdly, it's boring? You have GOT to be kidding. Of course, that would be the opinion of kids weaned on what Hollywood pumps down their throats these days. There aren't any car chases and massive explosions or blood and gore, so it MUST be boring.Look, I don't mean to be elitist here. This movie is certainly not for everyone. I think it's a masterpiece in nearly every way and deservedly won Oscars in many categories and should have won Best Picture. If you are capable of understanding that this is set in a culture far different than ours here in the States and your patience is not severly tested by actually having to pay attention to what's going on, you'll like this film. Don't go in expecting &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot; (a good film in its own right) because you will be disappointed. And if you want to write a negative review, please do.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A13DQTXG02HZC1	Ping Lim	For those of us who were brought up in South East Asian countries, watching martial arts movies &amp; mini series were daily occurrences.  Now, living permanently in a Western country, I tended to feel nostalgic about those good old days.  When I saw the poster of this movie in a local cinema weeks ago, my heart missed a beat, &amp; watching this movie was my resolution for Boxing Day.  The movie didn't disappoint with a great storyline, good production team &amp; a great cast.  This movie superseded all those martial arts classics by far with its breath taking scenes (both real &amp; computer graphics illustrations of the historic Beijing, &amp; Xinjiang).  Furthermore, the Director provided the characters with depths, &amp; the display of martial arts is almost as good as what Jet Li did to the movie, the &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; almost 20 years ago.  Throughout the whole movie, I hang on to every words &amp; mesmerised by every scenes.  It was such a marvellous movie &amp; definitely worth waiting for.  High recommended. The title of the movie, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is actually a Chinese proverb.  To put it simply, it meant things are not what they seem to be from the outset.  This movie was about a seasoned &amp; honourable swordsman from WuTang (depicted brilliantly by Chow Yuen Fatt) who decided to give away his precious sword to his friend.  Chow Yuen Fatt's character was almost to the point of enlightenment in his pursuance of his swordsmanship but there's this thing that held him back.  This thing came in the form of his female friend &amp; fellow associate of Wutang, played magnificently by Michelle Yeoh.  Chow &amp; Yeoh's characters have been in luv for many years but due to lack of courage of Chow's part &amp; due to Yeoh's understanding of a woman's position during that time (she couldn't forsake her engagement with Chow's brother in oath who had since deceased during a fight), the luv wasn't realised.  Chow believed that by giving up his prized sword &amp; by not pursuing his swordsmanship any further, he could lead the life of an ordinary person realising what he meant to do years ago, to be with Yeoh. When Yeoh's character delivered the sword to Chow's friend (she happened to own a security company of that time), she bumped into the daughter of a local Governor (played by Zhang ZiYi).  She was about to be married to another high official's son soon enough.  Yeoh &amp; her became friends soon after.  During that time, Yeoh explained to the Governor's daughter why Chow's sword was highly sought after.  On that faithful nite, the sword was stolen.  Naturally, Yeoh put her suspicion upon the Governor's daughter.  But on that nite too, an undercover cop discovered that a wanted criminal by the name of Flying Fox was also there on the scene of the crime.  The last time the cop saw her was at the edge of the Governor's house.  So, would the burglar be the Flying Fox or the Governor's daughter, &amp; why should the Governor's daughter had such high capability in martial arts when her upbringing was supposed to be embroidery &amp; calligraphy, was there a correlation between her &amp; the Flying Fox, etc.  Viewers also had to see for themselves how Chow, Yeoh, Governor's daughter's lives all interwined with one another.  Who and what is the 4th main character in the movie &amp; would there be a everybody lived happily ever after ending or else?  My only request is that there would be a sequel should it be appropriate.	4.0	Exceptional masterpiece	2000-12-25	8	4	4
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1OOQ94LR59IZE	"""pizzadeliveryguy"""	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a truly fascinating film.  It stands above other kung-fu films which its dramatic story, and stands above other dramas with its amazing wushu sequences.  So where does it belong?  You decide.Li Mu Bai, played by the incredible Chow Yun Fat, is a Wudan swordsman and warrior.  After years of fighting, he simply desires to leave his violent past behind and achieve enlightenment.  He is, however, held back by his magical sword, the Green Destiny, a 400 year old blade that harbor remarkable power (and some cool sound effects).  In an attempt to free himself from bloodshed, he asks his companion and fellow fighter Shu Lien, played by the gracefully beautiful Michelle Yeoh, to give the Green Destiny to an old friend when she journeys to Peking.  But when the sword is stolen by the mysterious Jen, daughter of a governer and played by striking and lovely Zhang Ziyi, revenge, honor and love collide, along with a few kicks and blades.Ang Lee masterfully directs this fairy tale based on a book with the same title.  Though the story is overdone and often overly dramatic in places, it is simply amazing.  In an interview, Ang Lee stated that he did not care if it was cheesy or cliched...This was the film he wanted to make.The film is photographed by Peter Pau, whose previous work includes The Killer, and is simply beautiful.  the landscapes are breathtaking, and the architecture is magnificent.  the wushu sequences are choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, famous for his fight design in The Matrix, Fist of Legend and Tai Chi Master.  His ballet-like fights are superb, and stand out even among his other work.  The music and drums of Tan Dun and Yo-Yo Ma fit the film perfectly, and add much to the inspiring visuals. All of the actors give outstanding performances, and even their martial arts techniques are correct and look top-notch (a feat since neither Zhang Ziyi or Chow Yun Fat are martial artists like Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh).The film is not perfect.  As stated before, the story can be slightly ridiculous at times, and the subtitle translations are not always right on target (though they are far better than the dubbed track, which sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom).  The entire desert chapter is almost sleep-inducingly boring.  But as a whole, these are minor dents in its mighty armor.Whether you watch it for the dramatic love, amazing fights or simply as a work of cinema, CTHD is a masterpiece.  Sure, there are better kung-fu movies out there.  Sure, there are better love stories.  And there are better adventures.  But this film is unique.  Enjoy it.	5.0	"""Quiet your mind and you will see all"""	2001-07-11	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is director Ang Lee's tribute to the Kung Fu movies of the 60's and 70's.  While those movies were high on action, low on plotlines, Mr. Lee combines both into a visually stunning, intricately woven, action packed film.  The story takes place in the 19th century and revolves around a sword called &quot;The Green Destiny&quot;.  Chow Yun-Fat plays Li Mu Bai, the greatest of all warriors who was in possession of the sword and then gives it to a friend as he has found enlightenment and no longer wishes to fight.  The sword is delivered by his longtime friend Yu Shu Lien played by Michelle Yeoh.  While at their friend's house, the sword is stolen by mysterious figure who turns out to be the innocent looking aristocratic daughter of a governor, Jen played by the exquisite Zhang Ziyi.  In the first fight scene, a disguised Jen and Yu Shu Lien fly across rooftops and engage in battle.  This scene is among the most breathtaking and beautifully choreographed fight scenes in movie history.  In fact the scene is more ballet than kung fu. Li Mo Bai is forced to return to battle for The Green Destiny.  In a fight scene with Jen, he realizes she is no ordinary warrior, but one with special abilities.  He wants her to become his student, but she refuses.  Another fight scene that takes place on the tops of bamboo trees is equal to the roof top scene.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the best combination of action and drama to be released in a long time and the fighting scenes are not there for gratuity, but serve a purpose.  Mr. Lee did a brilliant job with this film and hopefully he will try to make another in this genre.	5.0	Tiger Roars	2001-06-18	4	4	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AIRHRV3D8X4J1	"Porfie Medina ""Porfie Jr. Medina"""	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a TRUE WORK OF ART. I rented this DVD last night and at first I was skeptical because I have never cared much for martial arts movies, but due to the buzz and and my own yearning to see it I did and man was I surprised. This movie is AMAZING the landscapes are beautiful and the fight scenes are just down right the BEST choreagraphed I have ever seen on screen. I like how the main characters come across as these spiritual yet very smart and respected people who respect the power that the sword gives it's user. The cast MICHELLE YEOH and YUN-FAT CHOW give this movie a quality that no martial arts movie has ever had, TRULY GREAT ACTING! I loved the way the characters would seem to amaze me as they jumped and glided through the air. The movie is based upon this amazing sword that is stolen by someone in the village. After Michelle Yeoh's character almost catches the culprit, the theif soon gets away with the sword and gives the them a run for there money when fighting in battle as she was taught a gifted form of martial arts by one of the greats in China. The movie does have a sad ending that i will not give away but I will say it is flying high! Check this movie out it is so AWESOME! I will be buying this DVD soon!

'better than starwars'.since the day i saw it, everytime i think about it, i get this feeling in my stomach. i dont know whether thats because i think zhang zi yi is fine or the movie just has that effect on people, or just me.  to finish, this movie is breath-taking. breath-taking enough it could kill you.	5.0	wow!!	2001-02-24	30	21	9
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A48UD92FQJCXZ	Priscilla	When &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; first hit theatres in Asia in the summer of 2000, audiences were beyond pleased - because for the first time, what could be considered a kung-fu film included within itself a moving story. This film manages to be so philosophically deep that it subconsciously stirs emotion and feeling within the audience - without ever being corny. Not to mention that this is probably the best film ever that features the geography of China. Shots were absolutely stunning. Music was also beautiful, with one of the best cello performances given by Yo-Yo-Ma, and a smash hit song by Coco Lee - &quot;A Love Before Time.&quot;The film consists of various types of relationships - everything from forced-hidden love, children to parents, and disciple to a kung-fu master. Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen, and Zhang Zi-Yi together made the best acting performances seen for years.Cinematography was impressing. Each shot was meticulously perfected - exactly why &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; took two years for world-famous director, Ang Lee, to shoot. One shot of the rooftops for the film's previews itself took five months. The original version is much better than the dubbed, so take the time to read subtitles - it can't be that hard.Get ready for flying kicks, tears, and beauty.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A337FAEETGA4HE	Publius	People watching this movie for its martial arts scenes will be disappointed by how few fight sequences their are in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but the execution of those sequences along with the acting, story, and cinematography make this a film worth remembering.I've known quite a few people who thought this movie was boring.  I must say, I simply don't understand how they could think so, but what I've noticed about the people who don't like this film is that they simply don't enjoy dramatic cinema.  Instead, they prefer genres that depend less on a sense of character or characterization than on action and simpler, more explicit storylines.  People who are not accustomed to nor enjoy movies that make them think about larger issues will simply not see the point of many of the scenes in Crouching Tiger.	4.0	Really a Great Film, This is Primarily a Drama, not Action	2005-05-04	2	1	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3SP37JLGH5KFY	punkviper	The whole martial arts fantasy film genre has been done to death, but when presented with one done as painstakingly well done as this, it is completely forgivable.  Chow Yun Fat is, was, and will always be &quot;the man.&quot;  Normally his film roles are limited to the gun-toting, cool as ice, one-man-gang, crusader for justice against evil (see The Killer, or A Better Tomorrow for his best work).  When I saw that he, of all stars, would be playing a fantasy role, I was surprised.  But CYF has something that many actors (of any nationality) do not have: charisma.  The guy could play ANY role and make it compelling.  It's just a shame we don't see more of him in this film.But, the gals are what makes this film go 'round, and one viewing of the fight scenes contained herein will show you what staggering talent Michelle Yeoh and Co. have.  Whether it is the night-fighting scenes, the cafe battle, or the excellent weapons display at the training house, even the novice should see the dedication to craft and sheer amazing athleticism of these females.  And it wouldn't be so impressive if they weren't such first-rate actors.  Every line is delivered with a poise and elegance that surpasses most award-winning Westerners.I enjoyed this movie immensely, and appreciated the loving care that you could tell went into every stitch and every shot.  The only reason I docked 1 star was for the wealth of fantasy martial arts titles that have provided the framework for films like these to be a success (Ang Lee has stated that this film is an homage of sorts to those that have come before it.)  If you find your interest piqued by this film, may I also recommend Once Upon A Time In China (Jet Li), Iron Monkey (Donnie Yen), Fong Sai Yuk (Jet Li), and Drunken Master II (Jackie Chan).None are as romantically deep as this one, nor as high-budgeted, but the stories and action are second-to-none.p.s. I am also highly pleased that an American audience has warmed to a film such as this.  Perhaps we, as a culture, have more taste and intellect than I previously imagined.	4.0	Better for a beginner, but still exceedingly worthy	2001-01-27	18	9	9
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AWIGZU34011ML	R. A. Bosch	Everyone must have seen it at least once by now, so what else is there to say. Maybe that the only downside to the DVD is that for some reason it starts playing using the dubbed version, whereas I think the only way to fully enjoy it is in the original language and with subtitles. Apart from that I was very happy to have bought the DVD. When it was playing in the theatres I didn't go to see because I assumed I wouldn't like it becasue I don't like these martial arts films. Although I still have some reservations about these flying skills of the characters, it is a beautiful film. The only thing I can add is that you should definitely see Ju Dou and Raise The Red Lantern. They are much slower and without action scenes, but the cinematography is at least as beautiful as in this film.	4.0	what more can you say about this	2001-06-21	0	0	0

The cinematography is good.Whether you grew up in the days of &quot;loving-those-karate-flicks&quot; or not, you'll appreciate the agility and acrobatic nature of the martial arts scenes, and you'll love the subtle overtones throughout the movie, the director gives you credit for being able to understand (unlike some movies that feel as though they've gotta spell it all out for 'ya).It's outstanding!

Her passion for fighting and adventure almost consume her. Her forbidden love with Lo holds everything she wants in life, yet by custom she must follow the path her parents set for her and resigns herself to their wishes and an arranged marriage.She then meets Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who is in love with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat). Yu Shu Lien and Jen (Zhang) alternate between being friends and enemies, but hold a deep respect for one another. Their sword fighting scenes are incredible. The sheer power they seem to possess as women would be astonishing in real life. This is of course fantasy and the flying scenes never for a minute seem out of place once you put them in a fairy tale perspective.Subtle tensions burn slowly in the characters causing them at times to burst into flames as the action awakens to new heights. The canyon cave with a hot tub warmed with heated rocks and horse riding in the dessert add such romantic appeal.When Yu Shu Lien says: ""To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger."" Li Mu Bai replies: ""You're right. But I don't know what to do."" They seem to have no restrictions in life, yet their hearts are chained. Not even the Green Destiny sword can cut through these chains wrapped around their hearts. Throughout the story, the sword makes its appearance and empowers the fight scenes.What I loved about this movie was that women can be strong yet feminine. They can reach for the stars and still enjoy the pleasures of love.For those who have always dreamed of flying through a forest or bathing in a hot tub heated with rocks from a fire nearby. Let your imagination travel to a different time and place. Become a character and you will never forget this movie. Some of the lines are filled with deep emotion and spiritual beauty.Only those who see beauty in the hearts of others will see the true meanings. If you have always received everything you wanted in life, this movie will hold little meaning for you.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1J2931UBBJPXM	Reviewer	"The legends and myths surrounding the martial arts are extended and brought dazzlingly to fruition in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" a sumptuous production directed by Ang Lee.  When legendary warrior Li Mu Bai's (Chow Yun-Fat) meditations take him to a place beyond anything he's ever experienced, a place of darkness and sorrow, he decides to give up the life that has sustained him for so long.  As a prelude to his new life he gives his sword, ""Green Destiny,"" to long-time friend and patron, Sir Te (Lung Sihung).  But when the sword is stolen and aspersions are cast upon the house of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), who (with his family and entourage) is a guest of Sir Te's, Li Mu Bai goes into action to reclaim his sword and elicit justice for the House of Yu.  To effect his goal he allies himself with the woman for whom he has long carried unrequited love in his heart, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who-- like Bai-- is a warrior.  At the same time, he reaffirms his vow to avenge the death of his master, who was killed by a renegade named Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei), who remains at large.  Ang Lee has created a visually stunning, lyrical, poetic film that is engaging on a number of levels:  The brilliant choreography  (by Woo-Ping Yuen), especially in the sword fighting scenes, is absolutely mesmerizing, as is the ability of the characters to defy gravity and literally soar up the sides of walls, across rooftops and into the tops of trees; there are sequences in this film that will literally take your breath away.  And then there's the story itself, which is nothing less than a meditation on life and the quest for that often elusive butterfly of inner peace and the resolution and acceptance of one's own destiny.  Blended seamlessly together by Lee, it becomes an artistic triumph of the silver screen that is truly magical; the sheer poetic nature of the film is unforgettable, the images of which will remain in your mind's eye forever.  The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat is perfectly cast as Li Mu Bai; there is a subtle, introspective quality he brings to the character that is sublime in it's sensitivity-- that of a  man of strength and integrity, worthy of the legendary status accorded him as a warrior, and the respect bestowed upon him as a man of principle.  It's an honest portrayal that rings of truth, which Yun-Fat conveys so succinctly and credibly.  Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as well, exhibiting adroit physical abilities in the action sequences, while also demonstrating her gift as a dramatic actress.  Most importantly, she makes Shu Lien real, and there is a definite chemistry between her and Chow Yun-Fat that brings the story even more vividly to life.  But the most exciting discovery of the film is the young Zhang Ziyi, who is absolutely magnificent in the role of Jen Yu, the Governor's daughter.  It's an extraordinary performance, energetic and charming, and Ziyi has a screen presence that is riveting and commanding of attention.  She has a tremendous physical dexterity, and her martial arts engagements with Yeoh and Yun-Fat are melodious and utterly captivating, as is her skill with a sword.  The supporting cast includes Chang Chen (Lo), Gao Xian (Bo), Hai Yan (Madame Yu), Wang Deming (Tsai) and Li Li (May).  Through the combined efforts of Lee's direction, the exemplary performances of his actors and the expertise of a number of technicians, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a film of ethereal magnitude that transports the audience to another time and another place.  Rarely has the screen been graced with with a film of such grace and beauty, and seeing it is a truly memorable experience.  One of the best movies of the year, it is not to missed."	5.0	Ang Lee Delivers One Of The Year's Best	2001-01-29	14	11	3

By the time I left thbe theatre, I was honestly overwelmed with so many different thoughts.  The fact that the film was in a different language was irrelevant, and because of it I cannot watch the film in english.  The DVD version allows for a rather annoying dubbing of english launguage.  Put the Subtitles on, and watch the natural film.  This truly is going to become an epic in years to come.  Chow Yun Fat shows his best performance on screen so far (comparing to &quot;The Replacement killers&quot; and &quot;Anna and the King&quot;) and of course Michele Yeoh adds a strong support role.  Althguh the DVD doesnt give much in way of added features, some of the screen shots just remind you of amazong parts of the film.  This is a MUST BUY.	5.0	What more can you say about this film?	2001-11-06	1	1	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2ONQ1AFSEOCQO	Richard W. Kirkendall	A combination of impressive fight scenes, a not-that-original story, and a lot of really long, really boring periods.  When I see a movie, I want to be entertained, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not entertained to learn about the intracacies of the personal battle that Chow Yun Fat's character is having, or the rest of them.  And another thing, that fight in the trees?  Pfffff... with all the capabilities they obviously had for action in this movie, why would you waste it on a piece of tripe like that?  This movie would have been much more successful as a movie if it was about an hour shorter and, therefore, 2 times faster.  If you're looking for a &quot;work of art,&quot; plenty of &quot;artistic&quot; buzzwords have been attached to this one.  However, if you're looking to be entertained at the movies, I would recommend any number of martial arts movies that don't slow you down with lame character development attempts or the facade that this one exhibits that it's something more than the action.  Big Trouble in Little China comes to mind.	3.0	One word- Overrated	2001-10-11	3	0	3

Crouching Tigar Hidden Dragon is a brilliant mix of action, fantasy, martial arts and magic all mixed up in a colourful bowl of perfectly design music. Its a film you have to see more than once as so much goes on, the dvd is something not to be missed, slow motion options, so you can see how good they REALLY are and features that look set to take you deeper into this world of treetop battles.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1IPW0I8HOHGH2	R. Maynard	The Far East storytellers finally meet the Far West in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It is one of the most refreshing films I've seen in a long time.  At last, Eastern Culture reveals their swashbuckling romantic side, in a film that portrays the plausible impossible.  It's comforting to know that, worldwide, we share the same dream.It's a tale of love, with the thread taking a trail similar to King Arthur's Knights in Shining Armor.  It has its evil villain, oriental style, and the Impossibly Beautiful Princess, who is miserably betrothed to some old-coot throne dweller, whom she doesn't love.  Now comes the hero, whom she truly does love.  He, of course, a handsome but poor peasant, culturally doomed --- forbidden to even think of marrying her.Swords are destined to clash in a plot like this --- and clash they do --- but with one huge difference: the swordspeople are not your men in shining armor: they are women!  This is truly cool.  When men clang swords, I see grimness in their eyes.  When the women of this film clang swords, I see fire in their eyes.  Nice touch.The direction, cast and filmography are great.  The very talented actor, Chow Yun Fat, will be a familiar face to most viewers and thank goodness, we need him.  He provides a steadying influence when we come upon the Impossibly Beautiful Princess, Zhan Zi Yi, a dazzling young actress, wielding her heart-stealing repertoire of skills.This film is a gigantic leap from the sad grayness that's been so often depicted in earlier works from the Far East.  Try this film; if you're a hopeless romantic like me, you'll love it.Hellooo, Hollywood: You have some serious competition.	5.0	Great film!  A surprise, and truly entertaining.	2001-06-16	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1T1VE5EELYOAQ	R M Rimmer	"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the film based on the novel by Wang Dulu in traditional Mandarin focuses on master warriors, the legendary Li Mubai, played by Chow Yun-fat, and his beloved, Michelle Yeoh's (the best) stunning portrayal of Yui Hsuilien, deriving their skills from the Wudang order, on self-mastery and actualization, and about the poisoning of those ideals from a scheming governess Jade Fox, the actress Cheng PeiPei, to a young, very gifted and beautiful May Wong a wayward half-pint, on the spectacular newcomer Zhang Zi Yi. What is her story anyway? The girl must learn to become an independent, responsible woman while maintaining traditional values unfurling a deadly Western-like contradiction, unraveling before her.The drama centers on the mystical &quot;Green Destiny&quot;, a 400 year old sword and traditional heirloom of the monastary which Li Mubai gives to his confident, Yui Hsuilien for delivery as a gift to a respected Beijing leader Sir Te, in nineteenth century, China. The sword as if the spirit of past warriors infused it seemingly takes on a life of its own adding power infinitely, the wizards possessing it.Upon arriving in Beijing, Yui Hsuilien meets the young, impressionable beauty, May Wong Jen, the aristocratic daughter of the powerful Governor Yu. She's fascinated about the apparent free life of a martial arts super warrior, adding more to her objections about the arranged marriage to come. She later in the film recounts in finding brief but unlikely love and the direction seamlessly takes us to another journey in X'ianj'iang.Someone steals &quot;Green Destiny&quot; that night, the climax then begins....All blame the deadly and frightening female witch, &quot;Jade Fox&quot; forstealing the Sword at the compound, who had also poisoned Li Mubai's Master Teacher of the Wudang monastary, significantly weakening her opponents, she once believed.The two schools fatally weave together and the plot burns to boil in the ultimate though complicated clash between the enchantment of experience and the seduction of evil.A million leaves fall  none the same,  different times, different ways  one turning slowly among clouds  a dot on an infinite plane.  Brief tears fall,  tomorrow, a different story made,  cycle never broken,  promises always eternal.I can say that the spectacular backdrop of Central and Southern Mainland China and the Gobi Desert of X'ianj'iang in the West, gives a fine taste on the work. The length and the depth of fine acting complements Wang Dulu's novel of art and textural composition. Ang Lee's direction adds a fascinating mix of Western ""superhero"" motifs well within Asian traditions, a much needed breathtaking, though tragically, relieving welcome.With 10 nominations, the winner of four Academy Awards and two Golden Globes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the best foreign language film of the year, including best cinematography, and best director, Ang Lee.[...]"	5.0	A Visual Masterpiece:  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	2001-04-08	34	28	6

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO	Robert Badgley	Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon(released July/00),stars,among others Chow Yun-Fat as Li Mu Bai,Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien,Zhang Ziyi as Jiao Long,Chang Chen as Luo Xiaohu,Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox and Sihung Lung as Sir Te.This is the English dubbed version of the film that won four Academy Awards in 2001,and deservedly so.It is a highly artistic,stylized fantasy film and a visual feast,with gorgeous cinematography and intricate choreography.It runs the gamut of emotions throughout from pathos to humour and back again.I thought this year,being director Ang Lee's year once more,with Life of Pi and its bevy of awards,this would be a good time to revisit one of his classic films.The story finds Yun-Fat as a warrior who has been trying to avenge his masters death for the past 10 years,and has failed to find the culprit.He wants to turn in his famed Green Dragon sword to his friend in Beijing,Sir Te,and start to concentrate on that that he has neglected for far too long;his love for Yeoh.It is a love that has for the most part been an unspoken one.But now and throughout the film,the two start to work together and reconnect.For once the sword is in Beijing it gets taken by a local thief.While Fat makes his way on his own to Beijing to visit his friend who was given the sword,his lady love Yeoh tries,in the meantime,to get the sword back.She in fact has brief skirmishes with the thief which is traced back to the Governor's mansion.She tries to walk a fine line to get the sword back without disgracing the house of the Governor.One night a policeman and his daughter who have tracked the thief finally confront her.However she has help.We learn the thief is the Governor's daughter and her aide is the thief's governess who is also the killer of Fat's master 10 years before,called the Jade Fox.As the fight starts going the way of the thief and the Jade Fox,Fat arrives to upset the balance,and sends them both running.In the night a Mongol arrives in the thief's bedroom and they embrace.A back story unrolls where we see that these two have a passionate history which she has tried to forget being a woman of position.She asks him to leave and  he does.The next day during the wedding procession the Mongol interrupts things and asks that she come away with him.Fat intercedes and squirrels him away in a far off monastery,until the time is right.The following day the thief leaves her husband and takes the sword.She is confronted by Yeoh and both have an intense fight,but she does not relinquish the sword.Fat again intercedes and pursues her to the top of a bamboo forest.Fat wins the day and throws the sword into the bottom of a waterfall.She pursues it and if it wasn't for the Jade Fox,would have died trying to get it.The Fox takes her to a cave and drugs her.She prepares poisonous darts then hides from those who will inevitably come for her.Yeoh,then Fat show up.Fat tries to detoxify the girl,then the Fox attacks.The Fox ultimately gets hers but she also has pierced the neck of Fat with a deadly dart.There is but one antidote and the girl knows how to prepare it.As she goes away to make it,Yeoh holds the dying Fat in her arms.All the lost chances and the suppressed feelings come out in her,and Fat dies professing his love for Yeoh.When the girl comes back,realizing she is too late,Yeoh tells her to go to the monastery to find her love.She makes it,spends a passionate night with him then next day throws herself off the top of the mountain.All I can add to my opening comments is the solid acting throughout.The story of the never realized passion between Fat and Yeoh,coupled with the same theme between the thief and the Mongol,amazing.Scenes such as the fight sequence among the bamboo trees or people gliding over roof tops,simply take ones breath away.There is one thing I have always found endearing in Chinese cinema and that is the inclusion of humour.Rarely,no matter how serious a film may be,there seems to be always some type of humour injected somewhere.It is the yin and yang,the serious and the humourous;ancient Chinese philosophy.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1.There are some scenes with some graininess but generally it is clear and crisp.A good remastering would take care of this.Extras include a featurette,an interview,the trailers and commentary.This is the English dubbed version.While good I do prefer the Chinese version,with subtitles.In fact I usually do prefer to hear the original versions as a rule.All in all a simply beautiful movie from start to finish.Director Ang Lee cleaned up at the OSCARS in 2001 with this entry as he did this year with Life of Pi.The film was obviously directed by a superb craftsman.Highly recommended.	5.0	Highly stylistic Chinese fantasy!	2013-03-01	2	2	0

Worse yet, I think the very reason the film had so little effect on me is the exact reason most of those who loved it so did--  the choreography. The fight scenes were so impossibly over-the-top that the film lost anything that could be considered realism after the first ten minutes. Even the worst Jackie  Chan movie retains at least a modicum of realism (note I do realize while saying this that that's because Jackie Chan does his own stunts, and if we didn't all know that,  etc.).Were it possible to divorce the surrounding film from the fight scenes therein, you'd still have a pretty flat  movie. The plot takes a few amusing twists now and again, but the script is written with a jaundiced eye towards the ""You! Killed! My! Brother! Now!... I must!... kill you!"" dialogue parodied so many times by so many films, and it never gives a hint that it's not taking itself seriously.If you thought The Matrix would have been a far superior film without the special effects, you really want to avoid  this.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3921YZ1LBONU8	Robert Matei	This movie sure takes some getting used to. First off, it's &quot;foreign-language&quot; - I'm not American but the only thing around are American movies. Then it is set in such a faraway world - ancient China, quite hard to relate to. Just as an example, it will be hard for average Westerners to tell whether it takes place 200 or 2000 years ago.The movie itself is an aesthetic treat. The costumes are rich. The decors are superb - though a little overdone in color and sheer richness (I'm sure ancient China didn't look that... Chinese), they greatly contribute to the atmosphere. So does the music.Many people talked about the matrial arts, and that is the least debatable thing in the movie. The fights are breathtaking, and there is an incredible realism in them. I think this is a huge feat: making such impossible movements seem perfectly natural. You'll enderstand when you see the characters glide across rooftops and up walls. For me, the culminating scene was the treetop fight, perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes, surely the most amazing fight sequence I have ever seen.Now to the human part. I think the relationship between Li Mu Bai and the other fighter (sorry, their names are so hard to remember...) is quite well developped. The romantic part is not very believable, buit nonetheless enjoyable.This movie is an exercise in poetry on film. It's an ode to art, beauty, culture and love. So don't expect a movie that will tell you a conventional story. It's not like it doesn't have a plot, but it's not a story as you would get from average Hollywood. If you take it as that, you will be disoriented by the lack of anything anchored in reality. This is more like a beautiful, colorful dream. Go into it knowing that, and you won't regret it.	4.0	Irresistibly poetic, though somewhat pretetious	2001-03-26	15	4	11

But ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East... Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrifice...Ang Lee was an astute choice as director... The location shooting was on the Chinese mainland and the actors came from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as China... Instead of the Shaolin school of martial arts favored by Bruce Lee, Ang Lee opted for the more spiritual form of Wudan; brute force is replace by scenes of balletic grace as opponents climb up walls or flit through tree-tops...The widespread success of the film is a firm indication that Chinese culture is making its mark..."	4.0	A martial arts movie filmed with great visual brio...	2009-02-11	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2QX63R4BHBRSP	Robert Stotzky	Being a fan of Asian cinema it was great to see that an Asian film finally recieved the praise that so many are deserving. Director Ang Lee has created a fantastic tale of love and he had the good taste to incorporate numerous fight scenes in it as well. These fight scenes have, quite naturally, become the center of attention in virtually every single review of the film. My review is no different. While it is essentially a love story, it's the fantastic fights that really make it stand out.The fights are in no way realistic, with people running on walls, jumping from rooftop to rooftop - or treetop to treetop - while at the same time fighting with hands, feet, swords and anything else that comes in the way. Even more impressive is the fact that no digital altering was used to create these scenes. These incredible effects were made using wires attached to the actors, making it possible for them to perform these gravity-defying stunts.For more action of this kind, check out some of Jet Li's earlier films (before he made &quot;Lethal weapon 4&quot;) like &quot;Last Hero In China&quot;, and the &quot;Fong Sai Yuk&quot;-series.	5.0	A fairytale adventure	2001-10-23	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A21Z7FXB1SVY2E	Robert T Earney	I first heard of this movie about five months prior to it's US release. I became very excited and begged all of the local movie theaters to get it. Consideridering that my town hosts many film and artsy festivals I was surprised that no theater or anybody else  had a clue as to what I was talking about. That is no longer a problem. My anticipation grew unbearable  but finally I got to see this spectactular movie which far exceeded my expectations. I go to the movies quite frequently and not since Raiders of the Lost Ark has a movie blown me away like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Yes, it is that good. Some people will merely see this movie as a film where people fly around on wires, and try to think of it as only an action film.The movie is so much more than that.  This is a movie that excells on  all fronts;acting, direction, cinematography, music, story ect. No spoilers or synopsis here, just rent it. What ever you do, do not watch the english dubbed version. Watch the subtitiled version. This goes for all foreign films. If you like this film for reasons other than just an action film , I hightly recommend The Emperor and the Assassin.	5.0	This might be the greatest film ever made.	2001-08-09	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2OVR63TMZ8FJJ	Robin McDonald	I have been waiting for someone to release a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for maybe ten years.  I had hoped it would be an American film but I think it fitting it was something in the middle. Ang Lee has been directed the outstanding film Sense and Sensibilities which is amazing considering it is a perfectly British feeling 19th century English country romance-comedy-drama. In spite of this success continues to make Chinese language films like &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; that have had a small but enthusiastic following here.  For me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was nothing new. Even though I am a pasty white boy, I have had the privilege of enjoying Chinese fantasy adventure films before.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has finally introduced America to a genre of film that has been long enjoyed in China. And in particular I believe to a great extent the film is an homage to the artistry of the great Chinese director Tsui Hark (pronounced Choy Hock)who has been orchestrating elaborate choreography such as this in forests, cities and buildings for years. Crouching Tiger is a blend of Sense and Sensibility and the films of Tsui Hark and others directors in that tradition.  It is therefore no accident that suddenly but quietly appearing on the DVD shelves of all your Blockbuster Video stores are the best known films of Tsui Hark.  Once Upon a Time in China and the Swordsman series.  Unlike most American films the sequels, Once Upon a Time in China 2 and Swordsman 2 are considered the best films. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon you will also thrill to Swordsman 2 just as much.  The choreography is often even more spectacular than what you have seen. Squadrons of ninjas whorl and fly through the forests displaying powers you have not even imagined. And like Crouching Tiger, men and women (and men-women in some cases) are on an equal footing. I have heard it said that once you have seen Alien or Aliens and jumped out of your seat, the only way to recapture that experience is to see the film with a friend who hasn't seen the film yet and watch them jump out of their skin.  For me it was kind of wonderful listening to the audience applaud after watching the rooftop chase.  Obviously it was the first time my audience had ever seen anything like that. So while it was not as amazing to me having seen similar it was very cool knowing this was an eye opener for many uninitiated.  I hope some people will be inspired to take a chance and watch the films that inspired Crouching Tiger.  Hopefully it will usher in inovative styles of action films in the U.S..  It already has if you have seen &quot;The Matrix.&quot;	4.0	Beyond Crouching Tiger	2001-07-17	0	0	0

It was after seeing the Life of Pi that I realized that the acrobatics is digital, a feature of Ang Lee's movies.The mysticism in CTHD is a bit fake but perhaps people who enjoy fake mysticism will then proceed to some real wisdom.Zhang Ziyi is an impressive actress, but aren't there some scandals about her too?  Knowing about them did affect my enjoyment.Everyone, or at least most people have clay feet.  But once you know, it becomes harder to see them still as magical, and then much of the charm is gone.	4.0	Very enjoyable.	2013-07-11	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"Ang Lee's martial arts drama ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" earned its niche in movie history as the first foreign language film ever to gross over $100 million dollars at the U.S./Canadian box office.  It is, of course, a film of other distinctions as well.The factor that sets this film apart from all previous martial arts films is, principally, the fight scenes themselves, which involve the characters defying the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walking along walls and even conducting a sword fight high above the tree tops of a windswept forest.  These sequences, which achieve a sort of heightened surrealism, are indeed breathtaking to behold in their originality, boldness and technical perfection.  They provide the unforgettable imagery that very few films these days seem able to achieve, giving the audience the all too rare sense that it is seeing something wholly new and visionary.Based on a novel by Du Lu Wang,  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" tells a quite fascinating story of a stolen sword and the attempts of two warriors, one a man, the other a woman, to retrieve it.  Like most movies set in an Asian past, Lee's film conveys a tone of quiet contemplation, even when great issues of war and peace, life and death, duty and honor are being fought over and discussed.  There is a lyrical, poetic beauty to much of this film, even - or, perhaps I should say, especially - in the non-martial arts sequences.  As the two warriors, Chow Yun Fat, a fighter grown weary of his past and yearning for the quiet rewards of peace, and Michelle Yeoh, a woman unique to her profession yet feeling deeply her unrequited love for the man she follows, bring a sturdy maturity to their complex roles.  They provide the human warmth that, in the first section of the film, in particular, keeps the work rooted in reality.Unfortunately, there is a scene about an hour into the movie, when a young aristocratic woman, destined to be married but yearning for the liberation that would come with being a warrior, has a long romantic flashback, chronicling her strange affair with a handsome young barbarian.  Although the scene ends up being crucial to the understanding of the rest of the film, it really isn't on an intellectual par with the main story of the film, coming across instead as something of an embarrassing bodice-ripper in tone and style.  Although the film does return to its main plotline eventually, it never completely recovers from the detour it has taken.  As with most movies with a midpoint sag, the audience is never really able to completely tune back in.  What a pity - for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" clearly has the elements to make a truly great film (and, judging from the reaction of many critics and writers on this site, a large number of people feel it is).  Luckily, after the flashback, the film manages to get back on track, as we witness the complex interplay between the unthinking arrogance that comes with youth and the restraining wisdom that comes with age.  This is the most powerful theme that runs through this visually gorgeous film.Thus, despite its minor imperfections, any lover of cinema would be well advised to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for the many wonders it contains."	4.0	dazzling but flawed film	2001-08-10	9	8	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2GQOI25E6UY25	RolloTomasi	&#65533;Forrest Gump&#65533; over &#65533;Pulp Fiction.&#65533;  &#65533;Titanic&#65533; over &#65533;L.A. Confidential.&#65533;  To a very long list of mistakes, the Academy can add its most grievous offense yet:  naming &#65533;Gladiator&#65533; best picture over &#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.&#65533;It isn&#65533;t so much that &#65533;Gladiator&#65533; is a shallow, shoddy piece of work that shouldn&#65533;t be within a ten-mile radius of the best picture category; it&#65533;s more that &#65533;Crouching Tiger,&#65533; Ang Lee&#65533;s visionary martial-arts epic, is the sort of blazing masterpiece that seems to redefine the purpose of movie-watching as an activity.  It is that good.Since its rapturous critical reception and its overwhelming popular success, &#65533;Crouching Tiger&#65533; has suffered the inevitable backlash by people who choose to call it an unremarkable twist on the wuxia genre, a movie that seems impressive only because we haven&#65533;t seen all the similar movies that came before it.  If this is true, if &#65533;Crouching Tiger&#65533; is indeed just another wuxia film, then we might as well call &#65533;Gone With the Wind&#65533; just another romance.  We might as well call &#65533;Double Indemnity&#65533; just another film noir.  We might as well call &#65533;The Godfather&#65533; just another Mob movie.  You get the picture.Not that &#65533;Crouching Tiger&#65533; doesn&#65533;t echo genre conventions.  On the contrary, director Ang Lee freely and unabashedly flirts with clich&eacute;s; the difference is that rather than merely rehashing them, Lee breathes new life into them with the sort of bold, breathtaking imagination you only encounter in an artist at the peak of his powers.  He tweaks them with a sort of childlike glee that&#65533;s half-mischievous, half-enchanted--and the result is a seamless entertainment that manages to fuse several elements at once without ever losing its shape.  It&#65533;s as fluid and controlled as anything Lee&#65533;s directed, the rare film that you admire as much for its careful craftsmanship as for the way it makes your spirit soar.It begins with two powerful warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who have always restrained their feelings for one another out of respect and honor for Shu Lien&#65533;s slain husband, who was Li Mu Bai&#65533;s friend.  A stolen sword, a secret manual, and an evil assassin eventually figure into the ridiculously elaborate plot, and by that point you can tell that Lee is having a lot of fun with the details.  The most volatile catalyst in the story turns out to be Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a young, vivacious beauty who longs to be a warrior and demonstratesincredible fighting prowess.  Unfortunately, she&#65533;s trapped by her aristocratic upbringing and is being forced into marriage, even though she&#65533;s secretly in love with a roguish bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), which is revealed to us in a long, absorbing flashback that would indeed be ponderous and distracting if it weren&#65533;t so deliriously entertaining.Lee juggles these elements with astonishing skill, moving from humor (the scene in which Jen single-handedly destroys the restaurant may be one of the giddiest sequences in comedic history) to drama (the film&#65533;s final scenes, which are haunting beyond words) without dropping a stitch.  What elevates &#65533;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#65533; above the roots of its genre, and what short-sighted critics seem willing to ignore, is the superb ensemble cast, from which the film derives its considerable emotional power.  The most notable are Yeoh, who can kick the ... out of anyone and still look elegant, and Ziyi, who more than deserved an Oscar nomination for her supremely hot-headed ingenue.It&#65533;s the brilliance of &#65533;Crouching Tiger&#65533; that these actors manage such surprising depths of emotion even while they&#65533;re spinning out one unforgettable fight scene after another.  If &#65533;Crouching Tiger&#65533; were merely the derivative, one-dimensional flick so many people say it is, it would still be a viscerally dazzling entertainment.  There&#65533;s just something about the sight of Yeoh and Ziyi soaring from rooftop to rooftop, clashing swords with enviable grace, that inspires and gratifies like nothing else.  The word &#65533;intoxicating&#65533; comes to mind.  As it is, the action sequences are only one recommendable aspect of a film that attempts everything and nails everything, without a single false note from beginning to end.Just another wuxia film?  Ha.  They should all be this good.	5.0	The best film of 2000	2001-08-15	20	17	3

So I vowed once Crouching Tiger landed in my lap, and I got the chance to watch it, I'd review it so all those other people desperate for advice would have a least a little to go by.  I was a &quot;bit&quot; disappointed, hehe....uh, the DTS is cool, its better than dolby digital 5.1, which is the best the other dvd provided.  Also, the Superbit didn't have that annoying dubbed track, that I doubt many people want to listen to anyways.  Although I only watch my dvds through s-video rather than the best picture quality component video, I can still say that I've seen better picture in dvds that werent superbit.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1TK6R2JSC97HL	Rottenberg's rotten book review	"In China at the dawn of the 20th century, the lovely Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) agrees to convey a fabled sword to Peking as a gift from its owner, the legendary warrior Li Mubai (Chow Yun Fat) to their mutual benefactor, Sir Te.  Both Li and Yu are warriors, veterans of a life of battle against China's organized underworld which has both scarred them and yet turned them into the master warriors (restless and regretful) that they are recognized for.  The gift of the sword, and Yu's bringing it to Peking, are symbolic acts in both Yu and Li's lives, turnposts at which they might intersect free of their destinies and finally realize their mutual affections.  When the sword, called ""The Green Destiny"" is stolen by a masked warrior who can leap tall pagodas in a single bound, plans are put aside and the hunt is on, not so much to reclaim the sword, but to repay a debt to the evil Jade Fox, a warrior who betrayed and murdered Li's teacher.Director Ang Lee supposedly crafted this elaborate art-house film as a high-minded tribute to the martial-arts epics of his youth, in which single warriors fight off an army of lesser fighters, while more-equal-matched bouts have the fighters hurtling through the air, as if rocketed from the planet Krypton.  But ""Tiger"" goes further, delving into the regret of its characters.  Besides Lee, we have Yu-Jen, the elfin faced girl who's prosepctive marriage to a highly-placed noble makes her pine for the life of a brigand, one she ""claims"" to know only from books, and Lo, a desert brigand with whom she has fallen in love.  Then there is the evil Jade Fox herself who puts in an appearance.  Unfortunately, Lee doesn't devote enough time to any of these compelling characters, though he does work them up excellently.  The ""Green Destiny"" itself is too quickly relegated to an object that doesn't quite hold our attention (Like that suitcase in ""Pulp Fiction"", it's quickly overshadowed by the characters that kill for it), and the mysterious thief and her awesome fighting skills take center stage.  A subplot linking the seemingly innocent Jen with the wildly exotic Lo is dropped in midway and threatens to steal the movie away, but its more than made up with by the depth brought to Lo and Jen's characters which seemed to have amassed the regret that Jade Fox, Yu and Li have taken their lives to collect.  A great film."	4.0	Love is the strongest weapon.	2001-07-01	3	2	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3081Z4P774YR4	"""rsmon77"""	"I came into ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" knowing it was a martial-arts fantasy (as if people actually could run up walls and skip among bamboo trees), and was not disappointed in the least.  The story itself was a little hard to explain to others who hadn't seen it, but as it breaks down, two warriors and close friends (the always cool Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) hunt down a thief (Zhang Ziyi) who may be the student of one of their oldest enemies.  Suffice to say, things get complicated from there.  Although this is technically the middle story in the series of books from which it's based (hopefully, those rumors of a prequel will come to pass), I managed to follow the story easily and have to admit it had a lot more characterization than I came to expect in other martial-arts epics (not that I have a problem with films where I have to turn my brain off, mind you).  The action sequences in this film border on stunning (the woman-to-woman fight in the dojo definitely ranks up there as one of my favorite action scenes ever), and the photography (definitely worth winning an Oscar for) was nothing less than beautiful.  Even though the ending itself appears to be open to a lot of interpretation, I have to admit this is one of those epics that doesn't insult my intelligence (although I have to admit clich&eacute;d lines like ""You will pay for my master's death"" and so forth did give me a slight chuckle upon hearing them) and manages to be quite intoxicating.

It is a very beautiful movie, the story is perfectly intertwined with it's scenery- both are equally impressive. It is a fantasy action/adventure/love story that is rightfully dubbed an &quot;instant classic.&quot;  Which brings us to the much awaited DVD version.I was impressed with the amount of extras this bare-bones edition has to offer, much more than most other non-special editions on the market .  I would reccomend buying it today than waiting for a deluxe edition to come out a few months from now.  The transfer is near-perfect, the only drawback is not having a movie theater sized screen in your house.  My only complaint comes from the voice-over work.  It is overdescriptive and more flamboyant than the original lines, and at times changes and adds new lines.  I reccomend first time viewers to take in the original Mandarin language version with subtitles first, then going back and seeing it with the English dub.  My money is on the original, but some would say otherwise.  Either way- if you are a fan of great scenery, action, love, or drama,  BUY THIS MOVIE.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A6FIAB28IS79	Samuel Chell	Call it what you will--archetypal fable with a feminist twist, exquisitely choreographed martial arts movie, balletic spectacle balancing image, action, poetry and music--&quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; is a distinctive variation on familiar genres.  The words &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;choreography,&quot; &quot;Eastern&quot; exotic myth don't quite do justice in describing the film.  For one, the action sequences are lightning swift--reminiscent of American silent comedies and more suggestive of music than of formal dance.  And certainly the tempo of this music and the pace of the film seem more Western than Eastern (as does the throbbing romantic cello of YoYo Ma).  Some will single out the three female leads in this rite-of-passage archetypal story as the film's most distinctive twist.  But even more novel is the way the form foregrounds allegory and approaches the theme of teaching and learning.  Film is a medium that is normally &quot;relentless&quot; in his  representation of the physical world, satisfying viewers' expectations of actions that are at least humanly plausible.  But by making his characters fly all over the frame, director Lee keeps reminding the spectator that if you try to respond this film as another action movie you will not only miss the point entirely but be thoroughly disappointed.  Sword play, flying, and fighting are metaphors for living, learning and loving.  All of the 5 principals in the story are learners--and all are failures to greater and lesser degrees.  In fact, the alleged villain, Jade Fox, is in some respects the most sympathetic of all the characters.  She had access to the most masterful swordsman of all but not to his teaching because of her status as a woman.  At one point sword play is compared with word play, or writing (through the picture-grams of Mandarese script).  Whether the instrument is a sword, a pen, or a brush, the viewer of this enchanting parable is finally enjoined to fashion a personal narrative that rejects pride and selfishness in favor of a life sufficiently disciplined to give itself over to love.	4.0	Chic flick on speed or sublime flight of the imagination?	2001-04-08	10	8	2

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A9Z2C1G5FJ77M	Sara	After hearing all of the great reviews for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I decided to see it.  In the beginning I was getting bored with reading all the English subtitles but as the movie progressed, I became more involved with it.  The actors and actresses gave phenomenal performances and the critics were correct in extolling this great action movie.  The part that didn't totally satisfy me was the fantasy parts such as walking on walls and flying through the air.  I thought the cables were well hidden, but I don't think there should have been as much flying.  It detracted from the movie's otherwise enjoyable sequence.  This movie leaves you slightly hanging in the end but it gives you something to think about.  All in all, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the perfect choice for someone who likes fantasy, fighting, and depth in a movie.	4.0	Gripping Plot But Go Easy On The Fantasy	2001-07-24	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A12B24ENFITYN	"""scorsese_crazy"""	Since everybody else has already commented on the stunning visuals of CTHD, I have decided to devote my review to commenting on the narrative.After viewing the extra features on the DVD and watching the interviews, I came to understand that Ang Lee, in making this picture, was responding to the body of work in the wuxia genre. Beyond the obvious martial arts component, the themes dealt with in CTHD are interesting in that they address the dark side of duty, social order, and paternalism; values that form the backbone of eastern philosophy (confucianism), and that are often glorified in martial arts films.In the typical martial arts picture, women are relegated to submissive roles, and often the plot revolves around defending the honour of one's master, mentor, or father. CTHD departs from these conventions, and places the concerns of the female characters in the spotlight. While it is true that Chow Yun Fat's character, Li Mu Bai, seeks to avenge his master's death, this plot element is downplayed, and in the course of the film we learn that his master was a flawed man who adhered to paternalistic/chauvinistic values (to the point of bringing about his own downfall). Instead, the central concern of the film deals with the subjugation of women; Jen must marry according to her father's and society's expectations, Shui Len is not free to act on her love for Li Mu Bai, Jade Fox is to some extent the product of her oppression. Ang Lee succeeds in painting sympathetic portraits of these characters, and credit must go to the cast for their solid performances, as well as to Ang Lee for his masterful direction.CTHD is a film with depth and substance and is a true rarity: I can't remember the last time that I saw an action flick that provoked any cerebral activity.A caveat: if you are unimaginative, or the type of person who refuses to suspend disbelief, then this film is not for you.	4.0	A social commentary disguised as an action flick	2001-07-01	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2RN2AO4BE6F4K	"Scott Bright ""scottypotty"""	Movie Summary:  Sword master Li Mu Bai is ready to retire and be with the love of his life. But a stolen sword and a strange bandit delay his retirement.My Opinion: This is not a classical Hong Kong Kung Fu movie where everything centers around a number of fight scenes. This movie has in depth characters, multiple plot lines, good acting and direction. It is an epic love story about two couples. The martial arts fit into the story seamlessly.  Thet are not the reason for the story, they are just part of it. I am a fan of the cheesy dubbed in Black Belt theater movie and CTHD is heads above those.DVD Quality: It's anamorphic yeah! There are plenty of extras and an English language track that I found to be better than the subtitles (they said different things!!!).What You Should Do:  See it no matter what. Even people who are not fans of this genre will enjoy this movie. Buy it if you are a Martial Arts or action movie fan.	5.0	Li Mu Bai and the Green Destiny	2001-05-23	6	5	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AY314LRU803OF	Scott	You just cannot beat Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in terms of beauty and quality. This is an absolutely top-notch film beautifully written, acted, and especially choreographed. The fight scenes had me absolutely reeling the first time I saw them, so flawless and so well-developed that the film transcended the television screen. Truly, it the best film I have ever had the pleasure of watching-- Not just once, but again and again. There is not a single story out there that can compare to the brilliance of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. These reviewers do not exaggerate.	5.0	A Truly Mesmerizing, Epic Film!	2011-03-29	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2HMGNBNSQFLAF	Scott Petrovits	It's strange that among so many reviews of this movie, there are only a few who absolutely hate it.  It's interesting that, in the reviews these detractors write, they criticize the fact that it is subtitled.  Perhaps it's no surprise that those who can't keep up with subtitles write the least grammatically correct, most poorly-spelled reviews.  I personally had no problem keeping up with the subtitles, since they were so dumbed-down from the original Mandarin.  I also was able to stay awake through the theatrical release BOTH times I saw it.  I admit that there are sections where the wirework could have been improved, but overall, the cinematography and screenplay made up for the lack of polish in the martial arts scenes.  As many critics of this movie state, &quot;I've seen it all before,&quot; but never like this. Did the film deserve the Best Picture Oscar?  It depends on the competition.  This year, it was &quot;Chocolat&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Traffic&quot;, and &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.  Among those, I'll take &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; (no &quot;T&quot; in &quot;crouching&quot;) any day of the week, with &quot;Traffic&quot; a close second.  I'm just glad it won Best Foreign Film.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2PNTEDGMOLMOY	Scott Schiefelbein	"""Crouching Tiger"" is a blessing, a film that singlehandedly elevates the guilty pleasure of chop-sockey flicks to high art.Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are perfectly cast as lovers who are united by their past yet forbidden to act on that love by their code of honor.  These talented actors say all there is to say with meaningful glances, conveying their mixed emotions of desire and regret.  (The dialogue is also surprisingly good for a ""kung fu flick,"" but is much more effective in Chinese with Engish sub-titles rather than dubbed in English.)Still, this movie is first and foremost a martial arts film -- albeit one with a heck of a love story.  Two fight scenes in particular - an early one at night in a courtyard and a later scene in a sparring room - steal the entire movie.  World-class athleticism combined with astounding choreography and a heart-pounding soundtrack -- sheer bliss!""Crouching Tiger"" gives us heroes to cheer, villains to hiss, and colorful sidekicks to make us smile.  Put this all together with stunning camerawork and a heart-breaking climax, and you've got yourself one heck of a picture!The only criticism of the DVD is the relative paltry offering of extras.  But I'd rather have a great film with few extras than a mediocre film with a ton of goodies on the DVD."	5.0	Dazzling!	2004-04-29	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2FU58A3LVLGKI	Scott Thompson	It is refreshing to see that great movies can still be made in this time of mindless action flicks (even if it has to be made in Hong Kong).  &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; is, in a way, a story of feminine empowerment and the constrictions of Chinese culture.  It is a story of love, revenge, rejection, desire and all the other things that make life interesting.  &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; is a great film that just happens to have some great fight scenes in it as opposed to Hollywood action movies that just happen to have a few lines of horrible dialogue in them.  So if you are a person who in not afraid to bo enriched by a film, a film that delves into the feelings and desires of the characters, then see &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot;P.S.  Ignore the people that say that they cannot follow the plot.  They just have mind rot from too many Hollywood gore-fests.	5.0	One of the greatest films in years.	2001-03-05	32	28	4

I thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was fantastic and had the feel of a romance, a mystery and an action movie all rolled together.  It is a pleasure to watch something other than what Hollywood deams we should be watching. And to have new actors other than the same old ones we see all the time was in itself refreshing, not to mention the main characters being female for a change. The action scenes were very smooth - no obvious wires!!! and the sword fighting enthralling.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A184CI1GIWVE6H	Servina Pub	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon - Ang LeeThis film has tremendous performances from Chow Yun Fat in his first action role and Michelle Yeoh as his star crossed lover.  The fight scenes are improbably dazzling and once again Yuen Wo Ping, who choreographed The Matrix makes the film a dazzling display of movement with action sequences that literally take your breath away.The Director, Ang Lee has made the film palatable to American and European audiences.  Check out the genre change as Jen (Zhang Ziyi) chases her lover across the desert and the film magically becomes a western.The film is primarily about traditional Chinese society and its inability to deal with the encroaching equality of Chinese women. The three main female characters all centre around the figure of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat).  They all show different kinds of female role.  Wife, Daughter and the woman who is rejected by society for her refusal to take on one of these valid roles.The character Jade Fox is excluded from society for stealing secret wisdom, which has only previously been available to Men. Jen is allowed this knowledge only when she redeems herself by turning to her father figure Li Mu Bai.  This shows brilliantly the struggle between Chinese women and traditional influence.Jen, the main protagonist  is fighting against traditional Chinese values in the form of an arranged marriage.  She is a gifted martial arts expert under the tuition of the rogue Jade Fox.  Li Mu Bai  wants to teach her himself.  He takes on a patriarchal role, attempting to harness Jens' skills in a legitimate way.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a visual masterpiece with amazing scenery and out of this world choreography.  It offers a high-quality, subtle plot with full character exploration.  The film has also won four Oscars and four Baftas, so this should be an indication of its tremendous quality. It is also the first film to bring Chinese cinema to western audiences on a blockbuster scale.	5.0	Culture clash and Battles of the sexes in China	2001-09-26	13	10	3

The story itself is beautiful and the action adds to the epic story.  I'm not a big fan of martial arts movies but this one has the great balance of drama and action.

I have seen it well over twenty times, and every time I see it, the power of the film's message still makes me weepy.  This move is beautiful.  That one word pretty much sums up the entire film.  I really have to stress that anyone who thinks the ending sucks has never been in love.  When they do someday, they should go back and see this movie.  They will understand it completely at that moment.Chow Yun-Fat has always been one of my favorite actors.  He helped set a start to the Hong Kong Blood Opera genre that John Woo has perfected (see Hard Boiled, now) and is perfect for this movie.Michelle Yeoh is breathtaking in this film.  Some may argue that she looks old, but I think her beauty is natural and timeless.  I saw her in Tomorrow Never Dies, but never expected her to pull in a performance like this.Zhang Ziyi is going to bear my children someday.  I always say this to my friends everytime I watch the movie, and I say it again when I see Rush Hour 2.  Not only is she stunning, but she can pull off even the most complicated of fight scenes.It comes down to one simple thing.  I first saw this movie with my girlfriend in theaters.  She cried at the end, and I was quite near tears.  Then we saw it again the next week.  The emotions were exactly the same.  I love this film, and I can gurantee you that it will remain a timeless classic.	5.0	The perfect marriage of love story and martial arts	2002-01-14	3	3	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A269TIEO3V9CD2	Shane E Lewis	After Reading several reviews both good and bad I desided to write my two cents.I have seen the movie several times and every time I am excided to go and see it again. All of the Charatures are very well developed. You get pulled into the scenes. The fight scenes grab your attention and keep them they are not you typical scene, two or three seconds and a camera switch. The camera stayed rolling some time for several mins. keeping tha action moving. It say alot for the actors that they ar talented enough to do those scens with few breaks in them.I would have like to have seen the movie in english but once you get used to reading the subtitles it is easy going. The only Draw back is the subtitles nmore than likely are not telling everything that is said. Alot can be lost in translation.Thanks for reading my thoughts	5.0	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon	2001-03-09	8	6	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AJ8TBV3FD6704	"Sharon E. Cathcart ""Why, yes, I am an author"""	&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is best described as a mythic/fantasy film.  Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat portray Shaolin kung fu adepts who are both investigating why a princess disappears at night.  A past relationship between Yun-Fat and Yeoh's characters is hinted at very broadly, and the chemistry between the two stars is sizzling.  There are some beautifully choreographed fight scenes, and gorgeous special effects (take particular note of the battle in the trees).  The DVD,like the film, is subtitled in English.  If you're like me, you'll find that (eventually) you can follow the dialog pretty well with only an occasional glance at the written words.  Well worth purchasing, because you'll want to see it more than once.	5.0	A Different Kind of Fairy Tale	2001-07-19	0	0	0

The Genre is a unique one for the U.S., and even my nine year old daughter and movie critic husband found it mezmerizing. This is a film you can veiw over and over again. I highly recommend a DTS digital decoder for optimum veiwing pleasure.  I initially had no intention of seeing this film, it happened by a fluke. I am so glad I did because I left with a feeling of wonder and amazement I have rarely felt when leaving a movie theater. It has a mystic that fills your heart with longing and awakens the dreams of the spirit. Don't miss out on the most talked about movie of the Year. The story is one we can all relate to, regardless of the culture. It is spritually fulfilling, Humorous, provides the action we want in a feature and the most wonderous visuals I have ever seen.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3V6V8MJLDFJ7V	Shelley Lee	I have been reading wuxia novels and watching wuxia series and films all my life. The actions illustrated in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does not suprise me because I have seen more advanced fighting scenes. The people who make fun of the actions or say they are 'goofy' or 'unrealistic' lives under a rock because they don't know much about the wuxia culture. The chinese culture dates back more than 5000 years. Wuxia warriors are believed to have existed but we are not sure what they are capable of. How do they defy gravity and can fly over roof tops? hello? They practice kong-fu since they are very small. One of the ways is to tie heavy rocks on your feet for several years and get used to running and walking with the rocks on. So when you take them off, you can obviously jump higher. People, don't be so narrow minded. Many things can be done ...don't make quick judgements based on the limited knowledge that you are exposed to. Remember? We landed on the moon. Anyways, I enjoyed the film because of its beautiful sceneries and the way they incorporated chinese culture into the film.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A6UGTB17P5BX8	Simon Gifford	I was really looking forward to this movie, as I'm a great fan of martial arts/kung fu films. I wasn't disappointed. Unlike a lot of HK movies, this one has a worthwhile plot. The story is set in China in the late 19th Century. Chow Yun Fat is cast as a warrior called Li Mu Bai whose favorite sword, the &quot;Green Destiny&quot; is stolen, and now he wants it back. He pursues the thief across the Chinese landscape, with his friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, who also starred in &quot;Supercop&quot; with Jackie Chan, performs brilliantly). However, this movie chooses to make that only part of the story, and also focuses on the human relationships that the characters have, so we can feel sympathetic towards them. Newcomer Zhang Ziyi puts in a wonderful performance as the saucy, feisty teenager Jen Yu, who is on the brink of an arranged marriage, but instead rebels against her Governess by running away into the dessert and falling in love with the man she meets there (played by Chang Chen). It`s nice to see a martial arts film that tries to appeal to both men and women.Also, the fight scenes in this film look absolutely stunning - people leap across rooftops, scale walls and walk on water, ignoring the laws of gravity. The choreography comes courtesy of Yuen Wo-Ping, best known in the US and Europe for his work on &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The beautiful Chinese scenery is a plus point too, resulting in a feast for the eyes.That said, as brilliant as &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; was, I found it strangely familiar. The sets, action scenes, costumes and stunts reminded me of Jet Li`s &quot;Once Upon A Time In China&quot;. Chow Yun Fat acted very well in this movie, but he seemed strangely out of place to me when you consider that for a long time, Chow had starred in HK gangster flicks like &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;. Incidentally, Jet Li was the directors` original choice to play the part of Li Mu Bai, but he turned it down to star in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; instead, which probably explains my &quot;Once Upon A Time...&quot; d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.Overall though, I think that this movie is fantastic - it really deserves all the plaudits its` been getting. Everybody should see this - not just martial arts fans, for its` wonderful blend of stunning scenery, action and romance.	5.0	A fantastic film - but oddly familiar...	2001-02-02	3	3	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ARTIKJCMZSGT1	"""singyung"""	"Ang Lee decided to use the literal translation ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" for the Chinese title of CTHD because there is no direct western equivalent. This should warn us that CTHD is a film set in the Chinese warrior mythos which also cannot be translated directly to a western/modern audience.Before going on, I must admit two things: (1) I love CTHD to distraction (I've had the DVD for a year and I still love it), and (2) I am a Chinese who has grown up watching mythical Chinese warrior movies. That makes me a minority since CTHD was critically acclaimed but NOT popular with the Chinese. So I know and understand those who thought CTHD was [a terrible] or so-so movie.I've been disappointed with movies before, so my advice is to take note of the REVIEWS instead of just the hype. And browsing through the positive reviews of CTHD here, it looks as though the people who really enjoyed the movie were usually those who went to the cinema, saw it on the big screen, heard the Mandarin soundtrack, read the subtitles, appreciated restrained love stories and didn't have a clue as to what to expect in a Chinese martial arts movie.It also seems that the reviewers who hated or didn't cared for CTHD generally wanted more action (or a faster and more convoluted story), couldn't accept the martial skill of ""weightlessness"" (or didn't like the wire-work), got bored with the plodding middle-age romance (or the frivolous teenage romance ), or any one or more of the above. My guess is also that they also didn't read the sub-titles.I'll also admit that I'm a Michelle Yeoh fan and not a Zhang Ziyi fan, so Zhang's 20 minute flashback sequence was tedious for me and the teahouse scene was just comic relief. But at least I'm clear about my own expectations. I was also aware that Ang Lee had certain commercial ""requirements"" to meet in CTHD (120 min length, youthful romance, blah X 3).So after much thought, I realised that enjoying any movie depends on what you wanted to see in it in the first place. Since Tsui Hark's ground-breaking 1990 sword-fighting epic, ""Swordsman"" -- where ONE martial artist acquired astounding ""telekinetic"" and ""levitational"" skills -- the Hong Kong movie industry filled the next decade with movies where ALL the martial artist displayed ""telekinetic"" and ""levitational"" skills. Most of my friends accepted it as THE way a martial arts movie should be done, but I got very sick by 2000.So I obviously had the ""right"" mind-set for watching CTHD and I loved the way the martial artists in CTHD ""leaped"" instead ""hovered"", and actually ""fought"" each other with fists and weapons instead of ""blasting"" each other with their qi(energy) or will. I'm glad that Yuen was challenged by Ang Lee to choreograph the close-quarter combat sequences with their precise manoeuvres and counter-manoeuvres.I also have some appreciation for Chinese music, landscape paintings and architecture, so the Tan Dun's score, Peter Pau's cinematography and Tim Yip's sets and decor were enthralling for me. I have had a western education so it may be that I am looking at such ""exotic"" eastern culture with a westerner's eye.But over and above the production values, Ang Lee and his stellar cast infused CTHD with light humor, suppressed emotions as well with several underlying themes. One of those themes was that everyone could be a ""crouching tiger or a hidden dragon"", i.e. everyone has the potential to become a great menance or a great person. Think about it, what made Zhang's character end up destroying almost everyone around but her own innate selfishness and impetuousness?"	5.0	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a Chinese metphor	2002-06-18	15	12	3

His fighting skill were never really even shown, it was all slight of hand fancy camera anglesand whatever to make up for the fact that he is just an actor in real life. In fact the truth is he hardlyshow up in the film, the only thing we do know is his name was ""Li mu bai!"" If his reputation proceded himit was only spoken of it was never shown. If the term ""His Reputation Proceeds him"" was ever meant to fitanywhere its here.2) The fight scenes where they are climbing all over the rooftops and trees.. Flying from tree to tree im nottrying to argue against the idea. But the Wire Work, (actors attached to wires for flips jumps, etc) was justended up looking so sloppy that it ended up looking silly. If you like it. Fine im not trying to steal youreggo.. but let of MINE, because the wire work was really sloppy overall.I mean you cant CLIMB OVER AIR, rooftops yes but if your walking over a roof and making step after step atleast make it LOOK like your feet are hitting something.3) Thirdly the storyline was not bad but you mean to tell me this girl played by Zhang Ziyi was able to fightthat good from a manual, from which even as they state in the movie that she only knew half of it and whatshe knew was dangerous to her? Chow yun fats wish seemed to be MORE or less of having a HARD ON forteaching Zhang Ziyi ... even more than approaching his love interest.Lets face it Zhang Ziyi is the only thing good about this film besides the idea of The Jade Fox, the person whoplayed Chow Yun Fats love interest Michelle something was GREAT for the part. But what they never eventouched, i mean they didnt even hug. He chases Zhang Ziyi more than his love interest.And it takes focus even though itwas not supposed to be the point. Its a faulty script i couldnt believe it. I dont hate it but it was reallyjust above average and is good. Do you know how many great martial arts movies have already been made?I did like it but it does not live up to the HYPE for me at all.The story ends before you know it everyone you want to live dies, its just ridiculously faulty. If i say thisthen how can the film critics praise it so highly you ask.. Jesus Christ if you dont know its all about ZhangZiyi by now THEN you might not ever.She is so lucsious, my baby, my precious, oh yes my preciousssss. Oh my little baby girl. Shuffle Shuffle.......Hey woah oops! Are you still here? Im so embarrased.Anyways even though she is my girlfreind Zhang Ziyi i would rather reccomend The New Crouching Tiger HiddenDragon at least we got to stay with the characters and get to know them become confortable with them as wellas the story in that 2 disc film. Its way more fleshed out.""Make popcorn now."" Excuse me honey? ""Make Popcorn now!""Ok thats my que MY GIRLFRIEND Zhang Ziyi is calling me i better go before she gets jealous and chops of myhead with the green desitiny sword or drop kicks me.I would buy this movie but i would theatrically reccomend the new crouching tiger hidden dragon as the story isway more developed, fautly yes but at least it wasnt like the original where we step into the movie theatre youblink and then its over."	3.0	Best Martial Arts film of all time!.....................YA RIGHT	2005-11-03	37	4	33
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ALY6VWLV0PNMU	S.Leung	"This movie is such pleasant surprise. The ""martial arts"" theme in this movie is not really a historical one (ie. not according to any Chinese history), but it's more in keep with the folklore and legend of martial arts theme and romance, along the line of the martial arts fictions from Jin Yong (&#37329;&#24248;) which are beloved by generations of Chinese readers in Asia. It's great all round, from script, to directing, production, cinematography, and music score. It's a breakout performance from newcomer Ziyi Zhang. Although I'm never too fond of the high-wired fake martial art jumps in similar movies, there're enough martial arts fight scenes in this movie to feed the appetite. Michelle Yeon easily handles the fighting, but Ziyi Zhang matches Yeon respectably. I've watched this movie time and again, and I still enjoy it immensely, in particular, the beginning sequence when Yeon pursues the sword thief through the dark mansion on ground and over the roof. It's awesome."	5.0	Great gem in chinese martial arts movie	2013-12-17	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3628GJ1QPH729	slightlykooky	This movie is a feast for the eyes, ears, heart and especially the mind.  In the true realization of yin and yang, Ang Lee has assembled two contrasting male/female couples which will entice the viewer the entire voyage.  Ang Lee has yet to disappoint this viewer (from his foreign &quot;Wedding Banquet&quot; and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; to more mainstream &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and the &quot;ice Storm&quot;).Lee has the uncanny ability to transform before our very eyes; his characters' motivation and development.  We watch Chow Yun-Fat who has a sort of Obi-wan Kanobi-noble and graceful elder Jedi quality to him, contrasted with Zhang Ziyi- a young Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker synthesis- who must turn away from the dark side of the Force.  It is their internal as well as their external (the action fight sequences) struggles which draw you in.Blockbuster films rely on special effects to generate their action and dramatic narrative.  Although there are special effects (the wires used to make the characters almost-fly) in Lee's film, they become secondary.  He is able to create a compelling story by weaving the action sequences seemlessly. In a nutshell, this raises the bar for all future filmmakers who want to do something more than another Jackie Chan-blow-em-up movie.From the opening action sequence, jumping from rooftop to rooftop, you forego the wires and submit to the 'willing suspension of disbelief'.  only these enlightened warriors would be able to achieve such a feat, while their unenlightened peers have to settle for the 'normal' karate chops and attacks. Action movies have sold many $$ at the box office/rentals, but the true mark of a good director is not just his story.  It's the storytelling of his characters (and in really good directors like Ang Lee--it's in how they change or don't change over the course of a movie).  You'll fall in love with Lee, his characters and the pure poetry he sets into motion!Kudos to Lee getting Tan Dun to do the soundtrack.  His rumbling percussion sounds like thunder in places and rhythmically sets off like a firecracker during the action sequences, then pulls back and lets cellist Yo Yo Ma soar in haunting melodies.	5.0	pure poetry in motion	2001-01-04	26	24	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A912C7977MO6O	Smallchief	"CTHD combines an exciting story, great stunts, beautiful cinematography, lovely women, and a complex story that is by turns mysterious, suggestive, and incomprehensible. Michelle Yeoh is a good actress in addition to her physical talents as a martial artist. Zhang Zi Yi is a sexy vixen. Chow Yun Fat is an aging warrior who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. He loves Michelle Yeoh, but can't get around to telling her, and is attracted to Zhang. The unanswered question posed by Zhang is, ""Did you want me or my sword?"" The two women dominate this movie; their martial arts scenes are spectacular; Yo Yo Ma's cello is sad and fetching; the scenery is spectacular; the fate of Chow and Michelle is heart-rending; the fate of Zhang is puzzling and ambiguous.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1XUNEVQG3YMYC	"smarmer ""smarmer"""	Why a 400th review?  Because I believe this film has a complexity few have noted.  Yes it is a grand spectacle.  While not quite as glorious as Lawrence of Arabia, I did think it could be mentioned in the same paragraph.  Actually it was The Searchers that came to mind as I was walking out of the theater after seeing it the first time.Yes it is also a rollicking martial arts flick.  &quot;How do they do it?&quot;  I know -- they use wires and speeded up (ie slowed down) takes.It is also a touching love story.  The stars of the film express considerable emotion with very modest looks and gestures.  The line at the end of preferring to be a ghost close to his love over a spirit in heaven ranks up there with the best love lines in film.But most of all I thought this was a film about narcissism.  There is the narcissism of the main character who is so touched with despair that he momentarily forgets his duty.  There is the narcissism of a different kind of duty that prevents him from &quot;disrespecting&quot; the memory of his friend -- the deceased fiancee of the woman he loves.  There are the complicated alliances, including one with a man who seems to be in league with a mafia-like underworld.  (And this is a good guy!!)  There is the bitter narcissism of Gray Fox, the proto-feminist warrior who kills our hero out of rage over a supposed seduction at the hands of his master.  By the way, that was one spot that did not make full sense to me.  Would we expect a Wudon master to have a casual affair with one of his students?The most narcissistic character is Jen, the Governor's daughter.  She is blessed with native talent which she has begun to cultivate.  She has a feisty spirit.  But over and over again she chooses self-indulgence and narcissism over discipline, over love, over doing the right thing.  She destroys the lives of everyone around her before narcissistically taking her own life in the final scene.It was the waste of talent resulting from narcissism and the wreckage left in its wake that haunted me for a long time after the film ended.  The meditation on love, duty, discipline, and narcissism is what the film finally was about for me.I agree heartily with those reviewers who felt the film was poorly served by the DVD transfer.  It is not really terrible, but it is sub-par.  A film of this greatness deserves a first class DVD edition.  I hope one will be forthcoming soon.	5.0	Complex Masterpiece	2001-06-27	14	11	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2ZHELQ9MNGBI1	"""smugly"""	It may well be that this story comes to us from the great and time honored tradition of Chinese epic sagas, but for this American movie-goer, it seemed to come more from the tradition of the old Hercules movies, or perhaps some exaggerated continuation of the Bruce Lee series. I've known many Chinese people in my life and if any of them could fly, one of them would surely have tipped me off to this fact. .Personally, I found all of the flying around and the incredible fighting skills to be distracting, but I had prepared myself to see one of the year's greatest films. Perhaps if I had begun the movie with no preconceived ideas and lower expectations, I'd have enjoyed it more. I'd recommend that you see this movie, but don't get into it expecting greatness, unless, perhaps, you are much more familiar with the genre and the tradition than I am.	3.0	But Chinese People Can't Fly	2001-06-28	2	1	1

This is the most epic-ly epic film I've seen since Lawrence of Arabia... the settings, the actors, the action, the music, just everything was mind-blowing. You have to see this on the big screen to really appreciate it. Fantastic acting all round, especially by our hidden dragon. Chow Yuen Fat can't make a bad film (Chinese one, that is) and Michelle Yeoh has real screen presence here.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ	"Spare-Time Critic ""Deb"""	I watched the subtitled version (touted to be the best), yet I was still disappointed in the movie.  To give it its due, how could I help but be disappointed?  I'd read SO MANY raving reviews saying it was the best movie ever made, I expected to have my socks blown off -- which is a perfect setup for a letdown.The subtitles were not a serious disadvantage; the dialog and plot were easy to follow. The acting was good, the scenery was incredible, and the fight scenes (despite the very obvious use of wires) were engaging in their way.What detracted from my enjoyment of this movie was my inability to empathize with the focal character, Jen.  Her role as the beautiful, flawed heroine should have made her an incredibly interesting character, but I found her hard to cozy up to.  Everyone around her seemed nearly worshipful of her, able to overlook her willfulness, her duplicity, and her self-centeredness.  With that much adoration, she didn't need mine... so I felt emotionally disconnected from her.This was, in my opinion, a fatal shortcoming.  A movie is about more than gorgeous scenery and incredible battles - it should, first and foremost, have characters we care about.  The supporting characters, though imperfect, were sympathetic in their own ways (even the villainess, who only wanted, after all, to be loved).  Yet, they circled this petulant, selfish girl like planets orbiting the sun.  It was all a bit hard to swallow.No, it wasn't a bad movie at all... just not as fantastic as it was built up to be.	3.0	Maybe it  Had Too Many Glowing Reviews...	2001-06-16	6	3	3

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AM2LVPURL9KSJ	S. Peterson	I think the reason that so many viewers who didn't like the combat scenes in this movie but can't seem to articulate is the fact that the fights in this movie are like ballet. They are like a choreographed dance and had no sense of violence whatsoever. It was more like video game violence than anything, and that's what turned me off most to the movie. This is by no stretch of the imagination a &quot;Kung Fu flick&quot; which is how it was marketed and how it was pitched to me by friends who loved it. What it does have going for it, though, is a sweet and compelling love story. It has two love stories, actually, and they're both beautiful and touching for different reasons. If you're looking for a good, rich, compelling story, this movie won't let you down. If you're looking for a kung-fu flick with realistic, visceral-yet-graceful violence, try a Bruce Lee flick. The combat in this movie is nothing more than a dance, which is beautiful in ways, but not what I wanted or enjoy.	3.0	Great story, contrived effects	2001-10-10	3	1	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ANZD45JS41WM9	"""squidx"""	This is one of those good movies nobody should miss! (unless you're not into martial arts fighting, or unless you're one of those like my husband who finds reading subtitles a chore)I've watched enough Chinese &quot;wuxia&quot; films and TV series throughout my childhood to get tired of them, so when this movie came out I refused to spend money on watching it in the cinemas even though probably everyone I knew in my life had already seen it one way or another. Eventually when I caught this on video, I was thoroughly impressed. The storyline was so good, although it was somewhat similar to what a typical Chinese &quot;wuxia&quot; flick would be, I guess it was still kind of different because this is a Hollywood flick with all those better quality special effects and filming thrown in.With an enigmatic, very intelligent, yet sweet-looking actress like Zhang Zi-Yi acting as a secretly-trained in martial arts, yet rebellious only child of a rich diplomat... falling in love with the leader of a barbarian tribe from Northern China... set against the backdrop of a dusty, sandy desert in China and a somewhat dream-like story, dialogue and screenshots littered throughout the movie to illustrate the budding love between these 2 - this was the main focus and highlight of this movie for me. This love story was so beautiful, quite touching really. Compared to the other love story that's going on in this film, this really stole the day.Chow Yun-Fat has aged a lot and looks kind of tired, so I can't say that I think he's great in this because he used to be better when he was younger. Michelle Yeoh - another somewhat tired-looking, aged actress who I think has lost most of her youthful looks suits the role she plays - as an older, mature, experienced &quot;aunt&quot; that Zhang Zi-Yi can look up to and learn something from. Nevertheless, the 2 older actors Chow and Yeoh played their parts well because they are such experienced actors, so I can't fault them.Overall, I loved this movie. Lots of quick and skilfully executed fighting scenes, a dreamy love story... I can't imagine watching it in English dubbing though cos it'd be too weird an experience.If you hate reading subtitles, well you can watch the dubbed version but you'd probably not enjoy this as much.If you want to watch it, watch it in the original with subtitles.	5.0	I loved it!	2003-11-05	2	1	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AXXCW4CEOWCP0	SR Tan	[....]I'm always going to be a kid who loves this kind of stuff - stories that revel in the impossible and the fantastic and the exhilaration of adventures in the imagination. That's said as both a loyal member of the Spielberg generation and also as a hopefully halfway serious student of Chinese culture, being an Asian-Australian kid who can empathise heart and soul with filmmaker Ang Lee's need to recreate and show us a 'dream of China'. He's a filmmaker I admire greatly and hope to emulate one day.Well, this is the dream come almost true. I don't presume to correct others' opinions on the film - clearly it has touched millions of people in a way it didn't quite do for me - and I'd been living in anticipation for months. I believe that CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is, ultimately, a blessing more for what it has made possible than what it is in itself. I'm glad that it's dazzled so many people in the West, and everywhere around the world. It makes me wonder how people will react when they realize how much more can be achieved in this genre that they can't even begin to imagine.If there was a problem for me it's that the excitement, laughter and beauty of the film were, rather like Yu Shu Lien, too rarely permitted to burst the bonds of restraint and _really_ take me soaring. It could be fitting, especially in a film about social restraint, I suppose; but then I would say more detail about the social world of the characters would have made the action and the love story deeper than they were. It's not an epic without a vast world of secondary characters and conflicts teeming behind it; pretty widescreen landscapes and plenty of fighting seem to have been the sole criteria for most people using the term. I'd have called it something else.The story as it stands mostly serves to treat the viewer to rapturous displays of cinematic poetry in the scenery, sentiment and action, and the film certainly delivers on those counts. But I prefer my plots to have more grip and bite than what you'll get here.But please don't let this arch-sounding sentiment stop you from enjoying a film which promises to be quite likely one of the most graceful, poetic and invigorating fantasies you've ever seen, [....] Hope it opens your eyes to other forms of cinema coming out of Asia today.As for the actual DVD - if the US release matches the Asian one, we'll all be very happy with one of the slickest packages ever.	4.0	Ang Lee's Dream Come Almost True	2001-04-26	14	11	3

I was anxious to see the English dubbed version to see if it would add or subtract to the enjoyment of the movie.  What a disappointment.The sound track was just bad. The relative levels of the music, sound effects and the voices were all wrong.  To top if off, the levels varied from scene to scene and would drop off in places.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ACLJ052ISSF72	Stephen Barbe	No matter what oscar says.  I knew as soon as I saw this movie nominated for both best foreign film and best picture that it would definitely win best foreign, and fall to gladiator for best picture.  While I enjoyed Gladiator a great deal, it is a crime that CTHD did not win the award it so richly deserved:  Best Picture of the year 2000.  When I first went to see this film, I was among the hordes who were blown away by the stunning cinematography, incredible action choreography and amazing wire work.  Truly a remarkable action film with amazing filming on location.  I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so brilliantly green as the bamboo forest that is but a small location shot in this movie.  The first viewing proved to me that I loved this film, but it did not prove to me that it was the best picture of the year.  That took 2 viewings.  I highly recommend to anyone who has seen this film and enjoyed it that you go see it again.  I found (since I don't speak chinese) that seeing it a second time while already knowing the story allowed me to concentrate less on reading subtitles, and more on the actors and their performances.  It was amazing to me to peel back the layers of the initially strong performances in this film and see the incredible amount of nuance that each of the leads provided in their portrayals.  After seeing it the second time, I had a whole new take on almost every piece of dialog in the film.  The first scene between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh most definitely sets the tone for this film, and contrary to what many would have you believe it is not a tone of rollicking action/adventure.  It is instead a tone of yearning, tragedy and love found too late, then lost.  This movie, packed with stunning fights and amazing flying martial artists is not so much about fighting, as it is about the chinese values of loyalty, honor and duty, and how these admirable values can ultimately keep one from truly being happy.  It is the story of a love denied too long, and accepted too late.  I am not ashamed to say that I wept openly at the end of this film both times that I saw it.  The power of the story and the performances were so strong that I felt a small shadow of the loss that the characters in the film felt, and even this small shadow was enough to make me weep.  For those of you who find nothing but swordfights and blood in this movie, nothing I can say will change your mind; but for those who have an inkling that this film is about much more than fighting and bloodshed, go see it again and buy it when it is released on DVD.  You will not for one instant be sorry that you did.	5.0	The real best picture of 2000...	2001-03-27	62	56	6
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2IL2DEK962QDI	Stephen Frost	Crouching Dragon, Whizzing Tiger is one of the most asinine movies I have ever seen. Full of itself and the overwrought, throwaway &quot;wisdom&quot; of the characters' cherished Wudan art, the film grates without relent.The melodramatic fools portrayed in the film spend more time running their fatuous mouths than they do at any actual attempts at &quot;fighting,&quot; to use the term very loosely. Particularly annoying is the silly galumphing about in the air that some of the characters do when they aren't flipping around in the dirt missing each other repeatedly with flailing, ineffective blows.Further, their weapons are practically useless in most combats, due to their vast inability to even touch flesh with them, much less pierce it. With all this supposed training, couldn't their &quot;warriors&quot; be taught to use a damn firearm? A few well-directed shotgun blasts would dispatch the wallowers in short order. Ang Lee needs to take a cue from Tarantino.Other terribly improbable inanities of the plot include a paralyzation technique performed by some jabs in the ribs, a young girl falling in love with her robber and rapist, a governess who moonlights as a murdering martial arts master and who has wanted posters of her image in many local hands but whom no one can recognize when at her day job, and a poison that supposedly makes the heart pump blood backwards. (What? It makes the heart valves turn around in the vessels? Yeah, right.)Perhaps the most disturbing dilusion is the ornate wardrobe and lavish residences in which these creatures of utter fantasy exist. Were the film to show the slightest resemblence to reality, the dire poverty of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, the utter filth and disease and death in which they live every day, would be shown.The one positive thing I can say about the film is that the writers for the English overdub were skilled at creating a phonemic pattern of English dialogue that matches somewhat closely the mouth movements of the actors speaking in Mandarin. The English is a creative expression of most of the concepts in the original tongue.	1.0	A Witless Waste of Time	2003-12-30	21	2	19

It has some good points like some great acting and a vaguely intriguing if somewhat drawn out storyline and it also had some bad points, notably some of the special effects which were nothing sort of pathetic (the flying scenes etc.) Its one of those films that you have to make your own judgement on but personally its not something that I'd watch again so rent before you buy!	3.0	Merely Average	2002-01-16	7	2	5
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1JJOV69MAU2J2	Steven Dennis	Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon looks great on DVD, with great sound and lots of interesting extras, including  fascinating interviews with Director Ang Lee and Michelle Yeoh (who looks and sounds far different in real life).The movie itself transcends the romance and martial arts genres with a mystical, magical fusion that is breathtaking.From the moment the actors fly over the first rooftops to the last final leap, the movie is mesmerizing, taking us into a fully realized vision of old China, and its martial arts gang underworld.The acting is first-rate, the cinematography revolutionary and the fight scenes weave tales of their own...This is Ang Lee's second masterpiece. Check out Sense and Sensibility for the other.	5.0	Modern classic, don't miss!	2001-08-15	4	2	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3U56M0Y8LYO6J	"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict"""	"Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is part-martial arts film, part-romance, and part-cinematic ballet.  It is a visionary work that is unique and endlessly graceful.The reunion between ill-fated lovers Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is disrupted by the theft of a sword called the Green Destiny.  The sword has been taken by the beautiful Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) who is determined to forsake her pampered existence.  Mu Bai's quest to recover the Green Destiny eventually leads to a showdown with the young thief and an old adversary from his past.Lee does a good job of examining the notion of romantic yearning through the characters of Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien and the notion of personal sacrifice in light of one's status through the character of Jen Yu.  Yet, it is the amazing acrobatics of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" that will catch your attention.  Your first impulse when you see the rooftop chase early in the film will be to guffaw at all the laws of modern physics that are being ignored.  At this point, you should suspend logic and embrace the special rules of Ang Lee's universe.  By doing so you will be able appreciate all the visual wonders that are on display later in the film.  Do not take ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" too literally and you will be privy to a rewarding viewing experience."	3.0	"""Sharpness is a state of mind."""	2006-12-29	2	1	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AZCBHPTWICPIW	Steve W	"I upgraded to Blu-ray from my well-worn DVD copy (the 2001 release).  I have not seen the previous Blu-ray release that came as part of the three-pack, so my comments below compare the stand-alone Blu-ray to the DVD.The Blu-ray transfer is a definite improvement over the DVD, though not to the degree of some other transfers I have seen.  Much of the film was shot ""soft"" by Ang Lee to cover for wire-work and, basically, to suit his own taste.  Those scenes remain soft on the new transfer. Not much if any of the grain has been removed and it occasionally flares up.  So while it doesn't provide the ""digital sharpness"" (for a lack of a better phrase) of many recent releases, it does present what the director intended and I don't list that as a fault.Black levels have improved and several scenes have had exposure levels altered (all for the better).  Coloring remains much the same as the DVD.  Most noticeably, the offensive random noise and dirt from the DVD release has been cleaned up.  That in itself is a good reason to upgrade.Sound is now in Dolby TrueHD and emphasizes the clash of swords a bit more but it is no huge improvement.  I've never listened to the English audio track so I don't know if that's changed at all, but the sub-titles have been reworked and that is good news.  It seemed easier to follow some of the plot nuances (like the master-pupil concerns) which I had to piece out over several previous viewings of the DVD.  Extras are the same with one addition, a commentary track by Peter Pau (cinematographer) which is worth listening to.Overall this is a definite improvement over DVD and fans should consider buying.  I always thought the DVD rushed and beneath Sony for a film that won so many Academy Awards; this is a good step up.  Oh, and Michelle Yeoh looks more gorgeous than ever in HD."	4.0	Comparing the 2010 stand-alone Blu-ray release to the original DVD	2010-07-27	28	26	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A23A0ERHVM4HS6	Stingaree	What is this?  Why is Hollywood so enamored with special effects and in this case having people fly through the air.  It all started with Matrix and now it's everywhere.  In this movie people are flying from tree to tree and jumping over buildings.  I mean if you can fly, you've pretty much mastered one of the things that has always limited man.  I would think there wouldn't be much to worry about after that.  I known the martial arts movies of the 70's were also unbelievable, but those were usually the bad ones and were described as such.  This one got rave reviews from the critics and it was annoying to watch.  Unless you like fairies flying through the air skip this peace of garbage and buy a true martial arts movie like Enter the Dragon or The Chinese Connection.	1.0	What the f...?	2004-12-17	41	3	38
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2JEONEOLE4FD2	"Subash S L ""slsubash"""	It is surprising how a movie like this can fool so many movie goers, the Academy and all the reviewers who have written rave reviews about this movie here on Amazon. I lived in Singapore for two years in the mid nineties and every other Chinese martial art movie telecast on TV showed the same old stupid flying acrobatics, bizzare and figment-of-your-imagination weapons, indefatigable fighters, body moves defying laws of physics and other such whimsical and ludicrous stuff.  They must have made a gazillion such movies (wonder if they'll ever stop making them) showing the same old rubbish over and over again to the point of nausea. Then, one of these movies makes it to the west and guess what? It takes home an Oscar for the best Foreign Language film! Give me a break! Maybe Ang Lee wanted to play a big joke on Hollywood and I can imagine him laughing at the end of it all. If you aren't sick and tired of the antics mentioned earlier go ahead and watch this film, otherwise save your precious time doing something else.	1.0	What a joke!	2004-05-28	20	5	15
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2R3JI8YFCAK90	Sueg	This is kind of a strange movie, its like a fantasy. This is about the old world of China. Were there was marshall arts and they were able to jump and fly on to builds and jump from roof to roof with ease. This is about a young girl that is going to get married soon and is wants live a little  before she marries. She gets shown this old sword that its killed a lot of people and still has the blood stains on it. She decides to steal it. Everyone she comes in contact with wants to fight her and she wins every fight. She falls in love with this one rebel and he falls for her. He takes her comb and she follows him and she really kicks his butt. After she falls for him, she tells him that they will meet again and that he is to keep her comb until then. Plus if he damages the comb, she will beat him and never let up. A lot of people want to see her dead, because she is so good. Her father finds her and he ends up dead. She is told to back and be with the one that loves her and she does. This is a movie that is very entertaining. I enjoyed it.	5.0	I liked this movie.	2014-05-27	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2OKOHYSNGCLX9	Su Niles	How can one NOT love this movie?  First of all, it is mystical, enigmatic and, at the same time, fierce and direct.  Second, Ang Lee has an incredible eye and sense of &quot;art&quot; that culminates in a film that leaves you feeling fed and still hungry.  Michele Yeoh turns in an exacting performance that conveys Lee's intention: A warrior and tradesperson who is confined by the mores of her culture and her place as a woman. She shows this with dignity while not shoving it into our faces. Again, Lee wows us with his artistic touch.  Third, CHOW YUN-FAT! How can anyone be indifferent to him???  In this film, he IS Li Mu Bai, a man filled with conflict, sadness and a knowledge of &quot;wasted time.&quot;  Yo Yo Ma brings out the China of the age with his cello, pouring the essence of Lee's film into my soul.  The film is poetry and prose on celluloid, with many layers and interpretations that viewers can decipher for themselves.

When I saw this movie in the theatres I knew it was a must-own.  The DVD is great for slowing certain action segments down to the frame by frame view.  Even if you are not used to the Hong Kong martial arts genre, as I am, you'll like the pace, the fighting, the plot, the strength of acting, and admire at least one of the main characters.  Additionally the backdrop and cinematography are exquisite.  And finally, if this matters to you, the subtitles are a far cry from previous Hong Kong film translations or dubbings (which are horrendous but funny).	5.0	Worth owning and reviewing	2001-07-02	0	0	0

Those who hate it, to you I say, &quot;well there are people who will hate anything that so many ppl love.&quot; You can dislike this movie if you want, but I for one am glad a film like this was recognized as it should have been. Which now shows a market for Chinese/Japanese films of this calibur for US theatres. Which quite frankly is its greatest achievment if nothing else. This movie will linger in your mind, and now you can watch it whenever you can. Its not THE BEST martial arts film ever, and its not THE BEST dramatic film ever, but its right up there with many of them. I'm not much for Wire Fighting but this movie does it well.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AMIOLJHCQHGBE	"T. A. Wauldron ""iamtoddicus"""	I loved the Matrix. It was incredible.  But this film, filled with heroes flying across rooftops, selfish princesses stealing legendary swords (the Green Destiny), and ageless revenge, stole my heart with it's undertows of lost love, Chow Yun Fat's and Michelle Yeoh's Jackie Chan martial arts moves, and honor bound caste situations. Anyone who has read my reviews knows I believe cinematography and soundtrack are huge for me. Director Ang Lee has poured both into the senses. The darkness of Peking's  alleyways to the brilliant greens of the bamboo forests create moods of mystery, and the walking on treetops reinforces the magic of the moment. This movie is touching, filled with action, and envelopes you. Watch this movie in the English version the first time. This way, you can enjoy the color and story of a legendary hero, his true love he cannot confess to, and the devestation that is wrought by a selfish girl bent on elevating herself above all for the sake of her own ego. The trailers did great justice to this movie. Not only did they expose the fantastic effects, they gave you the feeling of the entrapment involved in the ancient Chinese caste system. I will NOT ruin this movie by disclosing the dual `love lost' theme. Anyone who writes a review and gives away the plot of the movie should be hung. This film needs to be experienced without expectation. The atmosphere is completely mystical. The characters, a legendary swordsman, a female anti-hero who studied the martial arts for the goal of self destruction, a selfish princess and her lover from the past, are all the reader need know. Any more steals from the flow of the film. Recommendation of CTHD has to be taken on trust. The reward at the end is such sadness yet blessed with understanding. There is a quality about this film that is truly lacking in American movies. Watch this movie the first time, and you will understand. Watch it the second time, and your heart will be broken. This question I will leave you with...does she fly to her doom, or to the redemption of others? Trust me. I know this review is sparce, but I did it on purpose. This film is magic.

The flight scenes with the characters flitting around like Superman or Superwoman just left me absolutely cold. Maybe if they weren't running up vertical walls and on the ceiling or across the landscape with their feet moving it would have been a little more believable. I mean why move your feet when they aren't contacting anything half the time. Why not just wing it like Superman did. His flight scenes were much more realistic than this amateurish attempt. The plot is feeble at best involving the theft of a 400 yr. old sword that looks like something Captain Hook might have been carrying.Sorry, but in my opinion this film is HIGHLY over-rated.	2.0	BOOORRING	2001-06-15	6	2	4

It's a complicated story and the characters are compelling (and very well played).So much for the good part.The wire-fu is excessive and the accompanying music makes it seem more like a ballet than a kung fu movie.  I don't like ballet (modern dance, yes; ballet, no).The leading character (Jen Yu) is a spoiled brat who dishonours everyone she comes in contact with.  Even at the end, instead of cleaning up her wreckage she just flies away.  This is not a criticism of Zhang Ziyi or any of the other actors.  The desert sequence, which provides some useful background (but an extraneous subplot) is far too long and based on subsequent events does not cause Jen Yu to be more responsible.This is worth seeing once or twice, but not more than that.  At this point I can't get through the first 15 minutes.  It's a pity:  this could have been a great kung fu movie.	3.0	Beautiful film, but grating after a few viewings.	2013-04-03	0	0	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AILKC0JC2T7DR	"""thebritishazn"""	The fact is that with the limited length of a movie, not much was done to describe the characters back grounds. This left me confused sometimes even though i am Chinese. Also the plot is simple yet the makers of the movie managed to make it so confusing. If this story would have been made into a TV series, it would have provided the neccesary time for the character's background to be described more deeply. For example, the desert bandit had absolutely not connection with the plot at all save that he knew the princess. The princess was also a unecesary character and made the story quite confusing. However, if you are not concerned for the storyline, the fight choreography and the special effects were superb. It captured(also exaggerated) the power that a trained warrior could have for example balancing on a branch and floating on water, etc...  Also the music matched the scenes very well, especially in the fighting scenes. overall I would recommend watching it for the action which i found quite impressive.	3.0	would have been a great TV series.....	2001-09-01	1	1	0

But hey, I gotta tell it like I see it - and I've seen Crouching Tiger and I gotta tell you - it sucks donkeys.The Curmudgeon doesn't get sucked in by hype often, but I really was with this film. I read everywhere that it was basically the resurrection on film. So I bought it without ever seeing it. Last time I do that, then.Now, OK - the fight sequences. This is all people EVER talk about in this film, so I guess I should give first mention to it. They are VERY impressive, without a hint of CGI rubbish or blue screen. They look fantastic - and it's a crying, pitiful shame they weren't in a movie of more worth.Because let's face it - take away the jaw-dropping fighting scenes and what do you have? A dull, plodding tale of ""honour"" that's about as interesting as counting peas in a bag. And while we're on the subject, there was never any explanation as to WHY these fights were so spectacular. Ordinary village girl meets masked assassin guy, and suddenly they're running up trees and floating in the air. Did I miss something?And how to say this without sounding racist? Hmmm.. tough call but I'll try - the director really SHOULD have tried to make the characters more distinctive. Watching ""bald guy in pyjamas fighting other bald guy in pyjamas"" can be a bit confusing. Not saying they all look the same or anything but hells bells - give one of them a hat or something.Like I said, I know I'm going to catch it for this review, but it really is a perfect example of style over substance.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A38U2M9OAEJAXJ	The Groove	Beautifully photographed, well-acted period piece set in China.  To call this film a &quot;martial arts&quot; flick is really missing the point, as it also offers a very compelling love story that has none of the sap you'd find in other, lesser Hollywood films.  The DVD presentation is also solid, and it has both the original Mandarin language track, and an English dubbed track.  While the English dubbed track isn't the worst I've heard, you really don't want to watch the film this way.  Watching the film in its original Mandarin language with subtitles captures the full essence of the film.  If you really hate subtitles and don't want to spend 2 hours reading lines on a screen, then go for the English dubbed version, but the loss will be yours.  Otherwise, this is an exceptionally made film that richly deserved its 4 Academy Awards.	5.0	Great filmmaking!	2001-12-07	6	6	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A20TJ5P97W5MS1	The Inquisitor	"Where does the power lie? In the hands or in the sword? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a 2000 film directed by Ang Lee and featured a great cast including Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and Chang Chen.  This film works on multiple different levels. It is zen, thoughtful, and mediative.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will definitely take you to a certain place and time.  The scenery and atmosphere in this film are beautiful.  The story follows a weary warrior that decides to surrender his sword.  In an act of unforgivable defiance, the sword is stolen.  This action is disrespectful and unlawful.  The sword is called ""Green Destiny.""  The robbery sets off a chain of events that revolves around a young girl that is actually a misguided master. The warrior realizes that it is his destiny to not only retrieve the sword but also redirect & train the young girl. The young master's notions are driven by rebellion and love. She is a misguided loose cannon. Throughout her struggle to keep the sword she will learn about what she truly needs: discipline & self control.  This conflict will change the fate of all parties involved and no one will walk away unscathed.  This film is about the forces of evil:  internal & external.  It is part dream & part legend. The film itself was a huge success in the US and its impact still resonates.The name ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is a translation of the Chinese proverb which refers to the hidden talents that lie beneath the surface of an otherwise normal looking individual. This film also has many hidden gems. The process of watching this film and discovering what lies beneath the surface is a worthwhile adventure to take in, consider, and enjoy.Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind."	5.0	The Empire 5 Star 500 - #128	2012-12-02	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A33FA68V0NCM5E	TheIrrationalMan	&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is, without any equivocation, a dazzling martial arts picture which has somewhat revived a moribund genre. Kung fu films have, in general, undergone some considerable decline in recent years, with the exception of Hong Kong superstar Jet Li attempting to breath life into the stagnating line of formula-plotted bone-breaking fests. Credit must also go to Ang Lee for electing to do add a slightly innovative and unconventional touch to the genre. The cheesy dubbed dialogue (which translates poorly and hilariously) is jettisoned in favour of the original Chinese language subtitled into English, thus preserving the film's main saving grace, its culture. While mainstream kung fu afficionoados have grown weary of production-line plotlines generally involving the hero's lost mother/brother/pet goldfish, &quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; eschews all of these stereotypes and sets about creating a truly authentic atmosphere. Lee's directorial style, incorporating balletic action sequences, high-octane martial arts feats is a marvel, and every minute detail is captured with a lovingness that most directors simply lack. The fight sequences are stunningly choreographed and the &quot;flying&quot; episodes appear intriguing. While Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi's treetop battle has been, in my opinion, much overrated, an even more absorbing martial arts encounter was that between Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien and Ziyi's Jen. Both instances, both in the courtyard and the dojo are, quite unreservedly, the greatest martial arts displays ever captured on celluloid. Wo Ping's sequencing and choreography of the fight scenes is nonpareil, excelling even the work of the late, great Bruce Lee. The film is one of the best films ever made, devoted kung fu fans are strongly recommended to see it. Production standards (e.g. art direction, set design, costumes and cinematography) are all of the higest order.	5.0	Mesmeric martial arts epic	2001-07-30	11	9	2

Forget it.  I couldn't even watch the whole thing through without nearly falling asleep.  The sequences are ok but the flying is just ridiculous.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AU030W57J4BM5	the one who knows all	&quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; is a film unlike any foreign film I have ever seen. Before seeing it or reading any of the reviews, one could assume that it would be a typical kung fu movie with the poorly done voice overs and the bad story. It is not even in the least. This DVD features the original theatrical subtitle version as well as an extremely well done voice over version. The story is hands down one of the best of this year. It contains two love stories, martial arts choreographed from Yuen Wo Ping (For those of you who have seen &quot;The Matrix&quot; you know what I'm talking about), beautiful acting, and some of the best scenery that I have seen since the deserts in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Two great warriors (Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh) begin their new challenge when the 400 year old sword &quot;the Green Destiny&quot; is stolen. Zhang Ziyi plays an aristocrat who has a far away love and a strong temper. The film appears like it has extremely expensive special effects but the total cost of the film was 15 mil.  Now lets get to the DVD extras. This DVD features more extras than some of the &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVDs that only have a trailer and production notes. The film features commentary from director Ang Lee(The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility) and writer James Schamus, a Bravo making of special, a conversation with Michelle Yeoh, and the U.S. and International trailer(There are more but these are the best). Finally, some DVDs are exiting to get at first but after a few weeks get old. Let me tell you, this is not one of them. With a plethora of extras, great acting, awe inspiring fight sequences, and amazing directing, this is a must buy.	5.0	spectacular love story is original and breathtaking	2001-06-11	6	3	3

The disc is excellent, with many extras, including both the US and International Trailers, an interesting photo montage, and a feature with Michelle Yeoh, commenting on the film. We also get a director's commentary from Ang Lee, and a making of special.  The original Mandarin soundtrack  with english subtitles is retained(in 5.1 Dolby Digital), with the option to hear it in dubbed english if you so desire(the dubbing isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. ) As far as the movie itself, for those who have not seen it yet,  it is without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen...it is such a grand movie with much drama, and I feel it should have won best picture over Gladiator...it really was better.	5.0	One of the Best Films of All Time!	2001-06-06	4	3	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A22QTZ5F98PSBS	"""thezerg"""	I must say that this film was far different than anything I've ever seen in my life.  First off, I've never really watched many foriegn films, so that was a problem, but I also never really seen any Chinese or Japanese (except Anime) films.  So you can imagine my shock when seeing this film.  I like the attention to detail in the film and the awesome costumes used.  But what I also loved, was the amazing wire-work done in the film.  Sure I was suprised by the flying at first, but I soon became enveloped in the new style of film.  Sure, there were some people around me who were concealed and even snickered at their flying, but they obviously don't understand the Chinese culture.  The fighting (as to what kind, I'm unsure) in this movie was something to behold.  It was very fast and very well executed by these people.  This is what more movies should learn how to do, it was simply amazing. Lastly, I must compliment the music.  It was no Hans Zimmer, but that is why it is so great, because it is so different and so Chinese.  It is very interesting to hear this kind of music in a movie because it is not commonly used.  All in all, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has it all when it comes to this kind of film.  Sure, you may dismiss the flying and maybe the sometimes elaborate acts as too far fetched, but this is a fantasy film, not a real life film.  What would the world be like if we couldn't suspend disbelief?  My suggestion is that you get this film right away when it comes out, because this is truly a film like no other.	5.0	A Fantasy Film with great Power	2001-03-25	4	4	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A30OXD42ZFYZLO	Thomas Keneally	Ang Lee's movie was one of the most beautiful of the year. Granted that it was unrealistic with people flying and martial arts, but it was captivating and artistic. The majesty and grace of the main actors was superb. In many ways it was more beautiful than Gladiator. That movie had so many flaws starting from the way Marcus Aurelius chooses his successor. While a lot of people downgraded this movie, some of the greatest writers have never been understood in their own country. This includes writers such as Nadine Gordimer, Coetzee and so on. So the chinese not liking it is not an end all. People saying that Rush Hour is better than this shows how little they understand the movie. This is more than a martial arts movie, it combines martial arts, fantasy and medieval storyline into a well crafted story. Though the storyline is thin, it is well done. Chou Yun Fat does a fantastic job in his role. As for people saying that it shows people living in lavish lifestyle while China has so much poverty, well this is not about this century. China had one of the best civilizations and a lot of in those times like governers could live well. It is sad that people do not understand fantasy. Comparing this movie to any Jackie Chan movie is a travesty as those as simplistic.	5.0	Unusual movie, people do not understand the fantasy	2004-09-03	6	4	2

That is the films greatest and biggest flaw, it is so amazing that its hard to comprehend and one can leave the cinema feeling a tad unfulfilled, yet if you watch this dvd with an open mind it cannot fail to impress. A few minor gripes are the use of subtitles, it is more authentic but it can become bothersome having to read throughout the 3 hour epic. the plot is also rather convolutd so make sure that you are paying attention. A special mention must go to the fight sequences which have truly surpassed the matrix in every way possible.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3SBVTRU7301II	"Thomas Yan Ong ""feilung888"""	First time I saw &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; was in the movie theaters. I had very high expectations for the movie. I didn't mind the Chinese (Mandarin) dialog, since I am Chinese, and it's always better than the poor English dubbed movies. It was a beautiful film with lots of stunning sceneries of China. It gives the movie a sense of mysticism that kung fu period films of recent years usually have, which is a must. When the first fight scene came on, with Jen (Zhang Zi-Yi) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), I thought it was going to be one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen... it wasn't the best, but it was very good. There were loads of awesome moments, with the cool spinning kicks, jumping around the buildings, and other such action, but some of the flying around I thought looked a tad unrealistic. There was one particular part where Shu Lien collided with Jen when they where running on the wall, I thought they could of made that scene a little better. But I had to hand it to Yeoh and Zhang, it was a hard scene to shoot. All the other fight scenes were better in exception to the first fight with Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei). I do not know if Cheng studies kung fu, but in the movie, with all due respect, she didn't look too convincing. Li Mu-Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) was good, knowing this is his first kung fu movie ever. Chow's acting was strong, but I think Jet Li would of been a better Li Mu-Bai because of what Jet Li is capable of doing physically. I'm not sure if it's true or not, but I've heard that Jet Li was suppose to play Li Mu-Bai, but turned it down because of his promise to his wife Nina. Anyway, the dramatic elements was a good touch for the movie and new to this genre. Overall the movie was very well made and a delight to watch. It was a good movie, which gets better after more viewings, but it does not live up to the hype that most American audiences give it. Mainly because as a Chinese movie viewer, I've seen it done before, as far as the action scenes, and I don't really see anything new. I still liked the fight choreography done by the master of fight choreographies, Yuen Woo-Ping. I am glad that this movie got the exposure that it did in America, hopefully the American audience can see more of the beauty of Chinese culture in future Chinese movies theatrically released in the US. If you want to see other great period kung fu films in recent years, check out these titles: &quot;Tai Chi Master&quot; (aka &quot;Twin Warriors&quot;), &quot;Swordsman II&quot;, &quot;Wing Chun&quot;, &quot;Once Upon A Time In China&quot; series, &quot;Drunken Master II&quot; (aka &quot;The Legend Of Drunken Master&quot;), &quot;The Last Hero Of China&quot; (aka &quot;Deadly China Hero&quot;), &quot;New Legend Of Shaolin&quot;, &amp; &quot;Fong Sai Yuk&quot; series (aka &quot;The Legend&quot; series).

It was beautiful. . .gorgeous costumes, beautiful scenery, beautiful people. . . .but I honestly was pretty bored.

One of my favorite scenes would have to be the restaurant fight where all those &quot;big&quot; men get their tails whipped by this young princess with supernatural abilities.

Star Wars takes 3 movies to have as many scenes of incredibly duelling action and intense emotion.  That's not to belittle the story or the movies, but it is stretched out.  If, like me, you consider the Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker storyline to be the key to those films, you realize how well the story is developed but also how slowly.  Well this film VERY quickly, and with great subtlety builds up the same sort of drama and presents some of the most mystical and wonderful scenes in just 2 hours.  Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are fantastic and hopefully cement their ability to be in major Hollywood releases.  Meanwhile Zhang Ziyi makes a stunning appearance as well.  It's been a long time since such a film came out and captured so many imaginations.  I think while many films will not stand the test of time, this is right up there with the Star Wars trilogy, Vertigo, and true classics.  I'm glad to say I was around when this came out.

I would actually give it 3 and a half stars, but I had to choose either three or four, so it gets three (obviously, I don't consider it a masterpiece. For a masterpiece, you need to see some select Sammo Hung films- more on that later). I have noticed that many of the people who praise this film have never really seen any other Hong Kong style films, so I thought I would give some background on some of the things in the movie that will help them make more 'sense'.1) The flying- Hong Kong martial arts films have a LOT of wirework these days, and even back before wires were used extensively, martial artists were depicted as doing things that Americans would consider ridiculous (like skimming across the surface of a lake by running fast, or jumping over a 40 foot wall). This is totally accepted in Hong Kong cinema, its not that they think it could really be done, its just part of their film culture to accept these feats as normal in a kung fu movie.2) The importance of the sword and the training manual- Seeking a special weapon or training manual to defeat the movie's villian is a plotline that has been used countless times in Hong Kong kung fu movies. Again, its part of the film culture, really. Obviously, you aren't expected to reason it through (like, ""how could she learn kung fu that good just from a book?""). Just accept it.3) The tragedy- HK kung fu films have a long history of incorporating sacrifice and tragedy into their main themes. The Chinese kung fu hero is supposed to be self-sacrificing, putting their own happiness second to everyone else's. Even more importantly, their sense of honor (different from the American idea of honor) must come first, not their own happiness. Americans like their heroes brash and mouthy, the Chinese like them noble and sacrificing.A few more points. NONE of the actors (with the exception of Michelle Yeoh) have any kung fu training. Chow Yun Fat did mostly gunplay movies, and Zhang Ziyi has a dance background. This is the reason for the extreme editing during the fight scenes- its to cover for the skills weakness of the actors. This is a trend in modern Hong Kong- where martial art movies used to have real martial artists in them, now they have boy-band members with NO martial arts training in them. Not a good thing.Jade Fox is played by Chang Pei Pei, a legendary Hong Kong actress who appeared in many swordplay films in the '60's (Incidently, she also had no kung fu training).There is no comedy in this film. The vast majority of Hong Kong kung fu movies contain comedy, it just depends on how much. We are talking really stupid slapstick lame humor, simply because that is what Chinese audiences tend to prefer. Thankfully, Crouching Tiger avoided any silliness and focused on the drama.Many kung fu styles are named after animals (Crane style, Mantis style, Monkey style), and this plays a large part in Chinese martial art lore. Referencing animals to describe martial artists (ie- Bruce Lee = ""Little Dragon"") and situations in the Chinese martial arts world is common, and the title of the movie should make more sense if you understand that.One final point is the concept of the ""boxer's world"" or the 'martial arts world' in Hong Kong cinema ('boxer' is the closest word to what the Chinese use to describe a martial arts practitioner). The 'boxer's world' concept doesn't have a Western equivilent concept, and is a little hard to describe. Its basically that if you devote your whole life to martial arts and the pursuit of perfection in it, you have no time for 'real world' type of living. Its almost as if you have two different worlds coexisting: the regular world where the regular people exist, and the boxer's world, where the serious martial artists exist. In addition, all boxers wish to be the best, and challenge each other to secure a position in the heirarchy of the boxer's world. In Crouching Tiger, Chow Yun Fat's character is a boxer trying to quietly retire from the boxer's world.If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger, I would urge you to explore kung fu cinema further. It is generally excepted that the best kung fu movies were produced in Hong Kong during the late '70's and very early '80's. If you are interested in viewing an old school kung fu movie (no real wirework, REAL martial artists, INCREDIBLE kung fu choreography and nice long takes (not choppy MTV-style editing to cover lack of fighting skills), I would recommend you pick up Warriors Two, starring Sammo Hung. This is one of the BEST kung fu movies ever made, and it is available through Amazon (it is distributed by Fox) and is VERY affordable. Just one word of warning, there is some humor in this movie (Sammo never made one without humor), but it is minimal by Hong Kong standards, and doesn't get in the way of the story and the incredible kung fu action."	3.0	From a long-time Hong Kong kung fu film fan:	2005-12-13	7	6	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ALN0TTRTLHA4E	"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick"""	This is one strange film. It is basically a Kung Fu epic using swords instead of fists which has been an enormous hit not only with the general public but with critics all around the world. This is despite a plot which is fantasy, action scenes which are Bruce Lee and enough holes in the plot to sink the Titantic.Despite all that it is a film that you can't help but love. One of the main assets is the incredible attractiveness of the main players. The basic plot revolves around a young woman who is an accomplished warrior. She is one of the more stunning actors unearthed in some time. The two older principles are also stars with immense screen prescence.One of the great strengths of the film apart from this is the beauty of the photograpy and the scence creation. Each scene is absolutely visually stunning and wonderfully set up. When one speaks to people who have seen the film they will talk about the battle on the tree tops or the scene at the end in the gorge. It is difficult to think of any recent film which has been so visually stylish.All in all one of the more impressive and	5.0	Unique	2002-01-03	4	3	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A5J1V0U9JW3YI	Tom Slick43	"This review is based on the differences between the standard DVD disc and the Superbit version only.  Based on that, I recommend that you save your money and get the standard version.  You'll get more features, while barely losing any audio or video quality, which is the whole reason for buying a Superbit disc in the first place.  I've watched this movie on my 40"" LCD Sony XBR BRAVIA (720 dpi), an OPPO upscaling DVD player, and 5.1 sound system, and for this movie, I didn't see any perceivable difference in video quality from the standard version.  So unless they're selling this Superbit version for 10 bucks or less (which seems to be the trend since Superbit discs may become moot now that HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs are starting to come out), I'd recommend getting the standard version of this movie, which sells for about 10 bucks at the major electronic retailers."	2.0	get the standard version	2006-11-03	9	7	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3C2LLCBYDRQUD	Tom Wagner	I'll assume that you can get an idea of what this movie about from one of the 700 other reviews on Amazon, so let's talk about the Superbit version.What You Get:Superbit dispenses with all the DVD extra features, and devotes the extra bits to the video and audio. What remains is the movie, Dolby and DTS soundtracks (in Mandarin *only*), and subtitles in several languages. NOTE: there is *NO* English audio track on the Superbit version of this DVD!! That means that, unless you speak Mandarin Chinese, you're relegated to watching subtitles, which I found distracting.How It Works:Since there are no extra features, the bits no longer devoted to extra features can be used to create a version of the movie with more data. Since DVDs use lossy compression for both video and audio, a DVD with more data devoted to the movie should require less compression. That means that extremely fine details should be rendered more clearly, and the soundtrack should be cleaner.Is It Better?Well yes, but not to the degree that I would have expected. At the beginning of Chapter 9, when Jen is doing calligraphy, you can clearly see the texture of the paper she is writing on. Also, the desert scenes in Chapter 18 show more contrast and better color saturation. I would have expected the audio track to be greatly improved, since it's the weakest part of DVD technology (especially when compared to Laserdisc). There was virtually no difference from the standard release in detail or soundstaging that I could detect - too bad.Is It Worth It?On this movie, no. CTHD is beautifully filmed, and the standard version of this movie gives you a very good transfer. The audio track is about the same, and the lack of an English audio track is a major drawback - which actually knocks it down to only 4 stars.	4.0	Superbit Just a Bit Better	2001-10-17	6	6	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ABT7GLR9YN907	"""tony888"""	This film is one of the greatest movies ever made. I rarely ever watch a movie more than once, but I have already seen this one 3 times in 4 days. Twice in Mandarin and once dubbed in English. Yes, I think it's that good. With superb acting, breathtaking fight sequences, and a touching story, this is why we we all watch movies in the first place. But this film isn't simply watched, it is &quot;experienced&quot;. Director Ang Lee does an excellent job of making the viewers feel as if they are actually in the movie. We feel the unspoken love between Li Mu Bai(Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien(Michelle Yeoh) and also the youthful exhuberant love between Jen Yu(Zhang Ziyi) and Lo(Chang Chen). We are placed right in the center of ancient China with beautiful art direction and scenery, and we have a front row seat to all of the fight scenes with clever camera angles. Lee's depiction of The Green Destiny sword is equally impressive. At first glance the beautifully decorated sword appears to be weak and bends at the slightest touch, but when it's used in battle it seems to be unstoppable.The fight sequences are especially impressive in that they are not just mindless martial arts fighting. You will see a big difference in the fight scenes of Crouching Tiger and the fight scenes of other martial arts films. Punches and kicks are fast and fluid, and the fighting is more dramatic in that it also reveals the characters' emotions. Jade Fox fights with anger, Jen with youthful confidence, and Yu Shu Lien with mature grace. I'd say this movie puts the &quot;art&quot; in martial arts. As usual, Yuen Wo Ping, best known in the U.S. for his work on The Matrix, has done some amazing fight choreography. I'd rate this up there with one of his other works, Tai Chi Master(Twin Warriors).The music in Crouching Tiger is beautiful and fits each scene perfectly. Whether it's the fast drums during a fight, or the slow cello sounds during an emotional scene, the music never seems out of place. The combination of Tan Dun's musical compositions and Yo-Yo Ma's cello solos have made me want to go out and buy the soundtrack as well.With such an amazing film, it's surprising it only took $15 million to make. Now that I've finally seen this movie, I'm also suprised it did not clean house at the Oscars. Gladiator was a wonderful movie, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an epic masterpiece. Steven Soderbergh did an excellent job with Traffic, but Ang Lee is the definition of filmmaker and has raised the bar for every other director.This DVD is loaded with extras including interviews with some cast members, a special &quot;making of&quot; segment, a lengthy photo montage that plays with all the music from the movie in the background, and detailed filmographies of all the main cast. However, I would recommend you watch the movie before you watch any of the extras because some of the interviews give away important parts of the story. If I had one complaint about this DVD, it would be that the dubbing is only above average. However, it is significantly better than the dubbing of most Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies, and I thought the voice they chose for Jen Yu fit her character very well. Most people would probably watch both versions(dubbed and subtitled) anyway, so this really isn't that big of an issue.I would recommend this movie even if you are not a big martial arts fan like me. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is so much more than just another martial arts flick. It is love, romance, drama and action all combined into one film. To use the words of Ang Lee, this movie is &quot;Sense and Sensibility with martial arts.&quot;	5.0	Simply a Masterpiece!	2001-06-06	4	4	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1YZXL63E1HS0J	Tony Young	This was classic oriental epic story telling.  The fact that some people may have found it complex (boring) probably has to do with the intricate manner of the story telling. Within one plot and story line there are various sub-plots and stories.  The best example that comes to mind is the nature of the sword being woven into the nature of Jen's relationship with Lo and the other characters. For an interesting read that best demonstrates the qualities of this story-telling style, one must read &quot;SAN KUO CHIH YEN-I&quot; or &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.  The similarity of these styles is awesome in that though someone may feel that they are reading/watching something mindless, one is drawn in to a story and hours pass by amazingly fast.

The poised and self-assured Li can handle anything -- except his feelings for lithe, pantherish Yu Shu Lien. Jen Yu, the tremulous and spoiled daughter of the Province's governor, is also fascinated by Shu Lien's glamorous life: that a woman can have so many adventures and such freedom is marvelous to her. Though the refined Jen is soon to be married off into respectability, she harbors a sinister plan. By night she transforms into a masked and cunning thief, out to steal the Green Destiny, an invincible blade once wielded by Li.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2J9COKR9JAZUQ	"Trey David Wood ""The Sleeper Must Awaken"""	In my early teens, I was introduced to Asian cinema by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which I saw at the theater with my family. Before this, I had only watched a few Bruce Lee movies, which of course contained some excellent fight sequences thanks to Lee, not to mention that they were simply wildly entertaining due to the spectacle of watching a talented man at the peak of his craft practically tearing people apart with lightning-fast movements to the accompaniment of hideously upbeat 70's music. Even so, they were less than artful B-movies and so they did not fully prepare me for the majestic and wonderful experience of seeing a real Asian masterpiece like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The movie is well-paced and the acting and dialogue are superb.  Each character is fully realized and has nearly palpable motives and concerns, which serves to draw the viewer completely into the story.  Even the flashback sequence that takes up a large portion of the middle of the movie does not become tedious, which to me is quite impressive from a writer's standpoint.There are two romantic stories in this movie that are opposites of each other; one is hardly acknowledged and has been growing with slow tenderness for many years, whereas the other is a passionate, tumultuous fling with an uncertain outcome.  The contrast between the expressions of love and the difference between the couples is very interesting and engaging to watch, and it seems to me that even the back and forth between courtly pleasantries and fight scenes serves as a parallelSpeaking of the fight scenes, they are not brutal or bloody, but they are very well choreographed and exciting to watch.  It's more like a kind of martial ballet, each participant gracefully attacking and dodging with surprising rapidity.  The only complaint I have is that the wire-work used to give them a gliding or flying ability does not seem as carefully implemented as I have seen elsewhere--they have a listless buoyancy at times that remind me of watching wirework during a stage production, where it's very obvious that the characters are suspended somehow.  Even so, the movie is so well done otherwise the dodgy wirework is easily overlooked.As to the plausibility of their being able to fly in the first place, there is no reason to criticize the movie for what is obviously a mythological aspect.  In the orient, the idea of martial artists with such transcendent abilities is as common as wizards and elves in the West. It's merely a cultural distinction in the mythology.  Recognize that simple fact and there is no reason to become indignant over it.In closing, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys both excellent film making and martial arts, and it may even be surprisingly enjoyable to those who would otherwise avoid movies where there is a lot of fighting.  As the characters have achieved a state of transcendent ability, so has this movie managed to transcend beyond its genre limitations.(Also, let me add that the blu-ray picture of this movie is serviceably good, although since it's a bit older it may not be the best reference movie for showing off your flatscreen.  Even so, still a beautiful film.)	5.0	A cross-cultural masterpiece.	2011-01-20	4	4	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2HEEGQG3H1ZL8	T. Stanley	Just like thousands upon thousands of people have said this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie has set the standard for martial arts fantasy and fighting movies in general. Crouching Tiger introduces us to a great cast of characters with only one of them being an international star to start with. The plot is fairly complex and the movie altogether presents a huge setting than spans from forests to deserts and mountains. The only thing that I have already witnessed and continually worry about is fight scenes in movies being performed with wires. It was amazing and inovative to see it in Crouching Tiger but now it seems that every movie that contains fight scenes has to make use of wire contraptions to aid them. Will there come a time when no movies will be without the use of wire aperature fighting.....? I guess I can always count on Jackie Chan for his pure style of fighting and stunts.I was disapointed when watching this that people in the audience laughed when the characters flew.  They were all shouting and laughing saying it was really fake.  But who laughed when Superman flew????  I bet you nobody.  They were in awe as they should have been while watching Crouching Tiger.  This is not reality, it is a fantasy world in which anything is possible.	5.0	Setting the Standard	2001-09-29	2	2	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2SGUJX38PZJWR	"""txarchitekt"""	If you like Amercian action this is where it is at. This movie takes the ideas (myths and martial arts) of the Asian world and wraps them up into action sequences that rivals that of The Matrix. Though this movie is not thought of as highly in Asian countries because of conficts of cultural and mythical value, within the U.S. it's sheer artfullness is enough to get past such views (when in fact the American public has no idea the basis of a crouching tiger or hidden tragon). This movie is full of amazing actions shots though a director's eye that is none less than that of a genious. This is one of the most artfully made movies ever put on the big screen, and this remains true because it doesn't base it's flair on the action alone, but on a musical score that is not only beautiful but that compliments every movement of every actor. The acting itself is almost emotionless at times, rendering parts of the movie less dynamic and at few times poor, but that can only be expected from a country who gives no training or good money to their actors. For americans this won't matter because of the translational barrier of the two languages. even with the caption you don't get a true sense of converstion, just bits of text one after another. i suggest watching it with the original language and no captions...this gives you the true effect the director wanted with the artfullness of a beautiful language adding an almost second score of music throughout the movie.

It sparks a lot of interest for reasons that I don't understand; aside from the fact that it has green trim on the blade, it is just another one of the hundreds of weapons used in this disgrace of a movie.The opening of this sorry excuse for a motion picture didn't lead me to believe that it would end up being as bad as it was. It started with a detailed sort of environment and a young girl wandering the neighborhood between her family, learning about her ancestors and about the green sword, which is the first sword we see in the film. After a while, everybody is in some Chinese desert hustling and bustling at each other on horses. Eventually, the woman meets a stranger and goes between getting acquinted with him and trying to kill him. The martial arts scenes were impressive and fast paced, but I didn't care for them after it was an old lady taking on 3 men and when a mother fought her daughter. Chow Yun Fat did do a good job in most aspects of this, which is the only major reason I'm giving this more than one star.	2.0	Mediocre at Best	2001-06-19	12	3	9

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1DE58PW3Q6BWZ	Ve Yin Mark Tee	"A routine mission to return Li Mu Bai's (played by Chow Yun Fatt) 400-year-old sword embroils the female warrior ""Shu Lien"" (Michelle Yeoh) in the machinations of ""Jade Fox"", an old enemy of Mu Bai's.  At the centre of this triangle is ""Jen"" (Zhang Ziyi) who has the potential, under the right guidance (Mu Bai's of course), to reach the very highest level of martial arts mastery.  Jen, unfortunately, already has a teacher....Ang Lee's return to his Far Eastern origins strikes all the familiar notes of ""Wuxia"":  scenic battles on rooftops, in dodgy taverns, on water and among bamboo groves.  As usual -- at least according to current permutations of the genre in Hong Kong -- it features women of remarkable skill in roles both beneficial and malevolent to the male protagonist.  The film is an astute exploitation of the emerging prominence in Hollywood of Chow and Yeoh.  Yeoh, for example, is the only real martial artist in the film and so -- rather wisely -- she is given the most demanding fight sequences:  the use she makes of the entire range of Chinese weaponry is not something one could master on set in a few months.  As for Chow, who never acts in Wuxia films, all he has to perform -- again wisely -- is a few striking poses with lots of cinematic cuts in between.While the action sequences are good, I've definitely seen better from the genre.  The die-hard Wuxia fan will also complain at the film's evident kowtowing to North American film conventions:  the kind of romanticised love between Jen and her ""barbarian"" boyfriend being a case in point.  Considering the director's earlier Far Eastern excursions, he could have perhaps pushed the dark side of the film a tad further towards the cutting edge by suggesting a lesbian relationship between Jen and Jade Fox... but all in all it remains a competent and entertaining effort."	4.0	After Bruce Lee...	2002-02-17	1	1	0
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3G515RA5ZXR3B	Victor Drysel	To try and describe Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would be a hard thing to do.  I can say, however, that this movie has it all.  Spectacular stunts and beautiful coreography that rivals the Matrix (although these two films had some of the same people working for them).  But what makes this film great is the directing and the story it tells.  Ang Lee is a legend for telling a true story.  His movies the Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility were magnificent.  In my opinon, this is his best.  Another important item is the actors you get.  Lee chose stars like Chow Yun-Fat (Replacement Killers) and Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies), both wonderful action stars.  People will like this movie.  Whether you are an action fan, a drama fan, or just like a good movie.  Check this out, you won't be dissapointed.	5.0	A Breathtaking Masterpiece	2001-04-15	11	9	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A12RPD9TU807L4	victor	This movie has taken all the good points of martial arts/chinese mythology films and successfully used them to make a statement.Firstly, this was not a romance film, it is an alegory.The movie used a delightfuly straightfoward but unpredictable &quot;gotcha&quot; plot, with a background of many fresh, non-cliche, sequences of martial arts expressionism. Going one better, the movie even showed the aftermath of one salloon brawl (a minor point, but interesting for its thoughtfulness).Between the two relationships in the film, three if you count the unwanted marraige, I have read a few reviews here on Amazon by people who were disappointed that there wasn't enough development. But this film is not about romance, or couples, it is a brilliant expressionist essay on being true to yourself.Absolutely brilliant.(It sounds like somebody was upset that the english version didn't match the chinese-speaking actors. The DVD allows you to use subtitles.)	5.0	Absolutely beautiful film, briliantly capturing a theme	2001-06-28	0	0	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3SMT15X2QVUR8	"Victoria Tarrani ""writer, editor, artist, des..."	It is rare when a foreign language film has the ability to grab the attention of my fifteen-year-old nephew and me, but this movie is extraordinary.  We read the subtitles and did not feel like we were missing any details -- only that a world had suddenly been opened for us to view.Since we saw this film, we have discussed it and persuaded others to experience this enchantment.  Every so often we talk about this movie and plan to see it many more times.  This DVD should be shown in wide-angle format in order to see all of the majesty captured on cellulose.The script creates a perfectly logical connection between fantasy and reality, logic and irrationality,  and mythology and truth.  This flow makes it easy to suspend disbelief and be completely entrapped within the breathtaking beauty and fierce fights of the movie.Yun-Fat Chow is Li Mu Bai, and he displays a spiritual countenance that is the center of a true martial arts master.  His life has been in service and honor toward the sword *The Green Destiny.*  The complexities of his life and his choices are only a background for the intricacies of romance, tragedy, heroism, and philosophy that are woven with precise skill and art throughout this astonishing movie.Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) and Zhang Ziy (Jen) become acquaintances, then friends, then sisters, and finally enemies.  The transitions are created by the strong will of the young princess (Zhang) who ultimately learns the value of friendship, but at great cost.  She is well trained in the ninja arts by Li Mu Bai's ancient arch nemesis.  This training is significant because rivals do tend to reveal the inadequacies of their opponents while assuring their young students with victory.The action scenes are stimulating and plausible though the stunts are physically impossible -- or so it seems.  What is most amazing is that these impossible stunts were real!  The actors did the scenes, perhaps stunt doubles for some, though I doubt it because of Ang Lee's determination for accuracy.  When the warriors fly through the air, fight on the sides of building, chase across the rooftops, or fight high in the bamboo trees they did exactly that.  These were not created through simulation and the magic of technology.After the scenes were filmed then the digital artists worked to remove the equipment that helped the actors complete the feats.  The visions of China and the exciting ninja action captured my imagination.Ang Lee required the actors to learning to speak Mandarin Chinese.  The language accuracy may not seem important to those of us who do not speak Chinese, but it is the difference between cultures within China.  I was left with the feeling that I had spent time in a sacred place.Throughout the film there is the artistry of the music.  Segments will take you to dreamland while other sequences will cause a rush of adrenaline.  It is as if you are riding on a magic carpet -- you are there.I purchased two DVDs -- one for me and one for my nephew -- *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* is that good.It is better than five stars for the director (Ang Lee), cinematography, choreography, film editing, script, actors, action, philosophy, and emotions.  This movie won Best Picture in the Foreign Language category at the Academy Awards; and it deserved the honor.	5.0	Enjoy the art, beauty, and spirituality of China.	2001-04-14	56	50	6

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3DCUVHQ4H9E59	"""vteggroll"""	I read the review of smokingbear where he attacks the authenticity of the film, starting from the fact that most actors are not native Mandarin speakers to the Taiwanese guy that plays the Turkic horseman from Xinjian (by the way, I take offense to your calling Taiwanese-spoken Mandarin &quot;sissy&quot;).  Like most epics from historical periods, it's practically impossible to satisfy so-called &quot;historians,&quot;  mostly when there is a short supply of world-reknowned Mandarin speaking actors/actresses.I totally disagree with his belief that the plot is weak.  Ang Lee (who is Taiwanese and studied at NYU) has a knack for blending Eastern and Western qualities in his films.  Being half-Taiwanese and half American, I can appreciate both aspects.  The film is not traditional in the sense of Chinese storytelling and it cannot be concretely categorized into any genre.  I wouldn't compare it to an &quot;American Chinese Restaurant&quot; like smokingbear however.  It is made to be accessible to western viewers, however it is by no means watered down.  It is more of a fusion rather than being made merely to appeal to American tastes.I feel the Western style of storytelling lended the film a softer, more human quality than what you would find in traditional Chinese stories.  It gives the viewer insight into the forces acting upon the psyches of the characters.  The conflict of Confucian obligation and human urges is a good example.  The viewer becomes more emotionally involved with the characters this way.Of course, if you're a member of the genre police, you wouldn't appreciate the movie quite as much.	5.0	Western influenced, but clearly Asian	2001-04-29	5	4	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A14RVP4U2NR8BJ	"Wade D. Haynes ""postmodern_pundit"""	Let me begin by expressing my utter amazement at the artwork in this film.  From the beautiful sets and incredible special effects to the consummate acting, brilliant direction and wonderful storyline, I must say that movies of this caliber are very rare.  It succeeds on all levels: it is action-packed yet well-paced, dramatic and humorous; it is both a love story and an epic adventure.  Admitting that my knowledge of the Wuxia genre is somewhat limited, I would still venture to say that the fight scenes in this film are some of the best (at least that I have seen) committed to celluloid. The fight scenes come across as both poetic and energizing, like a ballet with sharp and dangerous weapons.  If you are looking for a slapstick Jackie Chan-esque martial arts fun-fest in the vein of Drunken Master, this IS NOT your movie. It does have its fun moments but the humor is much more sublime, with a dazzling wit that never seems out of context.  All this being said, I would like to focus on the DVD itself, that is its features.  The audio is superb, with both the English dub AND original Mandarin presented in a well-mixed 5.1.  The dialogue is well-integrated with the action and score, with little need to constantly adjust the volume.  The picture is pristine and quite frankly, among the cleanest I have ever seen on DVD.  There is some interesting commentary and an informative making-of featurette, but the thing that most impressed me was the English dub. I noticed one reviewer here who indicated interest in this DVD because it contained an English dub that might be funny to watch like other martial arts films.  Well, I'm sorry to say that said reviewer will be sorely disappointed if he's looking for laughs in that department.  Unlike many films of the genre the dub is almost flawless.  The fluidity of the English language allowed the producers of this DVD to manipulate sentence structure so that the English dialogue synchs perfectly with the actors' lips, yet still stays true to its content.  Of course, I would always recommend the original Mandarin with English subtitles, but for those of you who despise subtitles (shame on you!) will still be able to enjoy this movie with minimum distraction from the dubbing.  Altogether, I found the DVD release to be a wonderful complement to this beautiful film.  If you have not done so already, buy this one.  You will not regret it.	5.0	Beatiful Film, Great DVD!	2001-06-11	16	13	3

I didn't have any problems with suspending my disbelief and getting into the film, but overall I didn't think it was anything special. Just a good entertaining movie that in my opinion was wildly overpraised.If you haven't seen this film yet, go ahead; you'll probably enjoy it but don't believe all the hype.I might rent this but it will not become a part of my permanent collection.	3.0	Entertaining but wildly overpraised	2001-04-06	20	7	13

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3D7KQ7Z3PQRHD	"Waylon Piercy ""Vaya con monstros!"""	I first saw &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; months ago when it was first released, and was stunned for the duration. For hours afterward, I could hardly think of anything else. This magnificent film is an emotionally draining experience, but worth every minute. The fight scenes-- I hesitate to call them &quot;fight scenes,&quot; as that description hardly does them justice-- are indescribably beautiful, and magnificently choreographed by master Yuen Wo-Ping. Many people unfamiliar with Chinese film regard &quot;The Matrix&quot; as the pinnacle of action choreography, and &quot;CT,HD&quot; is hard evidence that this is not so. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a fine film, but the balletic battles of &quot;CT,HD&quot; are far beyond anything that film achieves. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; has become my second-favorite film of all time; my all-time favorite is &quot;Casablanca,&quot; so that should give you an idea of the distinguished company this film can keep.  From the very first chord of Tan Dun's magnificent score, &quot;CT,HD&quot; is an enthralling cinematic experience. The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat and the ever-delightful Michelle Yeoh, along with the captivating Zhang Ziyi, make up one of the most incredible casts I've ever seen.  Keep in mind that I've seen several thousand films, ranging from &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; to &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; to &quot;Hello, Dolly,&quot; and beyond those. &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; has a well-deserved place among the very best of them, and will stand as an all-time classic.	5.0	This film has a place among the very finest ever made!	2001-07-15	10	8	2

As far as I am concerned it won an academy award for Worst Picture.  It just goes to show how poorly the academy awards are at choosing movies.  There must have been some Bejing connection there, kind of like giving Bill Clinton an award for honesty and integrity. No story line, if there was it was so poor it was barely noticable.  Impossible to believe flying fighters? Reality is what separates movies from cartoons.  I suppose the flying was the biggest giveaway, people just don't do that and even if these people had wings on them it wouldn't have made it any more believeable.  Overall, an insult to the intelligence.  Of course in China it doesn't take much to entertain.  They watch American movies even though they don't understand anything about them.  Can you imagine the Chinese trying to understand one of the inner city black movies they make today?  I'll watch it again just to make sure my assessment is correct though, but throughout the movie I kept waiting for the story line to unfold.  It never did.	1.0	Don't Waste Your Time	2001-06-24	19	4	15

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3ADW6ME4ROSIC	Whisper	For those of you that might cast this movie in the pits of hell, there is one thing you are obviously missing. Culture. Our culture is so fallen away from God, (who is the source of our country to begin with, and I could get on that for about an hour) that we have no values let in society. Look around. Moms and dads let their children shoot people because they do not have the simple dicipline to keep them out of reach. God is written in the constitution (look that up too), as he was the reason we founded this country. From Him, we have values, moral standards, and education. But, we have fallen away as I stated. In other cultures, they are highly in tune to their values, morals, and education. Why do you think they beat us at everything?  You may be wondering why I am speaking so strongly in the favor of this movie? Well, simple. Culture. In East Asia, they do everything because of it. I know because I was there. I learned the culture of a nation that is just waking up to modernization. They are deeply rooted in their lifestyle of peace and harmony with nature. I am not Asian. I just have to say that if you found this movie boring or hard to understand, then you must realize, it was written from the standpoint of their culture. Do not critizice something you don't understand. I suggest learning Chinese, not Japanese as someone said, then approach the movie again. Or you can go live in China, learn their culture, and get a much better appreciation for this movie. Either way, I guarantee you will find that this movie has many facets that will interest you, and you'll be all the wiser for having taken the time to appreciate another culture.

And although some may say that the special effects (the &quot;flying&quot; in particular) was poorly done, I must disagree.  It was simply done in the style of the older films of the wuxia genre.  The wirework was done in a slow, dramatic way to maintain an elegance, although in America with all of our fast paced gun toting heroes it just seemed slow.In other words, to people who are used to this type of cinematics, the film was great, for people who would rather see lots of fased paced shooting, killing, and such, you might be a little disappointed.	4.0	True to it's genre.	2001-07-20	1	1	0

The movie will prove timeless in it's entertainment value. My rating of four stars is strictly for the movie itself. The quality of the DVD was very disappointing. First of all, except for the soundtrack, the sound in the Mandarin version (5.1 Digital)has been transferred to the DVD at a very low volume. I checked all the settings on my receiver and DVD player and all were set correctly. However, while the soundtrack booms through my speakers, voices and ambient sounds are hard to hear. Therefore, I had to increase the volume to hear voices, but turn it down when the music chimes in. As in the theatrical release, the cinematography is outstanding. The colors are vibrant and sharp.Most disappointing was the Commentary by Ang Lee and James Schamus. They add nothing to the enjoyment of the film. You learn nothing of interest. The commentary by James Schamus was especially annoying, and at times offensive. Offensive to both the viewer and to Ang Lee. All Ang Lee can do is chuckle at Mr. Schamus' bad jokes.In contrast, the 15 minute interview wiith Michelle Yeoh was informative and intelligent. What a bonus it would have been if the DVD was released with commentary by Ang Lee, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yung Fat. Maybe then we could have learned more about the making of this film.	4.0	Great Movie Bad DVD	2001-06-09	10	8	2

A Ten out of Ten, Two Thumbs Up as Siskel and Ebert would have said!Actually my title is a play on this years' Oscars prime contenders for the Best Film award. So this film review is as much as extolling the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, as well as acknowledging its counterpart in this crucible of film excellence.What is it they say about Hollywood, they ""so love an epic"", well then it was no coincidence that this years raisons d'tre for the Oscars owes a lot to two cities or should I say classical cultures a sort of East meets West saga, a quintessential Yin &amp; Yang juxtaposition, every bit about classic and ancient cultures &amp; philosophies as well as blockbuster filmmaking at its best!From the coliseums of Rome (that's the other movie) to the grandeur of Peking, the desolate beauty of the ancient Silk Road to the lush, verdant Chinese Bamboo Sea and snowcapped peaks (of Mongolia?), a forbidden love affair unfolds, of two star crossed lovers, and of another subdued and hidden yet poignant/noble love.The movie is very much story driven with multifarious underlying themes and incisive dialogue (yet there are subtle nuances that are sadly always lost in the translation/dubbing) intertwined in a hypnotic and magical portrayal of events occurring in as Ang Lee himself said... ""kind of a dream of China, a China that probably never existed, except in my boyhood fantasies in Taiwan""... an allegorical setting of ancient feudal China, but likewise having the dimensions of a cultural epic. There is the depiction of feministic beliefs and behavior of our heroine the strong willed and free spirited Jiao Long Yu (Jen) portrayed by newcomer Zhang Zi Yi in contrast to the chaste, demure and elegant love of Yui Hsui Lien, played by Michelle Yeoh, for the enigmatic Li Mu Bai, the indomitable Chow Yun Fat. The fast paced brilliantly and impeccably choreographed action sequences by Yuen Wo Ping (of ""The Matrix"" fame) in contrast with the almost surrealistic landscapes that served as a backdrop to the unfolding of an epic love story.Again kudos to Ang Lee whose direction is singularly unique in its style and breadth and his cinematographer Peter Pau whose spectacular composition and rendering of the panoramic background landscape is nothing short of a tourist guides' dream package. Exquisite musical scoring by Tan Dun was brilliant, enchanting and heart stirring, certainly Yo Yo Ma's masterful rendering of the sweet, haunting, and melancholic strands of the love song and background theme did it no harm either.

The acting of stars Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and the legendary Chow Yun Fat anchors this beautifully told story (to me, the underlying love between it's two main characters is the real story here) and manage to strike a stunning balance between the violence of the fight scenes and serenity of thier quiet longing for one another. The story itself is fairly simple, but the execution is astounding.&quot;Crouching Tiger...&quot; also features some of the best special effects ever seen in modern cinema and will surely capture and enrapture all who are blessed to witness it.

I do not wish to ruin the surprise factor.The movie has some funny parts, sad parts, and exciting parts. I wish I could tell you about it; but go and see it, or better yet buy the DVD.I have only ever given 5 stars to one movie (Amelie); but this deserves at least 4 stars.	5.0	Very Enjoyable.	2002-02-09	2	2	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3GJT5AACJ35YN	W. Marshall	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon swept the world off it's feet with it's beautiful cinematography and an epic story of a legendary sword, unspoken love and revenge. Now this film is the highest grossing Foreign Language film in history.  The performances by Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are outstanding.  Even though Chow Yun-Fat is one of China's most famous action star, this is his very first martial arts film.  Most of his other films consited of John Woo gun battles, but finally we get to see this wonder possess a sword in some amazing fights.  But the real treasure is Ziyi Zhang, her perfomance as a young daughter of a Governor, dreaming of a different life than hers, a life of adventure.  The fighting skills she displays are simply amazing for such a young gal, I'm sure we'll see much of her in the future (just probably not in Hollywood). One of the reasons I felt Crouching Tiger was so wonderful was the beautiful Mandarin dialect that these actors spoke in.  Most of them had to learn this dialect (including Yun-Fat) so it was very hard to fight and speak a new language at the same time, but the language has this beautiful sound that is unlike no other.  Even though the english dubbing also available on the DVD is done quite well, only the original Mandarin does justice to this film.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing a great epic.	5.0	Epic Film, Beautiful Language	2001-06-12	10	8	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1C19KQJVYJAMQ	Wookstable	I'n not a fan of the martial arts, action movies, or even films; after seeing this I am converted on all fronts, and I am going out of my way to write this only because I think time will prove this film to be a masterpiece.Every aspect of this film has been given such meticulous attention: the fight choreography and special effects repeatedly upstage each other with jaw-dropping skill; scenes between the two leads are among the finest acting I've seen on film or stage, played with such tenderness and passion; the resonance of the story ricochets from the fairy-tale reality of the film to today's talented and impatient youth, unwilling to sacrifice anything to master their talents and too young to find the need for humility.It is a deeply moving, breathtaking, heartbreaking ride.  Whatever you do, take it.	5.0	Breathtaking	2001-06-01	8	7	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A140U4C0D8TGR1	"WrathfulGrape ""(Korean film lover)"""	ANYWAY...so I get home last night from a very hard day of hanging around waiting to be stomped.  I pop in my brand spanking new Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon DVD and go straight for the goodie section (since I have seen the movie twice in the theater already, I was curious to see what extras the fine folks at Sony were going to stuff on my disk).I decide to view the &quot;Bravo&quot; making-of featurette first...I am a total sucker for making-of films.And BOOOOOM..the music hits you like a ton of bricks...BOMP BOMP BOMP or something like that.  Then cut to director Ang Lee sitting in his director's chair...moving his lips...Eh?  I cant HEAR him!  I scroll back a few frames...BOMP BOMP BOMP BOMP....and lips moving...so then I grab my remote and pump up the volume REALLY high...and then I hear it...this faint faint voice...gee whiz,,,is that ANG?When I got into the grape factory this morning, I log onto Amazon and see that I was not the only one who thought the sound truly SUCKED on this disk...and this whole time I thought I was turning into a raisin.I cannot express to you how disappointed I was at this DVD. I really loved Tan Dun's score, but MY LORD...I wanted to hear some of the dialogue too!  And the poor sound quality was all over the disk too...The images were crisp and pretty..the night fight scene, which was difficult to see in the theatre, was brightened the teeniest bit so that you can see the surfaces and the houses more clearly...But there is no excuse for that GODAWFUL SOUND!  I personally prefer subtitles, but that doesn't mean I dont want to hear the inflections in the actors voices...oh wait..I could barely hear those at all because of the GODAWFUL SOUND!Grapes make very little money, therefore it was a pain to me to know that I wasted my hard earned dollars on a disk that is so low in quality.Two lessons learned from this experience: 1) Always read customer reviews before buying anything, especially electronic stuff 2) Always wait for a special edition/platinum edition/Criterion...(if they could do it for &quot;The Rock,&quot; they could do it for this movie too)	1.0	And this whole time I thought I was losing my hearing	2001-06-19	19	5	14
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A2QQ5O2TFZPTIH	Wu-Tang_Assassin	"Classic movie. All of the fighting scenes were excellent, no flaws in them. People dislike the fact that they glide over buildings etc, like they are flying. Big deal its just a movie, and adds a different type of twist to the movie. The music of course, goes along with the movie, and the scenery that its filmed in is nice of course. ""Michelle Yeoh"" and ""Ziyi Zhang"" both act excellent in the movie, just with the normal acting and especially in the fighting scenes. I highly recommend this movie to ALL Kung Fu fans and for people that want a good story line in a movie. Because this movie, it does follow a story line, its not just fighting here and fighting there. So I highly recommend it, youll love the fighting scenes also."	5.0	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon	2006-04-15	4	3	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	ADA0IR4QH8I7R	Xealot	A relatively unknown and often quickly dismissed title at first, Ang Lee's &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; received the highest return of any foreign film in history at this year's Academy Awards- and it still did not receive it's due credit.  &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot;, a throwback to the wuxia (Kung-Fu Fantasy) films which director Ang Lee watched as a child, goes farther than any other film in the genre.  The breathtakingly choreographed fight sequences left the audience appluading in their seats (literally), and the poignant ending left even the most hardened of action movie fans with an expression of deep reflection.  &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is the perfect synthesis of  incredible action and powerful acting, a definite must-buy.	5.0	Should-Be Oscar-Winner	2001-04-28	3	3	0

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3L5PGZ2GTFAH9	"""xpopride123_99"""	The Wuxia genre are not new to me since I grew up on these types of movie. I've seen &quot;Bride with White Hair&quot;, &quot;Chinese Ghost Story&quot;, &quot;Swordsman II&quot;, too many to name. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does pay a homage to this older films because it borrows many ideas from these films. What Crouching Tiger did is it balances the script with action and melodrama instead of weighing more on the action. Crouching Tiger is more operatic than these earlier films because of the poetic like dialogues. There was never a moment in the movie that was boring. Everything has its purpose and director Ang Lee did a wonderful job on creating an atmosphere where everything seems magical.  Many people said that there were too many flying scenes and it's not real. Of course it's not real. I don't understand why people can accept The Force in Star Wars, but cannot accept flying. These are mythical characters and they are larger than life. This movie emphasizes on many philosophical ideas and if you do not understand, don't criticize it. I personally think this is the best wuxia movie to come out in a long time. Those that I mention at the top are great movies too if you consider watching these types of movies.	5.0	A great movie with a great cast and epic storytelling	2001-03-19	21	19	2
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A3UHOSQ3QLMT3O	Yen-Ching Chi	I found some people who don't understand Chinese martial art films or who never watched martial art films before ridiculed how people can fly. They probably don't realize that it is the essential part in all martial art movies. It is the rule, which people who watch martial art films are supposed to follow and appreciate. However, Couching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not just that. The sound design was amazing. It also delivered some very important message about Chinese philosophy.	5.0	It's about the Chinese Philosophy and the fairy tale	2003-02-11	7	6	1

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	AFMDUKHB6751D	Young Choi	Overall a fantastic movie.  However, buyers should be aware that the Superbit Collection may add audio clarity at the expense of the extra features typical to DVDs.  For instance the the regular DVD edition contains interviews, commentaries, graphics, etc.  Superbit has none of these.  For the vast majority of buyers who will not be able to even notice the difference in sound quality, this is a more expensive product that adds little value.  Stick with the regular DVD edition (which I'd rate a 5).	2.0	Serious Issues with Superbit Collection	2001-11-13	5	3	2

With this movie having around a thousand reviews, (some ignorant reviews from people that shouldn't be watching this, now there's a four star rating... Are you people very hairy? Do you drag your hands around when you walk?) I'm only going to say that the action, story, acting, direction, cinematogrophy, sets, costumes, comedy and drama is brilliant enough to produce a feeling of sheer joy. This is the movie that started my kung fu craze. I wish this movie came out years ago, for I would have liked to have been introduced to one of the best genres of cinema history a long time ago. So, watch it if you haven't, you will be introduced to some real action in a gorgeous way.	5.0	Everything about this movie is great.....	2004-01-07	4	3	1
B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A1ZZ03H0DTIJKC	Y T	The Wu Xia books come alive on widescreen! Thanks to Ang Lee, the recent winner of the UK 2001 BAFTA Best Director award (equivalent of the Oscars), brings the beauty of the very best of culture, plot, fights and landscape into a cinema experience.It was one of the most wonderful film experience I have ever had. You will probably come out from cinema speechless and have your mind dwelling on it for a while, I must say, if you enjoy good things, this is the film to watch.The breathtaking cinematography and music carried me into a dreamy state but yet the ending strikes a blow a reality that achieve a wonderful balance. The fight scenes in the film has really set a new standard for action movies, it is really quite unimaginable how you could top this film.If you can read, please watch the film, the isn't a greater disservice you can do to yourself if you miss this film on widescreen cinema just because you feel that reading the subtitle is a difficult thing.When the film ended, there was a complete silence in the theather/cinema, no one moved. As we left the place, no one say a word, then everyone will progressively exclaimed, 'What a great film!'.This is one film that will quiet you for a while because your mind is dwelling on the fantasy that you have gained from it. A beautiful cinema experience that will probably leave you, rather Speechless...	5.0	Speechless!!!  A Wonderful Cinema Experience... A Fantasy...	2001-03-12	7	6	1

It seems to be an overblown story about Oriental love and war and honor with actors on strings-like acrobatics. The reason why, in my opinion, most folks dug it is that they have not previously checked out what their kids are watching as far as the Anime or any of the cartoons coming out of the far east...or any of the martial arts stories that have been made for years out of the Orient.

B00003CXR3	Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [VHS]	A318RKL1I9ABCM	"""zaloop"""	There are so many things Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does right. First of all, the action is great. It is majestic and graceful and, most importantly, complex, as all good action should be. There are martial arts hand-to-hand fights as well as intense sword duels, and it's all done with the style of a complex dance. This is indeed one of the best forms of action you can have. When it all clicks, it's great. Like The Matrix, CTHD liberates its fighters by having them superpowered, letting them run up walls and fly, and this gives the action a feeling of freedom and limitless bounds. The influence is undeniably there. And like The Matrix, CTHD's action is better than what you'd find in, say, Jackie Chan films because it trusts the magic of martial arts enough to actually use martial arts, and the results are far more impressive than any Chan film, simply because the action is there as action, not as a side-dish to predictable sight jokes. (Not to mention that there is a good plot, too). ...This film is an epic, and makes sure it lets us know that, by creating some very nice visuals throughout. All the wide, detailed shots of Peking, the Forbidden City, are breathtaking, and the film is packed with beautiful, almost mystical settings like mountains, valleys, deserts, and forests. Not as grandly detailed and imaginative as, say, The Phantom Menace or Gladiator, but it still transports you to the time and place very well.And there are only a few flaws. Yes, this film, which probably has an average rating of 4 stars among the critics, still has flaws. Okay, maybe that word is too harsh; there are things that could've been improved on. There aren't that many. For one thing, the film never lets us in on the background and philosophy of the surreal fighting style that allows the fighter to float. It is a film's job to let us in; for some reason here, it's left abandoned. And no, it's not tasteful mystique; the film could easily let us know more about the style without giving anything away. Look at Star Wars- we end up knowing a lot about The Force in the first film alone, yet none of its mystique is lost. I'm not saying CTHD should've explained everything away; I'm saying it should've given us more background on the philosophies and practices involving the fighting style.  It is too bad CTHD doesn't do this, because it would not only add to the action but the story as well, as it would certainly bring up interesting philosophical themes.The only other flaw isn't so much a flaw as it is a section of the film. One part, where the film flashes back to the origins of the romance between the princess character and Lo, a bandit, isn't handled very gracefully. It ruins the great momentum of the film by suddenly taking thirty minutes to focus on the two weakest characters and actors in the film to focus on a pretty typical romance subplot, which could have easily been done in five minutes without losing any effect.As for the DVD of this film, it contains the usual features, like documentaries and behind-the-scenes videos, which aren't very special and don't provide much insight into the film itself. But what it also has is one of the best features any good DVD should have: director's commentary. With this, you can watch the entire film over again as Ang Lee talks you through it.This is a great film. With some fabulous action scenes (the best one involves Yeoh and Ziyi dueling in her training room, and Yeoh basically goes through every weapon on the rack fighting her), pretty visuals, a solid story with good chemistry between the characters, fine acting (Yeoh is the best), and a nice moody score, CTHD is yet another great holiday-season film, an excellent action/epic, and one of the best martial arts films you'll ever see. One of the best of the year.	5.0	Tiger-Dragon	2001-05-16	3	3	0

This moive sets a standard in Martial Arts movies!

For those who has not yet seen the movie, but have either a dvd system or vhs player, you have to get the movie NOW.  As for the dvd version, the resentation is great.  However, the clips from the film during the navigation gets repetitive after awhile.  The other features are great including the commentaries by Lee and Schram, funny and very informative, the commentaries definitely answered alot of my questions I had on the movie. The making of the film, the picture gallery, the international trailer are all great.  One problem, however, is that, 20 minutes were cut from the movie in order to make it into 2 hrs long. Therfore, some scenes seen in the international trailer did not make it in the movie.  Also Coco Lee's music video was missing from my region 1 dvd.  But overall a great presentation, great dvd to have.  But I will still buy the delux edition when ever it comes out!  In the mean time, this is surely a great DVD to enjoy!	5.0	&quot;Truely one of the greatest movie ever made!&quot;	2001-06-07	0	0	0
