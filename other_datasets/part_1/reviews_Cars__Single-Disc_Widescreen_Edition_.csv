B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LZGLA88K0LA0		The producers of CARS will probably have to dust off their shelves to make room for the Oscar it will probably get for Best Animated movie.  CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.  There he meets a Porsche lawyer voiced by Bonnie Hunt; a towtruck named Mater which is Larry the Cable Guy; and a former racing hero named Hudson Hornet played by Paul Newman.There are some cute moments and the animation IS brilliant, so CARS is a fun film to enjoy.	4.0	HOT ROD HEARTS	2006-11-12	5	5	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL	"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ..."	"'Cars' relies on such a beautiful personification, we forget the characters are really cars.  The whole human world has been transfigured, as ""Braking News"" comes on television, and cars watch their fellow heroes in Nascar-type races in the stands.  Playfully, we enter into the world of ""Lightning McQueen"" (Owen Wilson) who is trying to win his first ""Piston Cup"".  He is full of himself and not just engine oil, so he lazily creates a three-way tie with two other prima dona cars.  The tie-breaker takes place in California, but his smugness gets him off guard, and he is stuck with a sleepy desert town, Radiator Springs, off Route 66.  Here he meets some interesting fellow cars, including Hudson ""Doc"" Hornet (Paul Newman), a former racer and the town's judge, a rundown tow truck, Mater (Larry, the Cable Guy), and Sally, a Porche from L.A., enjoying the slower life as a lawyer in the country.  There's a love interest, but her distaste for his ego provides a series of events to have his egomania retreaded.'Cars' has a lot of heart inside its chasis.  We forget we are dealing with cars that our laughter and tears come to the fore without us thinking about it.  It's the human comedy with a theme to reflect on slowing down and enjoying the road(s) in life.  Surprisingly effective, the story is beautifully executed with nuances like vocal appearances by Bob Costas and Richard Petty, which authenticate the movie even more.'Cars' is the best of a great lot of animated features this year.  While 'Curious George' and 'Monster House' help reinvent animation, 'Cars' gets to the finish line better with a great story and a funny, touching delivery."	5.0	Cute and Classic	2006-11-08	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3N26CT3Z7WA6K	A &#34;Billy T.&#34;	This film came along at a very special time in my son's life.  He was just growing out of Thomas the Tank Engine, and was thoroughly immersed in Finding Nemo and Happy Feet when this film came along.  All of a sudden, he was into cars and NASCAR, and a whole new world opened up.Compared to Toy Story or the Incredibles, the storytelling of Cars is not as strong nor the characters developed as deeply.  Nevertheless, it is extremely entertaining.  There is naked merchandising throughout the film and the pop references (Car Talk guys) aren't so limiting that they would date the film.  I've never been to a NASCAR race, but the race sequences appear to be pretty authentic.  As with many Pixar films, the &#34;shorts&#34; are entertaining.At the risk of sounding like a movie critic, if The Incredibles and Toy Story are the cream of Pixar's crop, Cars gets a solid B!	4.0	A VERY GOOD FILM	2014-02-25	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A32JKNQ6BABMQ2	"abe ""starman"""	this movie was really cool.its not just about a few cars going left a lot in circles.first,theres a 3 way tie at the winston cup[nascars world series].this never happened before although kurt busch did finish 1st and jimmie johnson was 8 points behind 2 years ago.theres a lot of nasbar related stuff in there.1-only like 2 actual #s ftom a real nextel cup car are used.2-one of the cars on a 3 way tie is called the king.thays richard pettys old nickname.and the car was a old dodge superbird like the one ol king used to drive once.then theres a green and white car thats really aggressive.thats obviously dale earnhardt with a different paint job.then theres lightning mcqueen.hes the cool break out rookie who gas a chance to break a record by being the 1st rookie to be champ.anyhow,those 3 must race in a 3 car only race off at the end of the movie.any nascar fan i think will really enjoy it.it isnt just tossed together.someone actualy took time to research racesars.there the bump and run ,drafting,the skingshot and also as an asses bonus the racecars do famous things from nascar history like the pass in the grass and winning a race backwards.i think in all movies for children only toy story 1 and 2 are better.there are 2 poinrs i didnt like.1-mcqueen isnt a very cool name for a manly racecar hotshot rookie.unless of course you mean lightning is like jeff gordon then it all makes sense.2-the other thing i didnt like was the outcome of the big race  at the end.of course i cant say who won but they were booed and  had stuff thrown at them.thats just not a good thing to teach kids eveb if they font know that car was patterned after the greatest racecar driver ever.	4.0	really cool for a kids show.maybe the 3rd best kids movie	2006-08-29	9	3	6

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3MV4VT9T0NRTZ	acstare	My 2 year old daughter loves cars and trucks, so we got this for her to watch.  Obviously, a 2 year old isn't interested in watching the entire movie from beginning to end, but she enjoys it in small segments.  I am sure she will love it more when she is older,The only con is that sometimes the humor and relationship situations are a little more &#34;adult&#34; oriented.  It isn't too obvious to children (unless they are very wise to this sort of thing), but some of this sort of humor and situations is unnecessary in a children's movie.  Otherwise, fun movie.	4.0	Decent cartoon movie from Pixar	2014-01-03	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2F9ERD4UMAQY5	A. Duszynski	"This was a great movie.  The animation was top notch, both adults and children can be entertained by this film, and despite what some neysayers will tell you....there IS a story line.  Apparently the people that feel there is no story line couldn't grasp the simple message of ""take life slow and enjoy"".  The town of Radiator Springs used to be a hustle and bustle town.  But then a major freeway was opened up, which bypassed the town, saving commuters a mere 10 minutes.  We learned our lesson on our last road trip, we got off the main highway and took some alternate route, which lead us through small towns that we never saw from the main road.And as for the length and whatnot, MY 2 YEAR OLD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!  He just sat there and watched the screen through the entire 90 some minute flick.  If an 8 year old can't sit through this, then maybe their parents should limit their sugar intake and video games in hopes to regain their attention span.Overall, this is a GREAT movie.  Well put together, great messages behind it, lessons to be learned, and it is entertaining.  So don't listen to the negative comments because chances are, the neysayers have the attention span of a goldfish and couldn't understand the simple messages in the lessons Lightning McQueen learned: take life slow and enjoy, and that sometimes you need to think about others rather than yourself."	5.0	Don't Fall for the Negative Reviews, It Was Great!	2006-09-23	10	8	2
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1G953CAEYF54D	African Violet	"I have a four yr old little boy who loves all kinds of trucks and cars.  He could give you the names of all his vehicles long before he could identify his colors.  So when we saw the movie trailers for ""Cars"" on the computer, I knew that we needed to get this one.  As one of his Christmas gifts it is quickly becoming his new, all-time favorite.  It takes the self-centered racing car, Lightning McQueen and side-tracks him in a sleepy old town that the interstate by-passed.  During his week of community service, he makes friends and finds out that there is more to life than living in the fast lane.  It is a wonderful movie and well worth watching it over and over as four year olds love to do."	5.0	Movie with a heart	2007-01-16	3	2	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ATDE9JYCPI0L1	Alyssa A. Lappen	All right. I wanted to see the characterizations by Car Talk stars, Tom and Ray, a.k.a. Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. The Car Talk comedians make a brief, not-so-funny appearance in the first scenes. Still, I, my 14-year-old son and his aunt came away happy, despite the predictable and corny story line.At the grand opening event, rookie racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) vies for the coveted Piston Cup against incumbent champion, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), who is determined to best his perennial second-place, at all costs. The rookie, naturally full of himself, expects to step from peddling Rusteze into big league Dynaco sponsorship. But the three tie for first place, and a tie-breaker is scheduled in California. Lightning immediately sets off, aboard his faithful truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). En route, Mack's back panel accidentally opens and the sleeping Lightning falls out on the dark interstate, where he is awakened by the roar of oncoming traffic.Frantic to find Mack, Lightning chases the wrong truck off the interstate and winds up on Route 66 in Radiator Springs. That's where the fun starts. Race cars have no lights, and Lightning drives blindly, tearing up the road as he goes.In court, mechanic, judge and 1951 Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) are inclined (the last, for secret reasons) to let Lightning go, but local attorney Sally (Bonnie Hunt) pressures the judge to make him repair the road he has destroyed. During his days at work, Lightning is befriended by Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and eventually by all the other town characters as well, including Sally, Sheriff (Michael Wallis), tire store owner Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and his sidekick Guido (Guido Quaroni), a retired army jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley), a shabby VW bus, Fillmore (George Carlin)--and even the Doc, whose historical racing championships Lightning discovers and advertises.There are plenty of twists and turns in this albeit predictable road, but the end result is an instant classic, filled with great Randy Newman music, terrific scenery and some wonderful lessons about friends, community and the importance of keeping things in perspective.We loved it, cliches and all.--Alyssa A.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AC7J2CCGFQXY9	"Amazon Customer ""fairytales&dreams"""	"I love Pixar films, they are always poignant, yet funny, not to mention the animation is awesome.  While Cars is not my favorite Pixar movie, it was still entertaining and fun to watch.Lightning McQueen is a flashy and selfish race car on his way to California to race in the big Piston Cup race and while on the highway his ride (a Mack truck called ""Mack""heh) falls asleep and somehow the ramp drops down and lets a sleeping McQueen out onto the highway.  While Mack continues on his way oblivious McQueen is not on board, McQueen suddenly realizes that he can't find his ride and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.He speeds around looking for Mack and unfortunately, gets a police car from a small town of Radiator Springs off route 66, on his tail.  He gets in trouble and ends up having to serve a community service sentence by fixing the road into town that he messed up in his police car chase.  McQueen isn't too happy about this as he's supposed to be in California for the race in a week, but the town leader, Doc Hudson (who presided over his case as judge) is adamant he serve his sentence and McQueen is resigned to his unlucky fate.I thought there were a lot of funny parts in the movie and I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes.  Instead of ""cow tipping"", there is ""tractor tipping"", and the scene where McQueen and Tow Mater (a rusty tow truck) decide to go tractor tipping was hilarious.  Another funny moment was when the 2 Italian cars that owned the local tire store, and their love of all things Ferrari, finally meet a real life Ferrari (their reactions were so cute!).I loved the message in the movie.  That fame, fortune, and looking out for number one isn't what life is all about, that the love and companionship of friends and family is far more lasting.  It was heart-warming to see the change in the brash Lightning McQueen, as the town of Radiator Springs and its locals, slowly effect his outlook on life.  He begins to realize what is really important vs. what he thought was important before in his flashy race car life.  The ending fit into this theme of what really matters in life, winning no matter what or realizing winning isn't everything (Oh, be sure to continue watching after credits roll, there are scenes after the ending showing what happens after the race).This is a fun-filled movie, with some humorous moments, and while not the best Pixar movie I've seen it was still a good one.  I don't think I've ever seen a bad Pixar movie. =)"	4.0	Very cute and entertaining movie	2008-06-13	6	5	1

Some things could be improved like why McQueen has its original colors in the final race instead of having the new ""Radiator Springs"" colors (as it appeared at the end). My son loves it and he didn't stop seeing this movie at home since the release of the DVD.Only this movie and Toy Story have the revolutionary idea of thinking about the movie AND the toys. The others only have the typical ""not-so-look-alike"" figures or not-so-funny-to-play-with toys.This movie brought us the great idea of mixing the Matchbox/HotWheels collection with the movie characters. My son loves any type of toy cars like most of the boys (and many men) but he loves die-cast cars by far.There isn't any movie that used this option (die-cast cars) for its characters and the idea of a growing collection set. That's why I think there is innovation in this movie.I hope they give us a second movie (and more die-cast cars)."	5.0	This is the best toy-oriented movie since Toy Story!	2007-07-27	3	3	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1T6N0MZNIRMZU	Amazon Customer	It's funny. I am late coming to this movie because I was afraid it would be too intense for my child, who just turned 3. I have yet to let him watch Nemo. Also, I am doing everything I can to discourage NASCAR viewer ship in my household. (Being a Southerner, you choose between two classes - Thoroughbreds or stock cars.)At last, I gave in. My son loves the cars and although he had not asked for the movie, my partner and I needed a break from Thomas, so I bought the widescreen version of this movie.The first thing I realized was that this is the same story as Doc Hollywood. Now, I happen to be a sap and I loved Doc Hollywood, but I was afraid it might be a too-familiar theme to keep my interest. Suffice it to say, I did not pause the movie one time from start to end.Some say it does not have enough drama, but I am so glad no one has to die in this one, especially the Mom - and in a very loud and violent way - such as with Nemo. (I am still wondering whether Walt Disney ever got therapy for his Mother issues. Between the Mothers dying and the rest of the older women being witches - well...)The characters are amazingly well-developed, remarkably loveable and incredibly designed. The casting was perfect and the tons of little jokes and spoofs will keep us watching this for a long time - if for nothing else than to watch for the jokes we missed.We may have enjoyed it more than he did, but I know he will watch it many times in the months to come.Oh - and for those who didn't have at least one little tear - cut back on your Prozac.	5.0	"""Doc Hollywood"" for Cars"	2008-06-23	4	4	0

When I was able to get the movie to work, the picture and sound were incredible. This is a good disc to keep around in order to show off your system.The reason I have it four stars:I have the Samsung BD-P1200 and it took 5 tries before I was able to get the disc to load. Like Pirates, Fantastic Four and a few other discs, the java menus really overload the stand alone players. I made sure the disc was clean and after the 5th time of opening the tray and re-inserting the movie the player recognized the disc.I'm of the opinion they should lay off the java menus and just stick to the basic menus for these movies.-update-I have purchased the Panasonic DMP-BD30K and it handles this title just fine.

I'm so glad I did. It's filled with interesting characters from Mater the tow truck to Guido the forklift and the stars of the film are as usual interesting and entertaining.Lightning McQueen is self-centered and arrogant but when after a three-way tie for first place in the Piston Cup, he gets lost on the way to the tie breaker race and ends up in Radiator Springs. He's sentenced to community service and tries to weasel out and escape his obligation. The towns autos keep him close and eventually he begins to see that not all the world is involved in racing and speed isn't what life is all about.The realization is a bit abrupt but then it's film. The movie is also filled with lots of sight gags and in jokes some for the kids and some for adults and some for all ages.

The cars and trucks will delight all children and the subtle, and not always so subtle, connections to real-life will have adults laughing on the floor.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANCOMAI0I7LVG	Andrew Ellington	I have a huge problem with this movie.  As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.UGH, I hate this movie.The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).In a word, this film is just `boring'.	1.0	Time for a car wash...	2010-06-28	26	5	21

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2K3L0DOPQQ697	"Andrew Olson ""otaku"""	"Disney movies really aren't my thing.  For example, I recently bought a few movies from WalMart: Serenity, Slither, and Final Destination II... none of which are Disney movies.  I used to think that Disney movies were mainly for kids. Granted, I do have the entire Lilo and Stitch series, but beyond that, my late Disney experiences have been from watching old WD movies like Beauty and the Beast and Finding Nemo with my 5-year old cousin (and don't take that as a rip on Finding Nemo; I actually really liked that movie).  What really attracted me to Cars in the first place, however, was the fact that it had Larry the Cable Guy in it, as the lovable but somewhat dimwitted Tow Mater (known throughout the film simply as Mater), seeing as I am a HUGE fan of Larry's material.  I finally got to see the movie as a result of a bootleg copy I got from a friend.  I must say, it is one of THE best Disney movies I have ever seen.  It was very family-friendly and overall quite hilarious.*Warning- Spoilers Ahead... Proceed With Caution*The premise is quite simple: a NASCAR-like superstar named Lightning McQueen is one of three cars that tied for entrance into the Piston Cup, one of the most premier races in the nation.  While on his way to the race, however, his transport truck Mac falls asleep, allowing Lightning to roll out the back of Mac's tailflap; when Lightning awakens, he chases down what he thinks is Mac, but isn't.  He finally stops in the quiet little town of Radiator Springs... but not before ripping a statue of an engine out of its base and completely tearing up the main road through the city.  The judge and town lawyer (who happens to be a very attractive female car [I feel really weird saying that]) sentence him to repave the road before he can leave for the race.  He ends up having to repave the road twice, cause the first time he didn't do it right and the road was all bumpy.Throughout the film, Lightning's pride almost stops him from being able to make the friendships he does while in Radiator Springs; guys like Mater (played/voiced superbly by Blue Collar Comedy Tour regular Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty old pickup truck who runs a towing company (Tow Mater... get it?  hahaha... ok.  I'll stop.) and Doc Hudson, a old (1951, I believe) Hudson Hornet who was the winner of 3 Piston Cups during his own racing days.  He eventually becomes Mater's ""new best friend"" and goes out on a tractor-tipping expedition with him... which, btw, is one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.  The movie ends like you wouldn't expect it to (hint: Lightning doesn't win the Piston Cup), but Lightning ends up making a decision that leaves everyone watching with a nice, warm, happy feeling inside.  ^_^One of the nice things about Cars is that, like Finding Nemo, it is quite the unconventional movie.  The title suggests that the movie will have something to do with racing and/or cars, but the real delight is in that the main characters are the cars, not the racecar drivers; in fact, there are no drivers.  The cars in Cars are completely autonomous (they move on their own) but can talk, drive, and overall act like regular humans... remind you of the fish in Finding Nemo (which reminds me... I haven't reviewed F.N. yet... watch for my review a bit later).

The movie is 2 hours long, and I couldn't wait for it to be over after the first hour. My wife and I had to turn it off at the 1.5 hour mark. Overall, it doesn't seem good for either adults (because of the above mentioned) or for kids (because of the length). Pixar has so many other movies. See those	2.0	Not very entertaining.

And there are so many little details that went into this movie that make it really special, like how the engine noises of the different types of cars are accurate (like the purr of the Porsche).My favorite scenes are Guido's 3 second pit stop, and the tractor tipping scene (I crack up every time Mater says, ""That's Frank!"")This is a fun movie to watch, even if you're not a racing fan.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LTZGHZBBBQX0	Anthony L.	Nobody makes cartoons like Pixar!If The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Up, Toy Story, and Wall-E aren't the greatest computer-animated films ever made, blending humor, heart, and smart entertainment, then I'll eat my hat!Cars could also be added to the list, as it seems that young boys between the age of 3-7 cannot STOP watching it! However, when all of the above films are 5 star triumphs, Cars drives smoothly into a 4 star spot.The reason: Cars is a STRICTLY American film. It's set in America (the most American part of America) and has all-American characters.Living abroad, I can tell you that it does not have as large an appeal to foreign audiences.However it makes up for that with some of the most memorable characters (Lighting McQueen, Mater), family-friendly humor, and some roaring racing sequences!An excellent cartoon for the whole family!	4.0	Cars is shiny on the surface, and underneath: a roaring engine!	2012-11-03	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A37YYE73XR83FI	"Anthony P. ""Inspiring Mind"""	I had low expectations for this film.  I think the title is pathetically uninspired and lifeless.  I thought the Cable Guy would be the overly talkative, obnoxious character like Donkey in Shrek.  And, not being a big expert/fan of cars in general, I thought I might be overall underwhelmed. But, my father wanted to see this, so I took him to see it for Father's Day.  And, I had the best day with him in a long time.  Amazingly captivating--with a few details that are culturally overplayed groaners--and well paced, CARS takes a checkered flag in my book.  I have seen probably more computer animated films than I'd like to see in one year. [I was equally surprised by Over The Hedge.  Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.  But, I wouldn't like that to ruin the film for me.  One of the funnier highlights is the use of cars as even the insects of the film.  Oh, and stay through the credits for a satisfying end note.	4.0	Surprisingly enjoyable for a non-NASCAR fan	2006-07-24	8	7	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3VF465ZMK1RY2	A reviewer	There is a reviewer on here who says this movie is not good for younger kids. I disagree.  It really depends on your child's interests. My son was three when this movie first came out.  He had never watched a movie all the way through before, and is usually bored by videos/movies.  This is the first movie that he has shown any interest in seeing.  Long before it came out he was fascinated by the pictures of cars with faces and we took him to see the movie months ago (his first movie theatre experience) and there has not been a day since that he doesn't talk about Cars.  He knows all the characters, remembers the whole plot (we only saw it once), and now he compares the types of cars in the movie with the ones he sees on the road.  I thought I wouldn't like the movie because I am totally uninterested in cars, but I thought it was really well done.  The characterizations are fun and the animation is superb.  Only Pixar could come up with such a creative, engaging movie about cars.  My husband LOVED it and is looking forward to the DVD release as much as my four-year-old, who keeps asking for it for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and admire Pixar even more after seeing it.	5.0	My 4-year-old and 36-year-old love it!	2006-09-05	8	7	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1WB5NZYY5XR8A	"Ash1138 ""Just a middle aged guy living in Col..."	I went into Cars with not very high expectations. I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults. Still, I didn't hear any kids complaining at my trip to the theatre so don't be concerned about taking them.Pixar returns to it's roots with the same style film as Toy Story 1 & 2. It also keeps with it's tradition of being an impeccable movie studio that never fails to impress. Cars is another homerun for the studio and easily one of the best films of the year.	5.0	Unoriginal, but thoroughly creative and enjoyable!	2006-06-18	5	4	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1A6KF9MZENFN9	B. Barry	"A little known secret about Pixar, is their huge support for their local community.  Last night I attended a fund raiser premier of CARS at Pixar's studio's in Emeryville CA.  The event raised over $80,000 for our local school district!So here are my thoughts on the movie.Firstly, this is a fast paced and LOUD movie.  Those with sensitive ears should think about taking cotton buds to the theater.Ok, I read some of the comments so far based on the teaser's and have to say that the animated cars are done wonderfully.  Each car really has it's own personality and although they do look a little cartoonish, Pixar has again shown that they can animate anything and bring it to life and then some.The big race scenes are really only at the very beginning and at the very end, the majority of the movie is set in a small town ""Radiator Springs"" somewhere in the midwest just off Route 66.I won't give too much away as far as the story goes, you'll need to go see it yourself for that.The movie is packed full of very funny jokes and scenes, like the Tractor Tipping scene, and the SUV off-road bootcamp!Visually, this movie is stunning.  I can't imagine the amount of research that went into producing this one.  Anyone who has driven I-40 near Amarillo TX will recognise the mountain ranges shaped like old Cadillac's burried nose down in the sand.  They really capture the road trip experience.  And the scenery is breath-taking.Not being a big fan of ""Larry The Cable Guy"" I have to say that his performance as Mater the tow truck, was brilliant.  As one of the main characters, he was very funny and endearing.Technically, Pixar really pushed the envelope again.  We're used to Pixar movies breaking ground in each movie, the underwater rendering in Finding Nemo, the fur rendering in Monsters Inc., etc.. In cars, it's all about the rendering of dust particles which looks super realistic and is not an easy thing to achieve.Overall, this movie will have great appeal to a lot of people, although I personally think that The Incredibles is still my favorite.  This one might not win the Best Animated Feature award but I'm sure it will get awards for the technical aspects of the film.Finally, I just want to thank Pixar once again for their amazing and continued support to the local community, whether it be fund raising events like last nights, or the masses of computers they donate to the schools, or the number of their employee's that regularly volunteer their freetime to work with the kids in mentoring programs.  I couldn't wish for a better neighbor."	4.0	Not as good as The Incredibles, but still a master piece of CGI movie making!	2006-05-04	11	10	1

I think a reasonable car movie would be something involving all of the NASCAR races on ESPN and ESPN 2 with real people in the cars racing them and do the animation that way. I hate it when there are talking cars.Cars aren't meant to talk. They are meant to drive and stop when supposed to without talking. This is my opinion. Just because you don't think this is right doesn't mean it's not helpful. Be kind.	1.0	Talking cars: Horrible idea. Worse with no organization.	2011-08-19	13	0	13

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3GZJB73PRI47H	Benjamin Peck	Let me echo what others have said: this is the best blu-ray I've seen yet.  The picture is brilliant of course, but the PCM sound at 24 bits will also rock your speakers.  The special in-movie features are the best implementation so far of what blu-ray can offer us.  You can feel the dedication and love when watching them - so removed from some of the tacked on 10 'making of' bits we get even on most blu-ray today.This disk should be held as a standard to other studios when they whine about people not buying enough blu ray.  If every disk were like this I'd be broke buying them.	5.0	Best Blu demo	2008-09-27	3	3	0

Although I love Pixar cartoons, this one just never did anything for me.Leave it to Pixar to surprise and delight.Having just turned 40 the movie resonated within me in a deeper way.Whether it was the fact that Radiator Springs had been seemingly left behind in the modern world, or the story of how Doc Hudson had grown old and forgetten, the theme of the passage of time really struck a chord.When lighting McQueen learns to forego winning in order to help the King finish the race, it is a moral and empathic moment for children of all ages.I don't collect DVD's personally, only for the kids, but this is one of the few that I might consider purchasing and stashing away to enjoy privately in a quiet moment.Highly Recommended!Cheers!	5.0	How A CARtoon can make a grown man shed tears.	2008-07-25	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2TAPL67U2A5HM	Bjorn Viberg	Cars (Widescreen Edition)~ Owen Wilson is a good animated movie that I feel is a bit too oriented towards the American market. Most people in the rest of the world do not watch Nascar and therefore many of the Nascar references are lost on people that do not watch it. The animation is great, the storyline is well written, the music is really good. The message of the movie is that one needs to take responsibility for ones actions, be tolerant and not be haughty. The story centers around a haughty race car called Lightning McQueen that learns respect, tolerance and the true meaning of family. It started out poorly and just became better and better. But still I give it 4 stars out of 5.	4.0	Cars (Widescreen Edition)	2006-12-02	7	1	6

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ATWKOFJXRRR1	"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com"""	"Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout."	5.0	Another Animation Success	2006-11-20	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NKRH3TJ4DPVI	Book Glutton	"I bought this as a gift for a family with small children. I know it has been a favorite for many families. Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too. Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young. It's the kind of movie that deserves repeated watching.I have read a number of books on leadership this year. I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions], a ""leadership fable"" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop. These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.You can see some of this at work in this movie. I believe you can see also the reversal of some form of these at work as the movie progresses. You see that it takes the development of interpersonal relationships and personal goals to overcome obstacles that are necessary to make teams work--to make us team players. These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire. We all want them to be successful. These are not trivialized by successful persons. A great plus is: it's all presented in an understandable format within the context of something that is simply good entertainment enjoyed by many of us.Very enjoyable and instructional!"	5.0	Favorite of Children.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AWNKEM8DAG8PY	Brian Conway	"The seventh film from the incredible collaboration between Disney and Pixar, Cars is probably the most mixed and formulaic movie of the bunch. That's not to say the movie isn't good. The premise, a world populated with anthropomorphic cars &agrave; la every single Disney movie ever, is admittedly prosaic but Lasseter and co. know how to milk that formula like nobody else. Cars serves as further proof of this as the film has got it where it really counts. Though the characters and the coming-of-age tale are about as traditional as it gets, Pixar again picks the perfect talents to breathe life into their CG creations. Everyone is appropriately charismatic, tough, melancholy, or goofy with Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy leading the way. Visually, Cars is absolutely stunning, topping all of Pixar's previous efforts. Sometimes the gorgeous vistas are almost too good; one can easily find themself admiring the scenery instead of paying attention to the story but the quick pace manages to reel the film's audience back in quickly enough. The only quality of Cars that is worthy of being deemed ""bad"" is the soundtrack; no matter how hand-in-hand country and Nascar go, bad music is still bad music (which would have been easily fixed if only Randy Newman sang the tunes).

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LRV1LZR4SJYZ	Brian James	Cars, while technically proficient with some beautiful animation and backgrounds, is probably the weakest of the Disney/Pixar productions.  There didn't seem to be much heart in the story and even when suspending disbelief, it was difficult to get the mind around the premise that cars inhabited this world.The story did pick up with the tractor tipping scene, but overall, it was somewhat less than satisfying.  For a collector of the Pixar efforts, I think the movie should definitely be included as it demonstrates how Pixar is evolving as it continues to turn out movies - but this is certainly not one of their best.	4.0	Veering Off the Highway	2007-01-11	3	2	1

The pure digital transfer looks beautiful in HiDef with a BluRay player and 1080p HDTV (Sony PS3 and Samsung 40"" in my case).  Colors are spectactular.  I love the music and voice acting Pixar put together as well.  Click and Clack, the Tapert brothers from NPR as the Rusteeze owners was an especially nice touch.  The plot of the film is kid friendly but also takes adults back to the time when people drove cars to drive cars and meet people, not get somewhere.  Now the occasional car meet at the local drive in diner (if any are left in your town) is about all that is left of this culture.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3N6GAJTEOF4MO	Caleb Williams	Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.	5.0	An Interesting Concept And A Brilliant Movie By Pixar	2008-08-20	2	2	0

No complaints coming from the little guy, but there's something about the metallic paint of these vehicles that don't seem to have the same quality as the typical ""Cars"" cars you find in stores.  Not sure if it was due to a limited production run, or simply due to contaminates in the air/paint.  Not an issue for young kids, but may be a concern for some collectors. It looks like each car might come out a little different, dust in the paint, etc..Very happy with the purchase, and love watching the movie in Blu-Ray.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18G7GG53G2X8A	Chris Pandolfi	"For ""Cars,"" the folks at Disney/Pixar created a world in which automobiles replace every other being on Earth. I found this fascinating and baffling at the same time; they drive on roads and highways as they usually would, but they also have the ability to enter buildings, hold cameras, and sit in stadiums like humans. Obviously, this means that they take on human professions; at one point, a Porche named Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) says that she used to be a lawyer in Los Angeles. Interestingly, cars also take on the role of other life forms, including insects (which are appropriately reinterpreted as miniature Volkswagen Beetles with wings) and livestock (replaced by tractors).But all this is to be expected in an animated film, and in this case, it works even better because the story enables viewers to forget about such unrealistic things. This is a good thing for audiences of any age. For kids, ""Cars"" is a cute, well-crafted film with loveable characters. For adults, it's an entertaining animated comedy that manages to be humorous and insightful without getting sickly sweet.True to the tradition of family friendly Disney films, this is the story of friendship, learning, and redemption, and it offers an important life lesson while maintaining a comedic disposition. One would think that such a formulaic plot would have gotten stale a long time ago, but for whatever reason, it still works. There are probably many reasons for this (not the least of which is the appeal it has for children). The one I stick to is that, no matter how inaccurate, sappy, or unoriginal a story may seem, everyone loves something with a good heart that can deliver a happy ending. ""Cars"" is certainly not new in terms of its basic structure or characterizations, but the fact that it literally brings mute and/or inanimate objects to life makes it fun. Pixar is a studio that has proven itself capable of such a task, starting in 1995 with talking toys and continuing in 1998 and 2003 with talking bugs and talking fish.Now we have talking cars, and no one seems to like talking more than Lightening McQueen (Owen Wilson), especially if it's in front of a camera. Lightening is a rookie racecar, but he already has a following that outshines most other celebrities of the racing scene. One particular race results in a three-way tie between him, the mean spirited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), and the competitive but decent King (Richard Petty). In order to break the tie, one more race will be held in California. The winner will receive the prestigious Piston Cup, the fictitious equivalent of the Heisman Trophy or the Stanley Cup. Lightening wants to win with every fiber of his being, not only because he believes it'll turn him into a bigger celebrity, but also because he'll become the new face of a well known car company (he wants to get out of his current sponsorship: a car wax called Rust-eze).Unfortunately, things are about to get bumpy for Lightening. Even though he's popular, skilled, and photogenic, he's also an arrogant publicity hound. Because he believes he's such a hotshot, he feels he has the right to pressure others into doing what they shouldn't. On the way to California, his mode of transportation--a big rig named Mack (John Ratzenberger)--falls asleep on the road (a situation which isn't helped by a group of neon lighted punk hotrods). This causes the rear hatch to open and Lightening to be dumped off the side of the road. His attempt to find Mack leads him to the famous Route 66. It also leads to a high-speed chase with an irritable, aging police car (Michael Wallis as Sheriff). Not surprisingly, Lightening is caught and arrested.Thus begins his stay in Radiator Springs, a remote, dilapidated desert town. It has definitely seen better days: buildings have chipped paint and rotting wood; the neon signs are faded and buzzing; and the only intersection with a traffic light is useless because yellow is the only one that seems to work properly. It's filled with a variety of colorful characters, all of which are somewhat odd but completely good. There's Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a hillbilly tow truck; Ramone (Cheech Marin), a vintage car that loves to change his paint job every day; his wife, Flo (Jenifer Lewis); Filmore (George Carlin), a wasted Volkswagen van whose mind is still stuck in the sixties; the hippie-hater Sarge (Paul Dooley); the Italian tire duo of Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and Guido (Guido Quaroni); the shy fire truck, Red (Joe Ranft), and Sally, the attorney Porche who left the city life of Los Angeles for the freedom of the open road.The most important character of this group is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a character who ultimately takes on the role of the Wise Old Man. He also seems bitter and short fused, especially around Lightening, whose desperation to reach California in time has made him immature and shallow (little does he know that his disappearance has become major news). He's ordered to tow a road-paving machine in order to fix the damage he caused during the high-speed chase, something he's unwilling to participate in. But it eventually becomes clear he's learning a very important lesson: if he wants to achieve his goals, he has to understand the value of thinking of others, not just himself. The relationship he and Doc share is an interesting one: as it turns out, Lightening can actually teach Doc a valuable lesson, one that specifically relates to letting go of the past.But other characters also need to learn a thing or two, as well. What the locals want is for someone to drive through their city and make use of their services. In other words: they want to revive their home through business and companionship. Ever since a new highway was built out of convenience, Radiator Springs has been all but forgotten. No one is more dedicated to the welfare of the little town than Sally, and eventually, Lightening begins to notice. This in turn reawakens feelings within him, feelings of affection and admiration. They also bring about compassionate feelings that make him see the townsfolk in a new light. They're a good group of people (actually, they're automobiles), and they deserve to be treated with respect. But the question remains: will he learn his lesson before he's found and taken to the big race?I suppose it's unimportant to answer that question. ""Cars"" is not about telling a new story; it's about telling an old story in a new way, and that's what makes it such a fun experience. What most impressed me was how the world we all know is adapted to serve the needs of living, breathing cars. Even the scenery takes on a particularly vehicular quality; many of the desert rock formations resemble the shapes of cars, hood ornaments, and hubcaps. I was also impressed by many of the vocal talent the filmmakers assembled. Only Larry the Cable Guy could voice a rusty tow truck with a thick southern accent (they even work in his trademark phrases, ""Git-r-done!"" and, ""I don't care who you are: that's funny right there!""). Only George Carlin could voice a character that sells ""organic"" gasoline and blares a Jimi Hendrix record in the morning (he seemed to rely on Al Sleezy, the Hippy Dippy Weather Man for this role). All the elements came together to form a decent addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup, a film perfect for kids and adults alike."	4.0	Get Your Motor Running	2006-06-10	2	2	0

The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling.	4.0	Not just for the CG and the excitement - cool outlook and warm within	2007-01-07	2	2	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1AISPOIIHTHXX	"Cloud ""..."""	"Even in the teaser trailer phase of a film's release, many people were not anticipating Cars that much. Was it because they had come off the action-packed the Incredibles and people weren't exactly revving (pun maybe intended) for talking cars? Or was it just simply the idea seemed weird? Whatever the case, the general reaction upon its release was it was good-but-not-great; the one that ruined Pixar's 6 for 6 winning streak. So is it that bad? Well no, but the idea this is a horrible film is just really pushing it but it's still a lesser effort.In a world where everyone and everything's car-related, the story centers on Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racer who only thinks of himself. After a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup and on route to California for the finals, he's accidentally dumped on the Interstate and ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. There, he meets a number of cars trying to keep their struggling town alive while Lightning learns it's better to think of more things than winning.Let's get the good stuff out of the way. While everyone sings 3D animation praises, a slight backlash was created when Disney at one point abandoned traditional 2D thanks to the failures of Home on the Range and Brother Bear, making audiences hate 3D a bit since more and more (and more) 3D movies were being released. But still, the computer animators outdid themselves since almost every new camera angle gives us something to marvel; from the neon lights to the sheen of polished cars to the landscape. It's also a bit more movie-esque in the more bigger action scenes, making it a bit more dynamic. There's also some inspired gags like bugs that are actually Bugs as in Volkswagon Beetles while cow-tipping as been replaced by tractor tipping.In a couple of commentaries, Pixar head John Lasseter said that a goal of Pixar was to make you see familiar worlds in a new light. Imagine toys that can talk, monsters having feelings or the burdens of being a superhero. Does anybody really wonder what a car does? While that's not to say the idea at least sounds pretty neat but it just seems awkward that we have to get sympathetic to a talking car. While I'm not being kind of pessimistic and it's unfair to say every Pixar film has to be at least masterpiece-level or it's awful, you can admit at least there's some problems with the film anyway.One problem is the story. It's weird how there's as much as 6 people who work on the screenplay yet it feels so padded in its story. There's a whole lot of scenes that are meant to develop everyone but everyone seems kind of one-dimensional anyway and main hero Lightning just sounds like a jerk all the way through even with a newer enlightenment (could be a Owen Wilson problem though). The James Taylor ""Our Town"" song is meant to be the emotional scene but it pales to the Sarah McLachlan-sung ""Jessie's story"" scene in Toy Story 2. The voice acting is a bit more stunt casting, probably catching it from Dreamworks' tendency to get big-name stars to voice everyone.Pixar was excellent when it came down to DVD's packed with information about making the film. Sure A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films started out kind of thin but when Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and the Incredibles had top-tier DVD's, seeing Cars quite small extras is disappointing. We get the kinda-funny short One Man Band while a new short involving the tow-truck Mater is not that funny. Everything else is light on insight and you'll instantly think of a double-dip in its future. But strangely, I ended up buying it anyway knowing there was a bigger release somewhere in the future. It'll probably come around Ratatouille's DVD release (which, by the way, looks quite promising).I don't love the movie yet I don't outright hate it and I won't hold Pixar's past achievements against it but based on the film alone, it is a bit disappointing there's just some issues that the film has you wish were fixed."	4.0	Halfway between great and okay	2007-03-10	1	1	0

A great film reminiscent of Doc Hollywood, but done nascar style. Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.  A tale of Love, Friendship, Loyalty, betrayal, and trust.  It has it all.  For the kids, yes... no worse than what bugs bunny used to have in it.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2Z5XUM00YMDGA	"Constantinos V. ""Constantinos V."""	This animated movie was way above our expectations. It was very entairtaining both for us and or our 3 year old son. The way cars are presented with eyes and a talking mouth is so original and so nicely done.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson lent his voice for this character) is  going up the steps of glory and fame really fast until he gets lost on Route 66 and find himself lost in Radiator Springs. There he meets with many different types of cars. Some of them used to be big stars long time ago. As a result he discovers that fame, front covers, and spotlights do not last forever. On the other hand he discovers values that are long lasting such as true friendship and family.I want to make a special mention to the little italian blue forklift and yellow italian car named Guido and Luigi respectively. Their characters are the funniest in the movie. They will really make you laugh.I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment. By the way I do not think it is valid to compare this movie with other Disney classics. Pixar has started a new type of animated movies that is a league of its own and I am sure they will withstand the test of time becoming thus classics.	5.0	The fleeting nature of fame	2006-10-25	6	4	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A39CX0EE4BZCZC	Craig Connell	"Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes,"" at least at the time I viewed this.After watching ""The Polar Express"" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' ""faces"" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.As a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger ."	5.0	Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Animated Gem	2007-09-09	2	2	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26BWRBPP4V2WF	Craig MACKINNON	"Cars suffers from that common fatal error of many films - the editor didn't (or wasn't allowed to) do his/her job.  Cars, which skirts dangerously close to the 2-hour mark, is simply too long for a kids movie.  Yes, I know the Roger Ebert maxim, ""No good film is too long, no bad film is too short"", but my young son gets bored at the 80 minute mark, especially since the hero has been stuck in first gear for the last 60 minutes.The story: hotshot Rookie Owen Wilson ... er, Lightning McQueen finishes his first season in the Piston Cup circuit in a 3-way points tie with veterens The King and Chick Hicks.  It is decided to have a race-off between the three cars to determine who should win the prestigious Cup.  Off the three cars head to Los Angeles, but Lightning manages to get lost and arrested in Radiator Springs - a one-stoplight town on Route 66, bypassed by the Interstate system and forgotten.  The town's grizzled doctor and circuit judge makes Lightning repair the road he tore up.  As he works in the town, Lightning learns a little about humility, a little about love, and a lot about life.The opening NASCAR-esque race sequence is by far the highlight of the film for me (and for my son).  The power, the speed, and the sounds of a day at the race track are lovingly reproduced, and even a non-racing fan like myself finds the sequence amazing.  Unfortunately, the middle slows down to a crawl and lasts about 30 minutes too long.  I think the problem is that the creators gave equal time to Lightning's three new relationships in the town - with Mater, the wise-cracking tow truck; with Sally, the big-city Porsche who wanted a slower life; and with Doc (voiced by the late great Paul Newman), the old-timer with a secret.  The film should have been a double-redemption story: Lightning learning what life's all about, while in parallel Doc faces his past and overcomes his bitterness.  If the filmakers had more clearly focussed on this story, and allowed the other two plotlines to recede to subplots, the film would have been focussed and more enjoyable (not to mention cheaper to make!).So the film only rates a 3/4 for me.  The other star is lost because this DVD edition is not up to the standards of other Pixar and John Lassiter offerings.  While there are some nifty little vignettes on Route 66, NASCAR racing, etc., they are just that: little.  There is no director's commentary either.Don't get me wrong - there is a LOT to like about this film.  The voices are supurb, as usual.  The races are exciting, the sound is crisp and immersive, and the video is sharp.  The characters are fun and are worthy of inclusion in the Disney pantheon.  But small children will lose interest because the filmakers allowed themselves to meander in the middle 1/2 of the film."	3.0	Too many storylines gives a slow and overlong middle of the film; otherwise it's great!	2009-01-12	1	0	1
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUHG8KSHI529U	Craig Matteson	"Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary ""fish out of water"" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any ""wow"" factor.The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star ""Lightning McQueen"" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.Still, a pretty good movie.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A77184QJM3PM	"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley"""	First of all, this is a Pixar film. What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere? Anyway, get this film for yourself and take the time to enjoy a little side trip down Route 66.	5.0	Life Is A Highway	2006-11-13	4	2	2

And let's face it, this film seems mostly made with little boys in mind - bright, shiny cars and trucks racing along like so many HotWheels.  The visuals were stunning, the humorous caricatures very droll and amusing.  The story is basically a hot-shot Nascar-like celebrity learning about life and humility in a small town, presumably in the California outback.  However - and this is a personal ""however"" - I must be too old for envisioning a world where the dominant (indeed, only) lifeform is the car.  Ford Prefect made that same mistake in ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".  In Disney's 1952 original car film, ""Susi the Little Coupe"" (who looked as if she would have fit into this movie just fine) there were humans around in background roles, and I think a human audience would have been less unsettling than an audience full of cars.

Not as good as PIXARS best film THE INCREDIBLES. BUt I realy enjoyed this film.So many CGI film today can't come close to story and quality of animation of a PIXAR film. Disneys first try, Chicken little fell short, just not a good complex story, not saying it isn't fun, just not good enough.And finally, why do they continue to release movies in FOOL-SCREEN (fullscreen). It destroys the movie and what the director wanted you to see.Do people actually realize they cut off the side of the movie to make it fit your square tv. I work for a national retailer, who's log is made of big red circles. I love when someone comes in to get a movie and it is ONLY in widescreen and they have to buy a widescreen movie.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2N9RL87HUICW0	Darryl Y.	"The Bottom Line: Go see CARS!!! Pixar gathered all of the best parts of any its films and jammed them into one great film with the best animation, memorable characters, non-stop action, and heart that defines Pixar films. Go see CARS!!!I will admit it. I think I am THE world's greatest Pixar fan. I grew up with Pixar. Pixar fostered my early childhood all the way to my teenage years. I know everything about Pixar. Some would even call me obsessed. From each short, to the inside jokes, and to all of the great characters; I've memorized all the best one liners to all of Pixar's films. I've watched each one of the films a million times. I am the best!Which is exactly what Lightning McQueen, the racecar who thinks he's all that, thinks. After he races in the huge Piston Cup race, but ends up in a three-way tie, Lightning McQueen believes that he will win that Piston Cup. But like all great films, he confronts a problem, getting lost in the town of Radiator Springs and slowly realizing that the Piston Cup is only ""an empty cup.""It is at Radiator Springs where Lightning learns the importance that it's not about the prize at the end, but the journey that one takes to get to the prize. Cars is a movie about how Route 66 was almost forgotten by the construction of the interstate. It's about knowing that judging others is not the best thing. It's about how people can get away from the rush of city life and enjoy the small town life. Best of all, it is a movie that everybody can enjoy.The audience cried, they cheered, and they laughed for the characters on screen, because they cared for these characters. At two hours long, Cars is the longest Pixar film so far, but that's too short. Because Cars spends about a quarter of the movie developing the characters, some may say that the film almost stops and doesn't get anywhere, until it speeds up again. Lightning must fix the road that he broke. Along the way, he goes tractor tipping with Mater the tow truck, cruising with Sally the porshe, and competing with Doc Hudson the Hudson Hornet. During the ""Our Town"" sequence, I could feel a tear down my cheek and the Pixar folks tugged at my heartstrings. The finale sequence is probably the best finale sequence that Pixar has ever made. Each character introduced has a purpose in the film, and doesn't exist just as an ensemble.On top of the excellent story, Cars has the best animation, traditional or computer generated, that Pixar films are known for. The vistas look surprisingly real and detailed, especially on the big screen. The reflections, the lighting, and the shading in the characters make the characters realistically stand out from the background. The filmmakers did an excellent job visually making the viewers believe that these cars are living and breathing, having human-like qualities. Each shot of the film is a piece of art, with so much happening on the screen at one point at a time that one only wonders how Pixar did it.Since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, Pixar put one instant classic after another, creating and living up to the standard for the future of classic films. And guess what? Pixar has done it again. As a piece of fast-speed and high-quality entertainment, Pixar's Cars is the best fun you'll have all year. You're in for one hell of a ride.(Here's a little secret for you: Look out for all of the Pixar inside jokes scattered throughout the movie. There's the jackalope from ""Boundin'"" on a trailer, the birds from ""For The Birds"" on a telephone pole, the Pizza Planet Truck behind the announcers, and if you stay to the very, very end of the credits, you'll get a surprise from the Pixar folks.)"	5.0	Pixar raised the bar once again.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1JH5J1KQAUBMP	David Bonesteel	An arrogant young race car (Owen Wilson) has his eyes opened to what really matters in life when he finds himself stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten little town on Route 66 where folks still care about each other.There is a lot to enjoy in this movie.  The animation is spectacular, the voice talent is top-notch, and it presents good lessons about respect for the simple, enduring pleasures of life and the false allure of fame.  Despite these strengths and some good laughs, I didn't connect with this film on an emotional level.  I think I just wasn't captivated by the concept of characters developed from cars, but my two-year-old son certainly was, and his opinion probably counts more than mine.	3.0	Admired it, but couldn't love it	2009-01-01	1	0	1

The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2VN15501IUTND	"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak"""	"Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called ""The King"" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack ofRocky IV, which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AO50Q84BKQ2WF	Deacon Brodie	"I have to admit.  I was really looking forward to this movie.  I mean really.  The teaser that had been playing for almost two years during previous visits to the theater with my 3 kids left me giddy with excitement.  Okay, yes, I acknowledge that I am strange, yet I am not alone, I assure you of that.  Like millions of others, I have come to expect from Pixar Films intelligent, witty, and charming productions that serve up as many laughs (if not more) for adults as for their diminutive counterparts.  I mean, it's to the point where I am more excited to go to the films my eleven-year-old is now beginning to outgrow.So, I was looking forward to ""Cars"" and perhaps my expectations were too high.  While it was charming and sweet in a safe sort of way, the film just lacks the spunk and general pizzazz that we have come to expect from the people who brought us ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""The Incredibles"".  Lacking in cultural allusions, innuendo, and similar word play, the film is just okay.  Perhaps the fact that the main writing of the screenplay is credited to three writers with virtually nothing under their belts is an indication of why this venture lacks the expected luster of a Pixar movie.And yet...some questions I need to ask myself...Is it fun and appropriate for its target audience?  Yes.Does it have a nicely wrapped-up moral that is delivered well, but not too heavily?  Sure.Are the visuals bright and fun to look at for about an hour and a half?  Absolutely.So, was it torture to sit and watch it with my kids?  No.Most importantly, my kids liked it and it still beats ""Baby Geniuses"" by a long shot. And yet, it is with more reservation that I will walk into a Pixar film in the future...although I will admit that the teaser for ""Ratatouille"" looks great!"	3.0	A Parent's Review: Not as Much Fun for Me	2006-06-25	8	4	4

Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to ""save ten minutes"" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society.

Amith (kndy)	"""Cars"" is definitely a popular Disney/Pixar classic and in terms of quality, has received the highest of rankings when it was released on Blu-ray back in 2007.

These items are highly collectible and If you are looking for a holiday gift, especially for someone who owns a Blu-ray player, a die-hard ""Cars"" fan and loves Disney/Pixar films, you can not go wrong with this gift pack!  Definitely recommended!In 2006, the seventh Disney/Pixar film ""Cars"" was released in theaters.

He doesn't trust his pit crew and sure enough, when he gets into a 3-car tie, the race would be determined a week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway.While on the road to practice in California, he pushes his big rig Mack to travel all early morning but when a group of cars start becoming reckless around Mack, Lightning McQueen rolls out of the back of the big rig and ends up in the countryside.When Lightning McQueen goes to find Mack, he ends up in a small town of Radiator Springs.  But when he gets into a problematic situation with the local Sheriff (he tears up the main road), Lightning is arrested and put in jail.The town's judge and doctor Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", ""The Hustler"", ""Nobody's Fool"")  wants him out of town but the local lawyer Sally Carrera (voiced by Bonnie Hunt, ""The Bonnie Hunt Show"") insists that Lightning to do community service.And thus, Lightning must spend time with the locals of Radiator Springs where he gets to learn more about himself, making new friends such as  Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, ""Blue Collar TV""), Ramone (voiced by Cheech Marin, ""Lost"", ""Born in East LA"", ""Race to Witch Mountain""), Luigi (voiced by Tony Shaloub, ""Monk"", ""Wings"") and many more. But also Lightning  possibly discovering  love.""Cars"" is an exciting, hilarious and well-cast film featuring beautiful animation from Pixar and looks and sounds incredible via HD on Blu-ray!VIDEO & AUDIO:""Cars"" on Blu-ray is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1) and the picture quality of the film is absolutely vibrant.  Colors are absolutely beautiful as you can see the nice sheen of the cars and the reflections of the cars.

Vibrant colors, more detail and overall, a beautiful video transfer with no blemishes, compression artifacts whatsoever.Audio is presented in English 5.1 (uncompressed, 48 kHz/24-Bit) and the racing segments really utilize the surround channels but also the LFE.  It's one thing to have the nice clear dialogue and music through the front and center channels but to hear the cars speeding on the raceway and zooming and hearing through the surrounds is fantastic.  Crashes bring out the booms and the audience on the race track can be heard on the surround channels. Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack!Subtitles are in English SDH.As for the DVD, the DVD is featured in widescreen (2:39:1) and is enhanced for 169 televisions.

A Behind-the-Scenes look at the making of the film and the crew taking a trip on Route 66.DVD:The DVD contains the ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" short, ""One Man Band"" short, inspiration for ""Cars"", deleted scenes and more!JUDGMENT CALL:""Cars"" was definitely an amazing animated film when it came out back in 2007 and in 2009, the film is still a classic and its so popular that toys for ""Cars"" are still being offered in department stores which is rare to see for an animated film.I loved the film when it first came out and the film still holds up today and continues to be quite entertaining.  The picture and audio quality of ""Cars"" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.As for the ""Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that ""Cars"" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.Really, there's nothing negative that can be said about ""Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"".  If you have know someone who is new to Blu-ray and is a Disney/Pixar fan, this is a wonderful holiday gift to give.  It's a high quality release that is definitely recommended!"	5.0	Blu-ray: Same 2007 release but with two collectible cars.

And CARS does. Little Lightning McQueen (better known as ""Stickers"" by his love interest due to the sponsor ship logos all over him) is a hotshot race car who becomes lost and stuck in a small po-dunk town somewhere in the Southwest Desert (New Mexico? Arizona? Who knows...). He has to learn humility and what selflessness really is before he can get back on track (yeah, yeah pun intended).The movie's cute. Yes, cute. I know I cringe when I hear my Creative Writing students use this word about someone's work. All of the hype of the year was worth it for this one, and I know I've not see Happy Feet or Haunted House, but it's Pixar AND Disney. How can it lose next month? Best Animated is usually a shoo-in, but I'll hold that card until after Happy Feet whose reviews definitely aren't as good.

It is head-and-shoulders above _Happy Feet_ in all respects: The animation is better, the storyline is vastly better, and it's much less crude.  However, unlike _Happy Feet_, it's not a movie that does all the entertaining for you with cheap laughs; you have to pay attention.I must confess that I thought the story line needed a bit of editing (was not as well-paced as the Toy Story movies), but it wasn't glaring.  The other downside is that this is not really a kids' movie.  The action is much too fast and the bulk of the humor is in cultural references and comparatively sophisticated sight gags, most of which will go right over the heads of children (and, I guess, of some adults, hence the criticism that it is ""tedious"").  It's an extraordinarily clever movie and can be watched several times before one catches all the little gags.On the up side:1) It lacks most of the toilet humor and thinly-disguised sexual references to which Disney seems to be resorting more and more.2) The animation is mind-boggling.  Some of the scenery doesn't even look like animation, and the nuances of automotive movement (shaking smokestacks, etc.) are dead-on.  Makes _Happy Feet_ look mediocre and _Toy Story_ look like stick figures.  Absolutely a visually gorgeous movie.3) The story line, while a bit uneven, is still better than the vast majority of animated features.4) For those old enough to ""get"" them, the celebrity cameos, identifiable cars, historical references, and Americana references are priceless.

The end was not what I expected, which was good.If you watch this on a large enough screen, you'll find that even the insects are cars.

As an adult writing this for other adults, this may be less a review, and more of a bewildered diatribe. I wish I could put my finger on it exactly what was missing here.  It just didn't seem to have the magic of Toy Story 1 or 2, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo.  I also loved A Bug's Life.  However, Monsters Inc. kind of fell flat for me as well.  The voice acting in Cars from Owen Wilson and Paul Newman was serviceable, to be sure.  The animation was top notch as well.  There is just something missing with the heart of the movie.  I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one, but if you are looking for the the sweet, heartwarming type of movie as the ones I previously mentioned, look elsewhere.

For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?The plot was a transparent recycling of ""Doc Hollywood"", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars."	2.0	Doesn't have broad appeal.

"When my family and I first watched this movie, I was watching it as a NASCAR movie.

As I get older, I understand the 'slow down and enjoy how you got there' meaning to this movie.  This movie is more than it appears on the surface.  Watching it numerous times on DVD has helped to fully understand it.Another point that I have discovered with Mr. Lasseter's reason for making this movie is an appreciation for Route 66.  I started doing a Google search on Route 66.  There are a number of web sites dedicated to it.  Since I already love nostaglia, I have really enjoyed watching the movie and then looking at websites that have the locations that the movie was patterned after.  For example, look up the Wigwam Motel to see where the idea for the Cozy Cone Motel came from.As for the movie, the characters are great.  The voice overs were all great choices.  Owen Wilson is Lightning.  Paul Newman is Doc Hudson.  They fit their parts perfectly.  The soundtrack is to be enjoyed.  The 'Get your Kicks on Route 66' is great.

It was positive but not as positive as previous Pixar films have been met. Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story. I've never been interested in the world of racing but when I saw Cars in theaters, I realize it was not only for racing fans. It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it. Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend. The story has really good messages and as with every Pixar film, the animation and the level of detail is simply breathtaking.Cars may not be your cup of tea but is a worthwile picture and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one. Cars may be seen like the worst Pixar production but even worst Pixar means amazing and much much better than all the competition has to offer. Cars is an excellent film.Video & Audio:Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package. Now Disney has repackaged it alongside a DVD in order to promote the sequel that will premiere this summer in theaters. Cars BD is magnificent. You can watch every detail, every nuance, every texture in the screen. No compression artifacts are found in the print. Cars BD is amazing.Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department. You can hear everything with absolute clarity.Bonus Features:In comparison with other Pixar BD sets, Cars is somewhat light in the bonus features department but still has a lot of insight bonus material.First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time. This mini documentaries include design of characters, settings, graphics, animation and more.  If you prefer you can also watch this documentaries separately. You also have deleted scenes, a game, the shorts One Man's Band and Mater and the Ghostlight, the inspiration for the movie and more.A DVD copy is also offered.Sneak Peeks:Some trailers include:Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)The Lion King: Diamond Edition (on BD and DVD this fall)The Incredibles on BD (already released)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Sep. 20)The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Aug. 9)Closing Thoughts:Cars is an excellent film that is worth watching.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2BEU7GPGNIG44	Dorrie Wheeler	"Disney's Pixar Car Cars was the number one animated feature film of 2006. If you didn't catch the movie in theaters, surely you were aware that the movie was out. The branding campaign for this movie was unprecedented it seems with available merchandise ranging from breakfast cereals to children's gym shoes, books, video games, apparel, posters and more.Well if you didn't catch the movie in theaters the good thing is that now you can pick up the DVD. If you did check out the movie this past summer, chances are this is one that you may want to add to your DVD collection.Cars is the story about a red race car named Lightning McQueen. It appears that he is rather new to the championship aspect of racing as he doesn't have the biggest endorsements and he is still chasing the coveted Piston Cup. On his way to the Piston Cup Championship Race, the big rig truck that is carrying him dozes off and McQueen is accidentally ejected from the rig. This leaves McQueen lost in the middle of nowhere. He rips into a really old town named Radiator Springs where he is stranded. The town needs a new road and they enlist McQueen's help. McQueen isn't quite willing to help in the beginning but he soon grows close to the people he meets in town like the rusty pick-up truck Toe-Mater and a pretty blue Porsche named Sally.Cars is a really endearing story and the critics who hail the film as an instant classic are right on the money. It's a story you won't forget after watching it. However, the film is very long clocking in at 116 minutes, just four minutes under 2 hours. Some kids may get bored during parts of the film. The film has such a fast paced beginning and slows down drastically while McQueen is in Radiator Springs. The pace picks up again toward the end of the film after McQueen is rescued from Radiator Springs, but younger kids may have tuned out long ago.The film is rated G, but I will note there is one scene where McQueen shouts out that he is stuck in ""Hillbilly Hell."""	5.0	Awesome DVD, Slick Packaging, Kids Love It	2006-11-06	8	6	2

It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.	3.0	Perfect for the Kid Who Loves Matchbox Racers - His Parents, Less So	2011-07-18	0	0	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A106YXO3EHVD3J	"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b"""	I've been watching all of the Pixar films in order and up until Cars each film was better than the last one. Cars is an excellent film and visually it certainly shows the growth of the studio's animation. Unfortunately the film is a bit long for an animated film clocking in at close to 2 hours. The characters are all memorable, but for some reason this film does drag a bit at times. If it had been edited down to an hour and thirty five minutes it probably would have played better.It's still heads above the majority of the usual animated films and deserves a spot in any animation collector's library. The Blu Ray looks and sounds stunning and all the extras have been ported over from the DVD release in 1080P. We also get plenty of new additions to the bonuses exclusive to Blu Ray, if you've been holding off buying Cars, the Blu Ray will not disappoint.	5.0	FANTASTIC BLU RAY FOR WHAT MAY BE MY LEAST FAVORITE PIXAR FILM!	2014-06-05	1	1	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AXPN8L8QI2Z4A	"Dr.||\\//|| ""To Hope is to do Magic"""	I am twenty-three and I've been a committed Pixar fan since Toy Story.  I have every movie from Bug's Life to Incredibles; and I rate all but Bug's Life five stars.  Cars was unfortunately not a five star, not even the four star of Bug's Life.I think Pixar has forgotten what they do.  They created animated film that appeal to the family.Cars spends too much time on scenery, and it draws out each moment as if it were some drama reflecting the human condition.  It has neither pep or comedy.What was done well, was not really what the movie should be.  The most memorable moment is a long romantic drive between two talking cars.	3.0	Right in the wrong ways.	2006-06-15	10	2	8

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1JW3ENUR11MUI	DS	I thought I would address the question that bothered me most, is it worth rebuying Cars in Blu-ray?  I ran my dvd version, side by side with my Blu-ray, alternating scene by scene, on a Visio HD 1080p 42 inch monitor.  I even upscaled the dvd to 1080p on a fine upscaling Phillips dvd player.  The whole family commented on the difference.  The complete picture was just sharper with much more detail visible.  For example, in the racing scenes you could actually make out the cars in the seats in the speedway!  The desert landscape detail was just fantastic all the way out to the horizon.  I was sceptical.  I had resisted buying any animation on Blu-ray, but I thought I would give one a try.  As far as Cars is concerned, anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not sure Blu-ray is worth the list price, but if you can get it at a substantial discount (like at Amazon), I would say you won't be disappointed.	5.0	A reason to buy Blu-ray!	2009-02-08	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A7U1ZMV82133K	D. Thomas Longo Jr.	"This is a great flick that grows on one with multiple viewings.  It appeals on several levels:- Technical virtuosity and animation. Hey, it's Pixar.- Characters.  Lightning IS a hotshot youngster in for some learning.  The Sheriff is, well, the Sheriff.  Doc Hudson is - or comes to be - sympathetic.  You root for him and for Lightning at the end.-  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, ""the Mother Road.""  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, ""I fell in love."" The film is poetry at times.-  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.  I remember back then that even street Hudsons were low-slung somethings special.-  Just plain fun.  I wish the scene where the cars are boogey-dancing down the street could have gone on and on.  That Sheriff moved so cool.  The two Italians were sweet, too (the tire shop owner is a Fiat 500, by the way, Italy's remarkable postwar little two-cylinder car that went everywhere from the highest Alps to the lowest valleys)."	5.0	Great flick, on several levels	2007-01-11	4	3	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A5QCKO0LL1D5E	dv_forever	"This is a must have for your collection. I don't even like this movie that much. I think it's one of Pixar's weaker films. Of course Pixar is always good quality entertainment, so even a weaker film by their standards is better than all that unwatchable CGI nonsense from other companies. We can talk about the cliched storyline of the arrogant city slicker driving into an old, beat up town populated with goofy characters all day. It wouldn't matter. The movie is a total cliche, he learns his lessons about life and not being selfish, he wins the affection of the ""girl car"", he inspires the old champion racer to reconnect with the world again, his goofy sidekicks rebuild their town and get back to grooving, whatever... It's not a great story.The story and characters are second rate but the visual quality of this movie on Blu-Ray will make your jaw drop! I watched Ratatouille on Blu-Ray first and was mightily impressed but I knew Cars would take the cake as a demonstration disc on account of Cars being very colorful. It exceeded my expectations.Watch the scene when the main character ""Lighting McQueen"" gets into that transport truck and they drive out of the stadium and across the freeway of the city at night and then across the highways of the Southwest in the day. ""Life is a Highway"" is the musical cue during this scene. The visual scheme is gorgeous, lifelike, 3-Dimensional with an extreme sense of depth perception. It looks like real life even though it's a CGI animated film!I watched Cars using a PS3 connected via a standard HDMI cable to a 42 inch, 1080p LCD TV by LG. Every person who has seen this kind of quality has been very delighted as the reviews here demonstrate and so will you!WALL-E is going to look drop dead gorgeous when it comes out. I saw WALL-E at the movie theater, on a massive screen with digital projection. It looked great. It will be eye poppingly awesome on Blu-Ray too. Until then, you've got Cars and Ratatouille.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A29WZUZFT5T6KW	Elliott	This movie is in many ways just a joy to watch, but the ending is so anti-moral that I fear for the parents who don't discuss with their children whether it is right or wrong to throw a race, even if you feel sorry for one of the competitors. Remember the 1919 Chicago White Sox? They threw the World Series. They didn't get approbation-they nearly got jailed, and they were all out of baseball for life. Is this a lesson you want Disney to be teaching your kids? Motivation for committing a crime has no bearing on guilt or innocence, only in determining the degree of punishment. The protagonist got NO punishment for his crime. All those cheering for him were disappointed. The nominal winner, when he found out about it and it would be easy to find out, would not value his title, for he had not truly EARNED it. If you decide to show it to your kids, sit down and discuss with them whether the hero was TRULY a hero, or just another weakling. Better luck with finding something for your kids. I too kept hoping the older car would win, but his win was poisoned for me when his admiring competitor threw the race to him.	1.0	Bad Morals-How to Throw a Race	2013-01-28	10	1	9

Also, I felt that cars is a dubious choice for animated characters. Unlike bugs or toys, they don't have arms or faces, so it's a little forced, methinks.That said, I'd have to say they pulled it off. Actually, looking at real cars after having seen this movie, I half expect them to move and open their eyes.""Cars"" is not the best or funniest Pixar movie. My faves are Monsters Inc, Toy Story 2, and The Incredibles. But ""Cars"" was still very worthwhile, I enjoyed it. And it is visually gorgeous. The scenery especially is amazing.If you get the DVD, be sure not to miss the extras. The two shorts included, for one thing, are falling-over funny.I also appreciate the basic message of the movie: winning is not everything.

(No Spoilers Included)The open-ended one sentence summary: Selfish racecar gets stranded in a little Route 66 town with a towtruck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. 'Nuff said.Content Inappropriate for All Ages: 2 mild ""bad words"" refering to a place, and about 5 innuendos, most involving ""nuts"".Characters: 4 of 5 cars. Lots of variety in this department. Most of the characters were believable and acted accordingly, but I didn't care about them as much as I was expecting. First of all, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) was a riot. Mack the truck had an awfully familiar voice... *wink* and did a good job. The only casting choice I didn't like was Bonnie Hunt as Sally. She sounded too old for the part.Plot: 4 of 5 cars. Starts off with a twist, falls into a pattern for a while, then ends with a twist I didn't even see coming. Comedic bits interspersed. Pretty quality stuff.Animation: 5 of 5 cars. Animation like we've come to expect from Pixar. I'm sure it was hard to animate those cars' faces.Music: 4 of 5 cars. The songs (not original) perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I didn't find the score memorable, though.Impact: 3 of 5 cars. I'd say this is the most important section of the review. I did get involved in this movie when I saw it, but it wasn't a tear-jerker. The big finale didn't leave me with the sense of triumph which was essentially the whole point. I did think about this movie after I saw it, but I wasn't enamoured with it. It didn't leave me with any hard hitting thoughts on its characters, or side splitting lines to quote.All in all, 4 of 5 cars."	4.0	Review: Cars	2006-06-30	5	5	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A188G2XR43OJJW	Everfree	"Cars is one of those movies that only Pixar would dare to undertake.  Whereas many of Pixar's past successes have been copied by other studios, Cars is a concept that stands alone.  The attention to detail in Cars, in everything from the motion of the vehicles to the breathtaking settings and animation, is simply astounding.  When Pixar decides to create a movie, they do it right.  They do their research and it pays off.With Cars, Pixar has created a world  populated solely by vehicles; a world in which machines not only have faces-- but have real heart and soul.  Pixar's mechanical world is fleshed out enough to suspend disbelief without insulting or eliminating the need for the audience's imagination.The concept of anthropomorphic cars without humans may not sit perfectly in a logical sense, but that's okay-- Much of the movie's unique charm would have been lost with the inclusion of humans. The world of Cars is an alternate interpretation of our own-- it's a ""what if?"" world. After all, we spend so much time in our vehicles that to someone looking in from the outside, it might appear as though the vehicles were the actual beings inhabiting the Earth rather than the humans within them.  Somehow, Cars makes surprising sense... perhaps in some ways even moreso than the world that we do live in.Every scene in Cars advances the movie's purpose and the development of each character, and every voice-- even every spoken line-- does the same.  Cars is simply really touching. There are plenty of laughs throughout, but the real charm of the movie is its heart.  Cars isn't about cheap comedy; it's a movie that makes you genuinely smile if you let it.  The characters are diverse and surprisingly realistic, and the character interaction is unparalleled.  The message of the movie is not subtle or terribly complex, but it's real.  The story isn't anything completely revolutionary, but it's incredibly well polished and superbly executed-- without being overly predictable.Cars is one of the few movies I've ever felt the desire to watch multiple times just to fully experience all of the detail and heart infused into every scene.  To be honest, I'm not a big car guy (I probably wouldn't know an automotive joke if it hit me in the face), I've never cared a lick about racing, and I don't have any emotional ties or great interest in the history of the midwest... yet I absolutely love this movie.If nothing else, I think that says a lot.As for the DVD itself, I'm hoping for a 2-disk set in the near future, as this release is sadly lacking in the bonus feature department."	5.0	Kachow!

He pretty much watches this movie once every 1-2 days (he would watch it everyday or several times daily if I let him); he also loves Finding Nemo.  Story seems a bit advanced for his age, but he is able to sit through most of it w/o complaining.  It is generally ok to watch with some parental guidance - some violence (exploding/ crashing cars), some cuss words/inappropriate phrases (I believe one of the cars said ""oh lord"" once; also ""moron"", ""idiot"", etc), no sexualized images (although a few times mentioned celebrating win with ""the girls"".)

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A32GGXUECOZFRC	"frfubar8 ""joe reader"""	Pixar has delivered a winner worthy of the checkered flag in 'CARS'.  This film marks the return of Pixar to what they do best:  a story about a character who learns what is really important in life (ie Toy Story 1 & 2, Monsters Inc. & Finding Nemo).Coupled with the jaw-dropping, eye-popping, high quality CGI we've come to expect from the studio, Pixar adds a great soundtrack guarranteed to have the audience on their feet cheering Lightning on to victory.'CARS' truly has something for everyone:  the kids will love the fast paced race scenes and 'Mater's jokes;  NASCAR fans will appreciate the voices and the attention to the details of racing in the film.  The homage to lost Americana and 'the Mother Road', Route 66 is just icing on the cake, it makes a great thing even better.'CARS' is a worthy addition to the home DVD collection and I recommend it without reservation.

Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.Gary Peterson"	4.0	Amusing and somewhat touching.	2006-12-22	2	2	0

I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre.That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A19XVT1A1BLPRH	"Girl Geek ""S. Smylz"""	"The premise for this tale is not dissimilar from other Pixar/Disney pictures.  The plot begins with at the Final race that will determine who is the best of three cars and the winner of the much touted Piston Cup: 1.  The current champion in his last race; 2. The one who has always been a step behind; and 3. the young rookie in his very first season.  The race unconvincingly ends in a 3-way-tie partly caused by the rookie's (Lightning McQueen) cockiness.  The result is another race in California, winner take all.  The story finally gets moving when Lightning gets separated from his trailer (MACK), and sentenced to repairing the road in a sleepy town off old Route 66.This moving is a far cry from Finding Nemo and The Incredibles that involved parent/child relationships, but it holds its own.  Lightning must learn that his cocky attitude and always wanting to work alone has left him searching for ""an empty cup"".  There are also some great characters to meet along the way.  Tow Mater is a dim-witted tow truck that likes to go ""Tractor-Tipping"".  Sally, a sleek and sexy Porsche Carrera, owns the local motel.  Doc Hudson the local town judge has some secrets of his own. A hippie VW van and an old WWII era Army jeep add a running joke.  Unfortunately, we never quite feel that Lightning has learned his lesson until the end.  Most of the characters don't ever truly worm their way into your heart.Visually, this movie is breathtaking. During some scenes it is nearly impossible to tell that you're watching an animated film.  The race sequences are heart stopping.  And one event as a forgotten town lights up in the glorious neon glow of 40 years ago will leave many parents smiling.  Also, everything in this movie is related to cars:  there are flying VW bugs instead of flies; the cars do the ""wave"" by revving up and flashing their headlights; characters go ""tractor-tipping"" instead of cow tipping, and drink oil at the local drive-in diner.Parents should know that some of the scenes are intense and several of the Chrome and Fiberglass extras are violently taken out of the scene and crunched, though none seem to be seriously injured.  Talk to children about why Doc Hudson believes that Lightning is after an empty cup, and ask what the difference is between the ways ""yeah, okay"" is said and what they mean.  What did Lightning really learn from all this?  Parents may also want to talk to their children about Historic Route 66 and its impact on the Country.If you're looking for a good film, with flashy effects and a catchy sound track then this is it.  If, like me, you love all things Disney, then see this as an appetizer for Pirates.  And make sure you stay through the end of the credits."	3.0	Gentlemen: Start Your Engines	2006-06-15	3	1	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	APVKV29EDMS5H	Halo2508	"=+= Opening Statements =+=In June 2006, Pixar came out with this film that seemed to be made by the racing gods from heaven. Never had I been excited for a pixar movie in my whole life. Directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranfit, staring Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and many many more. Plus I got a kick out of all the celebraty voices featureing Jay Leno, Richard Petty, Darrel Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt Jr, Michael Schumacher, and Mario Andretti. Thank You for reading my opening shpeal and now...I will continue.=+= Plot =+=The story is about a fast talkin' racecar named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). He is living life on the fast lane, he's very popular, and he is about to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup. But, due to a three-way tie in the standings, there has to be a three-man race for the Piston Cup. On the way to the track, McQueen ends out fallign out of his trailer and left for himself on the highway. He somehow finds himself helping re-build a road he destroyed in the little town of Radiator springs. There he meets up with many new friends, like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt). McQueen soon learns to take it easy, and slow it down some in this little town. The plot is very well done, and the story of how Radiator Springs came off the map was very well made.Plot Score: 5-5=+= Casting =+=The casting in this film was perfect. Owen Wilson leading it off with many different talents behind him, such as the legendary Paul Newman, and the very funny John Ratzenberger. Plus with all of the gguest stars, this shaped up to be perfect acting.Casting score: 5-5=+= Music =+=The soundtrack in this movie was excellent. Featureing the song ""Route 66"" by Chuck Berry and John Mayor. Also ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow. And my personal favorite ""Life is a Highway"" by Rascal Flatts. And many many more. Excelent movie soundtrack and in a way, pretty humours for the Cow Tipping part.Music: 5-5=+= Final Thoughts =+=This has to be the best movie that pixar has ever came up with. The humor in this was way up there, and mix that in with great music, and a great cast and crew and what do you have? *Cars* thats what you have. Plus you have an absoulute funny afterward thing with some pixar films CARS style. This movie is perfect for the whole family, and also for all NASCAR fans, you will LOVE this one.Final Score: 5-5BTW: Just Thinkin is me...I needed a new account."	5.0	Cars	2006-06-21	4	2	2
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2GPN2VKS8E77C	HAMLET	Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death. The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition. Good way for a terrific actor to make his final bow.Rated G.	5.0	Another Winner For Disney/Pixar. First Place Again.	2012-07-06	2	0	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2HVL790PBWYTU	"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read"""	"Rookie race car Lightning McQueen might ""float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beamer,"" but, at 116 minutes, CARS still took a leap of faith that it'd be able to hold the attention of its targeted rugrat audience. But, because this animated film is helmed by the Pixar folks (who apparently can do no wrong), CARS is diverting enough, oooh-inducing enough, and plot-worthy enough that the two hours mostly fly by in attentive bliss.The story and its message itself are nothing new - about how one should take the time to slow down, smell the flowers, and just aw-shucks appreciate life's awesomeness, and also how it's about the journey, not the destination...Trite, you say? Yes. But, you know what? Contrived and derivative though CARS's storyline may be, that time-worn message is still given brand new luster by the very credible and honest voice performances of the all-star cast and by the very outstanding and glossy animation provided by the Pixar Animation Studios. Owen Wilson (the cocky but inevitably likable Lightning McQueen), Paul Newman (the gruff Doc Hudson), and Larry the Cable Guy (that nutjob Tow Mater) are particularly wonderful in their roles; but every actor involved is nicely cast, including NASCAR legend Richard Petty as veteran race car champ The King.I appreciated and was moved by the movie's touching portrayal of the sparsely used Route 66 and its discarded mini-town Radiator Springs, which became forgotten when, to save an extra 10 minutes of driving, an interstate highway was built which bypassed it. This movie's world may be wholly populated by cars but one could certainly feel for the forlorn folks of Radiator Springs and their plight. The extra feature segment ""Inspiration for CARS"" delves more into Route 66 and its pit-stop towns that were left behind, which proved to be the basis for Radiator Springs.Special Features include 2 animated shorts: ""Mater and the Ghost Light"" (where everyone gets their revenge on the prank-pulling Mater) & the great ""One Man Band,"" CAR's full 4-minute-long epilogue shown without the end credits (where you can fully relish the automobile film versions of TOY STORY and MONSTER, INC.), the ""Inspiration for CARS"" segment with director John Lasseter, and over 10 minutes of deleted scenes.So, is CARS as good as Pixar's past monster hits? Heck, no. But CARS, on its own merit, is definitely worth watching. While it doesn't make you consistently laugh out loud, you'll get a chuckle here and there, and you'll end up having a good time. You might even feel a twinge of nostalgia or a pang of regret at the passing of a Route 66 that was at its heyday. Certainly, James Taylor's music helps to evoke those feelings. The voice cast plays their A-game, and, as usual with these Pixar cats, the animation is really something to behold. I had no idea automobiles could be so expressive and could garner such empathy. I went into this film when it first came out, thinking, ""Huh, cars that talk. Okay..."" But the movie did such a good job that when I walked out, I thought of these cars as real folks, though housed in steel, rubber, and a coat of paint. Doc, Mater, Sally, Guido, Luigi, Lightning McQueen...they're all good folks. So, yeah, man, by all means, let's go tractor-tipping.

""Cars"" was thoroughly enjoyable and great entertainment. This was definitely challenging, computer-animated cars. Who would have thought that when it all started with toys that we'd make it through bugs, monsters, fish, and talking cars? Pixar is a true delight. This is a fun movie. I look forward to watching it on DVD since I only saw it once in the theater. Once again, you have great voice-over work and immaculate landscapes for the cars to roam through. All of Pixar's movies are genuinely heartfelt and ""Cars"" is no exception. If you have Pixar's others movies on DVD, then you don't want to skip this one.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ICW5OUWX2A2V	Ian	If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.	5.0	Toys, fish, cars...what's next?	2006-06-11	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JT3NRIAQONA4	James	"I think this movie is big-time underrated.  It's predictable, yeah, but so was Sling Blade.  Everything in a story isn't about surprise.  Anyway...With over a thousand reviews already rockin' Amazon, I just wanted to throw in a word for the Blu-ray.  Even though Cars is only about my 7th Most Favorite Pixar flick, it's a top 3 Pixar Blu-ray.  The following scenes, as rendered on Blu-ray, are really among my most pleasurable visual experiences of all time, not just counting stuff I saw on a tv screen:* The drive after the opening race.  From leaving the race track at night, all through the ""Life is a Highway"" montage, and then through the ordeal with the young punk cars, I almost can't believe what I'm looking at.  A dream sequence for anybody that's been intoxicated by highway driving at night:  the quiet, sleepy feeling, the low rumbles of the wheels, all those lights going by.  They even somehow captured that ""show-is-over"" feeling you get after a big arena event, the welcome of cool darkness and low playing radio after a big noisy show.  I could watch this section of the movie over and over.* Sally's and McQueen's ride together on the country road.* The dance/cruise night when the neon lights come on.  At the theater, I think my mouth literally dropped open at this.  I couldn't get over the neon and the reflections in the metallic paint and chrome.  And beyond the technical wizardry of making it look so real, they know how to make it look pleasant.  I sometimes wonder how many times they had to choose between what would be aesthetically pleasing and what would be utmost realism.  These guys are real masters, I think on the level with great painters, etc.There are other places I could go on about, but that gives you the idea.  If you even moderately enjoy Cars, get it on Blu-ray.  Or borrow it and watch those three scenes.  If those don't blow your mind, then I guess you can skip it (though it might be time for eye glasses...)"	5.0	Blu-ray Review	2013-01-26	0	0	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3UV7L5ND3EH8T	"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C..."	"My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the ""fumes"" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of ""Radiation Stinks"" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have ""heart"" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an ""empty cup"" (like the Piston Cup).The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute ""Inspiration for Cars"" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: ""You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college.""This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)As I said, the extras are slim pickins:--New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)--Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)--John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)--Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)--Deleted scenesThis is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot! Goes to show that one doesn't HAVE to be into cars to enjoy this movie.)"	5.0	Slick Movie With Lots of Heart	2006-11-15	6	4	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A18OUQEK7IZ2F2	"Jason Kirkfield ""The Pride and Sorrow of chil..."	"Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 ""Mother Road"" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the ""whore with a heart of gold."" Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.See also:Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition(by Sheriff!)"	3.0	Is it suicide to critique a popular animated movie?	2009-09-28	0	0	0

It's one of those animated films that both kids and grown-ups love.My wife and I had never been on any portion of Route 66, which inspired many of the settings in Cars, and seeing the film motivated us to take a trip to northern Arizona, where we drove a long section of the original Route 66 and saw some of the sights that the film was based on. Our favorite sight was the Hackberry General Store in Hackberry, Arizona, on which Lizzie&#8217;s Curio Shop in Radiator Springs was loosely based.So see Cars for the terrific animation and the laughs, or see it as a tribute to Route 66, the Mother Road, but either way, it's a marvelous film.	5.0	A fine animation and a tribute to the Mother Road	2013-12-16	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A140XH16IKR4B0	Jean E. Pouliot	"Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the ""simpler"" days of bygone years.""Cars"" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar ""Lightning McQueen,"" only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But ""Cars"" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.""Cars"" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But ""Cars"" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.Animated or not, ""Cars"" is a crashing bore for the little kids. The soundtrack veers too much toward mawkishness, and the languid vistas conjured up by the filmmakers are too glorious for small minds. There's too much story, too much unfathomable nostalgia and not enough racing.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y	Jeffrey A. Thompson	"I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically ""Sullivan Travels"" or more exactly ""Doc Hollywood."" There is a little ""An officer and a Gentlemen"" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the ""Car"" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch ""Doc Hollywood"" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck."	2.0	Doc Hollywood Rehashed	2006-12-18	14	8	6
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KY68OTSNHM3G	Jeffrey T. Munson	Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey.Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66.Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through.Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, so he tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before.Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him.As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life.This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!	5.0	Ka Chow!  Cars is a Hit!	2006-11-09	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3C6CZC2JP67VK	"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker"""	"Criticism of this movie is a mystery to me. My kids has so far place this movie on there top ten mini lists. I have yet to see a bad Pixar film (even ""A Bug's Life"" is still entertaining, for kids anyway) and the only reason that I can think of is how difficult it is to follow a film of such real quality like ""The Incredibles"". I'm honestly struggling to think of a fault with this film which is bright, colourful, noisy and funny - perfect for the younger members of your family. But there is also more than enough for the adults to enjoy as well, not even mentioning the exceptionally high standard of animation and voice casting. ""Cars"" introduces us to a world where there are no people and cars are alive (and not just cars - helicopters, SUVs, tractors, you name it).Once you've adjusted yourself to the quirky world of ""Cars"" then you're in for a real treat. The first thing you notice is the epic scale of the thing and how wonderful it all looks. Whether it's crowded stands at a stadium or the timeless beauty of the Grand Canyon, Pixar provides further proof (if any were needed) that they are the new masters of animation. Everything is bright and full of colour and life and after a while, you even forget that you're watching a cartoon altogether! I thought that a new standard had been reached in animation with ""The Incredibles"" but this looks even better than that. The voice casting is also superb, as always, with Newman and Wilson leading a cast of real quality. Even finding Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Schumacher in cameos was a real blast, although American audiences probably would have enjoyed (and recognised) Jay Leno or Mario Andretti a bit more. Some characters maybe weren't as defined as others - low-rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and 50's cruiser Flo (Jenifer Lewis) weren't as defined as others and didn't feel part of the story - but with so much on screen (especially during the race sequences), it's easy to lose some aspects of the film in the noise and spectacle.The dialogue is littered with one-liners while references and in-jokes abound (Lightning's tyre, for example, are called ""Lightyears""). The pace of the movie also fitted the story - fast and loud at the start, slow and quiet in Radiator Springs - and the whole thing is filled with the typically enthusiastic imagination that Pixar infuse their pictures with. However, for all of the technical brilliance of ""Cars"", I still prefer ""The Incredibles"" - it's more fun and doesn't sag in the middle as much as this did. But ""Cars"" is still a wonderful film and one that appears to have been underrated already by certain other critics. Don't listen to them - this is a family film of genuine class and quality and you'll be missing out if you don't watch it. Vroom-vroom!"	4.0	These cars are just too sweet!	2006-10-23	6	6	0

We haven't exposed our 2 1/2 year old to too many movies, but thought Cars would be a good one due to its rating and &#34;topic.&#34;. We were pretty disappointed.  We didn't expect a 'G' rated movie to have the language and attitudes that were presented in the movie.  When I say language, I mean words that he doesn't need to be using at 2.5 years....idiot, moron, stupid,etc.  We are fairly certain that at his young age, these words probably did not resonate with him, but that doesn't make it okay for a 'G' rated movie to have that in it.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2974Q7L7AMOK9	JetPak	This is the first REAL stinker from Pixar. I hope this is not what we have to look forward to now that they are back with Disney and are are doing the toy/product thing all over the dang place! This movie was loud and not very pleasant from the very beginning. It got better in the middle but then got to be a drag by the end. I could not wait for this movie to be over with. I usually love most of what Pixar has put out over the years and have given them high marks for most of what they have done over the years. (I was one of those who didn't like Nemo very much,... but it was a much better movie than CARS!)I guess they wanted to capture another side of the market by pandering to the NASCAR families. I was standing next to a father and daughter in a Taget store one day this winter and the child was jumping up and down in a very sweet, non-spoiled way, exclaiming to her father that there in front of them was CARS on DVD. The father said it was his favorite movie of the year. They purchased the movie that day. They looked to me like a very nice family. Loving and caring. They also looked like the stereotypical NASCAR family. I guess if Pixar can make a movie that can make some people happy then it's a good thing. However, it's not for everyone.For me it's a big thumbs down for this effort from Pixar. Better luck next time guys!	2.0	2 stars for artistic Effort!	2007-01-03	7	3	4

The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film ""thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak"". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A17MH6J8HKHS6W	J. Neumaier	How can you not love Pixar's animated classic 'Cars'? Cars is a movie about a race car who wants to win races, make it big, and who gets sidetracked for just long enough for him to realize what is most important in life.  This movie teaches children the value of friendships over materialism, and it encourages children to look past &#34;shiny exteriors&#34;. True character and self worth are inherent. My son loves this movie, it ranks amongst his favorites alongside Monsters Inc., UP, and Wall-E.	5.0	In our favorite movie repetoire	2013-11-09	0	0	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1DG29RP3FBQ74	J. Norberg	"I look forward to the new Pixar movie every year, and there is good reason for that. They keep pumping out clean entertainment, and ""Cars"" is no different.I found ""Cars"" to be quite different in its approach, as it kind of spoofs Nascar but glorifies it at the same time. I am not a Nascar fan, but I found this to be a truly funny movie. Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar. If you happen to like both--this movie is a bonus for you!The movie pulls all the right strings by being genuinely funny, teaching moral lessons, being romantic, and being melodramatic all at the same time. From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too. There are a large number of ""cameo"" appearances as well, and that just adds to the fun. Nothing like trying to play ""spot the star"" with a cartoon full of cars!!All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the previous Pixar films you will enjoy this, and if you've never seen another Pixar movie--now's a good time to start!"	5.0	Good stuff!	2006-11-13	5	3	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NKFB39AIEN8W	J. O. Booker	Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film. After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift). This is a great film and one that I'd rank with some of my favorite live action car films.	5.0	Cool ride!	2011-11-04	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1473GFL8O2L61	"Joey Z. ""Joey"""	This movie is one of Pixar's best! It is set in the world of cars with actually no humans and none the human shape thing. O.K. this movie teaches kids and  adults the lesson to adore the world around you and that there's more to life than just winning.Cars is a bout a cocky race car named Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) who is a rookie in racing. In the beginning, he is racing for first place in the Dinoco 4000 race against The King (racing legend Richard petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Newman). The race ends in a three-way-tie and the deciding race is held in California in a week. Mack, McQueen's trusty trailer, carries him to California but falls asleep. McQueen rolls out the back and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town off Route 66. There, McQueen messes up their town and is sentence to fix it. He meets lots of cars. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) his best friend and funniest in the film, Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a sexy Porsche who likes McQueen, Doc Hudson (Doc) (Paul Newman) Radiator Springs's judge and doctor and lots of other cars like Filmore, a 60's bus, Ramone, a low rider who runs Ramone's House of Body Art, Flo, Ramone's wife who runs Flo's V8 Cafe', Guido and Luigi, who run the tires shop Sarge, a WW2 vehicle, Red, the shy fire truck, Sheriff, the sheriff (duh!), and Lizzie, an old fashioned car who runs a souvenir shop. McQueen has fun adventures in Radiator Spring like tractor Tipping (funny!). In the end, McQueen leaves RS and heads for California. You'll have to see the movie to learn the rest.All in All, I would definently buy this if I were you. it is heartwarming, funny, and cute.	5.0	I Love This Movie!!	2006-07-20	2	2	0

Added to the fact that the story and the characters won me over, was the presentation of this Blu ray film on my HDTV.

He's left stranded in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs on Route 66 where he accidently damages the town's road as he's forced by the locals to fix it, during his stay he befriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt), former race car champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), redneck truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and  Ramone (Cheech Marin) as he really wants to get to the race until he realizes that he has to help the poor unfortunite town back to it's original glory.Very entertaining and sometimes funny yet witty Pixar Cgi animated comedy is well done but no where on the quality as Pixar's other movies like ""Toy Story 1 & 2"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and the highly underrated ""A Bug's Life"". Sure it's got a great cast especially Michael Keaton as Lightning's rival Chick Hick with George Carlin and splendid CGI animation, but it's not quite original like the other works of Pixar cause this movie will remind viewers of the Michael J. Fox movie ""Doc Hollywood"" with it's similar plot. But luckily this year's ""Rataoullie"" was a vast improvement on this movie, but i believe ""Happy Feet"" with the highly underrated ""Monster House"" did much better then this movie back in 2006 when it comes to unique CGI animated movies.This DVD contains a load of cool extras like two short films, a featurette on how they made the movie and deleted scenes, it is very good but thankfully ""Ratatoulie"" was better."	4.0	Very good but not up to Pixar's other greats!	2007-12-24	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A13FGQDHTDRV14	"John Wheeler ""Johanan Rakkav"""	"Had not Lexus thought of it first, Pixar could've adopted the motto ""the relentless quest for perfection"" -- especially on this movie. From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; ""humanizing"" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, ""I may never look at a car in the same way again!"" I'm betting that your whole family will feel the same way."	5.0	"""The relentless quest for perfection"" pays off again"	2008-04-24	2	2	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AA3EC3LKOBD80	Jonathan Cohen	"""Cars"", the latest offering from the animation geniuses at Pixar, is a sweet little movie that combines a witty (and spectacular) look at NASCAR racing with a leisurely story line that harks back to simpler times on the road. All the characters are- yes- cars! This may take a little getting used to, but it works well.Our hero, cocky young race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), earns his way into a race-off for the Piston Cup, but he falls out of his truck and winds up in the colorful, but faded, Western town of Radiator Springs (a beautifully rendered duplicate of northern Arizona). There, he does community service as a paver while meeting the various""car-acters"" in town. The most interesting of these is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a sleek vintage '51 Hudson Hornet who serves as mayor, judge and doctor. There's also Mater, the zany tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy); Sally, the Porsche and former hotshot LA lawyer (a likable Bonnie Hunt), and a great little comic-relief duo: Luigi and Guido, the Italian-accented Fiat and forklift who run a tire store (Tony Shalhoub). Lightninglearns a little more about life and returns to the speedway a new man- I mean car. It's all nicely done and has a different kind of feel than other Pixar movies- more of an easy-going road trip than a slam-bang adventure or undersea odyssey. The racing sequences, narrated by real-life announcers Bob Cutlass (I mean, Costas) and Darrell Waltrip, add genuine excitement that even non-gearheads like me will love. Did we mention that even the announcers are cars?""Cars"" comes in a package that's a little slimmer than the other Pixar DVDs, but this movie looks good. Two shorts, the cute ""One Man Band""(two street musicians, a boy, and an Italian town square) and ""Mater and the Ghostlight"", are part of it along with a short but interesting documentary that details Pixar honcho John Lasseter's surprising car background (his dad ran a body shop), love of Route 66-style road culture and research into NASCAR broadcasts. There's also an epilogue with little spoofs of past Pixar hits like ""Monster Trucks, Inc."" that will delight outtake fans. Musical choices include the doo-wop classic ""Sh-Boom"" (the Chords' version) and, at the end, a nifty take on ""Route 66"" by John Mayer. Randy Newman's back, too, with the poignant ""Our Town"" (sung by James Taylor).""Cars"" may not wow you at first, aside from the racing portions, but it will grow on you. It might be a little slow in parts for the very young. Give it a spin- you'll enjoy this ride."	5.0	HAPPY MOTORING!	2006-12-18	4	3	1

The added benefit was seeing it in the El Capitan in Hollywood.  With the organ grinding away as you enter, then, getting to see a pit crew in action and then some kids getting up on stage, wow, then the movie.The review of the movie tells a lot of the plot, but the sond ""Finding Yourself"" really reveals the story.  When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.  The animation is just outstanding, the sound track, wow, what great songs.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3GKPMHV4U64IY	Joshua Koppel	Lightning McQueen is a rookie race car in a world populated by cars, trucks and other vehicles.  Lightning is the hottest rookie around and he has a shot at the top title.  But a rematch sends him to California.  Unfortunately he gets lost on the way and winds up in Radiator Springs, a small town along old Route 66.  His visit gets him in trouble and he winds up being stuck in town while performing community service.At first Lightning is a smug egotist.  All he thinks about is himself.  He does not care about others.  But the people and the relaxed attitude of Radiator Springs starts to leave its mark on the race car.  Soon he realizes that caring about others is important.  His personality begins to change.  Soon he is back on his way to California for his chance at the title.This is a fun and creative movie.  The story at the heart of the film is as every bit a classic as Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  A strong and clear message that shows you can be good and successful at the same time.  The whole car motif is carried all the way even using tiny VW bugs as the world's insects.  Good characters help fill out the story.  Two additional stories are included.  One is Mater and the Ghostlight (the Ghostlight is mentioned in the film) and the second is a delightful tale of two performers competing for the coin of a young child (this on is called One-Man Band).  The film itself ends with an epilogue that was not in the theater that I thought was pretty good and in keeping with the tone and ending of the film.  All in all just a really fun movie that the whole family can enjoy.  Check it out.	5.0	The Fast and the Furious Fun	2006-12-15	6	4	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1N8C1GBFA6EC4	Jrusty	Yes, I said it: The movie is sexist.First off, no girls are racing, no girls are in the pit crew and every female other than Sally and Flow are nothing but sweet little docile things that are obedient to their husbands. Even with the cows, they are weak and easily spooked and Frank, the bull, is outraged and fearsome. The other females are the &#34;twins&#34; who are idiotic little groupies and then the models for Dinoco who are there for nothing other than being pretty.And Mater's Tales are even worse. Every female in that show is nothing but a sex symbol, someone seductive and unimportant. This is a terrible portrayal of females. Sure, you might say, &#34;But there are very few female racers in Nascar.&#34; but what is at all realistic about this movie? They could have put a female racer in to equal the balance but I am under the impression that the creator of Cars thinks very little of the female gender. If you have daughters, steer clear of this movie, and if you have sons you might want to consider making sure they are not picking up those ways of thinking.	1.0	Sexist movie that implies females are inequal to males.	2013-03-25	14	3	11

It also makes you feel good and has a great message of how friends come in all shapes in sizes and no matter where you are in life true friends will always be there for you.  That's what Cars is about.  It's about slowing down every now and then from our fast-paced, rushed world and really look at the important things in life and how beautiful life can be.  It's comical and heart-warming.  My favorite character is Mater, the old, rusted tow truck from Radiator Springs.  He is instantly likeable, with his cheerful demeanor, and comical way of life; a character that sees the good and fun in everything and everyone.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JPSPXBQP6P6X	June T.	"We bought this for our 2 kids for Christmas, having already seen it in the theaters last summer.  Even though they are 4 years apart in age (5 year old boy, 9 year old girl), they both enjoy watching it and have seen it several more times since the holidays.  One of the reasons I like it is that there is no ""bad guy"" as you often find in other Disney/kids movies.  And for adults (who often have to sit there and watch the movie as well!), there are a lot of ""cameo"" appearances, via voice, of famous NASCAR-related characters which keep it interesting.  Overall, a good family movie."	5.0	Kids love it	2007-01-18	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A291Z8JHXPNSBD	"KA ""BearMan"""	Pixar has quite a high bar to maintain and they falter a little on this one.  Based on my 12 year old neice's suggestion, she and I watched this film.  Pixar's usually pretty good right?  Both of us at one point looked at each other about half way through to figure out what time it was.  The film has great messages and wonderful animation but the execution is really flat and boring.  Pixar is noteable for being exceptional, something that's hard to do with animated films that will be appealing to both kids and adults.  It's enjoyable for the most part but this clearly is the first of the Pixar films to fall noticeably short.	3.0	Pixar can do better -- much better	2006-10-12	34	10	24

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1HO9J4DCQDGP9	"Kali ""bengaligirl"""	This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.	3.0	Nice cartoon but nothing spectacular	2006-08-19	19	6	13
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A16BGN07JEN0TE	"Kalyon ""Steven"""	"This movie will definetely make you smile!  It's an interesting idea too.  Think about it, some people do treat thier cars like humans!  Even better than other people OR themselves.  It is hard to believe but I've seen them!  I know there are people out there who name their cars.  Admit it!  Anyway, this is a great story for the kid's to learn about winning and losing in life.  But sitting there for two hours might pose a challenge for little Timmy.  ""Mommy, mommy, mommy, I need to go to the bathroom.""  There was also a moment that reminded me of Toy Story 2, that could've beem cut.  The scene when Lightning Mcqueen is being told how prosperous Radiator Springs was and how the interstate distracted the other cars away from it was kind of typical.  Remeber it was the scene with a Randy Newman written song?  Does it sound like Cowgirl Jessie's story about how Emily (I think that's the girl's name...) forgot about her and left her in a charity box.  It seemed the same.  Well, that's how I felt.  That would've cut about ten minutes.  Other then that, the movie was hillarious, creative, and most importantly, like all Pixar films, it appealed to the young and old.  Good job Pixar!

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1IOJE0W1NXOSE	Karen Potts	"""Cars"" is a slickly-produced, delightful animated movie.  The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.

However, it wasn't a perfect movie that I feel the need to watch over and over again.The opening of the movie was interesting enough, however how he managed to get lost and the damage he didn't wasn't realistic and that turned me off a little, but not enough to turn the movie off.The building of the story-line as he learns to be a good person and give to others is a good lesson to learn, and pretty well done. Still, in the end I wasn't cheering for Lighting McQueen to get to the race.The best part of the movie was the ending, and what Lighting McQueen does during the race with the King. I won't say, that would be a spoiler, but it made the movie pleasant enough to watch again.My younger family members love it, my cousin can't stop watching it.	4.0	It Was a Good Movie, But I Wasn't an Amazing Movie	2013-12-18	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AA68BSG4MNKA6	Kevin C. Li	This movie is so perfect.  It is filled with the funny scenes and excitement.  This is a well-made movie.  For the story, it is very straight forward that Lightning McQueen is attempted to go to California for the tiebreaker race.  However, during that time, he has to face a tough time when his delivery truck suddenly falls off and McQueen falls out of the truck and when he chases the truck back by speeding, he is caught by police and he has to do a community service and the time is against him too, he has to beat his pressure to secure a spot for that important race for him.  This story although is kind of easy to understand, it is basically good.  For the acting, they are all good.  For the direction, it is fantastic because all the scenes are logical.  My favorite part for this movie is the visual.  They are so funny and of course, Ka-Chow!  For the music, the songs feature in this movie is fantastic.  For the sound effects, they are all fantastic as well.  Overall, this is a good movie.	5.0	Perfect	2006-11-10	4	3	1
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27P0MW8TE1JQP	Kevin J. Loria	"Pixar's animation studio has not only been the go-to studio to continuely raise the bar for CG animation, but PIXAR pretty much created the bar itself. One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing ""The Incredibles"" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning ""Finding Nemo"" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and ""A Bug's Life"" none at all. So now with ""CARS"" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's ""Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're ""Lightyears"" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young ""oh-too-full-of-himself rookie"" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him  through the race. This clich&#65533; is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry ""TCG""  as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar ""good luck charm"" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the ""CAR TALK"" brothers ""Click & Clack"" on board, they so needed to advice us not to ""drive like my brother."" Great!Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06.  The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes."	5.0	KA-CHOW!!  PIXAR In the WINNER'S CIRCLE  again	2006-06-09	17	14	3

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A4GB8I8ACS4PM	"Kevin Pepper ""JedeyeNite"""	When Cars first came out on DVD, I was a little disappointed because there weren't very many extras on it.  I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.	5.0	Cars on Blu-ray is a WINNER!!!!!	2007-11-07	111	103	8
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RKI7RPP5CJMG	"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!"""	"The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  ""Cars"" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this ""vehicle,"" I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see ""Cars.""  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.Much like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars"" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the ""Blue Collar"" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, ""The Incredibles.""  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.  Pixar was perfect in capturing the thrill of a race, with great angles on all the racing action."	4.0	Pixar's Latest Crowd Pleaser	2006-07-09	2	1	1

My friend was talking about how great the movie was. I was basically getting tired of the same line of up of characters in the movies, talking animals, abandoned animals, ,etc. The hype about this movie was another factor in whether or not I was going to take my child to see it. It appeared that every one was trying to ride on the Car's band wagon, with so many companies trying to profit from it, it's a wonder if the movie was any good.I was floored, the movie was awesome, I am a grown woman and cannot WAIT until it is released to DVD so I can watch it over (and over and over) again with my son.The characters were perfectly aligned together to make an all-star cast, there is no need in making a part two, I see no way that you can top this one!	5.0	One of the best	2006-10-27	5	5	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A27H9DOUGY9FOS	"K. Harris ""Film aficionado"""	"I really wanted to love ""Cars"" when it came out! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless and it's quite unfashionable to be critical of this movie, I had actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record prior to this film. ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.But, alas, I was a bit let down with ""Cars."" It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no ""real"" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.""Cars"" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like ""Life Is A Highway"" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing ""Cars,"" did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, ""Cars"" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked.

All you have is a selfish young car that learns to love others and to value people and friendships.  He learns this from ""normal"" everyday cars that care about each other and come to care about him.  The show just makes you feel good about what you can do to be a good friend.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AGKPTMTR3UX1R	"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here"""	"CARS is by far the weakest of the collaborations by Disney and Pixar. The animation is certainly up to Pixar's very high standards. Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen. CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles. It is the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), rookie racer nonpareil, who is in a run-off in a three way tie in the Piston Cup. Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Pulled over, he faces the town judge, ""Doc"" Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a lifelong racer himself). Doc is about to let Lightning go when the town Attorney Sally Carrera (a Porsche, voiced by Bonnie Hunt), convinces Doc to lock him up for destruction of property. Lightning must do Community Service before he can get on his way.I found myself strangely troubled by CARS. The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity. There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.CARS lacks the heart of the TOY STORY films and FINDING NEMO. Quite surprisingly, the characters in CARS aren't very nice to one another, or, for that matter, nice at all. Lightning is cocky, and riding for a fall. That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling. The morality of CARS is convoluted and unclear, and certainly much more complicated than it should be for a film supposedly directed at children. Personal vendettas underlie much of the film's momentum.Lightning is a self-described ""one man show"" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.Sally Carerra has Lightning convicted not because of the minor property damage he has caused but because she dislikes the glitz and glam he admires (something she turned her back on when she came to Radiator Springs). She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public. Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments. Doc wants Lightning to pay the price for his own unhappiness.The rest of the denizens of the town spend most of their time complaining about how the Interstate has passed them by. Their shops are dusty. There's no business. But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster. Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine). Mater calls Lightning, ""my best friend,"" but Lightning never reciprocates.Ironically, things don't change in Radiator Springs until Lightning repaves the road. The rest of the town's cars get to work, painting and fixing and replacing the burnt-out neon bulbs on the roadside joints. Radiator Springs spruces up, but it definitively says something that not one of the natives bothered to get off their rusty tailpipes to do anything to fix the town until after they force Lightning to do the dirty work.Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero. Having learned a lesson about community, Lightning goes on to a surprising finish in the run-off race.With its ethics badly in need of a tune up, I think it'd be all right for your kids to miss CARS."	2.0	"""Here in my car, I feel safest of all . . .""---Gary Numan"	2011-02-08	6	2	4

We watch this movie any/every time I allow him to have a choice of watching TV. Oh... and when we aren't watching TV, we're reading the books. Cause yes, Cars comes in book form too.Overall, I love this movie -- especially for the messages about the best things in life not always being money and fame. Taking time to slow down and enjoy the simple things. I also like the way they become friends and McQueen learns to think of others and do nice things that matter to his friends.That said, I don't love some of the language. There are several instances of, &#34;What an IDIOT!&#34; in the movie, which I don't like at all. Why do they have to resort to name-calling when they're angry? Those same moments would lose nothing if they were punctuated by, &#34;This STINKS!&#34; or some other benign phrase that isn't calling someone a name.Guess I just have to use it as a teaching moment.In general, I definitely recommend this movie -- especially for 3-5 yr olds.	5.0	Luckily, I love it!	2014-05-09	1	1	0

Of course, with Blu Ray, you see SO much more, but even I was surprised with how much more crisp an animated picture could be.The movie itself is cute--has a GREAT message, and of course, lots of adult humor mixed in with the kids' stuff.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3JR2NS426T2YF	K. U. Tran	"Short:Get it on Blu-ray, well worth it and priced right.Story (4/5):I always supported Pixar and their movies because they were all about the story telling and creating an epic environment.  They usually avoided all the off-topic jokes and pop culture references that you'll typically see in most animated family movies.  Cars crossed that line a bit, but the story telling is still there.  It seems unique and typical at the same time, which makes no sense, but that is how it feels.  I can't say more than that without spoiling the movie.Visuals (5/5):While watching the film, I kept saying in my head, ""Man, that must've been expensive to make.""  It looks amazing and detailed, and they didn't blur out distance details to say time and money.  Moreover, without the human features, the cars would be hard to distinguish from the real thing.  So this is a must buy for Blu-ray people.  One should also consider upgrading their entertainment center for Pixar movies in general, or you'll be missing out.Characters and Voicing (5/5):Another great thing about Pixar films is that they cast people that fit the roles they're voicing.  No random popular celebrity for marketing purposes.  Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (to name a few) all did great jobs voicing his/her character.  The characters (with car type matching their personality) are very interesting across the board."	5.0	Get it on Blu-ray	2009-06-10	0	0	0

I mean, Cars actually seemed like a full blown movie, while the aforementioned movies were held together by a paper thin plot.  Over the Hedge was a good 4 star movie, while The Wild was more like 3 star, but I'm getting off track.Cars is the newest Pixar movie, and the only animated movies I'll be willing to see in theater is a Pixar, Aardman, OR Shrek movie.  I didn't see Cars in theatres because I heard it wasn't as good as the other Pixar movies and not as funny.  MAN I h*te critics sometimes.  This is a very good movie and should win Best Animated movie for the Oscars.  IT was better than A Bug's Life and as good as Monsters Inc.  While I think Finding Nemo and The Incredibles were better this is definately a great movie.The movie is all about appreciating the little things in life and slowing down.

However, when I saw *Cars* it wasn't so bad.When Lightning McQueen ties with 2 other cars in a racing competition, they must re-race at another location in California.  Overnight, while sleeping in a semi-truck, McQueen is lost in the middle of nowhere.  Not only is he lost but he's in trouble for damaging a road strip and is sentenced to repair the road.Trapped and angry about his potential loss of a championship and sponsorship, he soons learns that there's more to life than winning the cup.  He meets other cars and befriends them as well as getting interested with one of them.  Meanwhile, he discovers there's someone there that used to be a racer but has kept it a secret.Regardless of his friendship with everyone, McQueen still has to repair the road.  When he is done, he has to decide which is more important...the race or his new friends.Pixar still hasn't failed me.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2NJO6YE954DBH	Lawrance M. Bernabo	"""Cars"" may well be the least of the Pixar animated films put out by Disney, in which case the future of computer animated films remains exceedingly bright.  The story starts with the final race for the Piston Cup, in which rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is tied with The King (Richard Petty) and bad car Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) for the lead.  The arrogance of youth costs Lightning the race and the three way tie requires one more race a week later in California for the title and the lucrative endorsement.  But on the way there Lightning get separated from Mack (John Ratzenberger), the big rig in which he travels, and ends up making the mistake of speeding through the town of Radiation Springs.  So instead of preparing for the big race, he is doing community service in a town that has been bypassed by the Interstate and all but forgotten.Radiation Springs, of course, is filled with all sorts of interesting cars.  Lightning is arrested by the Sheriff (Michael Wallis), and sentenced to repair the road by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman in a masterstroke of casting), at the insistence of Sally Careera (Bonnie Hunt), who runs the motel and is also the city attorney.  Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's new friend and teaches him the joys of midnight tractor tipping, while Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) wants to sell him tires.  There is also Flo (Jenifer Lewis) at the diner, and Sarge the Jeep (Paul Dooley) and Filmore the VW Bus (George Carlin) from the 60s rubbing each other the wrong way.  There is also a tin Lizzie (Kathrine Helmond), who still remembers when the place was founded by Stanley the Steamer.  There are a series of lessons that Lightning needs to learn, and this film goes through all of them right by the numbers.  Things might get a bit predictable, but there is a nice surprise at the end when Lightning puts winning in its proper place, so the little kids are clearly ahead of the game at the end of this one.More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of ""House of Wax"").  This is a move about cars, but it is also once that celebrates the past and the wonders of nature as well as what fast driving machine can do.  Plus, this is a film that has Bonnie Hunt be a Porsche, which is certainly a bit of type casting that only us older folks can appreciate.  Final Note: The name of Lightning McQueen is apparently a reference to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died in 2002, but it also clearly resonates in terms of Steve McQueen, whose legendary car driving in ""Bullitt"" is still well remembered."	4.0	"Not firing on all pistons, but Pixar's ""Cars"" is still fine family enteratinment for the summer of 2006"	2006-06-15	3	2	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3LECCQXKLOIMJ	Leah	Okay, unless you are an ex-pat or just plain American or you closely follow NASCAR racing, you would find this movie very entertaining.However, I'm none of those. Aren't Disney movies aimed to entertain 90% of the worlds population? Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not an anti-Disney activist but, this movie in my mind definitely did not live up to its media hype.Saw it at the theatre on the first week it was out with my easily amused significant other... hmm alright, I thought. Maybe I'll grow on me. (by the way, no one in the theatre on the opening week of a movie in the middle of New Zealands largest city at 7pm? Thats saying something)Second time I saw it, the kids who watched it with me got up and left during the first 10 minutes.. kids who usually pay attention to movies.Third time I saw it, I thought, whoa. I just don't know whats funny.At first glance it has the elements of a fantastic family movie.. Owen Wilson, a great story line, awesome animation, catchy soundtrack, little off jokes to entertain the older siblings and parents... awesome!!...but the very exclusive, very American NASCAR jokes went way over my head.Although, it is not Disney/Pixar's best feature film, I will give it props for creating Luigi.

The story line about a racecar that is stranded in Radiator Springs was well written.  The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A11ED8O95W2103	"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2"""	"The first time I tried to watch this movie I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with ""Lightning McQueen"" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says ""I'm a one man show"".  Hey, there is no ""man"" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.I liked ""Doc"" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by ""adult"" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?The bonus featurs are fun, like the ""One Man Band"" cartoon and the extra ""Cars"" cartoon.  The ""deleted scenes"" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.Finally, this DVD just seems like ""round one"".  A year from now there will likely be the ""Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow"" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again."	3.0	Takes a while to get out of first gear, then hauls asphalt.	2006-12-04	4	1	3

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2RHV42BTJSVON	"Liolania ""In2Jesus"""	"With thew somewhat dissapointing ""Rattatouille"", you may find yourself wondering ""Does Pixar still have magic?  Or are they being eaten by the Disney Moster?""  It is a legitimate question, and one that I will answer with one word: CARS.You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date, which would mean it is better than the ""Toy Story"" films and ""Finding Nemo"".  The reason this claim has been made is because although ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" were amazing, ""Cars"" succeeds on a few ways that those movies do not.Let us start with a synopsis.  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name ""Lightning McQueen"" (voiced by Owen Wilson"" is living life in the ""fast lane"".  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called ""Radiatory Springs"".  It seems to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the point lessons he has failed to learn up to that point.The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the characters that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated characters for children like ""Tow Mater"" (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), more serious characters like ""Doc"" that is embittered, and sober-minded.While most these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they here.  Even if we cannot agree with me on this, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will forget you are watching a ""cartoon"".  This is one animated movie that will stand the test of time fifty years down the road and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!God Bless ~Amy"	5.0	Pixar's Best Film to Date...	2007-09-03	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2PI1OI5I02A1Y	LoneCactus	"*Note - As many times, when the film is considered a ""kid's"" film, I watch my two children's reactions to the film.  10-yrs & 8-yrs...As I viewed Cars, I was stunned at how beautiful and amazing computer animation has become.  It has evolved from a novelty, to truly a beautiful form of art.  Cars, especially the scenery, was visually amazing...AMAZING!!!However...I noticed my children fidgeting throughout the film.  I could tell that they were losing interest rather quickly.  I did not see them laughing out loud with any frequency.  Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in the popcorn, rather than the film.  Afterwards I asked them how they liked the film and they just shrugged their shoulders.  There was never a moment that one could really feel sorry for Lightning McQueen or emphasize with him.  He was arrogant and self-serving as Chick Hicks was, although not as nasty...Cars failed in one major way that the other Pixar/Disney films succeeded in...Cars failed to have characters that my children (or my wife or I) cared about.  They were funny, but we did not feel emotionally invested in anyone.  Pixar, up until now, always had films that had great stories first and great graphics was a bonus.  This seemed that they put the graphics first and the story second.One other thing...if you are not a big racing fan, which my wife and two children are not, many of the jokes and cameos will go right over your head...thank goodness for Mater..."	3.0	Visually Amazing...However	2006-07-07	11	4	7

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK	"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing"""	"Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of ""Rushmore,"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and ""Cars"" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in ""Cars"" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.""Cars"" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.  The movie is also family friendly, even for the youngest members of the family.  This movie will be one that most families will want for their DVD library.Enjoy!"	4.0	Cars Sets a Pace	2006-10-29	5	4	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A22RY8N8CNDF3A	"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist"""	"Owen Wilson's friendly voice as race car ""Lightning McQueen"" is perfect for the Pixar movie about all kinds of cars.  The animation is outstanding as usual.  The mega-truckstop at the beginning of the movie showed a perfect example of the fantastic art and culture of the road.  ""Cars"" frames the 'road of life' and lessons old and young souls understand.  Kids will especially enjoy the racing and action scenes.Lightning is in a hurry to get to California for a big race and is traveling cross-country in a semi-truck. A series of accidents happen and Lightning McQueen ends up in a small desert town of Radiator Springs.  It is full of dying businesses because the traffic they depend on has been diverted to a new, faster Interstate.  When the old Route 66 went through, Desert Springs was doing well.  Lightning is arrested for tearing up the road and put in a ""boot"" and impounded.  The rusty old Tow Truck (Mato - short for To-Mato) is voiced over by Larry the Cable Guy.  Mato is friendly, dopey and kind to Lightning.  Lightning only wants to get back to his fast-paced world.The story is somewhat nostalgic for times that were not as pressured.  The reference to Route 66 following the bends and the lay of the land reminds us we need to take time to stop and smell the roses.  Now we have interstates cutting through in straight lines to save a few minutes here and there.  The story flows well and moves fast.  It is a thoughtful, creative movie and highly amusing.All the car characters are well developed and personalities match their make and models.  We have diversity and idiosyncrasy in the mix. There is the romance of the road as well as Lightning McQueen's romance with a sweet and racy Porsche lawyer (Bonnie Hunt)."	4.0	Get Your Kicks Watching Cars on Route 66!	2009-09-05	0	0	0

I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3NM0RAYSL6PA8	"Maine Writer ""David"""	"In the end, after a long race and countless detours, Cars comes swinging around the final turn with a pretty nice message about life. About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. ""It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game,"" etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like ""cookie cutter"" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.Nah. It'll never happen."	3.0	How many laps was that?!	2006-06-12	23	13	10
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A308QC9XPFHFGJ	"Malfoyfan ""Cath"""	My husband and I saw this movie in the theater.  We were really surprised by how unentertaining we found it, and I must point out that my husband is a real animation fanatic.  He would go to any and all animated movies in the theater if I would go along, which I usually won't.  We got suckered into this one by some positive reviews on TV.  I'm sorry to say we laughed once and I looked at my watch a lot because I found it draggy.  Maybe OK as a family-friendly film, but certainly not on a level with Shrek, Toy Story, Little Mermaid, etc.  Nice animation, but it takes a little more than that to keep my attention; celebrity voices don't do it for me either. I sometimes wonder if the people who write these movies would work a little harder if they didn't have well-known people doing the voices - it seems like they think people will watch the movie just because Paul Newman or whoever is doing a voice.  I also think the people who make this type of movie feel that because there are so few quality family/children's movies that they can put anything they want on the screen and people will go to see it because they need something to take the kids to.  Anyway...my husband and I agreed that it's unlikely we would watch it twice.	2.0	Quality animation, but boring movie.	2006-10-01	30	8	22
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AZTDHDUTVOSCC	"mallard ""calvin"""	I always find the Disney Pixar films to be a treat. And Cars is no different. The animation is incredible, with canyon landscapes, waterfalls, and highways. And with a great soundtrack, the music montages throughout the film are impeccable.The voices are great. All too often, the names of the cast of these animated movies are much bigger than the actual voice talents. But it's great to hear the voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (who is hilarious by the way) playing around on screen.And don't forget about the minor characters. It's great seeing stereotype cars such as the hippie van, the army jeep, the sexy Porsche, the old carriage, the German Volkswagen beetle, and many others. Though funny, it's refreshing to see that they didn't center the plot around a silly gag such as stereotyping cars, the way it was advertised.The plot is very simple, a big shot race car learns his lesson by making friends while stuck in a remote town in the middle of nowhere. It's simple, but affective.The only complaint I have with the film is its length. At 2 hours, it certainly seemed to drag. However, all in all, other than nitpicks, it was a heartwarming film.	4.0	Another Disney Pixar Classic	2006-06-28	5	5	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1IBKANWDYYFMV	Marc Klein	"I was fourtante enough to see an advance screening of this movie and got a gift after so thank you Disney. Now when I heard that a movie about CARS was being made I wondered how can you make a movie out of that? Well, based on Pixar's history, I knew that it would be entertaining and I was right.The movie is a fun and enjoyable film. The CGI is very well done considering that it's hard to design Cars as they have no personality or anything like that. The voices are well cast especially Paul Newman who, in real life, is really a race car driver. Typecasting? Perhaps but he's perfect for his role as a ""washed up"" race car. Of course you also have Pixar stable John Ratzenberger as a truck. Used to be John Goodman. Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious as a redneck rusted tow truck. Owen Wilson as the main character of Lightning McQueen. An egotistical selfish person but lovable nontheless.The moral of the story is basically: Winning isn't everything. There are more important things then winning. And I belive, this being a family film, brings this message across throughout the movie. It's a movie that has heart, laughter, charm,and personality. With CARS I can truly say that we have the first hit of the summer. Not only that, Pixar has another hit.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2I6MHMAZZDCRX	Mark Baker	"Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the ""One Man Band"" short that showed in theaters before this movie.While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar."	5.0	Stop and Smell the Pavement	2006-11-07	1	0	1
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3E832FY3AIKFT	"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad"""	So, will this make Pixar's run of excellent films seven for seven? Undoubtably.Early signs however were not good. Although the release date was moved from last fall to this summer (not usually a good omen) this seems to have been more a desire for the makers to 'polish the chrome' even more than it already was. With Pixar having such a strong reputation, they needn't rush out their product to compete in the now almost saturated market.Other bad vibes came in the form of the trailers. The teaser was pretty poor, not anything like the great ones for Monsters Inc or The Incredibles (excluding visuals which were enough to get most of our motors revving). Then the first theatrical trailer seemed to pitch the film squarely at 'motor-heads' with some pretty obscure car-based references.Of all of Pixar's films so far, this probably has the least universal appeal, at least on the face of it. I doubt whether many little girls will want to rush and see it (I may be being a little sexist here and I apologise) but this may be made up for with the amount of grown-men that will surely queue around the block.From here on, Pixar are now part of Disney instead of partnered with them and I sincerely hope that Pixar's knowledge rubs off onto Disney's flagging animation department.	5.0	Pixar's Seventh Heaven?	2006-06-09	4	2	2

I got the 3D version for Christmas this year and I was blown away all over again! This movie is simply *fantastic* in 3D. There aren't any &#34;emerge-from-the-TV&#34; moments really, since it wasn't originally designed for 3D, but what they managed to do with the 3D conversion made everything pop out in a way that gave tremendous added depth to the world.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AG42CYU5P8NVQ	Mathew A. Shember	I admit that I avoided it in the theatre.  Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.  He takes you on a trip on Route 66 and you can see where stuff came from in the movie!  You even get to meet the real life Mater!I am happy with this purchase and I HOPE Disney leaves them alone!	5.0	Finally got around to seeing it.	2006-11-13	2	1	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A33IMLYIVBG5Z4	Matthew B. Jones	"This movie is great family entertainment.  My kids love it and I really enjoy it.  I think it says a lot about the incredible people at Pixar that THIS is probably their weakest film.My major disappointment is with the DVD.  Pixar has always had great ""Special Edition"" DVD releases. With each film they've improved the features. They usually have close to an hour's worth of `behind the scenes' documentaries.  And they weren't released as a special edition at a later date.On Cars, it's about 15 minutes and includes NO `making of' content.  It's a good feature about John Lasseter's inspiration for the story.Usually, there are features about story development, animation techniques and other insights into the creative process that follows the years of work involved in making these films.The Incredibles had tons of  Behind the Scenes features as well as 2 commentary tracks with writers and animators, giving you over 6 hours of extra content.Over these many films, I have come to know and love the creators as much or more than the films themselves. I was a lot more excited about purchasing this DVD than my kids were.Pixar truly had captured the `magic' that used to be Disney Animation, even in the Walt-style `behind-the-scenes' features.  Then, Disney, who in recent years has given us `creative triumphs' such as Cinderella 2, Little Mermaid 2, Beauty and the Beast 2 and  Lion King 2 and 3, bought Pixar.I don't think it's a coincidence that the first Pixar release since the Disney buyout is being sold for the same $20.00 price, with minimal content.  Disney is clearly going for bigger profits and ripping off fans of Pixar.  I certainly don't believe that Pixar would suddenly change direction and offer their fans less.Disney doesn't deserve a 5 star Amazon customer rating for such a lame product.You don't have to hate the movie to rate this `release' as being poor.I'm personally casting this as my vote AGAINST  Nemo 2, 3 & 4 or A Bugs Life: The Grasshoppers Return!"	1.0	Great movie but this DVD is a HUGE disappointment for true Pixar fans.	2006-11-11	47	18	29

But, this movie is done in such a way that those who even hate race car stuff can enjoy.  Like most Pixar flicks, this one has a mix of action/adventure, suspense, drama, comedy and family fun, with some adult innuendo that the kids don't notice.

I purchased this copy because we just couldn't do without it. My son asks for it every day.  Naturally I've seen it a thousand times at this point, but even though it's not my favorite Pixar film, it is still pretty great and it holds up to multiple viewings. The story is good (as is always the case with Pixar), there are lots of little extra touches (look for the VW ""bugs"" on the flourescent lights), and even my two year old gets excited about the race scenes.I like that the BluRay combo has a regular DVD as well, because when we get our BluRay player out of storage, we can use that, but for now the regular DVD works too, and it means we really have three copies:  the one stuck in our old player, and these two.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1U360OMVQRPUB	Mel Odom	CARS is going to be another feather in Pixar's feather-studded hat.  Insightful and delightful, the film offers up the coming-of-age of Lightning McQueen, the rookie racecar that's tearing up the tracks and hot on the trail of the magnificent Piston Cup.  However, Lightning manages to derail himself by alienating his pit crew and talking his truck transport into driving all night and getting him lost in the middle of the desert somewhere along Route 66, the highway that used to be the byway to the western United States.  But that's where the story begins.  Lightning has to make restitution for tearing up the town, and along the way he ends up making friends that enrich and give meaning to his life.Pixar Studios is absolutely the crown jewel of the animated studios.  A lot of new faces are showing up in that market, but no one else even comes close to what Pixar can serve up.  Beginning with TOY STORY and moving through MONSTERS, INC., A BUG'S LIFE (which are lampooned in the end credits of CARS) and including the INCREDIBLES, Pixar has held unchallenged sway over animated movies.CARS has one of the oldest plots in storytelling.  Young upstart with the world by the tail gets taught a new lesson about the real meaning of life.  Scores of movies have used that as their baseline to tell a tale.  Yet, somehow -- probably because Pixar is just filled with magic, CARS pulls off an exciting feel-good reindition of what is probably the most hackneyed of plots.  Owen Wilson stars as the voice of Lightning, Paul Newman as Doc, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Cheech Marin as Ramon, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks and Richard Petty as the King.  All of the characters were great.  The world invented in this movie, where cars with personalities exist but people don't, comes across realistically portrayed (given the circumstances -- and viewers have to wonder where little cars come from and how they got invented).  The tractor tipping sequence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot.This movie is a must out there in the theaters.  Children and adults will have a great time.  The only thing that's going to be better will be the DVD with all the special features showing how Pixar wove their latest magic spell.	4.0	All Revved Up!	2006-06-09	4	2	2

After all, THE INCREDIBLES nearly smothered one with advertising, and it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time!  But, I was proved wrong.  As soon as the first black screen of the movie showed, my doubts and fears were alleviated.  PIXAR still has a whole lot left in them, and will for many, many years.  This movie is clever, interesting, and more and more it seems to be the kind of breather I need to get away from all of the crude humor and cheap, cruel laughs that most movies resort to nowadays.If you want to see a good movie, just skip Over the Hedge and go watch Cars.

I'm not much of an Owen Wilson fan, and I would never watch NASCAR.  However, this is my sons favorite movie.  So, after watching it more than 200 times (I wish I were exaggerating), I can honestly say I love the movie and feel it's one of the best to date.The movie has a number of memorable characters too.There is so much detail in the movie, it's fun for my wife and I to pick it out.  Like the automobile fenders and wheel wells that make up the mountain ranges.  The lost couple that come into town looking for directions to the interstate, their names being ""Mini"" and ""Van"" (they are minivans).  How passing planes leave tire tracks in the sky.  These are only a few among many.Also, after watching it in HD, you won't want to watch it in low def again.  The detail is excellent.  The overall plot is predictable, but still entertaining, and offers typical Disney/Pixar moral values.Highly recommended for all age groups."	5.0	Excellent Movie, Even if you don't like NASCAR	2008-07-30	3	3	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2UJ01OY68CQBF	M. Gil	My rage isn't against the movie, because it's excellent. Just read all the other reviews posted here.My anger is against the reason behind this DVD's marketing strategy. Why in this world this thieves at Disney didn't include an English and Spanish audio tracks in the same DVD, or at least included Spanish subtitles along with the English track. They didn't do it because they wanted to squeeze more money out from their loyal customers, and force them to buy two copies of the same movie, one in English and one in Spanish.I never go to the movies at the theater because mi wife doesn't understand English. I usually wait for the DVD release and buy it for the enjoyment of the movie at my home, playing it in my already expensive home theater system. Thus, if a movie doesn't have Spanish (audio or subtitles) I simply don't buy it. But I had to buy this one because my kids.My kids and I do speak English and we watch the DVD with English audio, given my kids prefer it that way. But when I watch the movie together with my wife we do it with Spanish audio or at least with Spanish subtitles (yes, I commonly watch movies twice). This time, with Cars' DVD, my wife was left out the enjoyment, of course, unless I buy the Spanish version.I've bought every DVD Disney has produced and sold in the past 5 years, but a rip off like this makes me think in piracy as an option....

People act as though I am out of my mind when I say the movies are too suspenseful for little children, lacking in positive male role models, somewhat vulgar, and hostile to families.So it's spring break.  We got Cars.You can be sure a Disney movie will have engaging characters and a snazzy plot.  Cars does have those.  But... Wrapped inside this amazingly beautiful animation are some rotten spots.  Now I'm hoping my kids forget this movie quickly.Lightning McQueen raced a train because he was in a hurry, and my heart just sank.  What did my kids just see?  How do you undo that?Language like ""moron"" and ""hillbilly hell"" and ""holy shoot"" -- who wants to hear that coming out of a child?  Because they are *going* to repeat it.  Lightning disparagingly calls Doc ""Grandpa"" and rejects his advice.  Nice.I want to watch a movie with characters my kids can emulate.  The outside world will come soon enough.  I don't want this movie to be a formative one for my kids.And so you say, ""Lighten up, it's just a movie.""  Well, ok.  But what goes in through their eyes, stays in there.  Otherwise, why would marketing work?Anyway, once is enough for this family... and I remain a Disney skeptic.  Sad."	3.0	lived up to my expectations	2009-03-21	8	1	7
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A10CJINP7KBR4W	M. Herzog	Pixar has always been a great movies.  Cars is no exception.  However, in terms of movie history, Cars was the last of the traditional Pixar.  Since then the stories have been more unconventional, following a rat who wants to cook, a robot love story, and a man who moves his house with balloons.  So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).  Also, I appreciate the basis of the story, the lost world of Route 66, where people cared about there stop, rather than drove past only stopping for gas.  In short, the movie is a resounding success that should be seen. Also, the blu-ray is gorgeous.  It is demo quality, seeing the reflections off every car, every detail in the ground, and you really feel the speed during the races.  Overall, Cars is a great movie, that looks amazing.  Recommended for fans of fun movies for a younger audience.	4.0	Last of the Conventional Pixar	2009-12-07	0	0	0

In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.Anyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..However, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..This DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..Finally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft..

I decided that I should have this movie too which reminded of last June.  To all NASCAR fans it is also perfect since it begins with auto racing.  Movie also had a bit education which talked about US 66 out west from the past to present.  Movie was also scenic which took out on a scenic drive through the desert, the forest, and river.  Bonuses were also interesting too which feature real pictures of the old cars of the past including the Hudson Hornet.  Here I had a bit of fun watching this movie since it reminded of a vacation.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AW99SBGWEXP0J	Michael Zuffa	"Lightning McQueen (Wilson) is a rookie in a NASCAR type race called the Piston Cup.  When the season ends with him in a tie with his two major rivals, Chick Hicks (Keaton) and The King (Petty), he must head to California for a tie-breaker race.  Along the way, he ends up stranded in Radiator Springs, arrested for traffic violations.  Doc Hudson (Newman), the town judge, sentences him to repair the road before he can leave.  Initially, he just wants to get done and get out, but soon he finds himself making friends with the locals, including Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and Sally (Hunt).  Soon, this cocky race car who had no real friends finds he may not want to leave so fast after all.When I first saw the trailer for ""Cars"", I was worried.  It did not look good, and I thought Pixar had its first flop on its hands.  Bumping the release date back six months did not ease my worry.  That being said, ""Cars"" is an excellent movie.  Pixar, I am sorry that I ever doubted you.  The voices are perfect, especially Wilson, Newman, and Larry the Cable Guy.  The film looks great, with bright colors kids will love.  The story is nice, and like many Pixar movies, focuses on friendship.  The only drawback I can find is that it runs a little long.

I wasn't sure I was going to like it, because it was 'cartoon' and that's not my favorite type of movie to watch, but I've enjoyed Pixar creations in the past, so I figured I'd give it a try, and my kids really wanted to go. When it was over, I wanted to watch it again, because I missed so much of it the first time--from laughing!When ""Jr."" came out, who happens to be the driver my ex loved the most, I was laughing so hard I couldn't see! The comparison to real life celebrities, racers, and past celebrities was simply brilliant. There is great humor here along with some innuendo that made it fun for grown ups and kids alike. It's fast paced enough that there's not a lot of down time from one belly laugh to the next... and if you have ever been on a farm or know about cow-tipping, the tractor tipping scene is going to have you rolling on the floor!My son was laughing so hard in parts he couldn't catch his breath.I highly recommend this as a family movie that both children and adults will love. There's even a moral lesson thrown in about responsibility, honoring commitments, not being to prideful, etc. Worth the cost to add to your collection."	5.0	Worth it!	2006-09-10	1	1	0

I love how everybody in the little town has their own little shop and their personality but they all get along.  Okay well heres my summary:Lightening McQueen is a rookie and doing great, him and 3 other cars tie a race.  So as a tie breaker they have another race in I think California.  So as Mac (McQueen's truck) is driving him to the race he falls asleep and McQueen goes out.  He ends up by himself and drives and he ends up in Radiator Springs where he makes friends and learns a huge secret!  And then watch the ending for yourself, I recommend it and trust me I'm alittle older so all age levels will love this movie!	5.0	Cute, Funny, Heartwarming	2008-04-26	2	2	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ	"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner"""	"The courtship between the Walt Disney Corporation and Pixar Animation Studios has been at best a tumultuous one to say the least about it. Former-Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner deserves most of the blame however. He and Steve Jobs, Chairman/CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, were at each other's throats throughout their nearly decade long partnership together. Even after the astonishing break-out success of honorary Oscar recipient Toy Story in 1995, Eisner had yet to be convinced of Pixar's potential. Rather then buy Pixar straight-out, which would have been the smart and economically efficient thing to do, Disney instead negotiated to extend their three-picture distribution deal to five movies. Things became even direr after Disney theatrically released Toy Story 2 in 1999 which had been originally produced with the intention of it premiering direct-to-video. Pixar believed it should count as part of their five-picture deal with Disney but Eisner argued that it was negotiated outside of their contract and did not count. Disney's efforts to (no pun intended) drown Finding Nemo in the midst of the summer season, which failed miserably as it went on to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, surpassing The Lion King, further emboldened Jobs to seek a corporate divorce, if only to rid himself of Michael Eisner. Disaster was averted however when Michael Eisner chose, forcefully or not, to step down from his position aboard the Walt Disney Company allowing his replacement, Robert Iger, to woe Pixar back to Disney. With Eisner now out of the picture, Jobs, with no contention against the Disney Corporation anymore, agreed to sell the animation giant to the company for seven-billion dollars, far more then it would have been had Eisner chosen to buy them out ten years ago.The story for Cars can easily be identified as the source of the movie's problems but precisely pinpointing the exact cause is a bit more difficult. While there is nothing particularly wrong with it per say - it is sweet and well meaning - it comes off as being far too generic. This is the exact same predicament the Brad Bird directed Pixar project, The Incredibles, was faced with two years ago. However, The Incredibles was in the end still able to be overtly entertaining in spite of this tremendous handicap. Cars, on the other hand, is not nearly as successful as its predecessor was. Time is not a factor, at least not on its face. Cars' one-hundred and fourteen minute time-length is on par with the running time for The Incredibles and yet Cars is the one that feels more drawn out. Lightning's trip to California, for example. While it does successfully `show off' Pixar's artistic prowess (emphasis added), it does nothing to better accommodate the flow of the story. Instead it smacks of pride and daresay smugness on the part of Pixar Animation and should have been shortened down. Even Lightning's community service sentence in Radiator Springs feels force fed. That said however Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway' is put to expedient use in this scene. And then unlike past Pixar films there is no distinctive villain to help chart the path of the film's protagonist. But then again this fails to explain Finding Nemo's success in terms of plot and character development. Regardless of what the true source of the problems is, Cars in spite of foreseeable plot devices still remains a cut above the rest of the mainstream box office.The decision to cast comedic-actor Owen Wilson as the lead in Disney/Pixar's Cars did not bring quite the level of anticipation or enthusiasm as Craig T. Nelson for The Incredibles or Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo had in their respected roles. In spite of his fairly consistent appearance in such artistic independent films as The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums for director Wes Anderson, Wilson is judged mostly on his more frequent appearance in low-level comedies like Shanghai Knights, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Wedding Crashers which make the choice to cast him as the lead in a Pixar film a bit odd. Slowly but surely Wilson proves he is up to the challenge. Furthermore, there is more to the character makeup of Lightening McQueen then what lies on the surface. French political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous political analysis Democracy in America warned of the greatest threat facing the newborn nation America and its principles of liberty, freedom and democracy - individualism. Not the rugged individualism which vastly shaped this nation's western frontier throughout the 1800s but rather the individualism which leads people only to think of themselves and withdraw further from the community at large. It is the kind of `no-fault freedom' Senator Rick Santorum describes in his book It Takes a Family as the ability to ""check out from the pursuit of the common good and to do what feels right for me, without regard to those around me"". It is a bit of stretch, true, to go from discussing high-level political-science canon to a children's film about a world entirely inhabited by living, breathing cars. Regardless, the basic principle remains the same. Younger children will likely not pick up on the social-political implications of the message this film expresses just yet, maybe a few years down the road - if they are being educated properly, but adults will. Their embrace of the film and its message will make all the difference.Cars will likely be one of the last, if not THE last, films for fellow car enthusiast and acting legend Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). He definitely goes out in style as the abrupt doctor of a simple town who hides a secret past. Say what you want about Larry the Cable Guy, even ardent fans would agree that his feature film debut, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, was a bit of an embarrassment, but there's no denying the fact that he steals the show with his hick antics as Mater which is just like ""tuh-mater, but without the `tuh'"".Few will likely notice without examining the cast list first that Michael Keaton (Batman, Mr. Mom, White Noise, Herbie: Fully Loaded, etc.) is the voice of the quasi-villain, or as close to a villain as the film gets, Chick Hicks. Kudos both to the casting director and especially to Keaton himself who disguises his voice brilliantly in order to create a rather suspicious character.And hearing Formula One-winner Michael Schumacher as well as NASCAR legends Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Darrell Waltrip, and Richard Petty, along with his wife, Lynda, provide the voices of their motor-vehicle counterparts in the film is definitely a surprising added bonus. Even car enthusiast/late-night talk-show host Jay Leno gets in on the act making a very brief cameo as Jay Limo early in the movie.Overall, Cars, the seventh computer-animated project from the creative and talented folks at Pixar Animation Studios, not to mention their very last film before the Disney buyout, is sadly their worst to date. This is more of an insult to the movie industry overall however. Even on their worst day Pixar still manages to produce a product that is superior then the majority of what is out in the market right now - animated or otherwise. Optimistically, it's about average. While some pessimists will be quick to label Cars as a step backward for the company and ultimately a failure, alternatively it can be said that director John Lassester, intentionally or not, successfully reintroduces the basic storytelling principles and heart which he himself installed in the company with Toy Story and A Bug's Life in 1995 and 1998 respectively as it makes the transition from an independent entity into another cog in the Disney machine. It is difficult to pin down precisely what is wrong with this film. For one it felt as the though the level of anticipation for this film was no where near as high as it should have been for a Pixar release in summer when everyone is out of school. Marketing may be to blame for dropping the ball on this one, at least in part. Cars was sold too much to the male-driven (no pun intended) NASCAR crowd that it practically alienated the female demographic. That said however it is not entirely marketing's fault. While it is not beyond reason to believe that children or even some adults for that matter may wonder what toys do when humans are not around or whether fish and bugs talk, it is quite a stretch to believe that someone out there truly wants to know what the world would be like if it was entirely inhabited by cars. And unlike fish, toys, monsters, and, yes, even bugs, cars are just not cuddly. It is therefore practically impossible to sell a love story to young girls when it is between two cold pieces of metal, essentially. In addition there is nothing in Cars - visually or otherwise - that really sticks out in your mind when you leave the theatre. Sure, the scene with Mater and Lighting sneaking into the field to go `tractor tipping' is cute and all but it's nothing compared to the scene in Finding Nemo with Dory speaking whale or Mike and Sulley `practicing' for the company musical called `Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me' from Monsters, Inc. Not to be so negative about Cars, there are some bright spots. Randy Newman returns to Pixar in top form with an incredible accompanying musical score. And the soundtrack to the film has to be one of the best in the studios' history. It features excellent new additions like Sheryl Crow's `Real Gone' and `Find Yourself' from country artist Brad Paisley as well as some classic tunes like `Route 66' performed by Chuck Berry and Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway'. Cars is no where near the disaster some had predicted it would be but neither is it the best we could have hoped for."	4.0	The Moose Hole - Life is a Highway	2006-08-13	11	2	9

They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.""Cars"" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the ""weird"" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.That a coveted trophy is -after all- ""just an empty cup"".Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough. Maybe it's because the storyline is not that original, maybe it's something else.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4	mirasreviews	"""Cars"" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of ""Cars"" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.""Cars"" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. ""Cars"" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy ""Cars"", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. ""One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to ""'Cars"", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. ""Epilogue"" (4 min) is the last part of ""Cars"" that played over the credits. In ""Inspiration for Cars"" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" author Michael Wallis.

On DVD, he used to watch it several times a day; it was basically background to his daily activities running around playing at home.He knows the movie intimately, and since he knows how to use the remotes, actually maneuvers around the film at will.Well, I was recuperating from surgery, and I plopped this disc into my new Blu-ray player the afternoon after my hernia repair. Ben plopped down right next to me, seeing the disc case, asking, ""Are you going to watch ""Cars""? Can I watch it with you?""The movie loaded and unspooled, and you would have thought he had never seen it before.Was it the three-dimensional, hypnotizing, hyper-real images? Was it the completely enveloping audio mix?Who knows? But let me tell you WHATEVER it was, it worked magic on my little guy. He got back into the movie as if it was a totally new experience.Now as a father who probably could lip-synch the movie if pressed, I have to tell you the same exact thing happened to me. I was lost in this ""Cars"" world. The picture was crystalline; the audio pure.What an extraordinary experience for a film buff! I felt a true sense of rediscovery. Details, in-jokes, audio subtleties...""Freebird"" indeed.Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf."	5.0	Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf.	2008-08-01	4	4	0

There are so many cool ""little"" things in this movie that after seeing it in the theater, I had to buy the DVD. All of the Route 66 and NASCAR elements made this a movie I can watch many times, as I always notice something that I missed during previous viewings.

Story.  Story, and incredible animation.  Their movies aren't the simple thrown-together-done-on-a-computer-and-get-it-out-quick-for-some-quick-money computer animated movies as of late.  Their storys have heart.  A lot of heart.  And yes, their animination is second to none.  Cars is no different.  I'm not huge into Nascar, but this movie appeals on so many levels, there's something for everyone in it.  I won't rehash the plot here.  Trust me, it's very good.  You'll love the voice talent, you'll love the animation, and Pixar's never ending inside jokes thoughtout the movie.  And if you're a Pixar fan, you'll die over the end credits.  Buy this.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1845IJB63D5H7	"Mohamed F. El-Hewie ""Mohamed F. El-Hewie"""	My love and fascination with motion, animation, technology, and action failed completely in keeping me in my seat beyond the first half of the movie. The movie is nothing but utter foolishness.The dialogues are unduly long and filled with unnecessary stories that only belong to the class of senile auto mechanics. The extravagant animation and motion, compounded by complicated dialogues, compounded by bizarre characterization of cars as humans; using bathrooms, having emotions, and making plots, all made sitting and watching a mad theater screen any thing but entertaining. Cars giving fives, messaging each other, expressing every human emotion, without humans, each one would have been funny and entertaining by itself, but the madness of mixing the action of animation and motion was overlapped by the madness of the many characters given to many car models.I could not tell why such an empty animation game made it to the big screen. There are plenty of folks who enjoy squandering their life in watching animation games, but a movie must make a point. Here, there were many points on many fronts. The animation art and motion were truly challenging. The Italian automobile technology challenging the American technology was overlapped by two colliding cultures, accents, and tales. Then there was many plots that needed to be followed in order to live the intense 90 minutes of the maddening animation.I quickly opted for another more compelling movie; Super 8, which turned out not much better than Cars, but it got me sitting and watching until its end.	2.0	Lacks all elements of a theatrical movie. Should have remained as an animation game.	2011-06-25	2	1	1

The only complaint is that sometimes it stops right in the middle and then we have to restart it and fast forward to where we were. This might be a problem with the Bluray player that we are playing it on, but it seems to only be a problem with the amazon movies that we watch. It doesn't happen that frequently, and it hasn't happened when we watch it on a computer so I am thinking it might be a problem with the bluray playing amazon. not sure.

DVDs are great because they're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages...but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English.  Nowadays practically every released movie has language tracks and sometimes subtitles in other languages but this DVD seems like a hearkening back to the dark ages when people were lucky just to get a movie on this format and no extra effort whatsoever was put into a movie's release on DVD.  I was pretty disappointed to discover just as the DVD was shipping that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AE7WX7VY993TE	"N. Lee ""Happy husband and father"""	"When I first heard about Cars, I didn't think much of it. I always loved Pixar's movies but I couldn't really see what they were trying to accomplish with a movie where there wasn't a single humanoid to be found anywhere. Plus, I thought another ""talking cars"" property would be as stupid as all the other ones. I didn't see or read much about the movie in the months leading to its release in theaters and so didn't have a whole lot of reason to expect a lot from the movie, which I was going to see almost out of duty (both because my younger cousins were in town and because it was a Pixar film).After the credits rolled, I knew I had just watched my second favorite Pixar film and one of my top 10 Disney films of all time. I still like Finding Nemo the best because it has a more emotional and universal moral component to it. I also happen to think that Ratatouille is a better ""film"" in general but I had a LOT more fun watching Cars. Like with Finding Nemo, I can watch this movie over and over again and not get tired of it. It may have to do with the inner child in me - my young nephew can't get enough of Cars and Finding Nemo but isn't nearly as impressed with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, two films my wife and friends like more.I liken Cars to Shrek in the sense that there's always something interesting going on in the background if you care to look past the core of what's happening. The world in which Lightning McQueen and Mater live is cleverly designed to be almost exactly like ours would be if there all organic life forms were replaced with motorized vehicles. Even many parts of the landscape are shaped like vehicles in much the same way we sometimes think that a mountain or tree kind of looks like the side of someone's face. And many aspects of the world are dealt with in the clever manner we've come to expect from the geniuses at Pixar - insects are VW Beetles, Lighting McQueen's two biggest fans love to flash their headlights (quite literally, for those of you with your mind in the gutter) and the racing commentators are named Bob Cutlass and Darryl Cartrip.While the general premise of the story is nothing new and fairly basic - a hot shot rookie race car concerned only with himself ends up in a long forgotten midwest town where the locals help him learn to enjoy life and care about something greater than oneself - the movie is immensely fun to watch, thanks mostly to the personality quirks of the citizens (specifically a run down tow truck with a good soul) of Radiator Springs, ""the cutest little town in Carburetor County."" It's always a joy to watch McQueen discover that there's more to life than fame and money.If the movie being great wasn't enough, this particular Blu-Ray disc also boasts the hands-down best video quality I've seen in any high-definition disc. This is the first movie I've seen where I can say that if you haven't seen it in high-definition, you haven't seen it at all. CGI movies tend to have really impressive transfers because the studios can use masters stored digitally instead of on film, but Cars outshines all others... and it's not a photo finish by a long shot. There are tons of little details that I didn't even see when I saw it on the big screen a year and a half ago. One perfect example is Lightning McQueen's paint job. Before I watched the Blu-Ray disc last night (Christmas Day), I didn't know that there were all these little sparkles in the paint similar to the ""jewel"" or ""pearl"" type colors you see for new car models these days (if you've seen the red 2008 Saturn Outlook, you'll know what I mean). My jaw simply dropped when I noticed that because it was just a completel revelation to me, all thanks to Blu-Ray (and my television is just 1080i).Another impressive thing about this disc is the ""Car Finder"" interactive movie game, a first of this kind on any home movie format. When you play this game, a special little heads-up graphical user interface comes on over the movie which shows your score, what cars to look for and how many you've missed so far. The premise of the game is that you basically keep an eye out for specific cars shown at the bottom of the screen. If you see one in any particular scene of the movie, you hit an action button on your remote control and a new car to look for pops up in its place. Even better, every car you find is added to a huge showcase gallery that has a close-up image of the car, the scene in which the car appeared and an audio background biography of the character (you can now find out what the actual name of the Apple-sponsored car in the opening Dinoco 400 race is). The only annoying aspect is that the normal controls for the movie (pause, stop, skip, etc.) are disabled - the only way to get out of the movie is to hit the ""Pop-up Menu"" button.All in all, this is hands-down the best and most impressive high-definition release so far (this is coming from a staunch HD-DVD supporter). I cannot recommend this movie highly enough unless you either just didn't like this movie or aren't a fan of ""kids'"" movies in the first place. Otherwise, if you own a Blu-Ray player, do yourself a service and purchase Cars today... or even better, buy a Blu-Ray player to enjoy this movie in a whole new way!"	5.0	Now *THIS* is how high-definition should look!	2007-12-26	2	2	0

Everybody's looking for a way to get real gone""If you think this is a kid's movie.  You're right.  But it has a story that may hit home for many adults.  I won't spoil the ending, but it made me more emotional than I saw coming.You might expect that a movie about shiny talking race cars will have an exciting, come-from-behind, nearly-impossible victory for the hero in the end.  But this movie is disarmingly smart, so you'll have to wait and see.The movie shows us that sometimes life genuinely surprises us.  And some people have trouble moving forward if people they care about are not able to finish strong.  Some people, including both of the main characters Lightning McQueen & Sally Carrera, don't believe they can ""win"" if they have left other members of their community behind.It's a racing movie that suggests finishing well is not primarily dependent on how fast you can go on the straight-a-ways, or how much you can dominate your competitors.  To finish well, you must learn how to coordinate the curves, consider others, and sometimes completely fail and go backwards.Why do we go backwards?  We don't do it primarily for others.  We don't do it for primarliy selfish reasons.  We do it because we are part of a community that supports each other.And we do it because the process of reconciliation teaches us NEW ideas to solve our specific, personal unreconciled problems from the past.  We don't do it just for the people in our past.  We do it also because the keys that resolve our problems with our past relationships are also often the individually tailored keys that will likely help our relationships with others now & in the future.Or as the movie's song ""Life is a Highway"" says:There was a distance between you and IA misunderstanding once, but know we look it in the eye"	5.0	Bright Colors And Even Brighter Ideas	2006-07-09	2	2	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AHF97M45JFCB	ONENEO	"I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's ""classics"" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones."	4.0	Still Charming Half a Decade Later	2011-08-31	0	0	0

The product info is wrong, this edition doesn't feature French nor Spanish subtitles, so Amazon should update the product specs.

I personally have never paid money to see any movie more than once in the theater, especially now when movies are released so soon onto DVD. We all loved it and can't wait for the DVD. My five year old is just beginning to play team sports and really got the ""winning isn't the most important thing"" concept and we have referred to it often. My three year old had never made it past the first hour of other Curious George and Ice Age 2 type movies which resort to simple slapstick comedy. He not only made it completey through Cars, which is longer than most animation movies, but sat through the touching and funny credits at the end. I used to live in the Southwest so I really enjoyed the scenery, which was amazingly accurate, and now we have committed to taking one of our first family road trips along Route 66.

We know a few girls who saw it, and they loved it, too.There is nothing scary in this movie, nor is there any name-calling.  My guys say they love Monsters, Inc, The Incredibles, Toy Story, and Land Before Time, but find parts scary and we have to FF several times.  Here, the only scares our hero receives are after the mistakes he makes.  For ex, to beat his opponents, he pushes his driver too hard & wakes up on the highway at night, cars honking at him (bossiness, the importance of sleep, what can happen if you're not careful crossing the street!).The first time my kids saw their older cousins after seeing CARS we heard them all discussing the hero's mistakes and successes, and in their simple way, listing the things he learned along the way that helped him be the ""real winner.""For adults, the music is great, jokes are hilarious and the sophisticated subplots (how often does anyone pause to consider the effects of superhighways on the small towns of America, or notice which stars stick with the sponsors that supported them before they became stars) provide thought-provoking entertainment.  As parents, we are thrilled to see the kids enjoy a cool film about friendship, trust, honor and winning in life, instead of just competing to win.The Amazon reviewer is WAY off in their simplistic review of this fantastic family film.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1C7976CRCW5S4	Phantom-X	Pixar is really at the top of their game.  Cars is a unique animated film that highlights how the negative emotions such as greed and lust will ultimately lead to displeasure and misery in life.  It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.	5.0	Charming.  Heartwarming.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AHTZL6X1QHIXO	"Phoenician ""Pheon"""	"Though Cars will not premiere in theatres till June 9th, 2006, I sincerely beleive it will become another PIXAR classic.In my past, I have considered every Teaser trailer of PIXAR's to give me the impression that the film would be disasterous.  From A Bug's Life to The Incredibles, the teasers usually left me groaining, thinking of inevitable disaster.  But every single time I saw the actual FILMS, I would be surprised, relieved, and overall GIDDY with happiness from the Quality of Work PIXAR puts into its films.SO when I saw the Cars Teaser in November before seeing The Incredibles, I actually was impressed and now wait dearly for the upcoming film, because when six films out of six films made from PIXAR are MEGA-BOX OFFICE HITS, as well as Oscar Winners . . . then its future films are bound to be great, if not PERFECT!I give this film 5 out of 5 for now . . . out of sheer precedence . . . but I doubt that I'll change it in the coming months!---And now it is August 2006, and I have seen Cars and given it a lot of thought.  While it may not be MY favorite PIXAR film to date, Cars remains an amazing film in all aspects, and it further shows how hard work & commitment really help in making a great film (Heck, it's the ONLY way!).This film prefectly captures the spirit of a road trip.  I may be off the edge here, but one of my favorite moments of the film was actually in the beginning, during the ""Life is a Highway"" Scene.  The very animation is stunning, and it throws me back in a time when I was but a wee child looking out my side window and seeing all those fields go by.  Honestly, I haven't been bored in a car since watching this movie.  That Road Trip vibe just keeps reappearing, even if I only travel to the supermarket!!One thing I do have to say, this DVD is NOT up to par.  Sure, the Movie is Awesome, and We'll get two shorts and the teaser to Ratatouille, but after that, it's just a few deleted scenes & ONE Featurette!!  This is seriously skimping out on the traditional PIXAR DVD, where two discs will give you tons of Bonus, too many to list (ALONGSIDE hundreds of little Easter Eggs).  Many of the PIXAR DVDs out even include BOTH formats.  Why this sudden change in tradtion?  Aside from a possible Disney-initiated ""Double Dipping,"" I really have no idea.  This is a great film, the DVD should be JUST as great.I'll still give this Film & DVD five stars.  But if a Two-Disc does not come out, then I'll be dissapionted indeed . . . .PS - GO SEE RATATOUILLE!!  NEXT Summer is going to be GREAT!!"	5.0	Undoubtly this will become just like the rest of the PIXAR films:  Classic	2005-11-27	11	6	5

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AB1UMC7SB9D7Z	"PolarisDiB ""dibness"""	Man, I cannot believe Pixar.  I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do.  Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help.  However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations.  I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too).  I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas.  Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.  These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.--PolarisDiB	5.0	Better than ever and as good as always	2006-07-11	6	6	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1TUDEC66M9FO3	Preston C. Enright	"The car race industry is very good at cultivating new customers at an early age.  I wonder if the producers of ""Cars"" received some money from the business.Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids.  How much of a movie  like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy?I thought ""Finding Nemo"" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters).I gave ""Cars"" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it.For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend ""Mothering"" magazine.  They review all sorts of good movies, CDs and books to entertain and educate young people."	2.0	Marketing NASCAR to children	2006-11-04	37	2	35
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1PDVPIGBNW0E8	Prince of Amber	I've seen pretty much every Disney movie ever made, to include the live action and made-for-TV movies.  I grew up with them, and AM a grown-up that still loves them.That being said, I was very disappointed with a slew of movies released by the company in the late 90's and into the early 00's.  They seemed empty, mere gimmicks for marketing and devoid of any sort of viable plot.After seeing some of the initial reviews for this movie, I knew I had to check it out.  It was rated VERY highly, and I hoped that so many people couldn't be wrong about this movie.This movie was incredible.  The animation is top-notch (computer animation has come a long way since Tron and The Last Starfighter). The voices are definitely on the mark for the characters.  And the plot...simplistic, but it's nice to see solid growth in the main character and a good resolution, with a little ribbing on the sourpusses of the movie.Cars is more than just watchable...I've seen it several times, and have noticed new things going on every time.  This is definitely a positive direction for Disney, and I hope they keep it up.	4.0	A Return to Classic Disney?	2007-02-09	5	5	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3PUN2N9OPUB3N	P. T. L.	From the opening scene to the final roll of the credits, Cars was a delight for me and my whole family. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship.Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour. I'm not completely crazy.)From my two-year-old on up, everyone in my family enjoyed Cars, and I actually came to like Owen Wilson as well.	5.0	Should Have Won The Oscar. Ka-Chow!	2007-03-30	4	3	1

I received eight (8) very popular (ie: UP, Cars 1&2, etc) Disney BD's.  Of course the rub is that I must purchase three (3) BD's at the $31.95 price. My first purchase was $19.17 for the CARS BD Combo Gift Set, the BD Prince of Persia at $31.95, and Pirates 3 BD at $13.00.  The total for everything was $60.12 including shipping and no tax.My two grand kids couldn't wait to play with Mater & McQueen and watch Cars over & over & over.  I don't know why some folks think the cars are a cheap knock-off but the one I received are still holding up. I'm sure if you want to hold on to it, it will go up in value.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3IC8ZSANG7HAI	"Rafael R C ""rafaelrc"""	"Pixar movies are known for artistic achievements in the fields of computer animation; and for their accesible storytelling, which is even true at the film considered most ""adult"" by many audiences: The Incredibles.Many critics have panned ""Cars"" by calling it cliched and predictable, cheesy and formulaic. Yes, it might be cliched and predictable, it might have a lot of cheese and it follows the ""we-teach-you-sound-values"" formula. But then, why is it that this movie is striking a chord on many people? Maybe is it because we have precisely forgotten about these values?In this era and age of Instant Messaging, Blackberry, ""Date Movies"" and Tarantino gore, sometimes you welcome an effort like ""Cars"". You need to be reminded that we get so stuck in our own goals, our jobs, our careers and where we want to get, that we tend to forget what's important and to take a pause and enjoy all the blessings surrounding us. And that's the message this movie brings us, which is a lot deeper that the ""talking car"" facade might lead us to believe.Lightning McQueen is a hot-shot rookie in the world of stock car racing; he's so much into his own success and arrogance he has forgot the fact no one is an island. He will get a heavy dose of reality while being lost, finding Route 66, a forgotten town, love and friendship; while learning about a place that was scratched off the map because of so-called ""progress"".Sometimes a message like that is stronger if we take the context out of our own backgrounds and place them somewhere else. And that's precisely what Pixar does by bringing fantasy characters that have some credibility on them (talking cars that actually bend and move like real cars) to that context, while not forgetting the comedy and a lot of humor. So many jokes are there you'll need the DVD version to get them all.The soundtrack is dead on-target, from the rockin' ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow, serving as an almost operatic introduction to McQueen to the teary ""Our Town"" by James Taylor and a nice version of ""Life is a Highway"" by Rascal Flatts.Yes, the movie is a bit long, but we in the audience at the theatre didn't really feel it; you won't help but feel identified with the characters: my girlfriend and I looked at some scenes in which McQueen and Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) were involved, and we saw ourselves reflected at those characters and personalities (Yes, I'm a tad cocky and career-oriented, sorry folks).I'm not a fan of Disney movies and I have entirely avoided animation pictures, including all of Pixar's previous efforts, except for The Incredibles on HBO. But something told me I should watch this one, and I am not disappointed. There must be something powerful about an animated movie that makes you put your life into a new perspective, and finish your day praying and thanking God for all the wonderful things you enjoy, most especially your family and friends.Life is indeed a journey, and there a lot of things to be enjoyed and learned while you get to your destination, including friendship and sportsmanship. And that message some people might call ""dated"" to be reflected in movies, is precisely the kind of message I'd like to bring and pass to my children, if I ever am blessed to have them."	4.0	An instant classic	2006-07-10	6	4	2

Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides.The characters' witty names reflect their personalities and help with screen play motion:  ""Lightening McQueen"" (Bullitt and the Cooler King would've driven this racer), ""The King"" (Petty's Superbird always grabs my attention!), ""Tow Mater"", etc.  This movie is brilliant and funny.  Your entire family will enjoy this DVD.  Your little ones will, especially, like it.I always prefer the wide screen version, but have also watched a friend's full screen ""Cars"".  Both are great.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A310KT1UQC5UNU	Reading Fanatic (CMP)	This movie is my 4 year old son's all time favorite movie--Cars 2 is a close runner up.  He wasn't even born yet when this movie was released, but as soon as he was old enough to pay attention to a full length movie (around 2 years old) he watched this one, and has been hooked ever since.  Since then he's watched this movie umpteen times--I really cannot give an accurate count, but the number is astronomical.  It's so bad that I've had to purchase this DVD at least twice.  We originally purchased the two-disc pack--DVD, Blu-ray combo.  But my son watches the movie so often, and insists on handling the discs himself, that invariably they get scratched--he usually watches the DVD on his portable DVD player, which he can operate by himself.  Luckily our Blu-ray copy has survived his rough handling.  LOL  I purchased this widescreen DVD as a replacement for the two-disc combo set that I previously purchased.  My husband and I both prefer the wide-screen versions of movies, but my son couldn't care less--widescreen or full-screen makes no difference to him.  Since it would be a catastrophe on par with a world war if he could no longer watch the movie on his portable DVD player, I am forced to replace the DVD whenever it is damaged.  LOL  Luckily, now that he's 4 and smarter, we no longer have that problem.  This is a great family friendly movie that is sure to delight viewers of all ages-my husband, I and our 6 year old daughter also love this movie.  It's a beautiful story about the value of friendship.	5.0	My Son's All Time Favorite Movie	2014-04-15	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ANUBY6KOT60WH	R. Galeano Valencia	"A lovely movie that leaves the kids with a beautiful life lesson and big time entertaining for the whole family. Main character is Lightning McQueen, a beautiful little spoiled racing car too vain of his own early success to see beyond his own unexperience. Too proud and sure of himself to rely on others' advice, and believing that he would never be in need of anyone else. When he accidentally falls off the truck that was taking him to California to participate in the Piston Racing Coup, he finds himself on his own in an unknown place. Lost and alone he gets to Radiator Springs, a long-ago forgotten community struggling to stay in business nevertheless no big roads or highways pass nearby. A bunch of colorful guys there, with engines and parts perhaps not so brand-new and shiny but with certainly far more experience will eventually make him value all those meaningful and important things that go far beyond the mere outside looks and efervescent success: friendship, companionship, experience, and love....And plus: what a soundtrack! Rascal Flatts' version of ""Life is a highway"" got me rocking all the way home after the movie theater... These guys are just purely and plainly great and make unbelievable music, even when remaking a new version of this famous 80's tune. I love them. Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" opening theme rocks! The rest of the soundtrack is just as great combining classic tunes by Chuck Berry and James Taylor with performances by Brad Paisley, John Mayer and others.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A107EAFS38OY3O	R. G. Tichy	"Of all the movies Pixar has made this one left me the least amused once I left the theatre.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is cute (but not really funny).  The soundtrack is great for the movie but it's pretty cliche.  The soundtrack in particular does not hold a candle to the ones Randy Newman made for the Toy Story movies.  ""Life is a Highway"" rocks out and starts the movie with a serious bang, but my 6 year old thought it was too loud.  A lot of little kids were holding their ears at the start of the movie.The plot is entertaining but it doesn't really function on that ""next level"" that many of the Pixar movies do.  And it is impossible not to remember ""Doc Hollywood"" with Michael J. Fox and think Fox would not have been better than Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen.I guess I think Monsters, Inc. and the Toy Story movies were much better than this one because they created characters that expanded out of the worlds of children.  Also, Monster, Inc. and Finding Nemo both talk to the adults in the audience about parenting while entertaining the kids you went with to the movie.  It's just genius that they can pull that off.  I don't see Cars trying to pull off anything so admirable, heck, it doesn't even function on a level other than the one the kids are watching, too.  I admit there is a nostalgia thing going that kids might not quite understand but it is an upfront part of the movie plot.  The nostalgia gets a little drippy too and probably takes aim at grandparents more than 35-year-old parents because it is all about ""life before the interstate"" which was created in the late 50's early 60's..."	3.0	Not the best of the Pixar bunch	2006-11-03	20	12	8

After huge successes like ""Toy Story"" ""A Bug's Life"" ""Toy Story 2"" ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo,"" they come out with another Box Office winner in ""Cars."" But compared to their previous releases, I rank this latest offering last. It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings.

As Pixar always does, the animation was outstanding, and the story was top notch.  The kids can see all of the cool race cars, while the adults can appreciate the story about individuals who care about each other.This movie has definitely been one of the better movies of the summer.  We need more movies to remind us that life is too short to not stop and smell the roses.  We need to appreciate those around us and what they bring to our lives.  Towards the end of the movie, when Lightning McQueen stops right before the finish line and goes to push ""The King"" over the finish line, the viewer can see McQueen's transformation from a selfish race car to one who realizes that he needs others on his team in order to succeed.I wish that there were more movies out there with such a positive message and lots of humor.  It is ironic that a movie about cars can remind me of why we need other people in our lives.Pixar does it again.  Cars hits a homerun, scores a touchdown, and wins first prize in the race.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2EDZH51XHFA9B	"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal"""	"Cars (John Lasseter,2006)The main problem I have with Cars will not be shared by the majority of its viewers, nor even the majority of Americans. It's the naked end result of a love affair with NASCAR, and all NASCAR represents. Still, if anyone can take NASCAR and make it worth watching, it's Pixar. And they do a relatively good job of it, despite the instant-death casting moves of putting Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy (are you getting the ""all NASCAR represents"" vibe yet?) in two major roles.Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Wilson), a self-absorbed rookie racer who overcomes overwhelming obstacles to finish in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup, racing's greatest honor. (That he put himself in the position to be burdened with overwhelming obstacles is a minor, but important, point.) The talking heads decree that The three finishers-- McQueen, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton)-- will have a race-off in California in one week. On the way there, thanks to various shenannigans, McQueen finds himself stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, having caused a great deal of damage to the stretch of Route 66 that passes through the town. The town judge, Doc (Paul Newman), sentences McQueen to repave the section of road he destroyed. Which, of course, leads to McQueen getting to know the locals and coming to care about something other than his own existence. Roll credits, another happy ending in the books.So, yeah, it's predictable. But the predictability doesn't take into account the Pixar magic, which flows as strongly as ever here. And I mean strong-- if it can make me like anything even remotely NASCAR-related (or Larry the Cable Guy related), there's some serious mojo workin' in the Pixar studios.It's not much of a surprise that Cars works as well as it does; Lasseter was the guy behind both Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life, three of Pixar's strongest offerings. He uses the same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula. After all, it's a formula because it works.Pixar strikes again. *** "	4.0	Really, only Pixar could make NASCAR entertaining.	2006-08-14	8	3	5

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1OBPHRXHZF8P6	"Robin Orlowski ""political activist"""	Through expert execution of Pixar technology, a young and initially feisty hot rod experiences a powerful coming of age after getting quite unexpectedly (from his perspective--of course!) stranded in small-town Radiator Springs enroute to California for the big race.The cars used in this film initially were introduced to myself and many other viewers through Chevron gasoline ads. However, film producers recognized that this project wouldn't have even made it out of the garage were it a corporate vehicle for Chevron. Instead, animation provides backdrop for a genuinely compelling coming-of-age story.Thinking of himself as hot stuff, Lightning McQueen is initially mortified by the judge's final sentence. Upon the recommendation of Sally, he gets ordered to stay and make amends for the street which he had destroyed--however accidentally--in his rush out to California. What was 'nothing' to him is home to these cars.Lightning is initially dismissive both of the town and its residents--convinced they cannot teach him anything.However, subsequently being bested by Doc in another race then takes him down a notch. For a 'family' movie, 'Cars' also contains very powerful and ever-relevant sociopolitical critiques of how highway expansion ultimately damages communities; Lightning discovers this ' helpful innovation' actually choked off the town's once vibrant tourist industry--killing their economy in the process.He also learns that the now-elderly Doc was once just like himself. This too adds depth to the movie. Despite the graying of America, we remain a very youth-obessed culture.  Contrasting with other nations, anything perceived to do with the elderly still gets perceived as `worn', `outdated' and `inferior'.Finally making it out to California, Lightning is surprised to find himself repeatedly thinking about Radiator Springs. Discovering that his new friends came to cheer him on, he is heartened. Although he does not win that coveted race, he does win the race of car life. A wiser Lightning returns to help revitalize Radiator Springs--in the tradition of all great movie heroes.In other words, it's not the typical `family fluff' which shies away from discussing anything substantive.

First, it's just plain beautiful to look at. The computer animation is absolutely state of the art and makes things like Toy Story look downright crude by comparison.Secondly, it creates characters you can love and laugh with. All the actors who do the voices are fantastic! The story is heartwarming and gives a great message, without being condescending or politically correct. There is lots of humor for kids, as well as subtle stuff for parents to enjoy too.My only complaint I was hoping for more Bonus Feature material. The two short films ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" and ""One Man Band"" are great and I guess I just wish there were more extras like them. The storyboard type stuff was so-so.I can whole-heartedly recommend this movie. I can't remember the last movie I enjoyed watching over and over again so much.

Pixar, similar to Toy Story, puts heavy duty race cars in a human light -- not one character in the movie is human.  Lighting McQueen an arrogant, rookie race car is aiming to win The Piston Cup.  If he wins he'!l get a major endorsement and be one of the elite cars of all of racing!  However because of his arrogance and his lack of respect for people in the field of racing, he finds himself friendless. So happens, his life takes a dramatic turn as he is lead into a run down town by the name of Radiator Spring off Route 66.  He meets a several fellow town's cars, especially those that help impact him in a positive light as it reaches it's climax.  The amination of the film is creative and brillant use of color.  The sound is vibrant as you really feel like you are on a race track or driving down a highway.  The voices are pretty good, my favorite of course is from the late Paul Newman who plays Doc Hudson.  For what it's worth the movie is terrific!  It is definetly a family movie and Pixar once more proves their excellence in pictures by using cars to tell fun, thoughtful, and real storytelling.	5.0	Cars Have Feelings Too!	2012-01-11	0	0	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A19ZXK9HHVRV1X	Roland E. Zwick	"***1/2So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles?  ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings.  It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen.  The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices.  It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse.  While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town.  The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations.  It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn`t winning the big race).The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival.  There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town`s medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo.  There's also an assortment of ethnic types with thick accents to flesh out the scene and indicate what a melting pot even an America made up entirely of motor vehicles would be.  A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman.  You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie.  Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, ""Cars"" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features.  Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile.  Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and ""drive"" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip.  Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves.  For a movie built entirely on driving, ""Cars"" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.  The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to ""drag"" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does.  There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter.  In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as ""The Great Race,""  ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" as its source of inspiration.  Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film.  These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer.  But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, ""Cars"" is too often stuck in neutral."	3.0	fantastic animation but too often stuck in neutral	2007-01-24	3	2	1

As some mentioned, you can purchase a online viewing from Disney website for $5.99 but that's not like actually getting a digital copy on your iTunes to put it on iPhones, iPad, or iPod...etc (which doesn't require internet to watch movie).  If you have other Disney movies with Digital Copy you can register them and get the online viewing for free.  Unless you really need this movie now I recommend waiting for Cars 1 & 2 Combo package.  I'm sure digital copy will be included and movies will be 3D.	4.0	No Digital Copy	2011-06-22	2	1	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A26WVK274IA7DN	Sarah Bellum	"Pixar usually makes children's films that also appeal to adults on many levels, including jokes that fly well above the heads of youngsters. My son, who is three, loves to watch the first ten minutes of ""Cars."" Then he gets extremely bored and stops watching. Good films, such as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and ""Toy Story,"" will hold his attention for the duration. (He knows ""Finding Nemo"" from start to finish and has watched it, at minimum, fifty times.)  I also enjoy good children's movies (I know most of the lines from ""Finding Nemo""), yet I find this film tedious. At a runtime of nearly two hours, I cannot sit through the entire movie in one sitting and even then have a difficult time watching all of it. It starts out well enough and the ending, with its positive messages of friendship, loyalty and good sportsmanship, is quite good. Much of the material in between, however, is fairly weak. Scenes drag on far too long and are just plain dull. The messages could have been conveyed in fewer and more truncated scenes and still have been as effective. The basis for a very good film here is certainly evident. As usual, Pixar's animation is excellent and the tone is just right for kids: simple without being condescending and with very sparse scatological humor (which is an astonishing feat, given Larry the Cable Guy's involvement). The voice acting is well cast and features uniformly fine performances. With more judicious writing and editing, ""Cars"" could have been another Pixar classic.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3RTR8Q4POQCKW	SaveUsMike	I used to work at the Disney Store in Times Square and while we sold a large plethora of Disney merch, Cars had always been the number one selling item. Ironically Cars was also the sole Pixar film I had not seen. Pixar to me is perfect and only makes Masterpieces, Even the companies OK work (Bugs life and Brave) is still lightyears better than 95 percent of most animated features on the market. So combining my love for Pixar as well as the dozens and dozens of medicore Cars reviews I have heard, I decided to pretend this cheesy looking cash grab didn't exist.Now we cut to almost 8 years since the movie came out and my completionist inner self came out and I finally said &#34;Ugh I guess I should so I can say I have watched every Pixar film...&#34;.I can't believe I waited this long to see what has to be one of my new favorite Pixar films! I don't know what to tell you, I was on a flight when I watched it and was very tired. Maybe it was the excitement of my upcoming trip (I was going to Disney World), or maybe I was just drunk still from the night before. I ended up loving this movie 10 times more than I thought I would have. While my review is 8 years too late I will skip the story synopsis and give some of my own personal highlights from the film.Radiator Springs - If this movie was set in the big city I most likely would have been turned off. I am a sucker for nostalgia. Radiator Springs struck me as a old town you expect to see in 1950s America. Mom and pop shops, everyone knows your name, people take pride in their business as well as town. That sort of this captivates me and has me care.Mater - While I can see the hate for Mater his comparison to being Pixars Jar Jar Binks is just ludicrous! No matter what at the end of the day, as adult as most Pixar movies can be, there primary audience and demographic will always be geared towards children. With that being said I can appreciate children's love for Mater and at the same time love his selfless morals that can instill values in children regarding loyalty and friendshipMorals - This hit a big one with me. Yes the &#34;Winning isn't everything&#34; message is in a million movies but I loved it here. At the end of the movie (which is geared towards children may I remind you!) it teaches a message that sometimes winning isn't everything and trying your hardest is most important in life.Now I know I sound all preachy with my review but I assure you this is not some super duper christian morals review or some right wing conservative view. I am an adult with very adult tastes regarding movies but I felt compelled to rate this review towards its primary demo, Children and there parents. As an adult who's favorite movies include Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, The Departed, The Nightmare before Christmas, etc. I have no problem dumbing down my expectations for a movie that wasn't even aimed at my age group to begin with (I am 23 now).While I wrap this up I hope maybe I provided some thoughts or insight for people on the fence about this movie even if I am almost a decade too late! With that being said I most likely won't watch Cars 2 (Come on you read the reviews!) but who's to say? See you in another 8 years!!!	4.0	I waited almost 8 years before I finally caved	2014-02-02	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A34TNH973Q9XT0	Serena Reed	"I have enjoyed many G rated ""kiddie"" movies over the years, but this is not one that I would ever watch again.  The movie starts off somewhat exciting, but as soon as you start to get into the action, it becomes boring and uneventful.  I felt like the majority of the movie was like a long, slow story about how the main character learns humility.  Okay, maybe this would have been okay, but not for most of the movie.  Somewhere along the lines there has to be more action and humor.  The funny moments are few and far between.  Most of the humor relies on jokes about how the other characters are presented.  How this is supposed to be funny for a over an hour is beyond me.  You giggle about how the characters talk for a few minutes and then you look for more, but you don't get it.  After all of this, the movie has a rather boring ending that almost makes you feel let down after you have waited for so long for more action.  In the end I would have to say that this one is a rental only.  I would never watch it again and the kids that I know were all unimpressed.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A16IITISD2LAX0	ServantofGod	"My wife and I watched the DVD three weeks ago at home and immediately regarded it as ""Movie of the Year"". The CG is stunning as expected, but it's success is primarily attributed to the great story/script and the outstanding details which captivate its audience all the way. I had the impulse to write a review immediately then but had been stopped by the many negative reviews that complained it's too targeted at adults and not so good for kids as other Pixar movies. I thought, ""May be I am really too old (40) and so I have rated too high an animaion that tributed to the aged or the veterans."" However, last night, when we were in a mall watching an AV shop showing it in a 42"" 1080P True HD Sony LCDTV, together with many little kids and their parents, we were attracted not only by the fantastic video effect (We only have a 29"" CRT at home and were astonished by how much visual details we missed), but how parents got to drag/pull/tow their kids away. In one case, a father simply put his 3-4 yr old son on his shoulder like a bag of flour and walked away. The cute beautiful angel, with his smiling face, waived ""Bye! Bye!

When this originally came out, it just didn't look interesting to me. However, since Cars 2 is coming out, I thought I should finally watch this. I should have stayed with my initial feelings. This is the stupidest Pixar film ever. It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds. There's nothing for the adult viewer here. The average Chevron commercial has a more entertaining story. This movie is literally sleep-inducing. But little kids who like mindless zooming things will love it.	1.0	Worst. Pixar. Film.

This isn't the type of film I'd watch on a regular basis, but I was on a plane and this was the featured movie so I tuned in. It was cute. The movie is about a truck that's friends with a race car, but another set of cars are plotting against the race car over a battle about oil. This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better. There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained. It's not the type of film I'd run out and buy, but I do think it'd be fun for kids and adults alike.	3.0	Pretty good for an animated car movie	2011-11-18	0	0	0

The digital animation is, of course first rate and the story has a nice message. I especially appreciated Newman's voice, his is the perfect voice for this character.  Look, I must confess, I cant stand Owen Wilson, his naisal voice and that bizarre nose, I mean what actress could have a career like he has had if she had a nose like that, I mean, right..but since I didnt not have to look at him, I actually liked his take on the main character, and Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the old Redneck tow truck, as for the Porsche, I really didnt like Bonnie Hunt, her voice is too old, she is like well into her forties, they needed a Jennifer Anniston or Angie Jolie to voice that character, they are more Wilson's age, in all due respect, Hunt's voice was for like an 80's Accord, but whatever..cute movie, great vivid dig animation, kids will love it`	4.0	CARS	2009-02-07	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3KKM0T1KY42HA	Sky	Cars is another Disney Pixar success. It succeeds in warming the heart; it makes you appreciate the value of friends and family; and it continues the tradition of teaching good morals. It's a class-A family film.The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.There has been a tremendous proliferation of computer generated films over the past couple of years which has certainly diluted the excitement that used to surround these movies. 2006 has got to set the record with 13...count 'em...13 releases that I can think of (Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, Hoodwinked, The Ant Bully, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away).And perhaps that is why I was a bit tentative going into Cars. Or perhaps it was because I just didn't think a movie about car racing and cars-come-to-life could be as enjoyable as the Disney Pixar films that preceded Cars. I should have known better.Cars is another in Disney Pixar's unblemished track record of delivering the epitome of a wonderful family classic.Here's a little trivia: John Ratzenburger appears (rather, his voice does) in all (Toy Story [1995], A Bug's Life [1998], Toy Story 2 [1999], Monsters, Inc [2001], Finding Nemo [2003], The Incredibles [2004] & Cars [2006]) of the Disney Pixar releases to date, and there's a little tribute to this at the end of Cars during the rolling credits.Cars is a very good movie that's well worth the purchase.	4.0	No Booster Seats Required For This Car Ride	2006-11-13	6	5	1

I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)	5.0	My little one loves it!	2012-09-10	0	0	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A10BT85QEKBZNZ	SMS CA	"The Movie CARSI like the movie because it is funny and I like the fast cars, the pimped out cars I like are DJ, Boost, Snot rode, and Wingo. The funny cars I like are Mater because of all the stuff he says like when he is saying his name he says ""my name is mater like Tamater but without the Ta"". If Lightning would of got tires he would of won and would be the first ever rookie to win the Piston cup But when he's on the last turn he blows two tires. Then no one knows how won. And the King goes up to Lightning and said ""he's a gutsy racer but you're stupid"". Then the King says ""get you a good crew chief and then you will be good"". And then they say for the first time ever lightning says a rookie has won then he jumps through the paper. Then the announcer says there is a three way tie then on the way to California. DJ, WINGO, SNOT ROD, and BOOST started pushing Mac and Lightning falls out of the back of the truck. And he ends up in Radiator Springs. He was speeding and the Sheriff was going so fast Lightning thought that the Sheriff was shooting at him. So Lightning started going faster and when he got into the town he tour up the rode. So he had to fix the road with Beshy. And mater said ""I would give two lug nuts to be with Beshy. Then he went really fast and the road was a lot worse so he had to do it again and that time he finished it. Then he found out that the judge was the Hudson Hornet. And then he tells Mater that he won 4 Piston cups and then Mater says ""he did what in his cup"". Lightning makes the Hudson Hornet mad so he calls somebody and tells him where Lightning is. So he was racing and was losing bad but then he hears all the people from Radiator Springs. And then he starts to win and Chick makes The King crash so lightning goes and helps The King cross the finish line. Then the Dinoco  manger over and asks Lightning if he wants anything and he says yes and Mater gets to ride in a helicopter and Radiator springs is put back on the map.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y	Sonja	"Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many ""kids"" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  ""Finding Nemo"" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out ""A Bug's Life.""  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of ""life and death"" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is ""the bad guy"" and ""a meanie,"" he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their ""enemies.""In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend."	5.0	great kids movie with very little violence and NO death - wow!	2008-12-31	1	0	1
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ	speed_on_wheelz	Lightning McQueen is a cocky, self-centered racecar (voiced by Owen Wilson) who thinks winning is everything.  One day while going to California, McQueen gets left in the middle of the street (accidentally of course).  He goes to Radiator Springs where he accidentally tears up the road.  McQueen is sentenced to fix the road.  While at Radiator Springs, McQueen has a change of heart; he finds out the true meaning of winning is not actually getting the most trophies, it's being a good sport and believing in yourself...also starring the voice talents of Bonnie Hunt as Sally, and Paul Newman as Doc, cars in Radiator Springs.This is a really good movie!

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3FEQXNCFC68KC	"SRFireside ""ZOOM!"""	"When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the ""acting"" is top notch.Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians ""dueling"" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.Production Features include:Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. ""Radiator Springs,"" ""Character Design,"" ""Animation and Acting,"" ""Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details,"" ""Hudson Hornet,"" ""Graphics"" and ""Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour"". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly. It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there."	5.0	Pixar does it again, but it had to grow on me.	2011-03-30	73	66	7

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2WAP3D72BH75C	"S. ""strap"""	Over the past 5 or 6 years, I've noticed a downward trend on the quality of animated films.  All use the same tired plot devices, animation looks the same, and the worst trend seems to be the focus on using Hollywood stars to do the voices.  Needless to say, I didn't rush out to see 'Cars' in the theater.  I only watched under duress on a long flight to Tokyo.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised...after a few minutes, I was hooked.  The plot in parts reminded me of a bad 80s movie starring Michael J. Fox, but it seemed to work  when acted out by talking cars.  I also have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of Larry the Cable Guy...Git R Done may have been funny the first time he said it....but, his tow truck character Mater was one of the more likeable and entertaining cars in the movie.Overall, a good animated film...probably the best I've seen since the first Shrek.	4.0	Much better than expected	2006-10-24	4	3	1

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3GJW7DVGBVX2O	"Steph JDF ""Steph."""	I have to admit when I first saw this movie and it came out I didn't get it.  I didn't like it either, for some reason it just didn't fit my tastes.  Yeah it was cute and everything, but it didn't grab my attention.  Maybe because I wasn't really interested in it at the time.Once my first child became two years old, she was really into Cars (not per se the movie but the actual cars like Hot Wheels) and well I was looking for something for her to watch on a movie in the dvd player in the van.  I came across Cars the movie once again.  Boy did she love it!  This is the only movie that my daughter can watch about 3-4 times and beg for more of and I have grown to love this movie too.The animation of this movie is outstanding, far surpasses a lot of what pixar has done and makes me feel like driving through Arizona sometime soon just to see it in person.  The storyline is funny and the characters are funning and loving.  The message that the movie sends is very heartwarming in which a car finds who he really is.  The music goes great with the movie and one thing that I really love about the movie is every time you watch it, you see something you didn't before.  Something that Pixar put that you didn't notice until you saw it a little bit closer.For example, Sally hits Luigi when she is talking to Mcqueen, there are tire tracks in the sky when they are racing in the dirt, etc...it's neat to see how they put hidden stuff in there like that.If you saw this movie once and didn't like it, I recommend to watch it again and see for yourself.  I love it now and sit down with my daughter when she watches it.  It's one of Pixars best and I wish they would make another one, but they don't like to do sequels.	5.0	First look...not that great, but a second look...WOW, what a movie!	2008-03-25	2	2	0

It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed.  I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels.  The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the ""mother road"" in the minds of  younger generations.  Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about  cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents.  The characterizations of vehicles living in ""Radiator Springs"" were clever but came from central casting.  The most original element of ""Cars"" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about.  In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the ""planes"" leave car tracks in the sky."	4.0	Good but not great compared to the Pixar classics.	2006-07-21	5	3	2

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38I00SO3D9ZSM	S. Zayas	Cars is yet another jaw-dropping animated work from Disney's Pixar Animation Studios.  The animation is breathtaking, beautiful.As usual, the characters are all cute, loveable.  You can read the story line in other reviews.  Suffice it to say, the story arc is typical Disney.What's best about Cars is that it teaches children that selfishness, vanity, and winning at all costs are not admirable traits or behaviors.  Putting others first, seeing the potential and beauty in things that, on the surface, are not beautiful, are  values glorified by this movie.  For that reason alone, kids (and their parents) should see this film.	4.0	Visually beautiful with great life lessons.	2006-07-03	2	2	0

At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk ""kid"" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old ""man"" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended."	5.0	Great quality product, Great quality movie	2007-05-06	2	2	0

Yes, it's technically a ""family"" movie (cringe), but this movie has all the Pixar Animation Studios magic and covers automobile culture down to the lugnuts and wingnuts. Way funny for kids and NASCAR addicts and classic-car lovers. Great story/script, sophisticated dialogue, and voices from some of the best actors in the business.Just like ""Toy Story,"" this Pixar masterpiece is a blast for both kids and old geezers (I actually owned a 1949 Mercury long ago) but also captures America's popular history, in this case our complex love-affair with highways and wheels. Note that all this is on top of some of the best digital-animation & artwork in the history of movies. Ka-chow!

It kept me entertained every minute!  One of my favorite scenes was when the two Italian cars got all dressed up to cheer at a race, and I almost died laughing since they looked just like the Italians we saw here in Germany during the month of World Cup games.I also love that Pixar takes pride in the details.  The non-talking characters in the movie were just as well thought out and lovingly crafted as the ""human""  characters.Another great thing about Pixar is they continue to entertain even after the story is over. The credits in this one were especially great. If you see it don't even think about leaving the movie theater until the credits are done rolling.And finally, I was impressed by the number of notable people they had play caricatures of themselves. Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and his wife Lynda, Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were all in there. (Not that I knew this until I checked out the IMDB entry for the movie, but it's still cool. I'm sure there are other famous names that I just don't know since I'm not a NASCAR fan.) Aside from racing names, they also had Click and Clack from NPR, as well as Jay Leno playing a TV talk show car called ""Jay Limo.""Genius!!"	5.0	Pixar has done it again!	2006-08-24	11	8	3

Our picks in movies have to be attitude-minimum, since my little one picks up on it and imitates.  The 'tude in ""Cars"" characters is shown to be unacceptable behavior to other characters.  The soundtrack is well-done, featuring a nice array of old, and remade and new songs.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A2ZZAPED8DHL07	The Best Out West	"This movie could possibly be the best one Pixar has put out there.  The characters are all so cute, and cleverly thought out.  For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.  Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen because even though he's a famous actor, his lines aren't tired and bored.  It's almost like he enjoyed the filming.Could they have picked a better person for the redneck tow truck than Larry the Cableguy?  I don't believe so.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is the tractor tipping, which I can see Larry doing.  Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.  Lightning McQueen is that spoiled superstar, who happens to find himself in the middle of nowhere.  He does some bad things to the town, and now, at his disgust, is made to spend time there and repair the damage he has caused.  Because of this, he actually learns that the the ""little"" people of the world can actually be pretty cool, and that just because he is a celebrity, he is not the center of the universe."	5.0	Possibly Pixar's Best!	2011-08-12	0	0	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3M2WW0PO34B94	thornhillatthemovies.com	"4 and 1/2I will never, for the life of me, understand why Michael Eisner, the former head of Disney, even entertained the notion of ending Disney's relationship with Pixar. Disney's recent animated efforts pale in comparison to Pixar's. For proof of this, take a look at the Disney theme parks; Pixar characters are everywhere, in rides, as characters meeting the public, in parades, in shows. You would be hard pressed to find any representation from ""Treasure Planet"", ""Chicken Little"" or ""Hercules"". You might see Chicken Little doing a `Character Meet and Greet', but that's about it. Disney needs Pixar. And vice versa. No other movie studio has a marketing machine geared towards and a reputation for family films.The two are a match made in heaven.When you produce such consistently great films, as Pixar does, it becomes necessary to rate them against themselves. There is no other scale; they have raised the bar too high. Rating ""Cars"" on the same scale as DreamWorks's ""Over the Hedge"" just isn't going to work. ""Hedge"" is good, but Pixar films are in a class by themselves. It becomes a matter of is it ""Toy Story/ The Incredibles"" good or simply ""Monsters, Inc"" good? ""The Incredibles"" and the ""Toy Story"" films represent modern examples of perfection in the art of animation. For that matter, there are few live action films that can compare. ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters, Inc"" are both very good, but they aren't perfect. ""Cars"", the newest film from Pixar, with the voice talents of Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenberger, is very good, but it's ""Monsters, Inc."" good. It isn't perfect.Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a rookie car on the Piston Cup circuit, has the moves and attitude to win the Cup, upsetting the King (Richard Petty), the veteran in his last race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), the venerable also-ran determined to win. After a three-way tie, the cars head out to California to perform for the title. Lightning upsets his third pit crew of the year, all of whom quit, and he sets off to California with simply his truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). Lightning pressures Mack to drive through the night and along the way, Lightning gets separated and lost. He ends up in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town on Route 66, far off the interstate. Disoriented, Lightning causes some damage and Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche, who lives in the town wants to see the damage repaired, pressuring Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's judge, to order Lightning to fix the road before he leaves. Determined to get to California, Lightning tries to fulfill his duty but gets distracted by the residents of Radiator Springs.Directed by John Lasseter (""Toy Story"" and its sequel), ""Cars"" is a beautiful, richly detailed look at a world where cars live just like humans. Nearly great, the film has many things going for it and one key thing working against it.Both a brilliant idea for an animated film and a brilliant marketing concept, ""Cars"" has a lot going for it. With NASCAR gaining popularity every week, this animated effort seems guaranteed to receive some cross-over. Also, how quickly can they retrofit the Speedway attractions at the theme parks? Let's freshen those babies up.From the opening scenes, depicting a race at the Motor Speedway of the South, the computer generated animation is flawless in design and detail. Really, the only detail telling us this film is animated is the faces on the cars. Beyond that, the scenery and production design are flawless. We believe we are watching a real race at a real speedway (complete with cars filling the stands, doing the wave, and RVs parked in the center of the track) and the scenes of Lightning speeding through the landscape look like they were filmed, the landscapes appear so real I could almost smell the pine trees and the desert wind blowing across the open plain. The shots of Lightning and Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning. When they visit Ornament Valley, the rocks are beautiful and look like hood ornaments. When the race car arrives at Radiator Springs, the filmmakers have created a loving tribute to the little towns, motels, businesses, tourist attractions and icons which used to dot Route 66 during its heyday.All of the cars are created with loving detail, each based on an actual car or vehicle. Even the car governor of California is a Hummer with an Austrian accent. Lightning is a race car, I'm going to guess a Mustang, I couldn't quite identify him, but Porsches, Ferraris, Buicks, Hudson Hornets and more, both old and new, make an appearance.The voice talents are, as always, exceptional. Owen Wilson brings the right blend of cocky upstart and guts to Lightning McQueen.  When he eventually realizes what his life is missing, and what he needs to do to fix it, we believe it. Paul Newman is perfect as Doc Hudson, the elder statesman of Radiator Springs. Once a powerful, cocky star in his own right, he prefers the quiet life in his little town. I read Newman, car buff that he is, suggested his character's make and model, giving Doc Hudson even more detail. He also has the right amount of gravelly intonation for a car fifty plus years old; you can imagine the carburetor adding to Doc's voice, in much the way Newman's voice adds resonance to the character. Hunt is good as the Porsche looking to protect and preserve the town and its inhabitants. Larry the Cable Guy is amusing as Tom Mater, the tow truck who is a few spark plugs short of a full engine. Tony Shalhoub plays Luigi, a little Italian car who runs the local tire shop and is obsessed with all things Ferrari. A number of real-life race car drivers make cameos as their cars and Tom and Ray, the Car Talk Guys from NPR, play the owners of Lightning's poorly funded sponsors.I have to give a lot of credit to Pixar. They could've so easily made the race cars even more realistic and covered them with real sponsors, much like the real thing. Thankfully, we are spared from watching endless logos for Home Depot and the like. Instead, all of the sponsors are fictional, and provide a level of humor to the tale. Lightning's sponsors are Rust-Eze, the rear bumper rust lubricant. He longs to be sponsored by Dinoco, a large oil company. Get it? Dinoco, large oil company. Dinosaurs. Oil. Chick (Keaton) is sponsored by HTB, Hostile Takeover Bank. These are cute jokes, some of which are worked into the story, providing another level of detail to an already richly observed universe.The problem with ""Cars"" is pacing. The film seems long and ten or fifteen minutes edited out middle would've improved the film greatly, giving it a faster rhythm, making it nearly unforgettable. As it is, the middle drags and we begin to fidget in our seats a bit.""Cars"" is fun, amusing and brilliantly designed. Sure to provide amusement for everyone in the family. As I have said many times, the mark of a classic animated film is it entertains the kids as well as the adults who have to take them. Would it entertain just adults? I heard a lot of laughter from adults, and a lot of laughter from the kids. At times a chorus, at others one group could be heard over the other. I can't imagine a better family film until maybe the next Pixar release, in summer, 2007, ""Ratatouile"", about a rat trying to eat good food in Paris."	4.0	How Long Before They Change the Name to Pixarland?	2006-06-13	6	6	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1ZAN7KBME97B3	Tiger100M	"Disney obviously made this weak film just as an excuse to make money selling toy cars to little boys. I was kind of bored in the theater with this film. I didn't find the idea of cars talking that interesting, the characters are bland and boring, the story doesn't work greatly, and there's barely an evil villain to work with. This Pixar film wasn't too acclaimed as opposed to the other Pixar films such as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles"". Reviews for this film were positive enough to pass but not greatly, and it was not a giant hit at the box office. The only reason why its popular is that Disney uses this film just to sell car toys to little kids. I didn't really like playing with cars as a little kid, and I still see it boring. This film is one of the sterotypical boy thing that I don't really like when I go out to the Disney store or Disney world. I don't normally play this game, but in my opinion, ""Cars"" is just for kids, and I mean 2-4 year old boys more likely. I really wish Disney would focus more on other balanced films than this.  The fact that this film made so much money from the toys is why ""Cars"" was the first Pixar film other than ""Toy Story"" to give a sequel, and guess what; "" Cars 2"" became Pixar's least critically successful film. That is one of the stupidest things Disney has ever done all because of greediness! And it's al thanks to ""Cars""!

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A3CP1WGNTOSKDA	"Tim Naff ""Tim"""	This is one of those Pixar flicks that does a better job of character development than 90 percent of the real-people films being released today.  Bugs' Life comes to mind as another positive example. It's a Disney production that even an adult can watch over and over.  I've gotten into it enough that I'm urging my family to consider a vacation out west driving Route 66.They said that when talkies replaced silent films, several years went by before they recovered from showcasing non-stop voice chatter and got back to real artistry in film making.  It's ironic that in this day when production houses (and audiences) can't seem to get past the gee-whiz of special effects, we need a pure animated piece to take us back to the real human-quality magic that movies can deliver.And then there's the Blu-ray video quality.  Holy crap!  This thing is knock-your-socks-off.  Animated films have an advantage in that everything can be simultaneously in focus.  Shadowy details can have a little contrast and sharpness added, and so-on.  The sound effects can be optimally synthesized for 5 channels.  There are simply fewer compromises.  The result is that in 1080p on an 11.5 foot screen, this is as good as I've seen, period.A movie about talking cars sounds dopey.  You may fear schmaltzy sentiment.  Expect to have exactly the opposite reaction.  Get it and get it now!Tim Naff	5.0	Terrific on All Levels, Including Blu-ray Transfer	2008-04-28	3	3	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AV5G37VFE5NVD	Tom Benton	"In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - ""hillbilly hell"".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?"	5.0	Another delightful family film from Pixar	2006-08-15	16	14	2

On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	CARS is the latest hit from animation power-house Pixar.  The story begins at the annual Piston Cup.  It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.  However, for anyone who lives in middle American or who has an interest in NASCAR or Route 66, CARS is a film that you will probably adore.  I know I do.	5.0	The Heartland of America.	2006-08-18	12	10	2

Those people totally downgrade every movie and make this movie to be all horrible when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about. I was appalled at that one moron who whined about how this isn't a good ""Christian"" movie because there's some name-calling in this movie by some of the cars in the script.Get a life, you schmuck. This isn't some Bible movie you bought, so get over it.This movie was excellent! I can watch it a thousand times and never get tired of it. I'm also looking into buying the sequel too. And considering that over 800 people made reviews of this movie and how barely a handful of them are one-star reviews, the others clearly know what they're saying when they claim this movie rocks the house.I'd give it a lot more than five stars, but that's clearly the highest you can go.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1C80B497LCYKA	"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark"""	I doubted whether a story populated with cars could actually make an interesting movie, but boy was I wrong. Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.Waitsel Smith	5.0	SURPRISINGLY CLEVER AND ENGAGING	2006-12-03	8	6	2

Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want."	4.0	Better for adults than for little kids...	2007-05-02	1	1	0

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1OIY65OL4XOKN	William Palian	Went to to World Premier of Cars last night at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, NC.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  Disney/Pixar has once again produced a terrific animated film.  Race fans will love it and need to watch closely for the parallels to NASCAR.  Those of you who have been to the infield for a race at Charlotte will like the Redneck Hill reference.  The stars turned out for the premier and Disney donated $1 million dollars split between Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camps and Speedway Charities, which includes Kyle Petty's Victory Junction Camp.  The characters in this film are loveable.  Paul Newman's 1951 Hudson Hornet is a small town judge and nobody in town knows about his checkered (flag) past.  Owen Wilson lends his voice to the main character Lightning McQueen.  Fans will fall in love with him.  Bonny Hunt is wonderful as the pretty Porche, Sally befriending Lighning in his journey through Radiator Springs.  John Ratzenberger again lends his talent to another supporting character in a Disney film. Don't leave before the credits to see additional work by John.  Tony Shaloub (Mr. Monk) plays Luiggi an Italian tire store owner and Ferrari lover.  Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and Michael Schumacher also make voice appearances in the film.  If you are a race fan you will love it.  If you are not, there are enough aspects of the film not revolving around racing for you to enjoy it.  Kids will love it and parents prepare for the onslaught of marketing that will have them wanting all things cars.  I willingly purchased 2 items today for my kids as I loved this wholesome family film.  GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!  I am eagerly awaiting the soundtrack.  Brad Paisley has 2 songs in the movie.  He played 3 songs at the Premier last night.  It's loaded with good music that young and old will enjoy.	5.0	World Premier at Lowe's Motor Speedway	2006-05-27	4	2	2
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	ARFCORBCTKX1J	"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer"""	"There aren't any new plots, and most stories have predictable endings. Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).""Cars"" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of ""Spirited Away"", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.""Cars"" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch ""Cars"" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the ""Toy Story""s, ""A Bug's Life"", or ""The Incredibles"", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The ""making of"" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while ""One-Man Band"" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon ""Susie, the Little Blue Coupe"", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.PS: Disney HD showed ""Cars"" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing. My feelings haven't changed. ""Cars"" lacks the surprises and twists of most other Pixar films, chugging its way to a predetermined finish. It just isn't much fun."	4.0	It just misses...

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	AUTBHG6070SL4	"wiredweird ""wiredweird"""	"No doubt, there are great animations coming from lots of production companies these days. Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors. Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends. But, as with any familiar recipe, it's easy to enjoy yet another preparation of it if done well. Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life. Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself. When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do. From Doc, to Lightning, to Sally, to Mater (get it? ""to mater""?), to the tractors, each comes across as a unique individual. It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.Too bad I missed this when it first came out. It's held up well, though, and will remain enjoyable for years to come. And no, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.-- wiredweird"	4.0	Another cute one from Pixar	2011-04-24	1	1	0
B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A38N7SFDOB3MR3	Wisconsin Dad	After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this. A must see, and must own children's movie.Total Score (out of 100) = 9043 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.8 (out of 10). Acting.

Follow the arrigant rookie that can ""do it solo"" to a person that really learns what the meaning of Team is.  Funny and Quirky, just the right amount.

B00005JNS0	Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)	A1WS5V4VI1L1PV	worldwearytraveler	I'm as big a Pixar fan as they come. I grew up with Toy Story, and they really hit their stride with flicks like Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Cars, though? Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.I freely admit that this is just a personal thing, but I found no part of this movie particularly funny, interesting, or entertaining. I really like the concept and the kind of humor that could get out of it, but as far a i could see, their was no reason that the characters were cars. No attempt at any sort of car-related humor was attempted as far as I could see, and I think it was more of an excuse for Pixar to not have to animate people, because their people always look a little... well... scary.All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring. the action was standard, the characters weren't really all that interesting (certainly not as interesting or complex as Finding Nemo's cast was) and I ultimately found myself checking my watch while watching it; never a good sign. The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie. The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater. I just wanted to punch him, he was so annoying.If you like this film, power to you. If you haven't seen this movie, trust me; go watch Finding Nemo again, or go see The Incredibles, that's an okay one too. Just don't waste your time; Cars isn't worth it.	3.0	Not bad, but...	2011-02-07	4	2	2

To this reviewer, however, the plot of CARS is lifted, and closely resembles the 1991 Michael J. Fox movie, DOC HOLLYWOOD. With that aside, the animation/CGI is breathtaking and the characters are spot-on excellent. Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing. The film may be a little long, and some of the humor may not hold the attention of younger children, but it is excellent for the adults and young adults. Pixar has added to their  list, a film destined to be a classic.	4.0	CARS Races Towards Classic Status	2006-06-14	2	1	1
