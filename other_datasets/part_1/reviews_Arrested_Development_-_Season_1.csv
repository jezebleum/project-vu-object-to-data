B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2DHRZSPDGF09N	9spades	Arrested Development is among the most original comedies in recent history and very addictive.  Definitely worth watching as long as you have about 25 hours to watch the entire season and another 20 hours to watch seasons 2 and 3 (which have less episodes).  When you watch a few episodes you'll probably end up watching all of them.	5.0	Excellent.	2013-09-09	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2GOAEF0ZRNG13	Aaron	Arrested Development is currently THE funniest and smartest show on television. The writing is razor sharp, the pacing just perfect and the cast!! Perfectly cast and brillianly acted, this show is just to good for regular television which may explain the lackluster ratings.  It's too cool and smart for average viewers weened on formulaic pap usually found on sitcoms.  BUT-kudos to FOX for renewing the program for another season. If you have'nt seen it, pick up this set and immerse yourself in it. Then start watching and supporting this great show.  I have neglected to describe the show's premise because one of the joys of it is to become acquainted with the large ensemble cast and get hooked on the show, and you will.  This show will become a classic!	5.0	The Best Show on TV !!! Period!!	2004-09-16	22	21	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A30NH98O69N9NZ	Abby Robertson	I fell in love with this show during the first episode.  It is truly the funniest show on TV.  I rented the DVD from Blockbuster before I bought it, and spent maybe five or six hours straight watching it.  It's hilarious.  You can't pick out a favorite character because they're all equally funny.  Buy the DVD. WAtch it over and over.  Tell your friends to buy it and watch it.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3519FXP75YED6	"A. Becerra ""Oh, save me, Jebus!"""	Without a shadow of a doubt, the best show on TV.When you first step into the world of AD, you will be bombarded. You won't know how to take it in, really. But then you enter the fabled threshold. And then it hits--the realization that you are watching the best TV has to offer.Season One of Arrested Development hits a glorificent, unrelenting stride very few shows have ever come close to--and this is just its freshman season. It is unrivalled, unparalleled, untouchable--except by its own equal, Season Two.So do yourself one of the greatest favors you'll ever be greeted with, and get yourself this set. You'll wonder how you ever scrounged around this Earth without it.Oh, and watch the Season Finale of Season Two this Sunday. Everyone knows that this show, above all other shows, deserves another season, so let FOX know that.Come on! Hermano.	5.0	Greatest Show On Television	2005-04-15	3	3	0

The nuances of each character are portrayed flawlessly by each cast member.This season was purchased for my mother and she just laughs out loud (which is no small feat). She tells me she is looking to buy the next season now.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1HLZLGEHLNYKF	A. Carter	This is the kookiest show, and SO funny. It's really best to watch the episodes right in a row, because the running gags/themes are more obvious than if you watched each episode one at a time. My husband and I have watched all three seasons of AR multiple times and we still find jokes we didn't notice before, and they never stop being hilarious.	5.0	Best show ever	2013-04-24	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3P7NSY3XTLRFL	A. Dalton	I love this series.  I purchased seasons one and two when I was looking for a new show to get in to.  I had only watched this once or twice on tv, and liked it, so I decided to try it out.  Every episode is hilarious, and the actors are amazing.  I am seriously upset that the show has been cancelled, and feel bad that it took me and others this long to appreciate how unique and funny this show is.	5.0	Development cut too soon	2006-07-05	4	3	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2Q7MHG02P7C3D	"adam ""adam"""	"I should be studying for finals tomorrow, but I would rather review AD.  It seems that a lot of the people on here love this show.  I think it's funny because many of these reviewers didn't originally like the show or saw it on tv by accident and started wathing it, which puts a smile in my heart.  My story is very similar.  I saw about five minutes of one of the first episodes on tv and didn't like it.  Then I heard it won Emmy for Best Comedy, and since I am a lover of comedy, I thought ""Well I should at least try it out because I wouldn't want to miss out watching a great television program"".  So I watched an episode from the second season a few months after seeing that one episode from the first season and thought ""Meh"".  But I did like how the episode all came together at the end like a good comedy should.  I wanted to keep watching it, though and the next episode was one of the greatest pieces of writing I've ever seen.  After seeing only two episodes, I borrowed the disc 3 dvd from a friend who rented it, and watched the episode ""Let Them Eat Cake"".  I wasn't even sure if I really liked it that much, but the show just grabbed me and sucked me in.  After seeing only 3 episodes I knew I had to have these dvds so I put them on my Christmas list.  Hooray!  When I opened it Christmas morning I watched it and over the next few days finished the entire season.  Now I love the show.  I even put it in my five greatest shows of all time, which consists of Seinfeld, The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and Arrested Development.  I love Gob, George Michael, and Michael.  The show is perfect and I want to watch The Office, since that's supposedly, from what I heard, a show crafted the same way as Arrested Development.Now for the second part of my ""Arrested Development Rules"" ""essay"", I want to just say that TG2 from Virginia, the reviewer about 3 reviews below me doesn't know what he/she is talking about.  Obviously if 3 people give the show a 1 star, 6 people give it a 4, and over 110 give it a 5, the people who gave it a 5 or 4 aren't wrong, you are.  You are outnumbered like 120-3.  How could you be right?  I suppose you just don't get it and that's okay.  Maybe when you're older.  Enjoy the dvd everbody!"	5.0	One Of My Top Five Shows	2005-01-27	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	ADW2PZZCJ3EYF	Adam D. Hayslett	I've been a fan of the show since the pilot and I've never written an amazon review, but this program and the dvd collection are both so fantastic that I feel it's my duty to spread the word. I would have paid 50 bucks for my 1st season dvd set because I watch at least 3 or 4 episodes a day. It's most definately the best dvd investment I've ever made. Buy it,  you will not regret it.	5.0	Genius	2005-05-14	6	5	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A33L7G4E8CID3	"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19"""	"For a channel notorious for purchasing risky shows, then giving them no chance at all to succeed, that a show as original, quirky, and brilliant would come from Fox is a bit of a surprise. Indeed, my brother is still convinced that this is an HBO show. Arrested Development is the best show on network television, and if you're curious about whether or not you should take the plunge, I would definitely advise trying it out. A few notes--it differs from most sitcoms in that there is heavy continuity among episodes and it is very detail-oriented. Jokes are forshadowed before they appear and are evoked afterwards. The humor is sophisticated, but accessible. Some (or all) of these facts are used to say that this is a show only for ""smart"" people, whatever that means. For my part, I don't think that intelligence has anything to do with it. It's more a matter of your willingness to commit to the storylines and concentrate on what's on the tube. If you are willing to do those things, you will be rewarded. If not, you probably won't. In essence, you get what you put into it.So, if you're willing to put some effort in, you won't be disappointed. The series revolves around the Bluth family, especially Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the voice of (mostly) reason in a family marked by petty jealousy, greed, and general cluelessness. Michael has to compete with his resentful older brother, George Oscar (or GOB, played by Will Arnett); his lipstick liberal twin sister, Lindsey (Portia de Rossi); his pathetic younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale); his is-he-or-isn't-he actor brother-in-law Tobias (David Cross); his rebellious niece, Mabee (Alia Shawkat); his judgmental and bigoted mother, Lucille (Jessica Walker); and his newly religious prison inmate father, George (Jeffrey Tambor). The only other (somewhat) normal member of his family is his son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Not only is this a flawless ensemble cast, but there are plenty of high-profile guest stars: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Liza Minelli, and Carl Weathers (playing an hilarious version of himself as a hige tightwad), to name a few. To my knowledge, it's the only time Liza Minelli and Carl Weathers have shared a scene, and if that isn't bizarre enough for you, just wait.I am hesitant to give away any of the jokes, because my retelling would only diminish them, but take my word that this is a show where you will laugh out loud at a near-continuous clip. The only comedy it is even remotely like is Sports Night, with the same kinetic style and documentary feel. Interestingly, series creator Mitchell Hurwitz did mention Sports Night in an interview about how he put the show together. There's not quite as much good feeling in this show, which pretty much veers away from drama. However, this is the most creative and original show on the air, and Fox has given them a surprising amount of latitude. Long live Arrested Development."	5.0	Terriffic Show	2005-08-24	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2RW9MR92QC63N	A Fan	I arrived late to this dance.  I don't really have any structure to my TV viewing, other than Sunday nights on HBO.  Despite reading positive reviews and hearing accolades for this show I missed the entire broadcast season.  What that means to me is that I've just immersed myself in probably the funniest 22 episodes of broadcast comedy ever (that includes Seinfeld and the old Dick Van Dyke show).  This first season is chock full of running gags, absurd situations and some of the funniest deadpan dialog deliveries ever recorded on video.  It's impossible to single out a cast member because they all make important contributions, even the guys who walk on for a line or two.  Watching them in sequence does maintain some continuity of narrative but you'll find yourself returning to some special favorites.  The bring your daughter to work episode brings out the absurdity of the whole practice while delivering some of the best laughs of the whole series.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A6KKZ8NROZAYK	AJ	Definitely up there with Seinfeld, Cheers, and MASH, this is one of the best shows in television history (IMHO). Unlike the first season of most shows, season one of Arrested Development might be my favorite. The characters are fully developed and all completely loveable, even the unlikables. I've seen all these shows and continue to laugh out loud every time I watch them again (maybe more). Warning: Highly addictive! So settle in with a dry martini or two (or four) because you'll be hanging out with the Bluths for awhile.	5.0	One of the best shows on TV	2013-07-24	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A23L2BR07AOBG1	alex bushman	This is a comedy that I don't really consider a sitcom because it isn't as concerned with specific topics to be dealt with on each episode and it doesn't include a laugh track.  The humor is found through the absurd story arcs of the characters as the season plays out. The story really does progress from episode to episode and in many ways the complexity of the story could be used for a soap opera, but in this case it's used for very intelligent and sharp humor.  Sometimes the funniest gags are the ones that are running ones and there are a few hilarious ones.  The best thing about this show is that it's all about behavior and there really aren't jokes, which makes it hard to explain funny situations to friends of yours, but are hilarious nonetheless. AHHH, and the extras aren't that bad either.	5.0	It's so funny in a natural kind of way	2005-03-14	1	1	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A11O7OW699BN45	Alex D	I got turned on to Arrested Development sometime around Season 2 or 3 - way late in the game but better late than never.  I did my best to catch up on the series through the syndication episodes on cable but unfortunately never saw any of the very early episodes (and missed many others along the way).  A recent Amazon Prime member, I've started to poke around the movie and television show selection and am now hooked again on Arrested Development after finally being able to watch the series from the beginning.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AQYH2DHP78S83	Alexis	"Arrested Development is by far one of the funniest shows out there that not many people have actually seen. The absolute ABSURDITY of it all is just so appealing. Every single member of the family has their own neuroticism that you just can't help but love. But my favorite is Gob - his ""chicken"" dance, emphasizing his points with the movements of his Segway.... classic.I've had many friends who have resisted this show at first but then became hardcore fans. Just stick with it, the absurdity grows and so does your love for the Bluth family.For reference, some of my other tv favorites include: Dexter, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Family Guy, The Office, 30 Rock, Tosh.O, Jon Stewart"	5.0	Fantastic (and underrated) show!	2011-05-31	0	0	0

It goes places that others don't, and then it goes a little further.  The writing is snappy, the characters delightfully horrible, the mandatory ""life's lessons"" learnt at the end of each episode are twisted just enough to take a dig at the other feel-good series around it - all in all, wonderful.The acting is terrific - I had pigeonholed some of the actors prior to seeing the series, and boy was I wrong.  Portia de Rossi is fantastic (although I'm a fellow Skip, I didn't think all that much of her before.  Now I'd cheerfully worship at her feet), Justin Bateman - wow - why isn't he elsewhere?  Will Arnett as GOB makes me guffaw just by thinking about him - Buster is uncanny - the list goes on.I can understand why it was cancelled.  It was too good, too witty, and too cutting.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2JG58PTMF8N1W	"A. Malik ""shotcaller49"""	This show is perhaps the best-written and best-acted comedy to ever be on TV. Of course everyone grants that title to Seinfeld. But while the 4 main characters of that show turned into caricatures of themselves after the first 3 seasons, Arrested Development keeps each character fresh and funny, week in and week out. Granted it's only been around for 19 episodes or so. But compare it to a show like Curb Your Enthusiasm (which I also love). CYE benefits from being on HBO and being able to be as explicit as it wants to be while AD has to be brutally subtle, making it that much funnier.I had seen the first season on TV (Thank God for TiVo) and bought this the day it came out. My brothers saw a couple episodes and then haven't given it back. You will be as addicted as the rest of us are once you see this great first season. And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE start watching and telling your friends about it. They will thank you and it will ensure that this amazing show stays on the air.Just a warning to the concerned parents out there: The show does get quite risque at certain moments and probably would go over the head of kids under 12 or 13 anyways.	5.0	Best show on TV right now...	2004-12-27	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	ABSX5TGEGRH76	"Andrew ""Radaar"""	"This is the story of the Bluth family, a once-prominent group of individuals who now have to try to live a more frugal life after George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) was arrested for shady bookkeeping (along with a few other charges).  This forces George's son Michael (Jason Bateman), who was planning on leaving the family's development business after being passed up for a promotion, to take over the company.  Michael is the natural choice seeing as how his mother Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walters) is a narcissistic and critical socialite, his twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke (Portia de Rossi) has never worked more than a day in her life, his older brother George Oscar Bluth, Jr. (Will Arnett), or just Gob for short (pronounced Jobe), is a lazy (and inept) magician, and his younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth (Tony Hale), is a moderately intelligent mama's boy who is prone to panic attacks.  Rounding out the cast are Tobias Funke (David Cross), Lindsay's husband, whom she married in order to rebel against her father, George-Michael Bluth (Michael Cera), Michael's son, and Mae ""Maeby"" Funke (Alia Shawkat), Michael's niece.  Oh, and Ron Howard narrates the show.Arrested Development is shot as a mockumentary, which, in my opinion, is a stroke of genius for this show, because it allows things such as dramatic and situational irony to be used in new ways.  It also adds a lot of humor when the characters refer to things, and ""archive footage"" is inserted (or in some cases, it says ""Footage Not Found"").This is a very different kind of comedy than something like The Simpsons or Seinfeld.  It doesn't revolve around punchlines and their set-up; rather, things happen as they would in real life, only the events in this show are a lot more humorous.  Furthermore, unlike many other comedy shows, the episodes are serialized, meaning that actions in one episode carry over into the next.  In fact, there are subtle hints in many episodes that allude to something that happens in the finale.  And one of the funniest things is that at the end of most episodes, there is a segment where scenes from the next episode are shown.  99% of the time, the scenes don't actually show up, but they fit in with the show's continuity.The characters are extremely developed, and their individual idiosyncrasies are hilarious.  For example, Gob is a crappy magician who thinks that he is the next Houdini.  Unfortunately, his tricks either fail miserably or work too well!  He also thinks that he's much more responsible than he really is.  Lindsay is a woman who loves to get involved with charitable causes... because she likes throwing parties to raise money (one of my favorite was the anti-circumcision group called HOOP; I'll let you figure out what the acronym meant).  And her daughter Maeby often rebels against the causes Lindsay joins, for the sole purpose of rebelling.The guest stars on the show are great as well.  Henry Winkler plays Barry Zuckerkorn, George Sr.'s extremely incompetent attorney who has his own share of legal problems (he actually reminds me a bit of Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons).  Judy Greer plays George's secretary Kitty Sanchez, who is a hypersexual, partygoing, cute-in-a-goofy-way girl who had an affair with George, and thus is in a position of power of Michael (she knows where some incriminating evidence is).  Buster gets a love interest in the form of Lucille Austero (Liza Minelli, who I hate to admit is perfect for the role).  Lucille Austero (AKA Lucille 2) is best friends/social rivals with Lucille Bluth, and it causes a lot of tension between Lucille 1 and Buster, who, as Michael points out, is still attached to his mother's umbilical cord.  And then there is Annyong (Justin Lee), a young Korean boy that Lucille accidentally adopted when Buster was misbehaving one day.  Annyong (which is actually Korean for ""Hello"") and Buster find themselves fighting for Lucille's affection (not that she has much to give) in some very hilarious ways.I can't believe I didn't get into this show sooner; it is one of the funniest comedies that I have ever seen.  Sadly though, it may not be renewed for a third season (it almost didn't get a second, but it won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, so FOX gave it a second chance).  And sadly, I can kind of understand why its ratings are so low.  As I said, it is serialized, and while its easier to jump into midseason than shows like 24 or Alias, it is a show that you have to see a few episodes of in order to fully enjoy it.  Also, as I said, it is a very different kind of humor that not everyone will appreciate.  However, those who do will find a great comedy that will hopefully inspire others and remain on the air for years to come."	5.0	Astoundingly Funny	2005-04-01	13	12	1

Let me tell you, they're wrong.Okay, maybe not wrong, but their descriptions of the show understate its complete perfection. I cannot think of a single thing, past or present, that mankind can be more proud of than Arrested Development. Seriously. If I had to choose between getting immunized or watching this show, I'd risk Polio. If Bin Laden had stolen the last copy, I'd go spelunking to retrieve it.

Passed that, it is THE best sitcom on the major networks since Seinfeld ended.  This show leads the hierarchy of sitcoms, followed by Scrubs, and Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO).Every character is played so flawlessly by the actors.  Most notably Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth who is the most sane person in the family, but can't see his own short-comings when it comes to his son.  The funniest character is Gob, Michael's scheming brother.If you haven't seen it, please do.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1U9OY79N3POOF	Anthony Donato	"Arrested Development is the most innovative and groundbreaking sitcom since Seinfeld.  The characters are multilayered and complex, and the handheld camera suggests this is a parody of ""reality"" shows.  The characters are so hilariously self-absorbed and narcicisstic that they COULD pass as reality show actors (a trend that I hope will end soon).I understand the ratings for AD havne't been the strongest, but improving, and I hope Fox gives the show the needed time to find it's audience.  Ironically, it was the same situation with Seinfeld, and once NBC gave it a fair shot, people ultimately came around.  AD is not a bland cookie cutter sitcom like Friends.  It's challenging, and requires the viewer to have a certain amount of social and political saavy.  Enjoy!"	5.0	Arrested Development - Season One review	2005-09-09	0	0	0

This show caught my attention and focused in on the sutle details of comedy, only to release those little details in a large escapade of events...on one of the many hillarious personalities of the characters on the show.Season Two has taken too long to arrive, I've seen a few episodes...but I must see season two before I loose all hope for the horrible shows that are on TV now!I am so glad A.D. has a 3rd season now, more laughs in the future!

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1IKNLUR7H9AE7	art vandelay	arrested development is the smartest and funniest comedy since seinfeld (on basic cable, not counting HBO) to the people who said the characters were flat-because the characters in Everybody Loves Raymond are so multifaceted? oh i get it hes afraid of his mother? i want to watch this for another 11 seasons. that sarcasm probably made a slight whistling noise as it flew over your head, along with all the other jokes you missed on AD. Also, AD has some of the best characters ever, and they are all individuals. now i love such shows as Scrubs, Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Friends(I know AD aren't supposed to like it) so if you are a fan of these shows, i'd try AD out.	5.0	BEST SHOW SINCE SEINFELD	2010-12-15	1	0	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	ATNTB6YON1SCS	A Savvy Veteran	That I didn't watch and support this show while it was still on the air. I bought all of the DVDs about 8 months ago, and after watching each episode several times, it has become my favorite television show of all time. The deeply layered humor, the running jokes, and all of the brilliant characters make this a must-have on DVD. It is impossible not to fall in love with the cast, which includes the brilliant mind of David Cross, the excellent deadpan delivery of Jason Bateman, and characters that seem to have been written specifically for Tony Hale, Michael Cera, and Will Arnett. It is very important to not just watch the pilot and then give up on this show, however. Anyone who has honestly watched all of disc 1 and not become completely hooked has a severely under-developed sense of humor in my opinion.	5.0	I'm sorry...	2007-07-24	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AVDUXSXBG2I60	Augiesez	I read the reviews here, heard the hype elsewhere and decided to finally give this show a shot. What an incredible waste of time. This show is not funny, it's not even dry humor. It is stale, depressed, boring writing being conveyed by mostly listless tortured acting. Think of Grapes of Wrath minus the cheer and color. I believe this is the fault of the director ringing any life out of what should be good performances by a talented ensemble (not that anyone could do much with this poor script). Were the screen writers on strike again at this time??? And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, in walked Fonzie - yep Henry Winkler, and it got worse. The pinnacle of his career was The Fonz (which was dreadful) and it has all been downhill for him since Happy Days. No wonder it's on the free list, they should really pay us to watch this one.	1.0	Yawn-a-Thon	2011-10-22	118	8	110

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ	"Barry ""Barrybgb"""	"The format of television we know as a sitcom is dying. The end of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" in May will be the death of the 'filmed before a live studio audience' sitcom. One camera shows like AD are the ones to watch now, and thank god it, and others like it, are here. They are a dying breed. This is the best half hour comedy to hit the top major networks in years and the most critically acclaimed one at that. So naturally, it was a flop in ratings and struggled to stay alive. Typical. The ""Pilot"" episode pretty much sums it up for the show. George Bluth(Jeffrey Tambor), is arrested for insider trading, and the Bluth family realize they need son Michael(Jason Bateman), to help with the family company after his father passed him over for the job. He tries to hold the company in check and to keep his continuously dysfunctional family together. His family includes his cold, icy mother Lucille(Jessica Walter), his spoiled, shallow sister Lindsey(Portia De Rossi), doctor turned struggling actor brother in law Tobias(David Cross), niece Maybe, struggling magician brother Gob(Will Arnett), mama's boy little brother Buster(Tony Hale), and his own son, the hysterically named George Michael(Michael Cera), who has an unhealthy crush on Maybe. The show is also narrated by it's producer, non other than Ron Howard. Every episode is packed with the most brilliant and intelligent writing, and sly references that you will only get if you are truly on your game. It's funny as heck, and impeccably performed, written, and directed. It is a mature and sophiticated humor. The kind that will go over a lot of people's heads if you don't understand it. And a lot don't. Julia Louis Dreyfuss appears as a blind attorney in the classic ""Alter Egos"", and the second part, ""Justice Is Blind"". Henry Winkler has a recurring role as the family attorney. The best stunt casting here is Liza Minnelli, as a socialite with vertigo and a competition between Lucille, and a relationship with Buster. Incredible. Somehow, Carl Weathers figures into it as well. Other incredible moments here include the episode ""Pier Presure"", where Buster tries to score some pot for Liza's handicap. ""In God We Trust"" is another winner where we learn of Tobias' naked hang up. There are way too many good things here to mention. Every episode pretty much hits it out of the park and there are so many things, big or little, in every single episode. It's the most well conceived shows on the air. Who knew Jason Bateman was a comedy god?. The guy's deadpan delivery is so good, you wonder where his emmy is. The rest are just as excellent. Jessica Walter has the perfect demeanor for her role as Lucille, and Arnett and Hale are as perfect as can be. Michael Cera is a tremendous young actor. He really makes George Michael seem like a real kid. Not an actor trying to be what writers think a kid would say and do just to be funny or interesting. And hey, it's always a plus when Jeffrey Tambor is around. This is pitch perfect writing and direction. With it's renewal for a second season, and it's recent emmy win for Best Comedy, Best Writing, and Best Direction, it gives hope that the TV Gods just may be wising up after all. Get this."	5.0	Bluth's Banana Stand	2004-09-27	14	14	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2VMU5ZK05P62E	B. Cobb	Trying to sum up how great this show really is would be impossible to do. The fact that the show has subpar ratings shows you that quality does not always bring quantity. Too bad for all those millions of people who aren't even aware of this show. They are missing out on a brilliant show. Possibly too smart and above the level of comprehension of those viewers who are used to a laugh track telling them when something is funny, Arrested may lose a few potential viewers. Another thing about the show is that each episode gets better every single time you view it. You start to notice things and then you cannot get the antics of the Bluth family out of your head.With the loss of unique programming such as Buffy, Angel, Futurama, X-Files, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, and Firefly this show is the future of television. Here's hoping that enough people discover it in time for it to have the lengthy future it deserves.	5.0	Best show on television in years....	2004-08-29	16	14	2

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2582KMXLK2P06	B. E Jackson	"It's a shame Arrested Development only lasted 53 episodes.  But when you think about it, it's really not hard to see why the show was cancelled so early.  Fox is one of those networks that will either deliver totally memorable or totally horrible programming.  There's really no in between.  I never get the urge to scream ""GENIUS!"" when I think about Arrested Development (like many people do) but if you watch a few episodes you'll see what makes the show so funny.  You have to keep in mind that the humor isn't meant to be in your face.  It's *really* important you understand this.Arrested Development never took off for a variety of reasons.  Probably the most obvious reason: most people didn't understand the subtle humor that made the show so popular among certain fans.  I have to admit, I didn't understand the humor at first either.  I couldn't understand if the show was supposed to be a drama or a comedy, and why so much thought and energy was being devoted to strange storyline twists and characters walking around doing weird things.  Eventually the humor clicked, and I began to see there was a REASON for the things that seemed pointless the first time around.  The weirdness had a purpose after all.I began to realize that every single character was MEANT to be in the show, and all the storyline twists and turns that originally seemed so clumsy and unusually-placed were actually all part of the unpredictability factor.  All these things added up to one wild, extremely funny show.Once you get into the characters, the humor will probably make sense.  In my opinion, most of the people who watched one or two episodes and didn't laugh simply couldn't understand the fact that not all humor has to be plainly obvious.  When watching Arrested Development, you have to search for the jokes.I don't think the humor is quite as intelligent as most people will tell you.  I mean, I'm not really a smart guy and I can understand most of the jokes.  The trick to getting into Arrested Development is to REALLY pay attention to *everything* going on.  Pay attention to the characters and the storyline progression.  If you don't, you probably won't see the humor.  It's really that simple (or complicated, I don't know!)That's another problem.  The average person who watches a comedy show has trouble understanding how searching for something is supposed to be funny.  Well, I think what's happening is that a new style of comedy is developing as we speak, and many people don't know how to approach it.  I think a show like the Office is another example of this style of comedy.  The jokes are there, but hidden.  If you give yourself time to search for them, you *will* find them.I think not including a laugh track is confusing to many people.  Without a laugh track some people don't know WHAT to think.  It does NOT mean you are dumb if you can't get into Arrested Development- it simply means you have not yet allowed yourself to look at this style of humor in a new light.  The show is *definitely* not ordinary.  Don't let this throw you off.To be honest, Arrested Development isn't a style of comedy for everyone.  But trust me, there's a reason Arrested Development is respected so much.  What might seem like a pointless storyline at first is probably leading up to something totally twisted that you will *never* expect!  It's all part of the charm.I'll admit, Arrested Development never makes me laugh out loud, but it's a style that's pretty creative and twisted, and makes you crave more when you eventually get into it.  Once you understand the humor you're hooked for life.  Including a laugh track would have RUINED the show.  I believe laugh tracks are starting to become old-fashioned anyway.Don't worry if you can't get into Arrested Development the first couple times you watch an episode.  Just please understand that you HAVE to give it a few serious chances so everything will fall into place in your head.  When that happens, you *will* enjoy it.  It's just too bad the show couldn't hang around for another 100 episodes."	4.0	pick up all 53 episodes	2006-09-19	19	16	3

OUTSTANDING is the only way to describe 'Arrested Development', in fact it was so good that I immediately purchased Seasons Two and Three. My only disappointment was that there were only three seasons and 53 total episodes, but they are all outstanding and highly recommended.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3S5WYWYKSAI9C	Bradley Olin	I -adore- this program. The narrative humor, and zany family never ceases to produce a laugh in this not so sit-com television show. Season three makes no exception, and goes to great lengths toward the inevitable finale to make it clear that they weren't ready to be rubbed out. If that doesn't bug you, (and why should it; if you enjoy the show you'll sympathize) you'll enjoy more of the bizarre and silly episodes that make this show so endearing.There's not much to say that's not already been said. The special features are so-so, but that's not the only reason to buy a DVD series these days, and honestly, the quality of the episodes more than makes up for it.The bottom line:Buy this if you enjoyed the other seasons, or if you're a fan of twisted and dysfunctional family comedies, ala Married With Children, the Family Guy, etc.	5.0	One of the Best Shows on Television	2006-12-09	8	7	1

Jason Bateman carries the role of the only level-headed one in the family well. The premise and show plots are a little unrealistic, but still relatable, especially to someone with a fairly large family that has to deal with each others' neurosis and quirks on a daily basis.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3SJ2VSCHZB18	Brian Markowski	"I feel sorry for FOX TV because they have a problem with their show ""Arrested Development"". The problem is that this show plays better on DVD then it does on TV. Kudos to FOX for keeping it on the air a second season, but even a slot after The Simpons may not be enough to keep this show on the air for a third season. Luckily for us, the first season is on DVD with plenty of sweet extras to keep a smile on any ""Arrested"" fan's face.The show chronicles the Bluth's, a California family spoiled by the money of their development corporation. In the pilot, the father is sent to jail and the company's assets are frozen. Our dysfunctional family is now forced to deal with the consequences of their greed, selfishness, and just plain weirdness. Jason Bateman plays Michael Bluth, the stable son, who tries to keep his family and business together.Any other sitcom today might play this like a standard living room set where wackiness ensues, but ""Arrested Development"" plays it more like a documentary where wackiness ensues. Producer Ron Howard provides commentary-allowing scenes to flow into one another with more complexity. A great comic cast including, David Cross from ""Mr. Show"", Jeffrey Tambor from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and Portia de Rossi from ""Ally McBeal"" gel wonderfully together.The real genius of the show is the writing however, comic plots included a character who has a crush on his cousin, an uncle who doesn't know he's gay, and a mother who tries to make her son jealous by adopting an Asian orphan. Which sadly proves that not even the FFC is watching this show on FOX, and here in lies the problem. There are so many hidden and underlining jokes that you get more out of this show watching the episodes back to back over the course of a month than you do trying to keep up with the show every Sunday, unless there's a special, rerun or sports game on.On this DVD you also get cast commentary on a few on the episodes, deleted scenes, and a couple mini-documentaries including a question and answer session with the cast. If you like groundbreaking TV, or igneous comedy, buy this DVD and hope they release season 2 this summer. It may be your only chance to enjoy this show the way it was meant to be enjoyed."	5.0	This is so good ...it's amazing FOX hasn't cancled it yet.	2005-01-13	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2N9OENVXDF643	Brian M. Benway	"TV fans owe a debt of gratitude to HBO, who single-handedly raised the bar for intelligent television.  Though it took a few sweeps of the Emmys for network execs to take notice, Fox finally answered the call last year with Arrested Development, a comedy so offbeat and so unlike anything else, that it may be a victim of its own success.A critical darling, but a show trying desperately to find its footing among the TV public, Arrested Development spent much of its brilliant first season teetering on the brink of extinction.  Fox must be commended for having the foresight to keep this gem alive.  Hopefully, with this DVD release, this can't-miss show will gain the foothold it needs.The Bluth family had it all, or so they thought.  But, when their patriarch is arrested for cooking the books of his family's land development company, all of their assets are frozen, and the once wealthy and entitled Bluths find themselves struggling to get by.At the center of this debacle is Michael, the good son who wants nothing more than to keep his family together.  This wouldn't be so hard if it weren't for his family's outrageous and numerous dysfunctions.  Michael is surrounded by an incredibly quirky cast of characters, including his sleazy older brother GOB, an out-of-work magician who was blackballed for revealing his secrets; Lindsay, his conniving younger sister, who tries to turn charity into profit; and Buster, the family's youngest and most inept, who still lives with his mother, and accidentally is dating his mother's best friend.  They're joined by Tobias, Lindsay's sexually ambiguous husband, who lost his medical license for performing CPR on a sleeping man, and who now is pursuing his dreams of becoming an actor.  There's also George Michael, Michael's wonky son who harbors an unnatural crush on his cousin Maeby.  Pulling the strings are the Bluth parents.  The father continues to conduct under-the-table dealings from prison, and the manipulative mother dedicates her time to pitting her children against one another, even going so far as to adopt a Korean child to make Buster jealous.Of course, it is truly impossible to describe Arrested Development.  The show, though absolutely absurd, truly believes in the world that it has created, and the writing plays brilliantly off of the character's traits.  Filmed with a single camera, Arrested Development has the look of a documentary, which further grounds the ""reality"" of the show.  The wise omission of a laugh track allows the writers and actors to pack more gags per minute than any show before it.  Indeed, some people may find it hard to find a show funny when no one has told them to laugh, but the true pleasure of the show is that you can discover the humor yourself.Arrested Development is perfect for DVD.  Even if you've seen every episode, the show is even more rewarding on a second viewing.  There are so many subtle gags and references that you simply can't get them all the first time.  It's also a great tool to convert your friends to show, as all it will take is the 40 minutes to watch ""Visiting Ours"" and ""Pier Pressure"" to get someone hooked.The DVDs present a very sharp picture on par with the HD broadcasts.  The sound is just Dolby ProLogic, but it gets the job done.  The extras are varied.  I wished there had been more behind-the-scenes stuff, but what's there is interesting.  The deleted scenes are hit-or-miss.All in all Arrested Development is a must-own for any fan of truly intelligent comedy.  This show joins the ranks of the elite, along with The Larry Sanders Show, Mr. Show, and NewsRadio."	5.0	Quite possibly the finest TV comedy ever!  (seriously)	2004-10-25	4	4	0

This is the only show that I watch (aside from Seinfeld reruns) that is consistently laugh-out-loud funny, and is also the only show (aside from Seinfeld) that I can watch repeatedly without getting tired of it.  In fact, it does Seinfeld one better with some of the running gags and also some of the jokes that you don't even realize are jokes until later in the season once you look back on them.  Amazing.  Why can't every show have this kind of writing?  Henry Winkler (the Fonz) plays their lawyer -- one of the absolutely most hilarious minor supporting characters of all time!  Buy it.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2C89EQ7KCG924	Brian Murphy	"Man, what is with this show? By the amount of 5 star reviews and buzz about this show, I was expecting it to be better than the Simpsons, the Office and Seinfeld combined. If anyone is familiar with sketch or other type of tv/movie comedies you quickly see that there are a lot of rip-offs. Naming a character George Michael is not funny and is very unoriginal. The movie ""Office Space"" has a character named Michael Bolton (get it - the singer). Also, David Cross in his other works has used this ploy of using funny or ironic names for characters (News Reporters named 'Mace' or 'Clint Dirk', etc.).Besides dissecting all the other rip-offs or unoriginal jokes in this show, I'll just say for the 100 or so jokes that they try to cram in this show about 2 or 3 of them are actually funny and or original. The characters are also super annoying and way over the top (in a bad way). The general plot of the show is absurd and unrealistic. And the show just gets way too quirky and cutesy. Plus, why must almost every Fox comedy show (or for that matter any show that questions the viewer's intelligence) have a narrator talking to you throughout the whole show? Not only is the narrator's voice irritating and boring but it just gets in the way and make the show even more grueling to watch. Save your time any money and find a new show. Or just borrow this from someone."	2.0	Way Over Hyped / Overrated	2005-12-09	107	13	94

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1VWV7E7WLL2K0	Brian Rainey	This DVD contains season 1 of what I feel is by far the best show on television.  The terrific writing is matched only by the acting skills and deadpan jokes of the cast.  The amount of characters and the time the show has spent to develop each one lends to a story that has many different things going on at once.  Seinfeld was able to do this as well, but did not have as many characters and the humor was more out in the open; Arrested Development seems to not care if the viewer gets every joke, as long as it makes itself laugh.This DVD is perfect, because the show can be watched over and over again and still be funny.  Having watched it twice, I find myself still catching jokes I didn't the first time through during the season last year.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A31Y5RW96T2UE5	Brosamj	Arrested Development is one of those shows that truly catches you off-guard and makes you thankful that there are writers out there that can write a smart comedy show.  I can't call this a sitcom because it doesn't fit in the typical formulaic mode of slapstick comedy, quick quips and silly situations.The use of no-laugh track is wonderful.  This is an affect that has been used before to varying degrees of success.  For Arrested Development, it is a homerun.  You end up focusing on the dialogue and the sitatuations and are not force fed on when to laugh.Jason Bateman is a revelation.  He brings normalcy to the family and is very likeable.  He has his faults, but you tend to laugh with him (though he may be slighly laughing, you can feel his utter confusion of how his family continues to act like they do) as his family is in continal meltdown.  His relationship with his sister (Portia) and with Gob are also hillarious to watch.Gob (pronounced Job...as in Job in the bible) is a fabulous character.  Seeing him on his segway machine (in the middle of traffic often, going down steep hills, through neighborhoods, on construction sites) is always good for a laugh.  His magic tricks...he is one truly great character.The guest appearances throughout the first season are so absurd that it is funny.  Carl Weathers as the actor that Funke should try to follow, Liza Minelli is terrific in her role as Buster's girlfriend and Henry Winkler is a very funny quack lawyer.I loved the episode with 'Hermano' as Michael and Gob tried to figure out who their girlfriend was having an affair with...the episode when Michael's son is trying to buy weed for Buster is hillarious...'they are policemen and they are hot!'A great show!	5.0	Is there a funnier show on TV?

""Arrested Development"" is the funniest, wittiest, most creative, and most well written show I've ever seen.  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD so I can watch it over and over again and give my Season 1 DVDs a break.  The reruns of Season 2 start airing on Fox on Friday, July 29th at 9 and 9:30 EST.  I suggest buying the 1st season on DVD if you've never watched the show before, but even if you don't buy Season 1, you'll still love Season 2 so watch the reruns.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1IGFTXCWKCXDO	Burnsy	"Simply put: The best new sitcom to hit the small screen since Curb Your Enthusiasm.  This is clearly the best that network television has to offer, a refreshing change from the cookie-cutter ""dysfunctional family"" or ""oversexed pals"" sitcoms that have been shoved down our throats for the last decade.AD features what is, far and away, the most original and imaginiative group of characters in TV history.  While credit goes to the creators for that, it is the actors that truly make these characters work.  The show is perfectly casted, with Will Arnett (GOB) and David Cross (Tobias) particularly shining.  Jason Bateman has revived his career as Michael, best described as the least crazy one.The poster who compared AD to Malcom in the Middle is off his/her rocker, and those who compare this show to Scrubs do it a great disservice.  Scrubs, which I love, doesn't have the same creativity behind its plots; it's also much more jokey.  AD is much more subtle and creative - and, in the ultimate compliment to a sitcom - even has shades of Seinfeld, where several plot lines will tie in at the end.  Still, the show maintains its own identity, mixing original characters, witty dialogue and sometimes outrageous stories to perfection.Through only one season, AD has quickly become one of my three favorite shows ever.  The DVD is a no-brainer, day-of-release purchase that may even force me to use a vacation day..."	5.0	Best Comedy Emmy - Biggest upset since the Miracle on Ice	2004-09-22	65	61	4

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AW3VZ5O895LRK	"carol irvin ""carol irvin"""	Review of whole series not just one episode.Lots of Americans grew up in family businesses. I was one of them and I think running your own business does build a certain kind of insanity through the family. No one epitomizes this better than the beleaguered Bluth family. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is that one sane one whereas his mother, his brothers, his sister, et al, swirl around him pursuing their own best interests (never anyone else's best interests and certainly not the family business's best interest). Ron Howard who produced the show also narrates it and does a wonderful job of it. The business is tanking in the wake of the senior Bluth's (the pater familias) financial wrongdoing within the firm.The biggest discovery for me on this show was Michael's lothario older brother played by Will Arnett. I have been tuning in Will Arnett ever since this show and he is funny in everything I see. I had never seen him before this show. Most recently I saw him vie with Alec Baldwin's Jack on 30 ROCK for NBC's CEO position. He played a gay corporate type to perfection.I loved Jeffrey Tambor on LARRY SANDERS so was glad to see him playing the pater familias and his twin brother Oscar. Tambor always brings a level of inept smarminess to his semi villainous characters. They don't ever quite make it to being villains because he is always shooting himself in the foot as he tries to pull off a nefarious act. His character is in prison in this series and he is particularly self absorbed yet bumbling from there. if the father is smarmy, the mother, played by Jessica Walter, is the ultimate as the matriarch with a thousand schemes afoot, all to promote her own best interests. She takes manipulative to a whole new level.Portia DeRossi plays Michael's greedy twin sister. She is good but it is her sexually waffling husband (David Cross) who is the character to watch. One of his many baffling but hilarious acts is to leave his career as a psychiatrist to become an actor.This was a very funny show which I totally enjoyed. HBO did it again, of course.	5.0	Leading Edge Satire--Being the Sane One in an Insane Family Business	2009-09-27	11	7	4

Yet, they lucked out and got a corker of a show. All I can say is, thank the powers that be that they renewed this for  a third season. Jason Bateman is absolutely great and deserved his Golden Globe for his work on this show....far cry from Teen Wolf Too. Will Arnett is wonderful as Bateman's older brother George, who aspires to be a magician, but who has no talent. And I'm not a fan of David Cross, but he is good here as the brother-in-law who has a phobia about being naked, calling himself a ""no-nude."" The rest of the cast is equally as funny and droll, and the show works so well because they're all so good.A few great quotes:Lucille: Oh, George, I should have never doubted you. Even when you slept with my sister it was for a good reason.George Sr.: Got her to stop drinking, didn't it?Michael Bluth: [calling from prison, taking about his brother, Gob] I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it.Lucille: You would do that to your brother?Michael Bluth: I said ""cot"".Buster: Mom is becoming a little controlling.Michael: What tipped you off? When she locked you out on the balcony again?Buster: That was half my fault. I thought I saw a graham cracker out there.Michael: You baited the balcony?Lucille Bluth: Prove it.If you enjoy humor with a biting edge but without that insipid laugh track prevalent on so many sitcoms, then this is your show.

And when I say that I don't mean in the traditional sense where you slap your knee and scream, ""Get It?!"" Rather I mean funny that makes you jealous because you realize that the people who write this show are so much funnier than you are.  I am currently working my way through ""The Cosby Show"" season 1 and it is stunning to me how inadequate its intelligence is when stacked up against ""Arrested Development."" There are no jokes about incest or an aged movie star playing broke, or ""Gilligan's Island"" on ""The Cosby Show."" Also, any storylines that involve parents teaching kids a lesson would not involve any drug busts or the exploitation of missing body parts.  It is much more appropriate to compare this show to TV comedies that actually have a brain such as ""Soap"" (also involving a very messed up family) and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (which also has a great understanding of the power of continuity).  This show, with it's depiction of a family shaken to the core after their father and meal ticket goes to jail for some ""light treason,"" attacks the epidemic in today's society in which rich kids refuse to work a day in their life.  Take Tobias for example, he uses the money that was meant to get his medical license back to purchase acting lessons from Carl Weathers.  Of course his acting skills are utterly non-existent, but he need not worry about that for his bread has already been buttered and it's easier to pretend to be a frightened inmate than it is to actually be a doctor.  The rest of the family partakes in such stand-in professions as magician, activist, and housewife.  That is if they work at all.  When family leader and main character Michael demand that the family start earning the paychecks they pick up every week Tobias and Gob decide to start a coffee shop.  It goes without saying that they would never actually work in a coffee shop, and that is very representative of many coddled, rich kids in our country.  As a manager of a Manhattan coffee shop I have one of these children working under me.  He overuses the words existential and bourgeoisie, and constantly tells me he SHOULD be working at a university doing academic research.  But if he is so smart then why can't he figure out the virtue of punctuality? And why can't the Bluth's figure out that Carl Weathers in obviously starving, and that there lawyer is incompetent, and that Buster has been smothered beyond repair? Because they are rich not smart, and despite the lies we were told in school there is no real correlation between the two. Then again, any wealth accumulated by the writers of this show is AOK with me because they obviously used their brain to get it.  I would tell them to pass some of that intelligence on to their characters, but that wouldn't be smart, would it?  7.22 out of 10."	4.0	Who Are These People?	2005-10-09	17	10	7
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A8DWKC3ASB91K	Christian Buckley	"One of those shows which I always see the ads for, but never seem to watch during its regular time slot. But I had seen enough of it to know I would probably enjoy them, so I purchased the first season.Let me just say that this show possibly rivals Seinfeld. I've always been a Jason Bateman fan since his early days and a couple unknown sitcom attempts which nobody probably remembers, and his straight delivery as the only sane person in this insane family is perfect.The casting is wonderful; there's Portia DeRossi's troubled twin sister who starts a non-profit with her brother and husband as board members, files permits with city and state, and all the paperwork just so she can donate an expensive gown to a thrift store, write it off, but then go back and buy the dress again at a severe discount -- therefore getting away with the purchase of a designer gown which her brother, who controls the family's finances, told her not to buy. [gasp]My favorite character, though, is Tobias, the ""never-nude"" who loses his medical liscense and decides to become an actor after accidentally finding himself among a troupe of gay performers protesting his father-in-law's construction business, and becomes inspired.There is no show on TV as fresh and funny as this one."	5.0	Bluths Rule	2005-02-26	6	5	1

That's saying a lot!  The way its sarcasm and stupidity is put together makes it a truly brilliant show.I am extremely disheartened that this show MAY be cancelled (very strong emphasis on the MAY).  If it is cancelled, I would probably lose my faith in the success of the human race.  I was introduced to the show by my brother when he showed me the DVD.  After watching the first episode, I finished the entire season in 4 days.  This is a must-get DVD.  I wish i knew about the show earlier.Finally in response to the 3 deranged maniacs who rated the DVD with 1 star, ""You are either deaf, blind or just stupid!""

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1OB5L3WMHJAD9	Christopher Culver	"I really do regret never seeing ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT during its three-season run from 2003-2006, as it is one of the few television comedy programmes I've enjoyed. Its documentary-like storytelling based around a quirky family, where executive George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison and his son Michael (Jason Bateman) must take over the company and shepherd his siblings, with frequent flashbacks makes for comedy that I can best compare to Wes Anderson's filmThe Royal Tenenbaums. While the writing is at a high level, with complex plotlines and jokes that play themselves out across episodes (or disappear only to return a season later), but the writers also had to work within the constraints of a FOX sitcom, and one of its successes is how cleverly they chafe at their situation. References to sitcom tropes abound, such as a character joining the military, the matriarch adopting a child only to have him quickly disposed of, and dramas of who someone's real father is.The strong writing couldn't succeed without strong acting. Rarely have I seen a cast so believable as a family, with Bateman as the responsible middle son carrying on a convincing rapport with Will Arnett as his loser elder brother George Oscar ""GOB"" Bluth and Tony Hale as his neurotic younger brother Buster, as well as Portia Rossi as his airhead twin sister Lindsey. I first became familiar with Will Arnett's acting when he played a hyperbolic pervert soon killed by a sex machine on a Human Giant sketch. His part of GOB is considerably more tame, and elicits as much sympathy as laughter. Just as fine as the central parts, however, are the guest parts: Henry Winkler as a seedy lawyer, Amy Poehler as a manic seal trader whom GOB marries on a dare, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a blind attorney.If you only know this programme from when it was broadcasted, the DVD is still worthwhile, as there's a lot of freeze-frame details that make it all even funnier. That said, the series was funny well beyond season one, and the DVD set of all three seasons goes in some places for little more than this set of season one only."	4.0	A fantastic series, but considering getting the discounted set of all three seasons instead of just season 1	2009-10-13	2	2	0

If you don't know Arrested Development you should it's awesome and one of my favorite shows ever. It really set the stage for the pushing the limits for what comedies could get away with on television. It's must watch television and it's coming back for season 4 (that I think is going to be exclusively on Netflix). If you haven't seen the show, get ready for because season 4 I'm sure is going to be off the charts! I'm so excited!The strange thing here is that you can't get Blu-Ray of the show on Amazon only the DVDs are available but you can stream it for free in HD if you have Amazon prime. I'm a huge fan of high-definition I love it and I think it's sad that this great show doesn't have Blu-Ray discs to purchase. Anyway instead of buying the discs maybe just get Amazon prime I mean it's only $80 bucks so that's a steal and you watch an older high definition glory.Thanks for reading I hope you enjoy the show.	5.0	Season 4 is coming - Great show why are there no Blu-Rays available?

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A28CLI341Y2FKK	Cj	Arrested Development is most definetly the best show on Television right now.  With all the typical (and unfunny) family sitcoms available, it is such a breath of fresh air to have a smart, creative, and hilariously funny show to watch.  Arrested Development is one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and it will still be funny, if not funnier every time.  It is obvious that a lot of time is spent to make this show so clever and humorous.  All the characters have depth and personality and after you watch a few episodes you feel like you know each and every wacky one of them.There is so much detail that goes into the dialogue, sets, and music, among other things.  Every time I watch an episode I see some new minor detail that makes me laugh out loud.  It seems like the show uses a lot of improvisation but there isn't, which really says a great deal about the writing and the acting.  That they can make it so smooth and realistic that is doesn't even seem like they are following a script.  Terrific ensemble acting, state of the art camera shooting and outlandish story lines are what make this comedy stand above the other comedies on television now!  Quality television at it's best!!I hope this show stays on the air for many, many years to come and more networks will recognize that we need more shows of this caliber on television today.  I highly recommend the show and the DVD to watch anytime you want to laugh.There is a reason why this show won an Emmy for best Comedy it's first season!!!!

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1B5Y34G3GJDJ1	C. Kragel	I first heard about Arrested Development from a friend. Skeptical at first, I find it difficult to get into new television shows right away without approving of the first few episodes. If they don't catch my interest, I drop the show quicker than a hot plate.Needless to say, this was not the case with Arrested Development. The show starts off quickly, introducing us to all of the characters in a witty and interesting manner that drew me right in. I absolutely loved all the characters and their little quirks that made them unique. It's hard to argue with a show that can produce such a greedy, manipulative, and disfunctional family as this one.Among the great characterizations are subtle references and small little side-stories that you really have to pay attention to really notice. The show will make light of these things, some more obvious that others; all of them hilarious.I definitely recommend this show to anyone seeking an outrageously funny, completely non-serious comedy about real life. This show has a little bit for everyone, and still seeks to surprise me with the complex storylines and unravelling plots that seem to only bury the family further in their greed and counter-productive means toward society.	5.0	A witty, clever non-documentary about a disfunctional family	2013-06-02	0	0	0

I have watched 3 eps and I have to say it's not wowing me. It could be that I have to let it grow on me or maybe it's just past its prime. I love humor like Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld but this one just doesn't seem up to that level. It could be that too many people said how wonderful it is and thus built it up in my mind to an unattainable expectation. That can happen and also can work both ways- when people go on and on about how wonderful a show is and then I watch it expecting greatness I am disappointed but on the flip side if people say they don't like something and so out of curiosity I watch it expecting heinousness I am pleasantly surprised... Anyway, I will forge ahead since I did purchase the entire 1st season on dvd but I'll say that I am glad I didn't gamble on the entire series which I sometimes do if it's a cheap bundle and I think I might like it.	3.0	Does this show get any better???	2013-03-10	1	0	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AS558SNWF1DXG	Clare Quilty	"This is much better and funnier than I expected from the commercials and opening credits -- which seemed a swirl of designations (""his niece,"" ""his brother,"" ""his brother-in-law,"" ""his mother"") for a gang of cheesy, stupid, rich-people stereotypes.  That is, in fact, exactly what the characters are but I realized, after the first two or three failed attempts to get into the show, they're pretty damn hilarious.As in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" coincidence trips over confusion; and no good deed goes unpunished; and you really can see some of the punchlines coming from a mile away -- but it still works for me, mostly because of the show's ""Simpson""-esque way of cutting away to little asides and flashbacks.  I'd definitely say ""AD"" is more Simpsonian than Davidian.I also like how no good joke ever truly goes away -- the stair truck keeps reappearing, George Michael's crush pops up again and again and there's always that prison guard shouting, ""No touching!"" at just the right moments.It's good to see Jason Bateman again, too.  If you watched the short-lived Bateman-as-junior-con-man sitcom ""It's Your Move"" growing up, it's a kick to see Bateman as a frazzled dad just trying to do the right thing.And, despite it's jokey trappings, the show actually does play around with the themes of communication and compromise - information passes from sibling to parents to sibling and often becomes warped during the transition, and there's a price tag dangling from every favor."	4.0	"""No touching!"""	2005-02-05	8	4	4

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A16EIVIBBXFAQ0	Craig	Whenever I see the ratings for this brilliant but ignored show, all I can do is wonder why so many people choose not to watch such a great series.  Hopefully, many of them will purchase this DVD to see what they've been missing.Jason Bateman has made an incredible comeback from obscurity to serve as the anchor of the show, just as he anchors the Bluth family.  The cast around him is uniformly excellent - Will Arnett and David Cross are my favorites, but it's hard to go wrong with choosing any of the supporting cast.  The writing is sharp throughout the season, with the show never losing its dry, ironic touch.I didn't expect that Fox or any other network could come up with such a great show, one that matches some cable efforts.  I'd recommend this DVD collection both for current fans, and for those interested in catching on to something great.	5.0	Best comedy on network television	2005-01-17	2	2	0

The Emmy voters were right to honor this show. It is by far the best written sitcom on television.  After all of the same sitcom junk that has been shoved in our faces, it is great to find something unique on the landscape.  The acting is unmatched on television, and the writing is amazing.

The beauty of the DVD series collection is the ability to watch every episode back to back and I love these episodes--so funny!The regular cast is brilliant: Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Jeffrey Tambor, Portia de Rossi, Michael Cera, David Cross, Tony Hale and all the rest.  So many comedic heavy hitters on one show!! And it never overwhelmed, always funny in a delicate way.  The cameos are well worked into the plot, and they are seamlessly integrated into the cast.  Liza Minnelli is especially hilarious as Lucille #1's rival and Buster's girlfriend.  Also included in this season: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Poehler, Henry Winkler, and Jane Lynch.This brilliant series about a dysfunctional family falling apart in the midst of corruption, embezzlement, fraud, and some ""light"" treason (yes, ""light"" treason), with only Michael the reliable son to save them from themselves, was cancelled too soon by the short-sighted executives at Fox.This series is a must own for the merits of the excellent comedy alone.

I am interested in the new season that has come out on NetFlix, but wanted to start from the beginning.  At first, I was attempting to watch the first season on NetFlix, but the show constantly stopped mid-stream due to the low speed of the NetFlix streaming server.  Remembering that I had an Amazon Prime account, I quickly checked to see if Arrested Development was offered by Amazon and HUZZAH!  NOT ONLY was it offered but at a wonderful 16MBPS which is a SUPER FAST streaming speed.SO, I'm now a happy AMAZON streaming media fan!

I believe the reason it did not succeed was because you had to have seen it from the very beginning to appreciate each character. Watching them develop over the series is incredibly funny. I would recommend this show to anyone whom is into watching a continuing plot based series from the beginning.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	ALO2H313HQOTH	Dane Joers	TV has gone through a lot of different comedy shows and styles, and it was about time something like Arrested Development showed up.  It's a shame that so few people watched the first season...They missed out.Once you watch one episode, it becomes apparent why Arrested Development was the winner of the Emmy for Best Comedy.  Every element of the show works together to create laugh-out-loudable comedy.  The writers behind the show are immensely clever and set up each joke wonderfully.Another overlooked asset to the show is the breakthrough camera-work.  Instead of the still/panning cameras like those in most sitcoms, it has the slight feeling like it's being filmed by an amateur cameraperson, because of the zooming in and out and the occasional jittering.  But believe me, this is not a bad thing, and is used often in a very comedic way, such as zooming into a face at just the right time, often at awkward, silent moments.  Often the awkward, silent moments are the funniest in the show.Credit should also go to the actors and actresses in the show.  They play their parts extremely well and were cast perfectly, in my opinion.  The show is very clever in bringing out each character's eccentricities and developing mirthful scenarios around them.If you have not watched Arrested Development, be sure to watch it with an open mind, because it is not like most comedy programs on television.  But once I kept watching, I was thoroughly addicted, and can't wait to see what next season holds.The show's plots are never meant to be dramatic, but still, there can be a few moving moments; although they are usually broken open by a following joke.  In general, this show quite well avoids the usual trite situations and storylines that most shows continue to repeat.  I found myself caught off-guard many a time by little surprises in the storylines that had me hurling myself off the couch and into a fetal position on the floor, rolling with laughter.I give this one of my highest recommendations.	5.0	Best show I ever watched	2004-10-21	6	6	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3BZJN6VFDXY2X	Dani D	"While many of the reviews posted here compare this show to others, I see it as a unique and clever show not comparable to any other.  It is so over the top but in a very funny way.  Unbelievable situations abound and that is precisely why it is fun to watch. Without a laugh track the show can move along at a quick pace with so many things, subtle and not so subtle, going on all around this family.Regardless of whether you rate this as the ""all-time best show"" or not, it is definitely worth the price to watch the 22 episodes. I watch them again and again to see what I may have missed previously.The characters are so well played by the actors that the ensemble just wouldn't be the same without any one of them. The characters are not the type that you ""relate"" to because it is truly fiction. That is what makes it funny!  The writers are fantastic and the audience is along for the ride with the totally wacky Bluth family who you will want to visit many times.Additionally, there are many lines from this show that you may find yourself repeating.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AOENT8Z3AN087	David Basskin	"No need to reiterate the set-ups, the plot summaries or the praise - just to add my voice to those who recognize this as one of the sharpest, funniest comedy series ever created. The writing is stellar and the cast is note-perfect. They rise to the demands of breakneck farce - not the easiest thing to do outside of a theatre. Obviously the brilliant (and very fast) editing is an asset, as is Ron Howard's narration. Too many high points to single out - but just a few:- the guest stars: Liza Minnelli, Heather Graham and Henry Winkler are just a few. Winkler is simply hysterical as possibly the most unethical, incompetent lawyer in California. What marvellous clowns!- the long-arc continuity gags. ""Say, that looks just like our kitchen."" A set-up that takes more than 20 episodes to pay off, but when it does, it's amazing.- Jeffrey Tambor. I've been an admirer of his for years, and thought that his incomparable schlemiel, Hank Kingsley (""Hey, now!"") from The Larry Sanders Show (RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS ON DVD, DAMMIT!) was his peak. But he reaches a new peak as Bluth, the crooked developer. His transformations from grieving arrestee to gang member to Jewish proeslytizer are funny enough, and his turn as ""Uncle Oscar"" is a charm, but the moment that had me on the floor was in the episode where Michael is trying to fire his Dad's assistant (played by the exquisite Judy Greer). Tambor is telling Michael, ""you don't know what it's like to fire someone, like when I had to fire my own twin brother, the face he made ... wait a minute, I can do that face,"" and then proceeds to re-enact his brother's hysterical pleading not to be fired. As I'm writing this, it isn't a hundredth as funny as the way Tambor delivers it - VERY fast and VERY funny. I howled.The cancellation of this show tells you everything you need to know about the tastes of network executives. That this show was created and produced at all tells you all you need to know about the unbelievable depths of comic talent at work today - or, more likely, AVAILABLE for work!And where ARE the DVD's of the other seasons of Sanders, anyway?"	5.0	Hey, now!

He and his son, George Michael (Michael Cera), are the bastions of sanity that anchor his manipulative mother (Jessica Walters), his older brother (Will Arnett), who is a self-aggrandizing magician that has been black-balled by the Magician's Union, his materialistic twin sister (Portia di Rossi), and his anxiety-prone younger brother (Tony Hale).  Add David Cross as the brittle, desperate brother-in-law who has left psychiatry for the dream of being an actor and Alia Shawkat as a budding juvenile delinquent and the result is an inspired comedy whose outrageous humor is only heightened by its documentary-style presentation.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2NIGI5371S5U6	David Khaindrava	I started watching the show by accident, it followed Simpsons  (which I still think is the best show ever to be seen on American TV) and I had forgotten to change the channel. What a great surprise. It is incredibly well written and perfectly executed show. And most importantly, this show has simply the best cast I have ever seen on television. It is impossible to pick out one character as a favorite. Great job by every actor bringing these unforgettable characters to life.I can only say one thing, if writing continues to be this good, this show is here to stay and what a treat it is.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3HT7THRDLPUHH	"D. Brunner ""tv on dvd fan"""	When Arrested Development first came out on television, all I heard was an enormous amount of hype. So much in fact that I avoided it assuming it was just another sitcom with laugh tracks to tell people that a joke was funny. This is far from that, and let me tell you it was well worth the hype.The story revolves around the dysfunctional Bluth family. A family that once had it all, is now struggling to survive thanks to the imprisonment of George Bluth, the owner of the family fortune. After he is sent away the family falls to pieces. Michael Bluth, is a twin middle child who has the smarts to keep the family afloat. He trys to manage the assests, and keep the business alive but it won't be easy with a family like this.The cast may be one of the best I'd ever seen. Every character works wonderfully together. The show does an excellent job of giving character depth and good back stories to every single person which is something a comedy show could only dream of doing. Every member of the cast is so diverse, each brings a different style of comedy that blends perfectfully together.This is a thinkings mans comedy. While there are the occasional over the top jokes, most require you to appreciate subtlety which is what makes it so fantastic. Lots of inside jokes continue through the season and by the time the finale airs you'll be wishing there was more. On to season two!	5.0	Best cast ever?	2007-01-25	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AMF7HSLX078BN	"Dean Hacker ""dhacker615"""	It is difficult to express exactly how funny 'Arrested Development' is.First, the cast is amazing.  Jason Bateman is the perfect deadpan center of the action.  He is surrounded by some of the best actors working in series television.  Some, like Jeffery Tambor, I knew going in from his brilliant turn on 'The Larry Sanders Show'.  Others are totally new, but they are all equally talented.  Each character is totally distinct with their own set of quirks.Second, the writing is amazing.  The humor of the show grows as it goes along.  This makes a show that really pays off committed viewing.  The characters are effected by the events of prior episodes and react in unexpected ways.  By the tenth episode, you laughing harder at these 'inside' jokes than you are to more obvious ones.  It plays out that way from episode to episode.  Like 'Seinfeld' a given episode is carried through more often by a theme than single plot line.  That gives the large cast some room to breathe.  Everyone does not have to be in the same room at the same time.Third, the Newport Beach setting is sort of fresh.  It is nice to see parts of Southern California that have not been recycled 100 times.Fourth, the one camera and no laugh track thing is a lot less cheesy than the standard three camera sitcom.  For one thing, it allows the story to move around a little more.  That also allows the writers to keep the gags fresh by putting them in different settings.Fifth, it is a show well served by digital technology.  DVD (or TiVo) allow the viewer to rewind to catch a bit of dialouge, or pause just to avoid laughing over the next two jokes.	5.0	The funniest network sitcom since 'Seinfeld'	2005-06-17	1	1	0

It can't beat out Family Guy, Seinfeld, Always Sunny in Philadelphia and so on. Finding out that Amazon Prime had them for free (more or less) I saved myself the money and sat down and watched the show. Since then, I've watched all 3 seasons within a week or two, and it is by far one of the best shows on and now off, but soon to be back on television. Or made of  film. While it's not for everyone the show is amazingly funny for those who do enjoy it. Very excited for the show to come back.	5.0	Very excited for this to return	2011-10-30	5	4	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AYQNZACOSSDK3	Derek J. Woods	"Other than the recent onslaught of random late night cartoons, no other show, especially no other ""real"" show has ever come close to the genius of Arrested Development. It's so absurd but so real-focusing on aspects of conversation, dialogue and facets of life no other show touches.  Every actor seems to perfectly fit their character, and every actor is atleast funny sometimes.  I can't even compare it to anything for you-almost like Family Guy randomness with Curb Your Enthusiasm's sarcasm and everyday life scenarios.  It has this appeal that kids and adults could understand....while Gob is my favorite character, the very real and deliciously evil grandmother is my parents.  I'm just glad this show isn't going to go unnoticed and taken off the air like other greats.  If you like Adult Swim, Family Guy/Simpsons, Seinfeld, or really if you like laughing at your own families dsyfunctions like most do....Buy this DVD"	5.0	Should blow up like Family Guy because it's that good....	2004-10-25	4	4	0

Slowly, but surely, all of my friends have started watching this show. Now, they all won't miss it, so it would be a shame to cancel it now.	5.0	Freaking Hilarious Show	2005-04-29	1	1	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A382AH0YTZJHQ5	"Der Hammer des Kuchens ""I guess so"""	When I first saw trailers for this show where the father was having a blast in prison I thought that it looked stupid. However I watched an episode because it was on after The Simsons and I realized that this was a very funny show. The only problem was that it was half way through the season so I missed some of the episodes. I don't buy shows on dvd but I had to get this one because it's that good.This has got to be one of the most funny shows ever. It's a blend of dry, sarcastic,  and physical humor. I find myself laughing throughout each episode. Another good thing is that it's not shot in fron of an audience so you get to see more of the sets and there's more mobility frm the characters. It's actualy shot like a documentary and at times they make it out to be a documentary. There is also a narriator who sometimes becomes annoying because he'll repeat what a character had previously done or why they're donig something which sometimes becomes annoying. Also there isn't a laugh track which I really like because I hate laugh tracks because it's like they tell you what to laugh at because you're so stupid that you don't get the jokes or the jokes are just bad.All the characters on the show are funny. There isn't one person who is alright and you think the show could be just as funny without them.If you're looking for a different kind of comedy show then you should get this because it really is one of a kind and you will find yourself watching it over and over again.	5.0	come on people	2006-10-04	2	1	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AFNOJTS838DRD	"DesiB ""des17598"""	That 1000+ reviews still average out to a 5 star review on Amazon is all you need to know.I saw one episode on TV and thought there was something intriguing about it so bought the season 1 box set when it came out.However many years later this is, I've now seen it all 3 seasons about 4 or 5 times. I put it on my ipod and found that it was able to calm me down or lift my spirits as well as entertain me.Smart, brilliantly acted and directed, it is without doubt my favourite series of all time closely followed by The Sorpranos, The Wire and Buffy.When season 3 came out I watched the extras and there's a film about the last day of shooting. When Will Arnett chokes up saying goodbye to the crew, I knew exactly how he felt.Fox got a hard time on cancelling this one, but by all accounts they stuck with it for at least a season and a half longer than they would normally have done but ultimately, couldn't justify the low ratings. I'm glad they did. Season 3 is probably the funniest. You can't help but wonder what its' trajectory would have been if allowed to continue.The cancellation is, in a way, when AD gets interesting as a cultural phenomenon. The word of mouth began to spread and new fans continue to find it. This doesn't happen very often with any series, let alone comedy.  The rumoured film would be wonderful to see but then I always simultaneously longed for AND dreaded a Beatles reunion, so perhaps I don't really want them to mess with the legacy of AD either.The writing, editing and acting are all at the highest level - seriously you need rewatches just to be sure you have all the innuendo and sight gags covered.Hands down the funniest comedy drama ever. Even if you like Black Adder, Curb, The Office, Father Ted, Fawlty Towers, Seinfeld, Frasier etc I promise you this is the smartest and funniest of them all - it really is.Reading this back, as someone who used to review things objectively for national papers in the UK, I'm surprised to have written something so subjective, but it's my honest opinion.

A lot of people don't like it because they don't pay attention to it. They all think that since it is a new show it isn't good enough yet to be smart and funny. Lots of shows weren't very funny in their first season and they expect the same for this show. No no no no no no no no no. This had one of the funniest first seasons of all time if not THE BEST. It is one of the only sitcoms I can think of that won the Emmy for Best Comedy Series in it's first season. Also, Jason Bateman is going to go down as one of the only child stars to live down his past. He is hilarious on this and is just as funny in his small role in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Anyways, give this show a chance. It deserves it. This show is anything but over rated, it is really, with all the great reviews and Emmys, Under Rated. This is the best show since Seinfeld.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2JJYNWL8RG7VU	D. Ninh	"Just when I had lost all hope with tv shows and sitcoms, amidst the endless sea of crap that is American Idol, Friends, Bachelorette, Joey etc, comes this small, quiet, witty remarkably funny-as-hell show. Though I never really watched this show when it first came out , a friend got this DVD set and made me watch it - i was instantly hooked.. i think the problem why this show isnt doing well in the ratings is because 1) most Americans are too stupid to get the humor and appreciate the wit and 2) it's one of those shows where you need to watch it from the beginning to realize the scope and idiosyncracies of the characters.  And for basically under $30 this disc is a steal (that's $10 a disc chokeful of wit!)It will be shame when this show gets cancelled since rumors have surrounded it for a while because Fox cant seem to promote it properly. i saw more promotion for ""Who's Your Daddy"" than for this show!"	5.0	I would give it a gazillion stars!	2005-02-01	2	2	0

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the funniest show on TV currently, although no one is watching.

Unfortunately it only lasted 3 seasons on FOX.  With this show you really have to enjoy and appreciate dry humor.  It is smartly written and I think most people don't/didn't &#34;get&#34; the humor.  There is a pattern because most of my all time favorite TV comedies have only lasted less than 5 seasons.Anyway, everything about this show is perfect.  The writing, the cast, the production value, all comes together to make it an hilariously entertaining show.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AWSRZ71TKGQ8Y	Eduardo Lino Costa	Arrested development really is that sitcom that you always hoped would come along to restore your faith on television comedies. With a public too numbed out by mainstream sitcoms such as friends, and frasier, its very seldom that an original comedy makes it through the breach to television prime time. When I first watched arrested development I imediatelly thought, this is pure brilliance, it's probably doomed. It wasnt, and boy am I glad its still going in full force, thanks to the legions of fans that recognise the fact that this is one of the bsst show to laugh out loud to, since seinfeld.DVD is, in my opinion, the perfect format to view this show, it is a serial comedy, but a lot of the better jokes involves storylines from previous episodes, so for your enjoyement, this is the perfect situation to watch chronologically, I believe that whart makes this show work is the blend of slapstick comedy, brilliant writting, and british style comedic timing.I will not bother giving you a synopsis of the story as you can read that in the description above, however, i will say that if you are a fan of original comedies, and wantt to laugh out loud, or have quotable jokes for long years to come, then i Insist you make this part of your collection.	5.0	pure genius	2005-10-19	6	6	0

You can enjoy this show the first time you watch it, but on multiple viewings the episodes reveal more and more call backs and recurring jokes. I've watched this season many times and still find new things. It's impressive how dense a seemingly silly comedy can be.	5.0	My favorite TV show	2013-04-17	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AE3UVCX1AI3DS	"""eghan6"""	"The world of half-hour televised comedy needed a good shot in the arm.  It came in the form of the Bluth family.  If you have grown weary of the idiosyncratic behaviour of the run of the mill sitcom families as seen on Raymond, King of Queens, Yes Dear, 8 Simple Rules, My Wife and Kids and so on then Arrested Development will feel like a fresh pallete of family disfunction.I am a fan of the single-camera comedy productions but Arrested leans more to the witty and circumstantial comedy that was seen on the innnovator of single-camera comedy, The Larry Sanders Show.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is getting a good run for its money as the events unfolding for the Bluth Family saga provide some of the most original and comedic writing this year -- on any show.The key...characterization.  There is no single character that demands the spotlight as they all possess foibles that avail them ample recognition.  GOB, the entertainer; always aware that the camera is on him and so he feels obligated to become his own dramatic sequence, culling inspiration from dated and hackneyed dramatic devices.  He may easily be the funniest of the ""normal"" characters on the show.  Then there's Buster; sheer commitment to timidity is all I can say about this actor.  Buster's panic attacks and faux bravados serve as great physical comedy to GOB's verbal comedy.  George Sr., the source of the disfunction is well-played by Emmy-nominated Geoffrey Tambor as his vices and complacency know no bounds.  And Michael, the straight-man to everyone else is underrated as it is through his eyes do we see the absurdity that is the Bluth family.Now the stories, great episodes include Pilot, Bringing Up Buster, Let 'Em Eat Cake, and well the other 19 episodes that I won't mention here because this series is just that a series.  It does not rely on stand-alone episodes and one-off humour.  This is an intelligent show for the educated viewer and this DVD is definitely worth a purchase as we may be looking at the heir the Gary Schandling throne."	5.0	I have made a huge mistake...	2004-09-15	1	0	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3J3BRHTDRFJ2G	"EJ Honda ""ejhonda"""	"Arrested Development brings to TV what most satirical shows lack: smart, biting, cutting-edge SATIRE!  The show is hiliariously irreverent (sometimes ""spicy""), well-written, with casting that is simply genius.  Ron Howard acts as the executive producer, and does the narration for the show.Jason Bateman stars as the only member who approaches ""normal"" of a grandly dysfunctional family.  Jeffery Tambor plays the patriarch who has built up a sizeable fortune building homes and developing real estate.  However, all is not well within the empire, and as the legal troubles mount, the eccentric personalities simply add to the mess that is becoming their lives.  The rest of the cast is stellar, without a weak link: Buster, the infantile younger brother, Gob (pronounced ""Jobe""), the older brother who dreams of being a magician and has a very high opinion of himself, Lindsay, the shallow daughter who vacillates between financial hedonism and questionable causes, Tobias, the bro-in-law whose sexuality is vague, Lucille, the mother of the clan who is all about furs and martini lunches. Too much to detail here, but not for the easily offended. Some language, adult situations, etc.  If you aren't offended by the charity HOOP (Hands Off Our Penises - an anti-circumcision cause), then you'll be ok with this show.The show is currently on FOX, Monday nights at 8:00ET - by all means, watch it!  If you've missed earlier episodes, you'll want this collection from Season 1.

Its ratings alone should have killed it long ago but it genius -- recognized even by newtork types -- has allowed it to persevere.  This is a perfectly cast ensemble show about a very dysfunctional family.  Its the kind of show where so much happens that episodes don't weaken with repeated viewing.  In fact, there's so much detail in them that repeated viewing enhance the experience.  That may be part of the problem with the show's ratings: many people may not be able to keep up with it when they see it on a weekly basis.  Here's where the DVD's come into play: the show works far better watching 2 or 3 episodes in a row.Its the kind of show where weeks later I find a joke from it flowing through my mind.	5.0	One of the Best Sit-Coms Ever Made	2005-07-15	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2V6T24IY09M0X	Felix Felicis	"Yes, you read that right. There has never been a show as funny or as unique as Arrested Development. You may think the dysfunctional family idea is played out on network TV, but believe me you have never seen it played quite like this. For one thing, the format of the show allows for a lot more comedy than a typical sitcom; it's shot like a single camera documentary, complete with narration, except the characters never address the camera directly - which helps to keep it more believable. Plus, on top of the frequently absurd and hilarious situations the Bluths manage to get themselves into, the narrator is a source of humor as well, as are the quick flashback edits that not only reveal info about our characters but allow for lots of running gags throughout. A lot of great character development comes from these montages and one-shot visual gags.The first season focuses on the plight of Michael Bluth (a stellar Jason Bateman), who has toiled away at his family's land development company for years and is finally at the point where he is expecting a promotion - which never comes, much to his chagrin, although we later learn why in a rare poignant moment. He wants bigger and better things for himself and his overly-neurotic son, George Michael (Michael Cera). His father, George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor), has run the company for years - often with shady deals or outright fraud - and isn't exactly the best role model for Michael or his son. Neither is his mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), an alcoholic control freak who has a habit of saying the nastiest thing that pops into her head.This has had a disturbing effect on the children in the Bluth household. While Michael is the most ""normal"" of the bunch, he is still sometimes self-centered and strict towards his son, though they do truly love each other and he's only trying to be a good parent since his wife died. His siblings, however, are far less lucky. His older brother, George Oscar Bluth III (Will Arnett) - or GOB, pronounced ""Job"" - is a failed ""illusionist"" and lothario who still constantly seeks approval from his father; his younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is a sheltered child-like buffoon who still lives with their mother. And his ""twin"" sister, Lindsay (Portia di Rossi), is a sexually frustrated, rebellious money-grubber who is married (out of spite) to Dr. Tobias Funke (David Cross), an analyst/therapist - or analrapist, if you will - who has lost his license to practice medicine and now wishes to become an actor. Their daughter, Maeby (Alia Shawkat), tends to ignore them both and isn't very attached to the notion of school or learning, though her own rebellious schemes are quite clever. George Michael has a taboo crush on her, which results in a lot of humorous problems for him throughout the series.The plotting is quite dense, especially for a comedy. There are frequently long joke arcs that run over multiple episodes or even seasons, but when they pay off they are MUCH funnier than anything else on television, ever. Some of these in Season 1 include - GOB's hilariously bad illusions, Buster and Annyong's rivalry, Michael's terrible luck with women, George Michael's pining for his cousin, Tobias' miserable attempts to succeed as an actor (""We're having a FIRE...sale!""), and lots of others. Many times, a single line of dialogue can have several different meanings and can also reveal a major secret about a character (For example, the seemingly innocuous phrase ""Justice is blind"" ends up destroying a relationship AND a court case, all at once). There are lots of puns and clever word-play, a lost art form single handedly resuurected by this show, and Tobias rountinely uses highly suggestive double-entendres with gay undertones, such as - ""Unfortunately, I've shot my wad on what was supposed to be something of a dry run and now I've got a bit of a mess on my hands."" The trouble that all the characters get into usually directly their own doing and often waaaay out there but since all the actors play it straight they never seem contrived or forced and somehow manage to become even funnier.Several other minor characters pop in regularly - the best being Judy Greer as George's lover and secretary Kitty, who has a habit of exposing herself; and Justin Lee as the lovable Korean adoptee Annyong (literally ""Hello""), who Lucille adopts just to spite Buster. Carl Weathers plays a parody of himself as a cheapskate out-of-work actor; Henry Winkler (yes, Fonzie) plays the incompetent, closet homosexual Bluth lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays an attorney as well, one with a penchant for lying that creates several awkward moments; and Amy Poehler is hilarious as GOB's seal-selling wife (she is Will Arnett's wife in real life). Special mention, however, goes to Liza Minneli, who plays Lucille's vertigo-prone neighbor Lucille Austero (or Lucille 2), and also Jeffrey Tambor - not only is he a riot as George Sr. (who in prison for most of the season, and loves it), but he also plays George's twin brother Oscar, and manages to make him a totally different character (as a pot-smoking hippie who's in love with Lucille and may or may not be Buster's real father).DVD is the preferable way to watch this series, because as I said earlier the jokes build on each other and become funnier when viewed in proper sequence (and of course, no commercials). The set also includes great commentaries on the Extended Pilot, ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake"", plus a cast panel discussion and plently of deleted/extented scenes and bloopers. I would recommend buying both Seasons 1 and 2 together - not only will your AD marathon last longer, but you'll save money and Season 2 is even better than this one (which I didn't think was possible, but trust me, it is). So, if you're tired of cliche filled, laugh-track laden network comedy, spend some time with the Bluth family and see what you're missing. They put the fun back in ""dysfunctional"". I mean, COME ON!!!"	5.0	COME ON! It's only the best comedy series ever.	2006-04-11	8	7	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AM9CAM6XHYU35	G. D. Barnhart	"Unfortunately, there is no intelligence channel (I-TV).  If such a channel existed, then AD could remain on the air, Scrubs would have remained funny, Mr. Show would be on its umpteenth season, and people would only admit to seasons 2-9 of the Simpsons actually existing.I knew that AD would have a short run from the very first episode.  Some of the characters are politically incorrect, the humor is delivered in brilliant Super Troopers style, and the family sometimes learns a small lesson.  The average viewer wants his/her humor blended and fed to them through a straw--evidence comes in the form of a ""laugh now, please"" laughtrack.Each character in this show has his or her own perfect quirks.  George Michael is unbelievably uncomfortable at any time, GOB is likeable due to his unlikeability (word?), and Michael is the dependable great guy with few character flaws and a massive conscience.  Nothing that any of the characters does or says is inconsistant with their persona, and Michael has enough family values to carry the entire Bluth tribe.I've been through this box set 8 times, and there seems to be no sign of slowing down.  I derive great joy from introducing more people to this work of comedic art.Be sure to never touch the Cornballer, and watch out for hop-ons."	5.0	Mom says it's too windy.	2005-02-18	10	9	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1I8F97AHES8YD	George Graham	This is the world we live in. Arrested Development, the funniest comedy in the last 10 years, is being taken off the air by Fox after three seasons. Meanwhile, Stacked is in its second season on Fox; Yes, Dear in its, what, ninth?! (I lost count); and many other crap-tastic sitcoms are still running. Where is the Punisher when we need him?Anyway, this is a review of the 1st season DVD set (which you have to buy, or you aren't...human), so listen newbies: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the only sane person in his family. His older brother Gob (Will Arnett) is a failed magician, excuse me, 'illusionist,' who always relies on Michael to get him out of tight spots; younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) is a thirtysomething still living with and relying on their mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), a selfish, alcohol-sipping woman; twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is unhappily married to struggling actor Tobias Funke (David Cross), and their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat) is in the middle of their shall-we-divorce-or-separate-or...etc.; and Michael's son George Michael (Michael Cera) is in love with Maeby, but she's his COUSIN! Oh yeah, and Michael's father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) passed Michael over for president of the Bluth housing company and is then arrested for embezzling from the company. With these people, who needs enemies?This is all the first episode, folks (give or take a plot point in the second and third). Unique in so many ways (no laugh track, thank God; filmed like a documentary; narration by executive producer Ron Howard; one of the best ensemble casts on television ever), it's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Yet it's one of the lowest-rated shows (in viewers, not reviews, which it dominates in) on television, and it was in danger of being cancelled its first season. So I suppose Fox was brave to give it two pity seasons (but the Emmys didn't hurt their decision, either). Buy the set and see what you've been missing, or if you HAVE been watching it, enjoy one of the best comedies around over and over again. And THAT's why you always watch a great show.	5.0	They've made a huge mistake cancelling this	2005-12-19	16	15	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A35L0DFQQTEX8Q	GhostWriter86	"Just not a funny show. The characters feel completely inorganic and not fully realized. They don't seem like people, they seem like random quirks assembled in the mind of a writer. Good TV completely immerses you in the world of characters. Whether they're ""real"", (it is TV after all) is a moot point because you believe they exist in the universe that they occupy--their motives, their phobia's or what have you ring true in some way. AD doesn't have that. The over abundance of idiosyncrasies were just distracting, (whenever Buster came on screen I wasn't sure what he was suppose to be. Is he just awkward? Is he retarded?). The same thing happened when Julia Louis Dreyfeus guest starred. Her whole blind lawyer gag completely pulled me out of the episode. I kept thinking that either: a) She's the worst actress alive, or b) She's not really blind. Fortunately for Julia, it was the latter. David Cross tried way too hard, I didn't laugh at all at his never-nude thing, or anything involving him for that matter, and don't even get me started on the little Asian boy.The character emotions are no more complex than a Facebook status update. Nobody seems to care about anyone. Jason Bateman's family perpetually tries to screw him. Jason Bateman doesn't seem to care about anyone either, it just seems like his arm is constantly being twisted, which it is, because if he does abandon them, then there's no TV show. Now, I'm not saying that I want everyone to be hugging or crap like that, but I would like it to be obvious that these people care about each other, (without Ron Howard having to point it out). If you want to see an example of this done correctly without being overly sentimental or at all distracting from the hilarity, watch The Simpsons season three through eight.It's the same episode over and over again. Jason Bateman tries to help his family. They make it difficult. He's about to abandon them and let them fend for themselves and in comes Ron Howard's narration reminding everyone that Jason Bateman wants to be a good dad, and set a good example, so him doing absolutely nothing can appear profound.The narration was also quite annoying. When a narrator is employed, it's usually because the story in question does not work and that's exactly case with AD. Ron Howard merely points out the subtext; stuff that should be obvious from just watching the show but it wouldn't be, unless he spells it out for the audience.It wasn't all bad, though. I loved both Jeffery Tambor and Michael Cera and they were the only reason why I finished watching the first season, (the ""there is money, in the frozen banana stand"" joke was hilarious), but the show as a whole just does not live up to its hype as the greatest thing ever."	1.0	Arrested Development re-reviewed	2008-12-09	168	23	145

Ouellette ""behind the lens in bend"""	my first review on amazon.  i am a filmmaker and writer, and will keep it very short.  when a story is filled with characters who do not care about one another and the viewer does not care about them, through normal channels, it will never, ever get picked up for production.  second, constant VO narration, which i am aware has been bought into a few times successfully, is almost always another deal killer unless the plot/characters/storys is something remarkable.  this is my opinion, i am considered to have a good and broad sense of humor and i will leave it at that.this is poorly written and flat.  let the dismemberment begin of me for being honest and just giving an industry based opinion on this show.  again, i am coming at this from being dumbfounded that this was picked up and greenlit.3 seasons says it all.	1.0	Joining the pariahs of one star	2011-08-21	149	7	142

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AAIL33CYCT47J	Gregory Baird	'Arrested Development' is one of the most criminally underwatched shows in the history of television. The cast is pitch perfect from the principles to the guests and right down to the superb narration by producer Ron Howard. The writing is pure genius, weaving the saga of the Bluth family into a comedic goldmine. You see, the Bluths are a spoiled, self centered family whose world is turned upside down when the patriarch, George, lands himself in prison for some shifty accounting in the family business. It is up to Michael, the good son, to hold his family together in the face of financial ruin and to keep the business afloat. This is no easy task considering that his family ruins the best of his intentions at every turn. His mother, Lucille, is a lush WASP who sees her children as an inconvenience until she can get something out of them -- a role that Jessica Walter makes sympathetic through her brilliant performance (and watch for Liza Minnelli's appearances as Lucille's vertigo-suffering social nemesis, Lucille 2). Brother Gob (pronounced like the biblical figure Job) is a reckless womanizer and aspiring illusionist, while younger brother Buster is a hopeless man-child stuck in the role of Mama's boy. Twin sister Lindsay is a misguided activist, whose pet projects inevitably fall victim to her wandering attention span and need for pampering. Brother-in-law Tobias is a failed psychologist and failing actor and, in a running joke, blessedly unaware of his repressed homosexuality. To top matters off, his son, George Michael, seems to have developed a crush on his rebellious cousin, Maebe. Also on hand is the great Henry Winkler (once known as the Fonz) in a recurring role as the Bluth's hopelessly inept lawyer, Barry Zuckerkorn. You would think that their myriad plotlines would get out of hand, but the writers manage to keep them in check. And wherever the plotlines go, laughs follow. I have never laughed so hard at a TV show as I have watching 'Arrested Development'. It is actually beneficial to have the DVD so you can rewind if your laughing makes you miss some of the lines. The really great thing is that the humor never wore thin during the show's two and a half season run, but it's best to start at the beginning with season one because, unlike most sitcoms, 'Arrested Development' is a linear show -- what happens in one episode effects what happens in the next. When you're finished with the first season I feel confident that you'll race out to get seasons two and three. It's that good.I would particularly recommend 'Arrested Development' to fans of 'The Office' -- the only show that comes close to Development's perfection -- because they have the same type of humor. It is a shame that we won't be getting any new episodes of 'Arrested Development', but at least we can still enjoy the show with the DVDs.	5.0	Give the brilliant show its due on DVD	2006-12-17	13	12	1

This is the only show that's put me on the edge of my seat, holding my breath until knowing for sure that it would be picked up for another season (and another, and another...are you there, Fox?)  True comedy writing at its best and quirkiest, with no ingratiating laugh track to tell you what is funny (maybe that's the problem its critics have...)When I get this set I plan to marry it.	5.0	Fox, hear our prayers	2004-09-29	10	9	1

I was laughing so hard on the plane my sides started to hurt.The extras were disappointing. There are no bloopers, even though there must have been some hilarious ones. And supposedly Michael Cera and David Cross are brilliant at improvising lines but none of those moments were heard either. The interview with the cast was severely edited so you know you missed a lot of good moments there, too.I think the show deserves 5 stars but the extras on the DVD were disappointing so I had to give it a 4.Caution to those who have never seen the show but are thinking about buying the DVD: I love it, and would recommend it to anyone, but my husband, who loves the Simpsons, King of the Hill, and other offbeat shows about dysfunctional families really doesn't like this show at all. He says he's irritated that Jason Bateman's character stays with the family and puts up with all their dysfunctional behavior.

However, please join my growing crusade (me and the guy who posted the second review above me) to encourage Tobias to reobtain his medical license.  Here's the scoop: at a crab dinner last year, i swallowed what I thought were crab testicles.  As a result of a severely developed gag-reflex, I choked on the balls, as a sort of defense mechanism.  And then came Tobias.  It was like a scene from a movie.  He came to my rescue and promptly removed his pants, exposing his denim cutoffs.  With his Docker brand khakis, Dr. Funke, wrapped the legs around my mid-section and squeezed tightly, thus causing the crab balls (which were later discovered to be deep-fried crab cakes) to lunge from my lungs and onto my date's lap.  While my date was disgusted and left the table, I spent the rest of a beautiful evening with Dr. Funke.  I don't know what Lindsey has done to Tobias, but he needs to refocus his career on medicine and then delve into acting, after his hands no longer posess that 'magical touch.'

For 'calibration' on sense of humour - I'm a huge Simpsons fan and 'Arrested' to me is the best sitcom to date.I suspect one of the reasons the show got axed is that it is difficult to enjoy the series if you missed the first few episodes and only catching it every now and then.However, watching the series on DVD means you get to grow with the funniest dysfunctional family on TV!! Several celebrity guests appearance as well.

My only guess is people really don't want brilliant TV, they want comfortable TV.  Which is why we have CSI, CSI Miami, CSI New York, CSI Seattle, CSI Grand Central Station, CSI BFE...  Look, anyone that's never watched Arrested Development, do yourself a favor and watch it.  Every single person I've ever talked to that's watched an episode or two has loved it.  Everyone that watched the entire season has loved it.  This isn't a show people like, or feel indifferent towards, and it's generally not a show people don't like.

I had seen several commercials for this on television, but had never gotten around to watching it.  So, I thought I'd take a chance on this highly acclaimed show.  After only one episode, I knew that this was going to be something that I would enjoy, and after three episodes, I was completely hooked.  I watch them almost straight through, because I just can't stop... it's addicting!  The characters are all quirky and hilarious in their own ways, with Jason Bateman holding them all together.  The writing is fresh and witty, the acting is perfectly suited to the characters, and the almost reality-show type camera work make it a very unique and enjoyable series.  (Not that I am a fan of reality television at all!)  If you are in the mood for an intelligent comedy, with an excellent ensemble cast, I highly recommend Arrested Development.  Also, after you have caught up on the story, please watch the new episodes on FOX so that it can continue to be in existence.  It would be a shame to see such a remarkable show fail due to lack of an audience.  So the next time that you see a new CSI spin-off, Law and Order spin-off (nothing against them, there are just a lot of spin-offs), reality show, or celebrity who wishes to expose every incredibly lame and stupid aspect of their pathetic life in an attempt to connect to the American people show - flip through the channels, Arrested Development might just be on, and you could help ensure that it will continue to be on for years to come.	5.0	The Greatest Show on Television	2005-10-17	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1LGEZKBNXPUW9	I. DeLuca	I had always known about Arrested Development and had watched episodes from time to time (whenever I could actually find it, since FOX loved to move it around), but I always felt that I was missing something.  Boy, did that change once I bought this first season!  I am IN LOVE with this show now, and so much of the humor makes much more sense now since I've been able to see it from the beginning.  The amount of stuff that goes on in a single episode is amazing.It was joy to discover all the different layers in terms of characters, things that you may not necessarily get being a casual fan.  I have recommended this show to all of my friends, family and co-workers and I encourage everyone to at least see the first few episodes of this show.  I cannot imagine someone who watches the pilot who won't instantly love it.	5.0	An Amazing Show!	2006-02-23	4	3	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AIJRLE558KBYW	I.L. Singleton	If you like Seinfeld of Family Guy, then you will love Arrested Developement. The show falls somewhere in the middle probably closer to Family Guy.Many people think this show is overly intellectual with snobby humor. Well, it isn't! THIS SHOW IS NOT ANOTHER FRASIER! There are plenty of dirty jokes and distasteful humor packed in each episode. One of my favriotes episodes of season 1 is Peer Pressure, where Buster gets George Michael to buy maryjane for his girlfriend Lucille. I also love Growing Up Buster and My Mother,the Car.In one of the 2 star reviews featured on Amazon, the reviewer mentioned that the main characetr's son is named George Michael and to him that wasn't very funny. However, this person obviously has not watched the show because that is very rarely ever mentioned on the show. The types of jokes made are about freeloading, sexual disfunction, prison time, alcoholism, and general family disfunction to name a few.	5.0	Plenty of Dirty Laughs.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2R5IVNNMWP47W	J. A. Brown	This show is currently the best comedy on TV; if you haven't been watching, this DVD set will prove why you should be.  It's very original and difficult to describe; the humor ranges from satirical to absurdist to obscure cultural references to slapstick to offensive, all in the same episode.  The story of a wealthy family's undoing due to illegal business practices makes for great comedy, as does the utterly dysfunctional family dynamic between all the characters.  Each character has their own quirks and motivations, and all are extremely well written and very well acted.It's important to watch these in order, because the storylines do continue, and previous episodes and jokes are referenced in later shows.This DVD set has a lot of great extras, like the commentaries and the featurette.  A lot of extras for just the one season, so it's definitely worth it.This show is the only comedy on network TV that consistently makes me laugh out loud more than once every time I watch it.  Even though it's won Emmys and has always gotten critical acclaim, it's still in danger of being cancelled.  So if you want to know what all the fuss is about, watch the first season and catch up so you can watch the second season--who knows how long it'll be on?	5.0	Hilarious and totally original	2005-02-13	2	2	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AJYC4QFDKXKZQ	Jacob L. Johnson	We never made it through an episode, despite the hope that it might get better. The scenes are all extremely short with canned little quips, minimal dialog, and stupid facial expressions to color a joke with a mock emotion/attitude. All is fakery with no attempt at creating authentic characters. Perhaps the idea was to create a farce similar to the movie Airplane, or along the lines of Monte Python, but this series totally fails. The jokes are not funny and the acting is so bad/non-existent that one is left to wonder if scenes were even rehearsed. In fact, the actors could be reading from a tele-prompter, which best describes the feeling of this series: canned, dull, without creativity or surprise. I cannot begin to imagine why anyone finds this to be funny or entertaining.	1.0	Dumb and Not Funny	2014-02-01	6	0	6

This show can be considered an acquired taste initially, but one could say the same for other classic shows such as Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm.  The pacing and narrative are different from what is typically served up on TV, so it may take some time to adjust to the quirkiness of the show...let it sneak up on you as the episodes progress, and you will be genuinely surprised at how clever and laugh-out-loud funny this show truly is.  I just wish Jason Bateman had made the cut for a Best Comedic Actor Emmy, as his work is surprisingly excellent and crucial towards grounding the rest of the loopy family members (all of them great as well) in something resembling reality, unlike the Jack & Karen slapstick nonsense in Will & Grace.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AL5OEDM8TPTKV	James Hiller	"Much has been said about Arrested Development. Many critics lauding this innovative series, wildly inventive, you have to see this show. However, this hype kept me away from this show. In reading about it, nothing seemed to appeal to me, nothing reached out and said, ""watch this"". But then, came the DVD, and on a whim, I thought I'd try it.Simply put:I haven't laughed this hard, out loud,  at a comedy television show in years.Arrested Development is a tour de force of comedy. It starts with the writing, which is, bar none, the finest in all of television land. In the creation of the Bluths, a narcissistic, troubled, and yet somehow endearing, family, we have a group of people that are both grounded and crazy at the same time. The characters are strong, fresh. The plotlines totally unconceivable and yet real. The writing is A+.Then, the actors. To pull off this craziness, you need a group of people, who buy into the vision and manage to make it real. Who would have thought that Jason Bateman could be the center of this insanity and pull it off with great talent? Portia de Rossi as a clueless socialite? Jeffrey Tambor's adjustment to prison life? All of the people turn in such classic work that they all deserve Emmys for incredible performances.Rumor has it that Fox is cutting the second second of this show short. Sure, create a visionary, ground breaking television show, and clip its wings before it truly takes flight. Had that happened to other shows in their infancy, we wouldn't have spent a decade with Seinfeld and Cheers. I implore the channel to reconsider their decision, and give Arrested Development a chance to breathe. And I implore anyone reading this reivew to click your easy ""one click"" button and order this classic. You'll be laughing so hard, you're sides will hurt!"	5.0	Welcome, Bluths	2005-02-23	10	8	2

This show is SO far from [mature] that it's a wonder it didn't end up on late-afternoon PBS, flanked by Seasame Street and Arthur The Aardvark.From the extended pilot to the last episode, this show leaves little to be desired.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2J7ZFZIKR267G	J A W	"There are more laughs, and more big laughs, in 22 minutes of Arrested Development than in 22 episodes of whatever redundant sitcom garbage ABC pumps out on Tuesday night.  Witty and slapstick silly and non sequitur weirdness all at the same time, this show boasts one of the best casts in television, and the best collection of offbeat characters not in animation.  It bears a resemblance in structure and approach to the Royal Tenenbaums (but this show has even more laughs, and is more rewatchable), so if you liked the Royal Tenenbaums or Family Guy or the peak years of the Simpsons, you'll love this show.  You know a show is great when the so called straight character  (Michael, played by Jason Bateman), has some of the best lines in the show.  Bateman is perfect with the character, he is able to balance understated sarcasm and likable human decency in a way that few actors can achieve, particularly in an oddball comedy such as this.The sleazy magician Gob, played by Will Arnett, is consistently hilarious and an ingenious comic creation.  David Cross and Jeffrey Tambor, two great comic actors from cult HBO TV shows (""Mr. Show"" and the ""Larry Sanders Show""), are also fantastic as the sexually dubious Tobias and the oblivious Patriarch of the family.  Every member of the cast has his or her moments, and each character adds something to the Seinfeld-esque interwoven plots.  The only weakness in the show, is the whole cousin crush subplot that lingered a little bit too long, and it was--intentionally--kinda creepy.Nonetheless this is one of the few items I'd recommend to someone who hasn't even seen a single episode, to just jump in and buy the DVD.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1XAP9PLDIUIPD	JB	Like many people, when Arrested Development was initially broadcast, I didn't understand it. I didn't give it time to develop and set the stage for the running gags and multi-level jokes that would come later.I highly recommend watching this series. Admittedly, it takes at least 6 or 7 episodes before things start clicking. Trust me, the commitment will pay off in the later episodes.What Arrested Development has that I haven't seen on any other television comedy quite this way are outrageous characters that do and say horrible things, yet are still somehow relate-able and lovable. The writing is quick and witty. The detail and subtle jokes lend themselves to repeated viewings, and in fact may require it. I personally enjoy the running gags (e.g., &#34;No touching&#34;).	5.0	Get into it, it will not disappoint	2013-07-16	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2M3BWCCNU7PPN	J. B	This show does have its funny parts but the fact of the matter is it's just not entertaining enough to warrant the half an hour. It's really hard to pin-point what's actually wrong with this show. The characters are likable enough, the story is fairly witty and entertaining but the whole overall concept just doesn't gel.It almost appears as if when casting for this show they took the cheap, safe avenue by getting a bunch of washed-up or unknown actors to star in it. To compensate for this as the series progresses they have MANY famous actors featuring on a regular basis. This is very a tricky casting technique, and this is going to hurt them in the long run. It's a very sneaky attempt to cheaply broaden their target audience by hiring the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfus from Seinfeld, Harry Winkler from Happy days, Amy Poehler from SNL to name only a few. It seems that they've tried to feature every actor in existence which starred in a successful show in a pathetic attempt to keep the ratings afloat. This isn't going to work, and you watch this series not last more than 4 seasons and it will only last that long because of Ron Howard's fat wallet.(Review update, now it has been officially cancelled. I told you so! How much do I rule?)I've heard some people claim this show is the new Seinfeld which is not only laughable but insulting to Jerry Seinfeld and friends. Arrested Developments downfall is the fact that the show has zero re-watchability. The episodes are more of a chore to watch at the best of times, and if you happen to come across a repeat that you've seen before you can forget about watching it again unless you like pulling teeth. That's what separates shows like this from the likes of Seinfeld; you can watch the same Seinfeld episode several times and it's still funny and entertaining. Arrested Development lacks this all important attribute, and will ultimately result in the demise of the series.If you ever see this review Ron, and wish to save your show from certain cancellation then hit me up and I'll be happy to provide you with some advice on how to fix this show although the damage may already be done.The conclusion to my review is that Arrested Development doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be. The story continues from week to week, but the story itself is dead with nowhere to go. If the father ever gets out of jail the shows over, if the remaining family members ever get their life sorted out the show is over. These massive plot holes result in each singular episode being totally random and nothing ever progresses. The father will always be in jail, the rest of the family will always be losers otherwise there's no show.To sum it all up in one line, if you've seen one episode of Arrested Development you've seen them all. And just a word to the Arrested Development fans, if you have to beg people to buy this dvd to save your favourite show from being axed then you're obviously a minority and the fact that it has now been officially cancelled states this fact clearly. Too bad they didn't hire me to fix the show for them; it could of been done but due to the problems mentioned above I could tell simply by the commercials for this show even before it came on tv that it was going to be a miserable failure in it's current format.Very predictable outcome for this show, it wont be missed...	2.0	Something's broken here	2005-10-07	146	15	131

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1MUJK6T4YK0GO	J. C. Drake	"This is arguably the best show since ""Get a Life!"" (which Fox STILL needs to release on DVD-not just a few random episodes, the whole series-but I digress). We're enjoying watching every episode in a week, to get ready for the Season 2 Premiere. However, one quick caveat for those of you that don't like strong language: the ""Extended Pilot"" on the first disc contains some VERY foul language-language that not even Fox can let through, and that disappointed me beyond words. If you're offended by repeated use of the ""f-word,"" avoid the extended pilot like the plague. (We had to turn it off after about twenty minutes.)That having been said, this show is absolutely wonderful. I've always loved how the ""next time on Arrested Development"" is hysterical, but doesn't give away the next episode because it never actually happens. If you've never seen this show, you HAVE to give it a try.Four stars for a five-star show marred by the language in the extended pilot."	4.0	Hysterical show, DVD has some unfortunate surprises	2004-11-04	22	3	19

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2VSTCKMUB46LL	"J. Conn ""Wife, Mom, Doula, Big Geek"""	Arrested Development is one of the most original and hilarious shows in a long time.  It really doesn't feel like it hits its stride until season 2, in my opinion, but Season 1 is still fantastic and what got me hooked in the first place.  AD has such a variety of comedy types, I believe everyone will find something they like, slapstick, off-color jokes, puns, and some very, very subtle jokes.  Some require a couple of viewings before you notice them - it's a very smart and fun show.I didn't watch most of the extras yet, having bought the discs mostly just to watch the episodes again. I did enjoy the deleted/extended scenes and I really enjoyed having the option of seeing the entire pilot.	5.0	A great start to a show that keeps getting better	2006-04-14	3	2	1

Arrested Development has well developed characters and the actors chosen could not fit their respective roles better. It may not have started with a large audience following but the critical reviews have been outstanding and after watching season 1, I can see why. I promise that after watching the pilot, you will want to watch the entire season that same day.

The Bluth family makes your own family seem the greatest company you could know and that's what I love about them.  This is a character driven show and everyone in the Bluth family has their own funny quirk that makes every other scene seem outrageously hysterical.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A12XLAAR6IH341	J. E. Myzell	The documentary style of camerawork began with this show. I could be wrong about that but it feels like it was the first. If AD had only started a few years later than it did it would be just as popular as The Office. AD was way ahead of its time in all ways possible and may have been too smart for its own good. It's a pretty smart comedy but got away with doing some pretty ridiculous things and it worked! The entire cast is spot on in their roles and each character is excellent at performing a comedy driven role. The writing is outstanding and the plot has many layers with each character having their own story line. No need to go into the specifics of the story because it's best discovered by oneself.

This show is the funniest show since Seinfeld and with every episode it gets better and better. If you enjoyed Seinfeld, then you must buy these DVDs. It is very cheaply priced for an entire season on DVD, and you won't regret it at all.  I will go back and watch some of the original episodes for the 4th and even 5th times and still hear new jokes that have me pausing the DVDs until I catch my breath.  The cast is by far one of the greatest ever assembled, with everyone fitting perfectly in their roles.  Henry Winkler's one liners are timeless and worth the price of the DVD's alone.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2F28HCA26QVIP	J. Gallimore	To be perfectly honest, I had never even heard of this show before a friend of mine suggested that I watch a few of the episodes.  I rented the first disc of the series and before the first episode had run to completion, I was on my way to buy the DVD set for myself.  The series is about a rich families' struggle to stay afloat after a series of incidents leads to the arrest of the head of the family company.  Michael Bluth, the son, does all that he can to keep the company going while at the same time dealing with his insanely dysfunctional family.  Every episode of this show is funny, but I would go so far as to say that some of them are uproarious.  The episode where his incompetent brother and his magician brother are construction workers has to be one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.  Arrested Development is somewhat sophisticated humor but is not completely devoid of humor that appeals to the other type of comedy fans.  Basically, this DVD set is good for anyone who enjoys a good laugh, I would suggest picking it up as quickly as possible, before everyone realizes what an excellent show it is.	5.0	One of the best purchases I have ever made	2005-01-21	1	1	0

You try to get them involved in the conversation as they sit alone not saying a word with a look of awkwardness on their face.  Your friends and you have an intimate relationship that span many years and you shared many experiences and laughs that anybody entering your conversation would be intimidated.Arrested Development isn't trying to occupy your life for a half hour every week; it is trying to be one of your close friends.  It wants you to share in the subtlety of a one word joke that will have your side hurting from laughing so hard because you have been friends for awhile and have experienced a lot together.  It is not a sitcom or a business model; it is a real live person.  You could never explain to another person the story behind a photo and have them laugh as hard when they see that picture you have of the girl in the ""Slut"" t-shirt.Fans of AD are not pretentious people; we are just close friends with the show.  It is a relationship that may have begun as casual acquaintances, but it grew to where it is now: solid as a rock.We invite anybody to join just as long as they spend time with us and commit to the friendship.  We can't just have one or two meetings and expect to know each other.  So please, join us down at the big yellow joint so you won't make a huge mistake.************************************************************************I'll agree with everybody else this show isn't for everybody, but the people who give it a serious chance will be thankful they did.  I've gotten two of my friends addicted to this show and I don't normally watch television.  Arrested Development is that good.  I had to stop watching it at work secretly on my laptop when I was trying not to laugh by covering my mouth with my hand, but this just made me cry.In my opinion, the funniest thing to hit television and one of the most creative shows ever.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A12GRQ1G4IKF0H	Jonathan	"I started watching this show a little late and at a casual glance I was put off by it's free-hand camera style and narration. Usually you can sit down and watch a show and at least feel comfortable in how they're presenting the material. But what this show accomplished it nothing short of astounding. It's so different that you have to let their style sink in as a new way of watching TV.When Desi Arnez invented the sitcom style by putting cameras and an audience in front of the set for I Love Lucy, that became the standard for over 40 years. Just like that show will be noted as a turning point in TV history, I think Arrested Development will also go down as one of the greatest shows of all time.Their scripts were crammed with so many jokes, it took my friends and I nearly an hour to watch one episode because we either missed a quick graphic insert (""Analrapist"" anyone?) or we were laughing so much that we had to keep going back to hear the next line of dialogue.They kept building on every joke and there were so many call-backs and running gags that towards the end of the series they were at a frantic pace. You could easily make 3 or 4 episodes of an average sitcom out of 1 of theirs. I think they always felt the end was near and tried to get every idea in before they were cancelled. It's very sad that they couldn't transfer it to cable or come up with some kind of deal to do partial seasons.Don't even hesitate to buy these DVDs if you don't own them or haven't seen the show. I'd pay the price of the entire box set for a single new episode. You're very lucky have the chance to watch this masterpiece for the first time.Things are going pretty crappily in the world right now, but if the fates can come together and meld these writers and actors into something so utterly perfect, maybe there's hope for everything else.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3IOS7R9SAVVYG	Joseph G Dew	When I first came across Arrested Development, I vaguely remembered the days back when this show aired and I wasn't sure if it was worth checking out - but I'm glad I did.  The cast is great, full of actors and actresses you will recognize and that are also very talented.  While the show does throw in some &#34;tender moments&#34;, for the most part it is crazy, zany fun to watch.Watching a 30 minute sitcom in 22 minutes is kind of cool, too (no commercials!), so you don't have to invest a lot of time to get a few chuckles.  My only problem with the show is that the characters are perhaps a little too zany to be believable, but everyone has a crazy uncle, aunt or cousin that relates to these characters.  Also, the storyline is great, and the Dad's prison scenes are hysterical (if you can imagine a wealthy, self-absorbed, out-of-touch-with-reality squeaky clean white guy in a general population prison - but who knows how to play the survival game in prison just like he does in the business world).While you can probably find some sitcoms with more belly laughs than this one, I think overall the uniqueness and general fun of this show is worth checking out.	4.0	Great Cast, Funny Premise, Overall A Good Show	2014-04-23	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AVR3F6VQYIMZW	Joseph Tidline	"I didn't get into Arrested development until half way through the first season, but once I saw that first episode I couldn't understand why I hadn't been watching this show. At times I find myself laughing out loud and can't seem to stop. The cast for this show is excellent and they work very well together. From the son who is secretly in love with his cousin to the son-in law who is a ""never nude"" and refuses to shower without a pair of cutoffs, this show is nonstop funny. And at the head of this clan is Jason Bateman as the son trying to keep the nuts in the asylum from completely getting out of hand. It is rare to find a show like this on the air and unfortunately Arrested Development is constantly fighting for it's life to stay on the schdeule. If not for the fans this may not have had a Season 2 or 3.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1HLX37FF1K543	Joshua Coyne	I like this show. Unfortunately, the first few episodes remind me too much of The Office which I decidedly do not like. Let me explain. The Office is the TV version of Dilbert. Dilbert is about employees suffering because they work for greedy idiots. Arrested Development starts out this way, and I do not like shows like that. However, part of the way through the first season of this show the tenor changes to be about a family with bad luck who take turns making mistakes and being there for each other. I would not go so far as to say the show displays morality, but it does work something vaguely resembling some sense of morality into some of the show.	4.0	Good, but needs patience	2013-05-21	1	0	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1LBJLQJEEDRAG	JR	Before discovering this brilliant show, I didn't really think that America was capable of producing comedy anymore on a par with Seinfeld or The Simpsons. But everything about this show, from the spot-on casting to the writing, is so perfect that you are forced to ask yourself whether you might indeed be watching the best American comedy series ever (and I'm a huge Seinfeld fan).I urge everyone to watch it, devour it, and tell all their friends about it (as I've done). You really do need to start from the first episode though and watch them in order because there are running jokes and things that you will miss if you haven't seen previous episodes. I also think that your average person might need 3 or 4 episodes to really get into it. Once you're there though, it's one sweet ride indeed.I mentioned the casting before, but it really is nothing short of brilliant. Even bit players like Henry Winkler as the Bluth's seriously incompetent attorney provide some of the biggest laughs of the entire series. Everyone will have their personal favourites - I love Davis Cross as Tobias and Will Arnett as Gob in particular - but it really is a true ensemble. Every character is vital to the overall success of this highly original and superbly written show. My only criticism is that I could have done with more screentime for the stew-loving Carl Weathers (now THAT is indescribably perfect casting!).Bring on season two!	5.0	Pure Genius	2005-07-17	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2QA16JS10I7HY	Julee P	"This is my first review for Amazon, but I love this show with all my heart and soul and I had to throw in my two cents.  If you could give a rating of 500 stars, I would have done so without hesitation.  Can I just rate it stars to infinity?In just one season Arrested Development has established itself as a classic comedy.  With imaginative, multi-layered scripts and some of the strangest characters that you've ever seen this is the perfect show to own on DVD because the more you watch an episode the more you see in it.Every character is flawed in some way (yes, even Michael), but the actors are able to make them likable and you find yourself pulling for them.  My favorites are perpetual graduate student and mama's boy, Buster and selfish, socialite mother Lucille.  Played respectively by Tony Hale and Jessica Walters, they always stand out.  That being said, though, every one of the actors and characters is wonderful.  Even peripheral characters like the terrible attorney Barry Zuckercorn and conniving secretary Kitty are memorable.As the creator of the show said as he accepted the well deserved Emmy award for Best Comedy, ""Just watch it."""	5.0	No touching.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AA5VM3KMANJRR	Justin D. Siebenhaar	"I'm not a big TV watcher and the two episodes of ""Arrested Development"" I saw on TV left me with mixed impressions.  A friend of mine showed me a couple episodes from the beginning of the season on his copy of the DVD's and I had to go and buy it the next day.  Since buying these in late October, I've seen every episode and avidly watch the show each week.This is by far the best show on TV today.  The writing is amazingly witty and the free roaming camera shots are great.  Each character relates perfectly within the setting they're in.  This type of chemistry and hilarious story lines haven't been around since Seinfeld.The one thing about this series, and this is both good and bad, is the episodes make much more sense when seen in order.  The reason I loved the series after I saw it in order was because I understood the little running gags throughout.I've shown this show to probably a dozen people with the last two months and all have gotten hooked as well."	5.0	The funniest show on TV	2005-02-09	1	1	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1PMB89C8S9IB4	KatyM	"This show is perhaps the most hilarious ever made. (Except for Britcom League of Gentlemen). I laughed out loud, helplessly. I finishd watching season one and had order seasons two and three immediately, even though I did my best to watch them on TV.Yet we live in a tragic time in which Jim Belushia is a sitcom star, Scrubs is still running, and the perpetrators of 30 Rock haven't been stoned to death for crimes against humor. The banal, the bland, and the boring.Meet the Bluths.Lucille, the evil drunken socialite whose sexuality comes in handy when the business is in trouble and who refers to her children as ""third-least-favorite"" as a term of endearment.Sweet-faced teen George Michael, is eager to please, dorky, and sexually attracted to his girl cousin and constantly trying to get her to see a dirty French film about cousins in love (hint hint).Tobias, a mustachioed married man, completely flaming, who speaks exclusively in obscene double-entendres, yet is moronically unaware of it. And he's a nevernude (which exactly what it sounds like).Two and a half seasons is more than I expected we'd ever get of this one. FOX played time-slot poker with it, which is as certain a cause of death as running TOWARD the noise of screaming teens in a haunted house on Friday the Thirteenth. A devoted fan from day one, I had a heck of a time finding the show to watch, and new episodes came on randomly, amid long stretches of reruns. Which TV exec decided that the right way to drum up fans was to constantly re-run the weakest episode? (A sweeps-month stunt involving the unspeakably creepy Martin Short playing a lecherous elderly cripple).So, this particular season? The best of them.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A25T4SRUMYLLOE	"Kayte ""Kayte"""	"The DVD is the best thing that could've happened for this series. When it first came out on TV, I would catch an episode here and there, but never really got into the show obsessively like I am now. The genius of the show is that it's on ongoing storyline with references to the past and allusions to the future and repeating ""inside"" jokes. Without watching the episodes in order, back-to-back, a lot of the storyline/jokes get lost. So, like I said, DVD technology is a superb benefit for this show. You can dedicate a weekend's worth of couch-planted joy to watching the show, in order, back-to-back, and then start all over again after the last disc has rolled. Seriously folks, this series just keeps getting funnier the more you watch it because there's SO much intelligent humor packed into each episode that you're bound to miss half of it the first watch-through.

Now I am dying for the re-runs of Season 2 to come out.I have to say that I think this is one of the funniest (not stomach hurting laughter, but ironic quirky laughter) television shows that I have seen in my adult life. It gives me odd memories of the old show Soap, which I recall watching when I was very young, and way too young to appreciate it.The writing is excellent, the acting is superb (happy to see Jason again!) and the narration by Ron Howard is like the icing on the cake. This is definitely an adult show, and bravo to Fox and company for bringing it back for Season 3.Incidentally, I have never written one of these reviews on a tv show, but I had to contribute to help get the number of votes up there so Fox knows we love this show!	5.0	Absolutely wonderful & original!	2005-06-20	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A37NNGE61AA6AZ	Kevin Jordan	Most reviewers have already noted that this is a generally well-written sit com.  It's unique in a few ways.  First, the situation is so unusual, that most viewers won't be able to identify it.  This isn't marriage jokes (Roseann, Everyone Loves Raymond).  It isn't growing up or family jokes (Cosby Show, Differnent Strokes).  It isn't city life (Friends, Seinfeld).  It's something else.  I can't think of a single character I'd want to have lunch with, but they all make me laugh.  In fact, I wouldn't want any of them in my neighborhood.  But somehow, I end up rooting for them.  There's the criminal dad.  The drunk wife.  The controlling son.  The deadbeat son.  The shallow daughter and her sophomoric, emasculated husband.  Even the kids refuse to be likable.  But still, they make me laugh.  They might make you laugh too.	4.0	Oddly entertained by generally unlikable characters.	2013-08-18	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AYF69WLAHWP0E	Kevin Kochanski	"Don't listen to reviewers who say inexplicable things like ""This is part of the holy trinity of sitcoms:  Cheers, Newsradio and Arrested Development.""  That statement is wrong on so many levels, but most importantly, Arrested Development stands alone as an amazing show, with no comparison.Don't think it's a gimmick show, or just one of any number of topical or absurdist shows that get so much acclaim.  Unlike, say, the Office, which is a whole show built around an idea that get's pretty old by the 12th episode (yes, we get it, David Brent is awkward!), Arrested Development exceeds it's hype.  It's brilliant.  It's funny.  It's witty.  It's clever.  It's not topical or ephemeral.  It's not a gimmick.  It's a saga.  It's one of the most unique shows ever, and simply one of the best ever.And any of you who worried about it standing up to repeat viewings, DON'T WORRY!

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3051KGJ63A88	Kevin Sheen	It seemed like any other new comedy, short lived. But this one was different, the characters are masterfully written and play off of each other perfectly. You are first introduced to the Bluth family, who are accustomed to living wealthy lifestyles. But when the head of the family is thrown into jail for illegal operations in the company, they all must come together, and that is one thing the Bluth family does not do well. Jason Bateman plays Michael, the only one in his family who actually has a grasp on life. An excellent first season, definitely a good buy. The writing is carefully strung together and the entire cast plays it in a hilarious fashion. Plus, there are plenty of appearances by other actors and comedians.	5.0	Newly Released DVD has my attention	2004-10-25	3	3	0

But i am so glad I did!This show portrays a family that is only stitched together by the last thread of Michael Bluth's patience. Although the rest of the family is rather idiotic, each person finds that they have some useful quality to give eventually. And even though they appear at times to hate each other, life always turns them back to the family.It is very well put together, and I am certainly going to purchase the second season. I recommend this to anyone - it can be a stress reliever when you think your life is getting hectic.	5.0	I don't know how anyone with a brain couldn't give this 5 stars	2005-10-19	5	4	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AKS9SJTHTU0OM	K. Gordon	"Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the onesane one trying to hold things together.Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to doa spin on a traditional sitcom.The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell didthey ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they hadto fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clevertwists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top,but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodeslike `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the historyof television."	5.0	I'd argue for this as the best - and smartest - US comedy TV series of all time	2012-08-20	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A185GLK2OCPEVP	K. Smith	"I'm not really much of a ""laugh out loud"" kind of person, but more of a ""smile-and-slight-chuckle"" kind of guy  (my wife is always surprised when she hears a genuine laugh out of me). Most good clever/witty comedies get this smile or slight chuckle reaction out of me (""Seinfeld"" and ""The Simpsons"" come to mind). ""Arrested Development"" is the only show that I have ever watched that consistently makes me laugh out loud during almost every episode. I have actually cried with laughter on several occasions while watching this show. One such instance was last night while watching the episode ""Bringing Up Buster"" from Disc 1 of this 1st season. I don't know why, but it just kills me when Buster starts cussing and it's just one long ""BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."" ""Well, no one's going to top that."" Man I'm almost crying just writing about it.I realize that humor is quite subjective, but everyone that I introduce to this show has LOVED it. I know some people have been complaining that the 2nd season isn't as good, but I have to disagree. The 2nd season is right on par with the first and I'll be buying that DVD as soon as it comes out too. I loved watching this show from the first airing of the Pilot and have watched it ever since. Now that I have finally purchased the DVD of the first season, I can go back and laugh until it hurts all over again.One little note: In the ""Extended Pilot,"" the cuss words aren't bleeped out like they are during the rest of the series. I think there are two ""f-words"" in the episode. Just a heads up."	5.0	LOL funny...	2005-06-09	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A136MAOWGCU2C2	K.T. May	"Fans of ""Arrested Development"" were disappointed, but in agreeance with Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of said TV show, when it was announced that it would not be returning.  It's not difficult to understand why.  Normally, when shows are cancelled that quickly, it's because they just aren't very good.  This show was intelligent, the plotlines became increasingly hilarious and complicated and the cast was just enjoyable to watch, but Hurwitz wanted to smartly end the show before the quality declined.  He said he would rather disappoint fans with less episodes than crappy ones--an excellent choice.Ron Howard provides some delightful narration for the show.  Jason Bateman carries the series as Michael Bluth, the son of George Bluth Sr., (Jeffrey Tambor) and Lucille Bluth, (Jessica Walter).  In the first episode, we learn that George, former CEO of the Bluth Company is going to prison for spending the company's money on ""personal expenses"".  Michael, the most stable of the family, is elected as the new head of the company, since his twin sister, Lindsay, (Portia de Rossi), is a spendthrift, his brother, Gob, (Will Arnett), is a failing magician with no sense of responsibility and his younger brother, Buster, (Tony Hale), is a good-for-nothing who is too obsessed with his mother to ever be successful on his own.  Michael also has a son, George Michael, (Michael Cera), who has some problems of his own, since after an accidental kiss with his cousin, Maeby, (Alia Shawkat), he thinks he may be in love with her.  David Cross plays Maeby's father and Lindsay's husband, Tobias, and, although married to Lindsay, his sexuality is constantly disputed in the same way Stewie from Family Guy is accused of being a homosexual.  Soon enough, George Sr. escapes from prison and the family struggles to keep his hideout in the attic, and various other places, a secret.  But more trouble shows up in the form of George Sr.'s identical twin brother, Oscar, (also played by Jeffrey Tambor).The hijinks and disasters tie in to each other so well in this show.  Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does and doubles it.  Henry Winkler guest stars in quite a few episodes as Barry Zuckercorn, the eccentric family attorney.  As the seasons progress, the guest stars increase, including an appearance by Scott Baio, the replacement family lawyer aptly named Bob Loblaw, (say it quickly).  Charlize Theron guest stars as an MRF, (you'll have to watch the show to find out), with whom Michael falls in love.  Liza Minnelli guest stars as Lucille's rival and, eventually, Buster's girlfriend.  There are plenty of celebrity appearances on the show to help flesh out the eccentricity of the lives of these characters.From Tobias joining the Blue Man Group and helping out the FBI by accident to the TBA foundation, to Maeby possibly not even being related to George Michael, things just get more and more complicated.  Enter also, Steve Holt, (Justin Grant Wade), who shares his own secret with Gob...and can't help but announce himself by first and last name whenever he enters a room.  Or ""Annyong"", the Korean son Lucille adopts in an effort to make Buster jealous of her ""new son"", only, she doesn't know that ""annyong"" means ""hello"" in Korean.  Or Ann, (Alessandra Toreson), George Michael's girlfriend who is often forgotten or ignored by Michael.As the show progresses, it keeps its hilarity and gains complication which makes for some excellent television.  Even though it's hard to trust a show if you've never heard of it and it has only three seasons worth of episodes, this is one show that you won't be disappointed in if you give it a few moments of your time.  Certain continuity jokes such as ""I've made a huge mistake"" just get funnier when applied to different contexts.  And this family is so quirky it's hard to relate them to your own family, so you can just enjoy watching this family act out some of the wildest events yet.  And hey, with Richie Cunningham narrating, you can't go wrong!"	5.0	Good TV has to come to an end...	2009-08-24	3	3	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2SOJZQ756CHH0	"Lehho Rebassoo ""document specialist and euphe..."	Soap was a comedy ahead of its time.  The time for its descendant, Arrested Development, has arrived.  This is the Golden Age of television.  There has never been as much quality writing and characterization.  Simultaneously, of course, television's ghettoes are more depressed than ever, and Nero will no doubt soon whip out his fiddle.  Leading a pack of hilarious and well conceived and ingeniously crafted shows, including Malcolm in the Middle; The Simpsons; The Family Guy; Home Movies; the Brak Show; Sealab 2021; Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law; and The Daily Show; Arrested Development is the funniest show on TV.  Let's hope it lasts longer than Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night and maintains the standard it set in Season One.  Curb Your Enthusiasm?  Please.  A lightweight.	5.0	Remember Soap?	2004-11-28	6	6	0

Most of the new sitcoms on TV now are not even worth watching. It's so great to see there is a new series worth watching. Jason Bateman does a brilliant job portraying Michael Bluth.  His character stands as the voice of reason for the Bluth family.  I was so happy when I heard they were making a second season. All the characters on the show work well together.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1IXUIM3375082	Liana	"This show is definitely a fine investment in your collection of brilliant sitcoms.  Because there are so many long-running jokes in this season, I do think it's easier to own and watch at your leisure rather than wait a week.If you're a person who enjoyed the BBC version of ""the Office,"" or ""Extras"" with Ricky Gervais, you will definitely appreciate the comedic pace of this show.  I also recommend this show to Wes Anderson lovers.  The sometimes dry delivery with overdramatic characters is a great contrast.What I love most about this show is its subtle attention to values and ethics.  There are actually redeeming qualities in the characters, and the undertones exist to poke fun at some of the distasteful aspects of society.  For instance, the reference to ""Girls Gone Wild"" with a different name: ""Girls With Low Self-Esteem."""	5.0	"A Show That Really ""Gets it"""	2005-12-27	9	8	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2LANEPBC0IO52	LMarie	This is one of the funniest, wittiest shows to ever be on television.There are some good summaries already posted here on Amazon, so I'll focus on how I think the DVDs are worthy of purchase.Season one of Arrested Development is terrific. It is about as perfect as I could imagine a comedy ever being. It is witty, fast-paced, bawdy and brilliant.The Season One DVD set includes a lot of background and information. The extended pilot alone, with Ron Howard's commentary, is absolutely worth the price of this set alone.Some of the jokes are very subtle, some are very obvious. This show demands that you watch each episode more than once, as many of the jokes become more apparent in a second or third viewing. You just can't catch them all the first time. Also, there is a lot of very subtle foreshadowing in many episodes.I will never tire of watching this show. It is guaranteed to give you many belly laughs and funny one-liners you'll never forget. There are jokes in this show that make me laugh so hard that I get tears in my eyes, even the third or fourth time I've seen them.Every time I loan AD DVDs to friends to watch, they are instantly addicted and mesmerized by the brilliant comedy - the writing, acting, and production.Alas, the show officially ended its run today - creator Mitch Hurwitz announced that he will not continue with the series. Fortunately, the show was wrapped up brilliantly in the final episodes on this DVD set.I cannot imagine that anyone who loves sharp, witty comedy wouldn't love this show.	5.0	Brilliant, witty comedy	2006-03-28	6	5	1

I bought season 1, I just preordered season 2.  I have watched season 1 several times and it's STILL laugh out loud funny.In these reviews, you see a lot of comparisons to Seinfeld.  Well, once you meet the Bluth family, you'll be saying ""Jerry who?""  Arrested Development blows that old gang out of the water.  So, what are you waiting for?

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2	Lovblad	This is a great deal. This is really one of the best comedies of the last decade. It only lasted three seasons but it is incredible. It deals with the problems the rich Bluth family encounters once the family leader ends up in jail. Starting from there it gets more and more crazy. The comedy varies between very often very subtle and straight-on slapstick. It is simply splendid. If you consider this first season, the first DVD is simply the best and strongest part: the second half of the season is not as superb, but still very good. At the moment it is also very cheap.	5.0	Very funny	2009-12-13	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2QKJCQMACNIAC	Maggie	Let me put it this way - I happened to catch the last 4 episodes of Arrested Development when FX ran a marathon this past Saturday...By Tuesday morning (the day the DVD came out), I was at Blockbuster absolutely desperate to see how it all began.  I was not disappointed in the least.This show is unbelievably hilarious and scathing at the same time.  In one episode, the matriarch of this once wealthy family goes to an after-party for a Spanish awards show and proceeds to ask every man there to fetch her a drink (you know, since every Latin man in a tux is a waiter and all).  The humour in this show works because while it is clearly mocking the idle rich, the writing is intelligent and the delivery is dry and razor-sharp.  I gave the DVD 5 stars because it also comes with more special features than most TV shows.  Each of the 3 discs comes with a commentary, extended or deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage of the show.This is one of the most complete shows I've watched recently - well written, well cast, and well acted.  The characters and storylines are developed throughout the arc of the season, but you won't be lost if you happen to start by watching the latter episodes as I did.  Other reviewers have compared this show to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, and The Office - and rightfully so.  I just wanted to add another show to that list - Sports Night.  Sports Night was another great, well written show that was critically acclaimed.  However, it was cancelled after two seasons.  Let's not let that happen to this show.	5.0	For the love of GOB	2004-10-20	4	4	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A7JGREYVMIQ5P	"Mark S ""HoyaFinisher"""	"This show has been a favorite among me and my friends ever since it came out last year, but it was hard to get people into it.  The DVD changed all that.  I have now ""ruined"" people's days by showing them one or two episodes off the dvd, and they get so addicted they spend an entire afternoon watching the DVD instead of doing anything else.  Its the most addictive show in my opinion on television, which for being a comedy is extremely rare.  Its a show with not just great laughs, but a lot of heart and the characters are truly human and relatable, not single dimension characters who never grow or change.  In regards to Season 2, this season is much more down to earth, mostly because it spends much of the time establishing and developing the relationships between the characters and getting the viewer used to their eccentricities and quirks.  Season 2 is great as well, but relies a lot on the viewer already understanding these quirks.  Therefore, this DVD is perfect for the newcomer and Arrested Development veteran alike, as no matter how many times you watch it you pick up something new in the episodes, and learn more about the characters.  The bonus features are great, and the hidden easter egg is very ""revealing"".  I received both this DVD and the Seinfeld DVDs for Christmas, and my Seinfeld DVDs are gathering dust, though Seinfeld was one of my favorite shows of all time.  That should tell you how good this show is.  I now make it a point to show this DVD to everyone I know, and after watching a few episodes I have no doubt that you will too.""Ah the clumsy adolescence.  Everyone goes through it, except me.

I watched ""the Office"" with Steve Carell (who I loved on the daily show), so I thought I would love it as much as this - I hated it - the only good character was Steve Carell, so it sucked - the difference with AD is that everyone is so unique and so funny and brings their own quirkiness to the characters.  And of course Jason Bateman is the best calm rational guy in the midst of a totally crazy family.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1BRBHB4P3MOL8	Matthew K. Warner	This show caught me by surprise, partly because it was so good, partially because it is so acclaimed, but mostly because it is both good and acclaimed.  Absolutely addicting, I watched the entire series in a few days.The strength of the show lies in the best writing I have seen in ages.  More to the point, the strength of the writing is its perfect character and relationship development.  Despite a large cast, the relationship of any two characters is profound.  They constantly interact, in doing so, we learn more about each character.  No one is left stranded.  The family always seems like a family, albeit everything wrong that a family can be.  The development of the ties between the characters creates an odd empathy and a familiarity with otherwise insane and over the top people.Summery, I have never seen a show (comedy or drama) that so effectively built relationships for each character.  This is difficult writing and it is done perfectly.  I recommend just buying the DVD and starting with the beginning so that you understand where everyone is coming from in future episodes.	5.0	The strength of character development	2004-11-01	4	4	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2VV0TJNJT9D3O	"Matt ""mattfl1"""	I really can't even explain it...the amount of work that must go into writing this show is unbelievable.  The subtle humor, the way episodes further into the season will make call backs to earlier episodes, the silly quirks of each of the Bluth family members.  It's a shame that (supposedly) they're thinking about canceling the show after the second season, and it's ironic that the show's best quality is probably the cause of it.  This isn't the kind of show you can just tune into in the middle of the season.  While Ron Howard (the show's narrator) does his best at getting the new viewer up to date with what's going on, this show is no where NEAR as funny unless you've been watching all along and can understand all of the sly, subtle humor relating to events past.  Honestly, this show is best to watch on DVD where you can watch episodes over again (AD marathons are great!), and rewind to hear the parts you missed because you were laughing so hard the first time.In short, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD set, and buy season two if/when it comes out.  At the risk of sounding cliche (a lot of people say this, but it's true), this is the best show on TV since Seinfeld.  On a weekend when you have nothing to do, watch all 22 episodes, all in a row.  That's the way this show is best enjoyed.	5.0	This will most likely remain my favorite show EVER.	2005-04-13	3	3	0

In the first season it has had just about the entire cast of Mr. Show: a great underground HBO alternative comedy cult hit.

This is brilliant and it keeps up the quality and the laughs from season 1 to season 2, then season 3.  In fact, it seems to be getting better as it goes on and easily had another 2 or 3 seasons life left in it.When I started watching season 1, I was thinking ""Wow !  This is the best thing since '3rd Rock From The Sun' !"".  By the time I hit season 2, I was thinking ""This is the best American comedy ever !!""  It really is that good.Unfortunately, this is another brilliant series that the Fox executives killed off too early, but you can only truly appreciate the writer's skills and the actors' talents on dvd.  I've lost count of the number of times we've had to go back and watch part of a scene again, just because there was too much going on, or because they snuck in something really subtle.  Things that many people would miss on broadcast TV, and that might have been part of the problem - it was just too darn clever.Do yourself a favor and go to a place where dvd's are sold (or rented) and buy it (or rent it) and watch it.

It hasn't aired yet here in Australia, but I bought the DVD to see what all the fuss is about, and I've never laughed so hard. Gob is the older brother with a strange scooter and a magician, Michael is the hero - trying to survive while his twin sister moves in and bludges money off him. Buster is hilarious as the 'baby' of the family, and if you're a middle child, you'll know what that's like.I reccommend at least renting it, or catching an episode, because it's honestly one of my favourite TV shows of all time :)	5.0	Believe it or not	2005-06-28	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3CXM6GUPK2TE0	"M. Gosse ""Kiwi girl"""	"This was one of my favourite 5 TV shows, until its too-early demise.  Arrested Development follows a wildly funny fall-rise-fall scenario for each of the individual characters of the Bluth family, as well as for the family fortune itself.  In the pilot, the family patriarch is arrested and the family's assets frozen, and pretty much the rest of the show is about the middle son (Michael) trying to run the family company and make money in spite of the rest of his hilariously incompetent relatives.The mother is a lush, the older brother (Gob, pronounced Job) is a failed magician who continually ignores the limits of his talent, the sister (Lindsay) only has experience with spending money rather than making it, and the youngest brother (Buster) is a complete failure at life and molly-coddled by his mother.  Add in Lindsay's hopeless/hapless husband (who becomes and will remain an unemployed actor in all the shows) and strong-willed teenage daughter, and Michael's placid, naive teenage son George-Michael, and you have an extended family moving inevitably from one disasterous scenario to the next.The show uses, what I would call, ""fake reality-tv"" type camera work.  The scripts are funny (NO toilet humour) and witty, the acting is brilliant, and the episodes build on each other, so really should be watched in the correct sequence.  If you want a great laugh, with characters you can feel for, this is the show for you."	5.0	One of the best recent US comedies	2007-01-09	3	3	0

My wife and I were howling with laughter through disc one, and I immediately purchased the set.It's got to be the funniest comedy out there, but I can understand why it doesn't get huge ratings.  You have to watch them in order, there's a continuity to the episodes.  If you watch an episode tonight on tv it will be hysterical, but you'll also get the feeling that you're missing part of the story.And that's why the dvd set is so perfect. The writing is terrific and complex; there's not one storyline per episode, there's often three or four.  They intertwine to become some hysterical mess by the end of the episode.  Every actor on this show delivers fantastic performances, their characters are so hysterical!I feel bad because I have not watched the second season, I've been waiting for the box set.  But thankfully it has been renewed for the third season, and getting it renewed was too close to the wire.Therefore I am begging people to set their tvs on this show, let it get the ratings it needs to continue.

This year, that show is Arrested Development.""This is the type of show that we should be embracing...and in its time slot just after The Simpsons, you'd think there wouldn't be a problem finding a substancial audience. So, what is the problem? Why are we threaened with the possibility of cancellation of a show that, given a chance to grow and nurture, could well be the Seinfeld of its generation?The answer lies in the fact that the viewership out there is not sophisticated enough, so forcefed they are on ""reality"" TV that they wouldn't know a great comedy if it jumped up and bit them on the...Hey now! (Sorry, wrong show). I was a skeptic when I first heard about this show...but once hooked, I went out and bought the DVD set as soon as it became available.Why? Because the show is FUNNY. It makes fun of all of the things we think about the rich and does it in a way that also makes us think, ""I guess this could happen...maybe...?""The characters on the show are all wonderful in their own quirky ways. Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth is supposed to be the glue that holds this disfunctional family together, playing it straight faced even though he seems at times to be the most disfunctional of them all. Will Arnett is brilliant as Gob, the brother who'd like to have it all, but doesn't want to work for it...and possibly the worst magician in creation. David Cross as Tobias and Portia de Rossi as Lindsay, the most confusing couple on television, and the support of all of the characters, especially Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr. makes this an ensemble not seen in a long time...everyone is well defined and different in their foibles. And add the likes of Liza Minelli and Julia Louis Dreyfuss (ah, the Seinfeld connection) to the mix and you have a briallian array of stars and guest stars.Highlights, well, all of the shows, really, but personal favorites include, in no particular order:1. Pilot2. Top Banana3. Key Decisions4. Pier Pressure5. Beef Consomme6. Shock And Aww7. Altar Egos8. Justice Is Blind9. Best Man For The Gob10.

First it must be said that Arrested Development is much better than Curb Your Enthusiasm, a lot cleaner also.  The show centers around a son who has taken control of his family's company because his dad's corruption and fraud, the father is in prison.  The entire family is dysfunctional in ways you will be unable to imagine.Buster is one of the funniest characters on the episode.  He is perpetually babied by his mother and is a victim of frequent panick attacks.  Also I like the character George Michael whose relationship with his cousin is one of the funniest recurring themes.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	ALGWESJ12GE8O	Miguel Medina	"The Fox network has matured by leaps and bounds in the past two-three years, a renaissance of sorts. I am a loyal NBC viewer with shows like The West Wing and E.R. But now with 24 and Arrested Development on Fox, well let's just say ""thank God for Tivo""! Arrested Development is one of the funniest, smartest shows to grace the small screen in quite some time. I love this show! The more I watch it the more I appreciate the cast and their talent (they casted each character perfectly). This sitcom has definitely revived Jason Bateman's career just as 24 did for Kiefer Sutherland. Buy it now!"	5.0	This is on Fox?	2004-11-23	5	3	2
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2M50H3CLYLLLF	Mike G.	This show is incredible.  I love that they came back for season 4, but it is upsetting that they can never get back to the quality of those first three seasons.If you ever plan on watching Arrested Development, don't start with a random episode.  You won't get it.  Instead start with the first episode of season one and move forward.  Most of the jokes in the later episodes are call backs or inside jokes to earlier storylines.	5.0	Great first 3 seasons	2013-07-12	0	0	0

It is such a money show.  Every character is perfectly cast.  My favorites being Dr. Funke and young George Michael.  I like George Michael because I can relate to his predicament.  I too have had unholy feelings for one or more of my cousins.  To see him struggle to control his urges gives me strength to battle my own.  If not for this show I believe that I would be the father of my own nephew by now.  I can also relate to Dr. Funke because I too would like to jump in bed with Robert Redford.  What?

I realize in the views of AD's thousands of rabid fans, that doesn't qualify me to have an opinion. But in case there is anyone out there who's still on the fence about it, here's my take:The writing is smart. The setup is intriguing and amusing. Jason Bateman and Michael Cera are appealing. A few of the other characters are fun to watch. But on the whole, I don't enjoy shows where almost none of the characters are appealing personalities and nothing good ever happens. The whole point (at least in the first few episodes) seemed to be that things would go from bad to worse, no one else in the family could be trusted to behave like a rational adult, and poor Michael and/or George Michael would be left holding the bag, every time. I don't get that much enjoyment from watching other people's misery, even if it's meant to be humorous.	3.0	Smart, but a downer	2009-05-15	17	2	15

A fresh concept that uses the extremely talented cast to huge advantage - how could it go wrong?  It doesn't.  Each episode is a gem, and kudos to the casting department.  The cameos in particular are hysterical.  One of the joys of the DVD collection is that it includes oodles of outtakes - a must for a show with some of the best improvers in the business.  Also, nice commentary on a couple of episodes by the whole cast.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1KAR9G699RM56	M. Miller	Now, I do not watch a huge amount of TV by anyone's idea, but when I saw Arrested Development I was struck by something original, creative, and strangely humorous.As the intro says, the story is about a family that has been in business problems, and one son, Michael Bluth's (played by Jason Bateman) attempt to hold the family together.  That may seem like a simple premise, but behind that are hours worth of enjoyment.As opposed to your traditional dysfunctional family, this one still struggles to remain a family; however, it also seems comfortably aloof.  Whether that entails a strange connection between Michael's son George Michael (played by Michael Cera) and his cousin Maeby (played by Alia Shawkat from the equally good 'State of Grace.'Another example involves a mid-thirty aged son named Buster (played by Tony Hale) and his strange connection with his mother Lucille Bluth (played by Jessica Walter).  Either way it is the family's own imbalance that drive this show, along with some great acting to support the excellent and unique plot.There has been some time since a show has been this funny and smart, probably early-Sorkin days.  Thus, Arrested Development holds its head high as one of the best shows today, and deservedly so.	5.0	It's all about family, isn't it...	2005-01-17	2	2	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AOWXV83EYUMER	"M. Milliken ""y2kpeanut17"""	Let's just get the big stuff out of the way: This is the best network television comedy ever. Period. Seinfeld is a close number two (well, not that close). The really secret of this show is the writing and casting. The characters they created were set up from non-stop hilarity from the start, and the show's writers never dropped the ball. Not only do they maximize each character's comedy contribution, but they continuously build on the jokes of previous episodes and seasons. Watch for the blue hand prints all over the house in season two. Make sure you get the DVD, because you can miss alot of the jokes on TV, I'm still picking up new double meanings that i didn't even get in my first 3 viewings. Anyone that says this show isn't witty, clearly must have no wit of their own and rely on canned laugh tracks to tell them when something is funny (a feature that Arrested development has no need for). Pick up this DVD immediately, and get caught up and watch the final 4 episodes of season 3. Maybe if a couple million more people tune in, FOX might realize they are a bunch of italian suited idiots who just threw away the best show on TV. (In case you didn't hear, season 3 has been reduced to 13 episodes and fox has not optioned a new season). But never fear, there are still 53 terrific episodes through three seasons which is more than enough to teach you what you've been missing all these years.	5.0	Who's Your Pop Pop?

From the advertisements, it seemed like a totally lame show and I refused to waste my time trying it out.  However, 5 years ago, I was up all hours of the night with a new baby.  Nothing good was on TV, and I stumbled across Arrested Development while channel surfing.  I figured it was better than watching infomercials, so I tried it out.  It was all I could do to not wake up everyone in the house with my laughter!  From that point on, I was glued to the TV every time it was on.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2F3M93RRLFQNJ	mrliteral	The Honeymooners ran for only one season, yet is considered a classic.  Full House ran for years and years, yet few would consider it a classic in anything other than a camp fashion.  The lesson is that duration is not a standard for determining what makes classic TV.  Arrested Development ran for only three seasons (two of which were shortened), yet it is not only a classic, it is one of the best TV comedies ever.Told in a mock documentary style, Arrested Development is the chronicle of one of the more dysfunctional families on TV.  Season One begins with patriarch George Bluth under arrest for a series of crimes related to his home construction business.  While he languishes in prison, it falls on his son Michael to hold things together, an effort that keeps being undermined by his family:  his older brother Gob (pronounced Job with a long o), a not-very-gifted magician; his twin sister Lindsey who adopts various causes when she's not out clothes-shopping; his mother Lucille who has virtually no maternal instinct; his younger brother Buster, a man-child with a strange mother-fixation; his brother-in-law Tobias (Lindsey's husband), an ex-doctor turned wannabe actor, and his niece Maeby, a schemer who relishes her own parents' neglect.  Only Michael and his son George-Michael are relatively normal, but even they have their quirks, particularly George Michael's crush on his cousin Maeby.Adding to all the fun is Ron Howard's brilliant narration; sometimes even he gets emotionally involved, such as when one character insults another by calling him Opie.  And there are all some great guest stars, including Henry Winkler as the Bluths' inept attorney; Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a prosecutor who may or may not be blind; Heather Graham as George Michael's ethics teacher who he (and every other male student) has a crush on; and Liza Minelli as Lucille 2, Lucille's rival and Buster's bizarre love interest.There are 22 episodes in this set, and all are brilliantly funny: if I've omitted much in the way of plot description, it's mainly because the episodes have to experienced, not merely described, to be fully enjoyed.  Beyond the episodes, we get a few extras, including the original, uncut pilot episode, a handful of episode commentaries, some behind-the-scenes looks and some deleted scenes.  In its time, it was unappreciated by most people and treated rather shabbily by Fox (who tossed it everywhere in the schedule), but now on DVD, you have the opportunity to see TV comedy at its best.	5.0	One of the best comedies ever	2007-06-23	1	1	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A26MJTY5E95YL3	M. Tappana	"Try to remember the most fun you've ever had. Chances are you're thinking about time you spent with close friends. In your funniest memory, your friends aren't telling set-up/punchline jokes, are they? The fun is in the journey and in a mutual appreciation of one another's idiosyncrasies. The inside jokes that can make you laugh on a street corner 10 years after the initial incident are things that happened, not formula joke.Arrested Development is not a sit-com. It is not a 3 camera set-up/punchline show. It is character-driven comedy that gets funnier the more time you spend with the characters, learning their histories, understanding past events. Jokes build in layers from episode to episode and season to season, because they are rooted in the characters, rather than being contrived one-liners.Unequaled storytelling and fantastic performances can make you laugh just as hard with a deadpan silence as they can with an absurd dance. The humor is a constant non-stop stream. If there is something happening on the screen it is either (a)planting the seed for a joke that is growing (b)the payoff for a joke that has been brewing (c)a callback to a joke that already happened. The jokes are as layered and deep as you can hope for.Examples- For most of one episode, Tony Hale's character, Buster, is missing his prosthetic hook--his hand having been bitten off by a trained seal his magician brother released into the wild. Eventually someone asks where it is and the show cuts to him doing The Robot to ""Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto"" and accidentally stabbing the hook into the dashboard of the family ""stair car"" - Which is all a callback to Tony Hale's famous 1999 VW commercial in which he dances to the same song inside the new VW. (Of course I didn't catch that until later)The episode in which Justine Bateman plays a prostitute that Jason Bateman mistakes for a long-lost sister is titled Family Ties.George Bluth says that when he met Saddam Hussein he didn't know who it was and complimented him for his work as the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. Episodes later the brothers visit a house full of Saddam doubles- one of which is discreetly played by Larry Thomas (played the Soup Nazi for Seinfeld)YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ANALYZE THE JOKES OR WORK HARD TO FIND EASTER EGGS LIKE THESE! But when you consider just how dense the humor is, you can laugh as much or as little as you choose. Brain turned on = funny. Brain turned off (traditional position for sit-coms, which are like humor T-ball games) = not funny.It's an absolute feast of comedy if you're willing to go along for the ride. Funniest show ever. Sad that it didn't find a wider audience. I would have subscribed to premium cable just to watch the show if it had transferred."	5.0	Most concentrated dose of comedy ever televised	2006-09-19	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1OPESKKD75GYU	MTJones	"In general, I don't believe in buying DVDs. If I want to see a show, I'll hop down to my local library or Blockbuster and get it there. After all, few discs are so good I want to see them twice.Not only did I rent Season One twice, I rented it twice back-to-back (the first time for me, the second time to show it to my brother). I watched it both times, fell in love with it, and Season One became my first official DVD purchase. Huzzah!I love the incredibly clever humor of this show. It doesn't resort to slapstick a la Three Stooges (though I love that too), it doesn't resort to sarcastic one-liners a la Friends (though I love those too). Instead, it puts the ""situational"" back into ""situational comedy"" and takes us for a wild ride.A dysfunctional family is no doubt stressful for anyone who's a member of it, but this show strikes comedy gold in a simple truth: everyone else loves to laugh at your dysfunction. There's an undercurrent of love and loyalty between the Bluths, mainly due to Michael's efforts. But there's a strong friction as well, and the way the family members interact brings that to light.I don't want to get into plot points and risk spoiling the surprise for those of you who haven't seen it. Suffice to say that this is the only sitcom that has managed to make me laugh so hard, I cried.Give it a shot. You're missing out if you don't."	5.0	Quirky, but Tastes Great	2005-09-12	3	3	0

Without you, Arrested Development would no longer be around.Now, on DVD, we finally have the DVD set from one of the best Sitcoms to come out in recent years.  Though its ratings were low, its begun to recieve national spotlight, thanks to their win of the Emmy Award for Best Comedy, as well as this release of the first season on DVD.Produced and narrated by Ron Howard, the show features amazing ensembe casting, including the surprisingly intelligent subtle character played by Jason Bateman, and other great performances throughout the cast (including comedian David Cross as the hilarious uncle Tobias).The DVD is a must buy for fans of the shows, or even people who have just heard the hype surrounding the show.  It deserves every positive review it gets- the show is quite possibly the best sitcom to come out since Seinfield, and deserves to stay in our homes and on the air.	5.0	The Best Comedy You Aren't Watching	2004-11-23	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1NALOTZ3J1E1O	"nc_beagle ""Mark"""	I'm pretty sure that this show won't appeal to everyone. The type of humor is often dry and of the inside joke or double-entendre type, though it certainly doesn't hesitate to using pratfalls and just plain silliness.At first, I wasn't crazy about some of the characters. Buster, especially, annoyed me. But that really didn't last long. All the characters have their purpose and Buster is now one of my favorites. There are a number of cameo appearances by well-known actors, but when you consider that the first season was in 2003, you realize that you are seeing some, like Michael Cera (a regular cast member) very early in their careers.I've tried to think of other shows that have the same type of mix of characters or that would appeal to the same taste in humor, but have had little luck. Seinfeld, I suppose is the closest I can connect, though it didn't really have the underlying, ongoing story line that A.D. has.If there are any weak points to the show, it could be that story line. I will say that I am halfway through the second season (watching on Amazon Prime) and wonder how long they can keep up the &#34;dad is a fugitive&#34; and &#34;the company is in jeopardy&#34; parts. But, in the end, it doesn't really matter. Most of the humor is tied to the sub-plot within each episode and in spotting the visual background jokes (like Snoopy's dog house.)Though there is the linear plot with the father, you don't really have to watch the episodes straight through to enjoy them--though I've heard that the new 2013 season kind of requires that you do.There is only one thing that has puzzled me and I'm not sure if it's just part of the humor or something else. When the narrator (Ron Howard) previews the next week's episode, a lot of what he mentions never happens.Give it a watch. It's safe to say you'll know from the first or second episode if you like it. The cast works well together from the start, so there really isn't that &#34;breaking-in&#34; period where you wait for them to gel.	5.0	Quirky and Hilarious	2013-05-28	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AZ2K08MNJFR16	"N. Chiemelu ""movie slave"""	I just got this on DVD a month ago and have watched the entire series twice already!  The word hilarious doesn't even begin to describe the funniest TV show I've seen in a looong time!The cast (with possibly the minor exception of Portia de Rossi who I think could be better) is amazing.  Special attention goes to Will Arnett as the cocky, ridiculous but deep down sensitive and eager-to-please Gob (I love his magician poses and the way he mocks Copperfield), Jessica Walters, who makes bad parenting look good, Henry Winkler, in his best role ever, Tony Hale (how can you not love Buster?) and of course, Jason Bateman who proved that he had a lot more to offer than Hogan's Heroes.  His dry wit and clever one-liners are great and he's the stable center of the entire show.  Jeffrey Tambor, David Cross (who finally got a role suited for him), Michael Cera and Alia Shakwat fill out the rest of what is undoubtedly the best cast on television.The deleted scenes (in the extras section) are just as hilarious and make you wish the show was a full hour so everything could stay in.  Can't wait to see what the second season has in store!  I'm hoping they get rid of Anyang, though, that joke was funny until he learned English.  And more of Carl Weathers (what is with his obsession with stew?), Liza Minnelli, Henry Winkler, Kitty, and the Hot Cops!	5.0	A truly laugh out loud sitcom	2005-01-26	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AJKWF4W7QD4NS	"N. Durham ""Big Evil"""	Fox has a sordid track history when it comes to their prime time shows.  There have been plenty of series' that were canned way too early and never given the time to grow, but thankfully Fox had the good sense to give Arrested Development a fighting chance, before ultimately pulling the plug after three seasons.  Created by Mitchell Hurwitz and executive produced by Ron Howard (who also narrates) and Brian Grazer, Arrested Development tells the sordid and hilarious tale of the Bluth family, who gets rocked with controversey when their wealthy empire falls on hard times when patriarch George (Jeffrey Tambor) finds himself and jail, and son Michael (Jason Bateman) must do everything he can to keep the family together; ranging from his alcoholic, pill-popping mother (Jessica Walter), wanna-be magician brother Gob (Will Arnett), useless brother Buster (Tony Hale), his twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), her clueless husband (the hilarious and deadpan David Cross), their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat), and his own son George Michael (Michael Cera) who secretly houses a massive crush on his cousin.  Yeah, and you thought your family was weird.  A comedy that isn't for everybody, Arrested Development got by thanks to it's sharp, witty writing and amazing ensemble cast, and Howard's deft narration didn't hurt either.  Loved by critics and revered by it's loyal fans, Arrested Development struggled in the ratings department, which is a shame because it is all so rare that sitcoms are this inventive and funny.  This first season is proof of this, and it's a shame that this brilliant comedy met it's demise far too soon.  All in all, Arrested Development isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoyed the show while it was on or are looking to check it out to see what all the fuss was about, this is definitely worth picking up, as are the following seasons.	5.0	Brilliant	2006-11-01	3	2	1

I know what you're thinking - things aren't the best ever these days.  The best ever is something that always happened a very long time ago, back in the good ol' days, right?After just two seasons on television, Arrested Development is the best comedy in the history of the boob tube.Of course, ""best"" can't be quantified, and preference is subjective.  And there are plenty of folks who have watched this show and not cared for it.  And I've noticed - if you feel that ""the Simple Life"" is quality television, this show isn't for you.  If you have attention deficit disorder you might have trouble following the continuing plots and running gags, but believe me, a twelve year old could catch up in half an hour.So, the show isn't for everyone.  In fact, maybe quite a few people have surfed by AD on a Sunday night, given it five minutes, and passed.  If you belong to this group, slow down.  Give it an episode, maybe two.  You won't start to ""kinda"" like it - you'll fall in love with it, you'll start fiending for another AD fix.  You'll find yourself laughing in public for what appears to be no reason, but you won't care what others think, because you've acheived true enlightenment.I'll leave the details to the many, many excellent reviews already available here at Amazon.  The best deadpan ever recorded, a perfect cast, and the writing.... the concept in general.  It's perfect, and the reviews are unanimous.So pick up this DVD set - $30 is nothing, considering how many time's you're going to watch each episode.  And the next time you see someone laughing to himself, for no apparent reason, you'll understand why.  Save yourself, save Arrested Development - don't make a huge mistake."	5.0	quite possibly the funniest comedy in television's history..	2005-04-22	8	8	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	AUJH1WVX56LXU	NeverNude	If it weren't for my brother I would have probably never known about this show.  We were at a store when he asked me if I'd ever seen the show.  I said no and he said, 'You gotta buy season one, it's (bleeping) hilarous. You won't regret it.' I told him that if it was so damn hilarous then why doesn't he buy it for me.  He did and I owe him my first born son. Every episode I ask myself 'Who writes this stuff?!'  You do need to start from episode one so you can catch all the little jokes.  But even after that you'll find yourself catching new things when you watch the episodes over and over again. And you WILL watch over and over again. I can't believe I missed this show but now I know it's here and I plan on watching religiously.  This is hands down the best show I have ever watched and that includes The Simpsons and Seinfeld.  Every character is lovable and brings so much to show.  The only flaw this show has is that it might be a little too smart for mainstream America.

First, the camera moves at kind of a fast pace with a laugh every second cuz the dialogue is so elaborately well written.  I am a big fan of David Cross but he's not even the funniest character on the show.  Jason Bateman turns out to be really good as the ""straight"" character.  Jeffrey Tambour is hilarious as the prison inmate father who converts to Judaism and starts his own video program.  The actor who plays Buster is probably the most awkward character with some of the funniest scenes.  The other brother, Gob, is good as the suave, lazy guy who dresses up as a cop sometimes.  And then there are the children, George Michael is great as the hard working and insecure youngster who's cousin (?) has many funny quips.

Wonderful characters interact believably despite the often bizarre situations they might find themselves in (Tobias prowling around a house belonging to someone he thinks is blind but can in fact see everything he is doing - you have to see it to believe it).

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1GN8UJIZLCA59	P Magnum	Season One of Fox's Arrested Development is a brilliant piece of television.  The show focuses on the Bluth family who's wealthy carefree lifestyle is shattered when patriarch George Bluth (the always great Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested for defrauding his housing development company's investors.  Jason Bateman stars as Michael Bluth, the only normal and sensible family member, who must lead the company back from ruin and keep his family in check.  His mother Lucille (Jessica Walter) is an alcohol swilling schemer who won't let go of her luxurious lifestyle, his twin sister Lindsay (Portia Di Rossi) is into bizarre social causes, her husband Tobias (a hysterical David Cross) who is a former psychiatrist turned actor, his older brother GOB (Will Arnett) an illusionist, his younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) who suffers from panic attacks and still lives like a child with his mother, his son George Michael (Michael Cera) has a bizarre crush on his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat).  Michael must juggle his family's eccentric behavior, try to get information from his father in jail and raise his son.  Series executive producer Ron Howard narrates the show and his even-handed tone adds the right amount of gravity to the goofiness.  While all the supporting players are great, Mr. Bateman is the true star of the series.  His reactions to the off-the-wall behavior of his family are deadpan perfect and he shows great range.  The show was not a big hit with viewers, but the show won the Emmy for outstanding Comedy Series.	5.0	Arresting Comedy	2005-07-22	6	6	0

I have NEVER seen comedy this witty and intelligent on broadcast television.  Have I been under a rock?  Did I miss a meeting?  This sort of stuff belongs with Curb your Enthusiasm on HBO or another cable network.  It is utterly dumbfounding that FOX went ahead and took a risk on this show.The Show is shot in a very independent free-flowing style.  No laugh tracks, no audience, and no artificially lit sets.  It makes you feel like you are watching a documentary.It is also very refreshing to see a break from the typical sitcom character formula.  Gone are the sterotypical over-worked house wife and beer-loving pig headed white husband.  The characters in Arrested Development are REAL characters with interesting flaws and motives, albeit this has got to be the most messed up family to ever grace the screen...yes even more than the Bundys.  This coupled with some quality comedic acting, especially from David Cross, makes Arrested Development FAR above par.If you like ytour humor witty and in-direct, you will love this show.  Fans of Curb your Enthusiasm and The Office will have a lot to enjoy here.	5.0	Since when was network television THIS GOOD?!	2005-10-17	1	1	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A227SO7YE6Z0U2	Prescott Cunningham Moore	Critically acclaimed Emmy Winner Arrested Development is the most refreshing and entertaining show aired in years.  This docudrama styled sitcom from the minds of Ron Howard and Mitchell Hurwitz follows the bankrupt Bluth family after the patriarch (Jeffery Tambor) is arrested for defrauding investors.  Thus, the only sane member of the family Michael (Jason Bateman) desperately tries to save his family from financial ruin while combating his siblings and mother for control of the family company.  The season begins a bit rocky with a hilarious but somewhat discursive pilot that sets the stage for the series.  However, the show quickly takes off with one brilliantly funny episode after another.  The quick repartee writing of the show is magnificently showcased by an amazingly deft ensemble cast including Portia de Rossi, Will Arnett, and Jessica Walter.  The actors play off each-other seamlessly, effortlessly highlighting the hilarious scripts.  In our post-Enron world, the show has a grain of truth to it, but you can't help falling in love with the machinations of the Bluths.  This comedy isn't for everyone however.  This isn't the mindless predictability of Friends or the simplicity of Everyone Loves Raymond.  Arrested Development keeps company with Seinfeild, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and the better days of the Simpsons.  If you like quick, clever, biting humor, this shows for you.  Highly recommended.	5.0	One of the funniest and most refreshing shows on television	2005-01-08	4	4	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2OUHMQP1BTLED	P. Smith	It's about time Fox made something funny again. Starring Jason Bateman (you may recognize him as the fat kid from Stand By Me), it is a hilarious story about what happens to the wealthy Bluth family after it's patriarch is arrested. With wacky characters like his outrageous mother who is far too acustomed to being rich, his idiot brother the magician, and his sister (who doesn't understand the real world) as well as he never-nude husband and rebellious teenage daughter who is constantly tempting Michael's son, it's hard to keep a straight face.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3GN5J5DJGTZJS	"Rachel Gray ""Reg"""	I love funny stuff, and seek it out. Having seen a lot of funny stuff, I honestly think that Arrested Development may be the funniest sitcom out there. This first season sets the bizarre story in motion, introduces us to the wonderfully outrageous characters (and the couple of almost normal ones too), perfects the unusual non-linear storytelling technique--utilizing a funny voice over narration (by Ron Howard!) that makes sense out of what is not explicitly shown--and, most importantly, makes me laugh so hard that sometimes tears come out.The DVD set also includes extra features that really add to the show, most notably the full length version of the pilot episode. There are also commentaries on some episodes, which will be interesting to people who like commentaries.	5.0	Utter hilarity	2010-09-02	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A30OR37UBU2MVG	Rachel	This might be the funniest show on TV right now. My friend introduced me to the show last year, and initially, while I thought the show was funny, I wasn't extremely impressed with it. I kept watching the show, though, and eventually I came to love it.I received the DVD for Christmas last year, and after watching all of the episodes again, I find the show even funnier. I laughed more times when I watched the episodes again than I did when I saw them for the first time.It might have taken more than one episode, but I love this show. I also hope that the show finds a bigger audience now because there have always been rumors that FOX will cancel the show. It would be an outrage if they would cancel (in my opinion) the only good comedy show on TV today.Between all the old, trite, boring sitcoms on TV right now, Arrested Development is genuine comedy.	5.0	sophisticated humor	2005-01-28	2	2	0

You'll fall in love with the absurdity of every character.Do you yawn when listening to the bland, contrived jokes of recent sitcoms?  Watch Arrested Development!!  It is pure genious.  Spontaneous and funny remarks from every character will catch you off-guard and make you collapse in laughter.The first episode you'll think it's weird.  The second episode you'll think it's quirky.  By the third episode you will think it is the funniest thing ever!  Just make sure to watch at least three episodes before you make any conclusions.As you can see, I am a fanatic about this.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A4ZPGB3IEUYCI	"redguru ""RedGuru"""	"Saying that this is the best comedy series currently on American television is obvious in the extreme.  There have been embarrassingly few comedies that have respected the viewers' intelligence as much as this perceptive series.  It is not surprising to see the amount of critical praise that has been heaped upon this work.  The erudite writers do not create quirky characters simply for the sake of making them interesting.  Each has his or her complete back-story that fits into the entire dysfunctional family system.This is rare comedy that can be enjoyed on a superficial level but what also bears scrutiny on deeper and intellectual levels.  In other words, after you are finished laughing, you can think about it and laugh some more.It never condescends to the viewer; it seems that the writers truly couldn't care if anyone ""gets"" a particular joke.  Let me site my favourite comedic thread: Canadian actor Will Arnett's character, Gob (for George Oscar Bluth) believes that his girlfriend is having an affair with ""Hermano.""  For those *completely* ignorant of the Spanish language, this means, ""brother.""  The writers never explained this in the episode, however, until the following episode.  When his responsible brother Michael (played by newly-acclaimed actor Jason Bateman; yes, brother to Justine) asked him why he didn't know the word after some four years of studying the Spanish language in school, he replied that they didn't teach words like that in class.Enjoy what tends to be a contradiction in television: a hilarious intelligent comedy.  And thanks to the producers for not having a laugh track to tell us what is funny."	5.0	Intelligent Mirth	2004-10-17	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3CDR7VEX55JAD	"Red Wood ""critic"""	&#34;Arrested Development&#34; is considered, in several polls, as one of the best TV programs of the last decade - if not #1, in fact, on many reviews. This is what brought me to stream it. My wife and I both got caught up in the show, after the first few episodes (any show takes a couple episodes, at least, to start moving). It's in the one-camera style and is really one of the main reasons this style caught on in fiction television. The whole cast is perfect - which is not always the case, even on the better shows - and the writing skates the depths of dark, twisted black comedy, playing at the ledge without quite jumping off. Sure it's risque and somewhat offensive, but it's never really vulgar. This kind of writing can be the most topical - as is so here - and the most brilliant - again, working here, as well. That's Ron Howard narrating, who also wears the hat of one executive producer (likely the one thing he's been involved in, besides &#34;The Andy Griffith Show&#34;, that I really liked him and the program/film). A friend of mine said the same thing I did, that it reminds him of the 70s sitcom &#34;Soap&#34;. However, this one's a little more cutting edge (then again, so was its predecessor, somewhat, back in the day). Makes my list of not only the top 5 of last decade, but one of the best shows ever - and I don't say that lightly, with other favorites including &#34;All in the Family&#34;, &#34;The Honeymooners&#34;, &#34;Star Trek&#34;, and &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34;.	4.0	"The Modern ""Soap"" is Much Smarter"	2013-02-02	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2R1HAXRNU0QX7	RMurray847	ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the great shows on TV right now.  It truly isn't like anything else you might see.  It has a jumpy, spontaneous, handheld look like many dramas you see these days, but it is far from serious.  This is a show that has characters that are very funny on their face, and when you dig deeper into their foibles, they become even funnier.  The characters are then thrown into outlandish situations at an unbelievable rate.  So much happens in one episode, it's almost dizzying.This dizzying pace is kept understandable by the dry, impeccably timed narration of Ron Howard.  Because he helped create the show, he has understood from day one the importance of this narration.  To quickly fill in plot holes and most hilariously, to introduce things like flashbacks, flashforwards, archived photos, etc. etc.  His tone NEVER attempts to be funny.  He's not telling a joke, but he is certainly setting up one joke after another.  Normally, narration is a painful, lazy device that grates.  But this show handles it so deftly that it is integral to its success.  If the show were to eliminate the narration, it would absolutely NOT be the same show.And cudos to all the great cast members:  Jason Bateman (in the performance of his career), playing straight-man Michael, is forced to run the company started by his father and run into the ground by his father in some Enron-like scandals.  They are home developers, and one scandal involves building homes in Iraq for Saddam.  All the other family members mostly want to mooch off the company and basically do everything they can to make Michael's life difficult.  And they also have their own ridiculous dreams and aspirations.  Michael has a twin sister who simply wants to be glamorous and lazy and shop all day...a dream held by her mother (Jessica Walters), except that the mother always snipes at her daughter about her weight...the daughter is played by the skeletally thin Portia delRossi.  Portia is married to Tobias, a former psychiatrist trying to be an actor.  Played by David Cross, he is my favorite character on the show.  Deluded, possibly gay but denying it, and best of all...a truly horrific actor!!!  Will Arnett plays older brother Gob (pronounced like Job, the biblical figure) a magician, with a huge chip on his shoulder.  There's younger brother Buster, who can't get out from under his mother's domineering shadow, and is the biggest mass of neurosis you'll ever see.  Michael's son, George Michael, is a likable but goofy teenager, embarrassingly attracted to his trouble-maker cousin Maebe.Sounds confusing...and if you're new to the show, it probably all would be confusing for awhile.  This is that rare sitcom that needs you to watch week after week.  But thank God for the DVD release of the first season.  You can catch up with all the shenanigans and then start watching season 2.  Trust me, you'll laugh almost until it hurts with nearly every episode.  You've never seen a sitcom like it, because there isn't one quite like it.  The humor is bone, bone dry, with sprinklings of slapstick or the just plain absurd.  Full of marvelous guest roles for the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfuss, an amazingly game and funny Liza Minelli and Henry Winkler.  Even Blue Man Group (season 2, now that I think of it).  What's great about season 1 is that all the performers seem to have instinctively grasped the right tone for the show right off the bat.  With many great sitcoms, when you see their first few episodes, you see how they were still struggling to find their voice (MASH, SIMPSONS, SEINFELD).  The AD folks were off and running from the first moment, again aided by Howard's narration.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!Word of warning for parents:  The DVD set contains a longer version of the pilot episode.  It's great fun to see that action-packed first show fleshed out...but apparently it must have been planned for HBO or something, because it has some pretty serious swearing in it.  In later episodes, some tirades of swearing are bleeped out to absolutely hilarious effect.  But keep your little ones away from the unexpurgated pilot.	5.0	FUNNIEST SHOW ON TV...BY FAR!!!!	2005-01-19	4	4	0

Once again, broadcast television shows itself to be the haven of inventive, clever writing.  In Arrested Development superior writing is matched with excellent acting.  The result is a show that is consistently witty, employing an inspired blend of witty dialogue, awful puns, and slapstick commedy.  Enjoy the ride as the hapless Bluths stagger from one comedy of error to another, blissfully ignorant that their actions have consequences along the way.Jason Bateman delivers a well-tuned performance as the arguably sane, responsible member of this outrageous extended family, delivering some of the best dead-pan lines I have ever heard.Jeffrey Tambor, already well known for bringing quirky odballs to life on the screen (remember Judge Wachtell from 'Hill Street Blues?), excells as George Bluth, erstwhile, felonious father of the fractious family.  Jessica Walter is fully believable as the manipulative matriarch who is more concerned with family warfare than family welfare.  Her machinations as she pits one of her offspring against another are worthy of Elanor of Aquitaine.Each member of the cast performs to perfection making the outrageous, improbably zany situations in which they find themselves seem as quotidian as our own lives.I encourage anyone who has grown up in a family to get to know the Bluths - your own family can only benefit by comparison with this crazy clan of engaging narcissists.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2NOZB6VZCTOI4	Robert I. Hedges	"""Arrested Development"" Season One is a perfect comedy. Combining elements of comedy, parody, and satire better than any show in memory, and adding sly plot twists in every episode makes for intelligent humor that is far more sophisticated than other network television fare.The performances and characters are extremely well-developed, yet subtly nuanced. It's impossible to single out a cast member for excellence, as everyone plays their part so beautifully. Jason Bateman as Michael is most central to the plot, and couldn't be more perfect: whatever he does in the future will be unable to live up to this effort. Likewise, Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful as the imprisoned Bluth family patriarch. The show makes excellent satirical points about the irresponsibility of celebrity wealth, and can be viewed on many levels, although I prefer it as straightforward comedy.The DVD set contains numerous bonuses including the extended pilot, commentaries (which are almost as funny as the show), a couple of behind the scenes documentaries, and the original music used in the show. Some viewers may find the show to be a bit racy, though normally in an intelligent, innuendo-laden way.This series is a gem: this season is probably the best of the three, and was more than deserving of its Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series."	5.0	For Once, A Winner That Actually Deserved An Emmy	2009-04-22	0	0	0

In fact, I'm probably responsible for turning on just about everyone I know to the show's peerless brand of cerebral, timeless hilarity.  For this feat, I am quite proud!Everyone knows, of course, that the essential ingredients for successful TV sitcoms are in the writing, the cast, and the timing of the show's release.  Arrested Development no doubt met both the former criteria; the writing is so clever, so offbeat, and so layered with wonderfully bizarre motifs (chicken dance, Tobias' ambiguous sexuality, George Michael and Maeby's on-again-off-again flirtation) that it begs repeated viewings.  And the cast is absolutely stellar.  Each individual performer is spectacular, but it's the way they riff off of one another that truly creates the show's magic.  The only problem with the show, I suppose, was in its timing.  It was cancelled after only three seasons, which signifies that its handlers didn't know how to market it, or perhaps that most viewers are not interested in TV that requires steadfast attention.So we are left with 50 or so episodes that are, more or less, representing some of the funniest and best TV moments in the last twenty or thirty years.All three seasons STRONGLY recommended!	5.0	Watch over and over and over...	2012-04-14	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A16QODENBJVUI1	Robert Moore	"By an standard ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT has to go down as one of the finest comedy series in American television history.  Probably no other comedy series has had such a superb large ensemble cast with every member performing to absolute perfection.  Despite the large cast, there isn't a weak or nonessential link in the group.  The writing simply is about as good as writing can get and the visual brilliance generated by the editors and writers has no parallel in American comedy.  And it is funny!  Intensely funny!  Furthermore, the show has garnered a shelf full of Emmys and probably would have won its second straight Emmy for Best Comedy if viewers hadn't felt nostalgic for the rather bland EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND's final season.So why isn't this one of the biggest hits on TV?  Why hasn't it been celebrated for the masterpiece it is?  And why has FOX ordered only a tiny handful of episodes for its third season, almost certainly indicating its cancellation after this season?  Certainly FOX's failure to support it fully is partly to blame.  FOX is easily the network I hate and detest the most.  I have so much ill will towards the network right now that I don't know if I will ever think of it without rancor.  It is one of the best if not the best network at developing interesting and innovative and original shows of the highest quality.  Yet is frequently fails to support its shows.  DARK ANGEL, FIREFLY, THE FAMILY GUY (though it was reprieved a couple of years after cancellation), and WONDERFALLS are merely four superb shows of the past five years that FOX showed only to cancel prematurely.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT now seems certain to be the next distinguished show to get axed.  How does it say about a network that would cancel a series that is not only its finest comedy but also quite probably the finest half hour comedy on TV?  Like I said, FOX is easily the network I hate the most and I rarely allow myself to watch series on the network now because I'm afraid that if I get involved FOX will pull the plug.But there is a second question:  Why aren't the ratings any better for the show?  There is widespread speculation that the show might be too intelligent for casual, less involved viewers.  Over the past thirty-five years the public has embraced a few very intelligent comedies, including ALL IN THE FAMILY, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, CHEERS, and SEINFELD.  But it has also failed to embrace some marvelous comedies like this one and ANDY RICHTER CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE, while at the same time going wild over more or less bland shows like FRIENDS and EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.  I have no firm opinion here, but I do worry that we might be a nation that refuses to embrace the truly smart shows.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, probably the finest hour long show of the past decade, at its peak pulled in only a very small audience.  Maybe Americans as a whole do not like very smart shows.  On the other hand, LOST, a very smart show indeed, has a massive audience.  Perhaps the answer is a combination of factors.  The one thing that is certain is that if ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is indeed allowed to die, as seems likely, it will be a massive lost.  As the nation as a whole gradually discovers the show through the wonderful DVD sets, more and more people will perhaps ask, ""How was such an incredible show allowed to die?""A few years ago NBC coined the expression ""Must See TV,"" a phrase that became a bit of a joke as many wags said that most of the shows it refered to was ""Must Flee TV.""  But if there is a Must See comedy on TV today, this is it.  By any standard this is marvelous television.  A growing number of individuals have come to believe that TV has finally begun to exploit its innate potential and begun in a great number of instances to surpass movies as the great medium for visual narrative.  Certainly ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the shows that bolsters the case for anyone so arguing."	5.0	An extraordinary comedy series whose lack of viewership is beyond baffling	2005-12-14	11	9	2

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1VRZQZBK4YVH9	"Running Deer ""Here.  Now."""	I just started re-watching this series via streaming, and I'm amazed at the brilliance of the show. It's very rare that writers put their fingers so accurately on anything such as dysfunction and actually make it work, but they do so here to an amazing triumph. Each of the characters is well-drawn, well-scripted, and well-acted, and the genius is in the way that they're able to semi-function as a family even though each character is completely focused on self (with the possible exceptions of George Michael and George). The strength of this show to me is in the way that each actor nails his or her part, maintaining a semblance of family unity while staying focused on self-fulfillment--they basically use each other to try to meet their own needs. I've read some of the one-star reviews, and I get the feeling that the main problem for the reviewers was not being able to get past the complete selfishness of the characters in order to see the satire that the show is giving us. . . it's a shame that satire is such a lost art in the states these days.All in all, this show does take a significant suspension of disbelief (who wants to believe that these people can be so incredibly selfish?) and a willingness to get to know characters who aren't all that likeable, but the result most definitely is worth it--some of the funniest lines I've ever heard have come in this show. It also takes paying close attention for the subtle expressions and often delayed reactions that come in response to something that happened several seconds--or even minutes--earlier. Many of the jokes will fall flat if you didn't catch a previous joke, and this is one of the few shows in which they have the guts to try for laughs through silence--and they succeed much more often than not. If I were a drama teacher, this would be a brilliant tool for teaching young actors and actresses the power of the subtle change in expression that the actors use so well. And did I mention that the scripts are pretty much brilliant?	5.0	Wonderfully dysfunctional	2006-06-26	0	0	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A9II8529Y9NSZ	rustlessrocker	I have to admit, I am late jumping on the bandwagon. I have just finished Season 1 and I had never watched the show before. I decided to watch based on recommendations from friends. I am glad I listened. It started out a little slow through four or five episodes, but after that it picked up. The show is funny due to the situations and surreal conversations that sometimes take place. It's a witty show that you have to watch closely to pick up a lot of the humor. I also think I missed a lot of the jokes, but I will go back and watch sometime. For now, it's time for Season 2.	4.0	Witty Show	2013-07-22	0	0	0

After all the books, CDs, DVDs, and other products I've bought from Amazon over the years, this is the ONLY thing I've reviewed, to my recollection; that's how strongly I feel about it.  Despite the 300+ reviews before me, the majority of them 5 stars, I still feel the need to put another five-star review out there.  This show is smart, clever, witty, and downright HILARIOUS.  It has replaced Seinfeld as my favorite show (something I didn't think was possible).I understand that, as it is now, the show stands to be cancelled after the third season.  Here is a petition to sign to help stop that from happening:  [...]And, as others have posted, what has saved shows in the past, SUCH AS FAMILY GUY, from extinction was ::: DVD SALES :::  So help save it by buying these DVD sets.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1L96VDO2YCC4Z	Ryan Skorich	This has got to be the smartest, most genius comedy since Seinfeld. Sure the ratings were never very spectacular, but those Nielsen statistics aren't always as accurate as they seem, plus the show was thrown all over the schedule. The DVD sales have always been impressive, but not enough to bring it back. At least there is one group of people watching this show, critics. This show has been critically acclaimed too much to take account for. Not to mention the 5 Emmys it's won. I was heartbroken when this show was taken off the air. It's one of the biggest mistakes in the FOX network's history. The show just needed time, look at Seinfeld, it never broke the top 20 ratings until season five! But at least there are still 53 episodes and 3 seasons to remember it by.The first season has the most impressive extras. The high amount of deleted scenes are well worth watching, and the documentaries and interviews are good too. If you like shows like Scrubs, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, or The Office, you'll probably love Arrested Development.	5.0	The greatest sitcom of all time!	2007-05-23	2	2	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1PAP1J6STMKZL	Sair K	I have been an avid fan of Arrested Development since the start, and got this DVD this winter after already being immersed in Season 2. I was able to catch a number of episodes that I had originally missed, which allowed me to catch some earlier references to some Season 2 running themes like Steve Holt! and the Corn Baller. Every time I re-watch an episode I catch a joke or gag that I had missed before, or a reference to something from an earlier or later episode. This show is by far the best comedy on TV (cable or network), and probably one of the best comedies of all time. My recommendation: 1. Buy this DVD and watch every single episode. 2. If you haven't been already watch the show on Fox. 3. Buy Season 2 when it comes out.Although the ratings of the show are low, its sustainability may depend on its DVD sales. I honestly think more people are watching the show than the ratings suggest, and hopefully this can be shown through awesome DVD sales. (It worked for Family Guy). So, if you are currently a fan of this show, or you just want something really super incredibly funny - then seriously buy these DVDs.	5.0	Get Arrested!	2005-04-28	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2GH3RU1VRQ2NW	"Sam  B ""Sam B"""	I am a huge TV fan in general.  My favorite show of all time (before last season) was The Simpsons.  I thought that I would never see a show that works on as many levels as The Simpsons did.  I admire how the show could have such broad comedy and such nuances, often in the same joke.  However, as wonderful as The Simpsons was, Arrested Development has eclipsed my wildest imagination of what a comedy could be.  I have never seen a TV show be so consistently funny.  If one were to compile a list of the 22 greatest episodes of TV ever, I would happily compare them to the 22 episodes of Arrested Development Season One and I would contend that the latter group is better.  Furthermore, never has such an amazing group of actors been assembled on one program.  Each actor is perfect in his or her role.  I was watching a program over the weekend counting down the 100 best TV show characters of all time.  If Arrested Development remains on the air for a few more seasons, I predict that the entire Bluth clan will wind up in the top ten.  The wonderful performances (including, by the way, narrator Ron Howard) and the incomparable writing have elevated this program to my favorite ever.	5.0	Best Show Ever	2005-04-08	4	4	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A25YY4MFW1440P	"SandraB ""Sandra B"""	Ever wonder what it is like to fill completely satisfied by a television show? In my opinion, TV has sucked since Seinfeld left the air, with exception of HBO (which is not TV anyway as they so readily remind us with their commercials). I try my very best not to watch any of the crap NBC, CBS ABC and Fox tries to ram down my throat, but I will find myself getting pulled into some mindless dribble because my roommates are TV junkies. After a long day at the office, the last thing I want to do is wasted my time on a new high concept comedy staring Freddie Prince Jr. or a show dedicated to the recently glamorous world of forensic science. With all my angst aside, there are three network shows worthy of my valuable post-work time, Lost, Family Guy and Arrested Development.Arrested Development was recommended to me by a co-worker when the first season became available on DVD. I read a lot of good things about the show and the Emmy and Golden Globe wins were impressive. However, being on FOX made me skeptical because they cannot do anything right except for animation, and the commercial spots were not funny. He persisted and was able to persuaded me to watch the first six episodes, which was roughly 2 hours of my time (yea I am big stickler about my free time), to see what I thought. I am so glad that I did. I have never laughed at show so hard nor thoroughly enjoyed one as much as I did Arrested Development. I quickly devoured the other two discs in the season, 24 episodes total, and began watching the second season which had just begun to air on TV.I will not bore you with a synopsis, because you can get that anywhere, but I will say that if you want a show that is way above average and can appeal to your both your intellect and your humorous side, then this is the show for you. Also, if you have an insane family like I do, then it will be double the laughs. I now own both seasons on DVD and have most of season three on my recorded on my Tivo. All my siblings, roommates, and friends love the show thanks to me.Unfortunately for all of us, FOX has decided to cancel the show, but I am keeping my finger and toes crossed that Showtime or HBO will pick it up. Do yourself a favor and get borrow or rent the DVDs. I know you do not know me, but trust me you should watch this show.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3DPMXYQMQO73D	"Sarah in MN ""Sarah"""	Don't let it happen!I've been a diehard Simpsons fan for 15 years, but a funny thing happened to me this year...I realized that the show I most looked forward to on Sunday nights wasn't the Simpsons (which, I admit, isn't as good as it once was), but rather the show immediately following it on Fox, Arrested Development.  The more I watch this show, the more I realize how brilliant and groundbreaking it is--I will even go out on a limb and say it's better than Seinfeld.If I had to compare Arrested Development to another show, I would say it's the Simpsons in its heyday shot in the style of a Christopher Guest mockumentary.  Like the Simpsons, it features a family that is completely dysfunctional yet surprisingly full of heart, and every episode is crammed with freeze-frame fun and hilarious pop culture references; like a Christopher Guest movie, the cast is fiercely committed to their characters and plays the wacky humor in a completely straight-faced manner.  Everyone on the show is fantastic, but I have to give special credit to Jason Bateman, who redefines the role of the comedy straight man, Jessica Walter, who is uncompromisingly bitchy as the family matriarch, and Michael Cera, who plays the bewildered teenage George Michael and who at the age of 16 may be the best comedic actor on television today.  And I don't even know what to say about Will Arnett as GOB.  You'll just have to watch.Much like last spring, the show is teetering on the brink of cancellation because of low ratings, and the fans are mystified by the inability of this brilliantly funny show to find an audience.  Granted, AD can be a hard show to get into--it's fast paced, the plots are complex, and there's a lot of self-referential humor--but buying the DVDs is a great way to get into it.*  Fans agree...give it three episodes and we guarantee you will be hooked for life.  Buying the DVDs also gives you the added bonus of being able to catch the sight gags and one-liners you missed the first time you watched because you were laughing so hard.  Finally, the better the DVD sales, the better the chances that this incredible show will be back for a third season, and the more gratitude you will receive from all of us devoted fans.*Fox is also rerunning episodes this summer...now is your chance to get caught up on season two!	5.0	The funniest show on TV might be cancelled?!?!?!	2005-04-23	7	6	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A26TWY9AD935HC	S. Finefrock	Simply put, ARRESTED DELELOPMENT has to be one of the best comedy shows ever to air on TV.  Here is your chance to either relive it's greatness, or to discover a true gem.  I usually would not buy, or recommend buying DVD's of a TV series.  With most series, you would watch it once, or twice and then it would collect dust until you either gave it away or sold it.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is the sort of series that can hold up to repeated viewings and actually improve with each new visit.  There are so many inside references to pick up that one usually misses them while laughing uncontrollably the first time around.This is the rare series with an excellent cast and writers that are on top of their game.  Despite their shortcomings you learn to love the characters for all their idiosyncrasies and questionable behavior.  The storylines are filled with delicious satire and irony, which only reach full appreciation when viewing the series as a whole.  By all means get seasons, one two and three and enjoy the best that television has to offer.	5.0	Don't Make a Huge Mistake, Get This at Once!	2006-09-05	3	3	0

Arrested Development's jokes build upon each other, use word play, utilize a bit of political satire, and make a grateful audience double over with laughter.  It may seem pathetic, but I am reminded of characters or scenes from AD every once in a while as I go about life and laugh out loud.  Start at Season 1, watch until the finale, and weep with uncomfortable loss with the rest of us.  I shall forever curse FOX.	5.0	17 stars!	2006-08-27	6	5	1
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A5WYNVGEOGV4T	SirTheory	"Thanks to Arrested Development we all know what ""Never Nude"" is... And the world is a better place. Even forgetting never nude, the entire show is fan-dee-double-tastic.The reason the show succeeds is because not only is it funny, but it's characters all connect with the viewer on some level. Maybe Gob is your best fried... maybe you've had illicit crushes like George Michael... perhaps your mother tried to keep everything under her greedy thumb. Whatever it is, we all know someone like everyone on the show. The cute-but-troublesome Maybe, the sensible and harrassed Michael... it goes on and on.You can't really imagine anyone else playing the parts in the show, which is a great compliment. Trying to think of anyone else to play George Michael just seems wrong. Who else but David Cross could do Tobias? No one. It's just one of those rare times where it seems like the cast was perfect.I love the way the the show is filmed. It feels kind of like a documentary without being overbaringly so. The cameras feel human, like you are actually in the room with them. They follow the action instead of predicting it.After watching the DVDs I wish my schedule was such that I could be watching the new episodes on TV.

The main reason it was picked up for a second season was because of all the awards and critical accolades it received.Family Guy was cancelled because of poor ratings, but now is being revived due to its stellar DVD sales.  Let's do the same for Arrested Development!!  Buy it, not only for yourself, but for your friends and co-workers who may never even have seen it!  If they have any sense of humor at all, they will thank you...AND, they'll start watching the show (boosting the ratings).I know it sounds like I work for the studio, but I don't.

What is great about this show (and the DVD set) is that it lends itself to repeat viewings; I've found things in episodes that I missed the first time I saw them on TV.  I wish that there were more extras on the DVDs, but it is a small complaint.  The cast commentaries for a few of the eps were funny, and the deleted scenes were also good.  Excellent acting, top-notch writing, great directing- Arrested Development has it all.  Too bad we won't be seeing more new episodes- I'll save that rant for another forum.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1WHAJUBDQFM3Y	Skippy McGee	This is the sort of humor that I thought was dying from the TV scene until America's version of The Office picked up the slack.  Here you have a pack of some of the world's most ludicrous characters all in one place.  The premise being that Michael, the eye in the hurricane that is his family, must take over the housing development company after his father is arrested for taking advantage of investors is fairly well known.  This show is really a character driven show, G.O.B. and Tobias being the most ridiculous of the batch.  You feel for Michael as he tries to deal with the insanity of everything, though he certainly is not free of his own awkwardness and selfishness.  This is a must see comedy that will have you cracking up over and over.	5.0	I just blue myself over how funny this is	2006-06-11	1	1	0

Just about anyone will recognize at least one of their own relatives amid this over-the-top crazy group. The beauty of the thing is that in the midst of some truly pathological behavior, there is love and tenderness. I watched this show devotedly when it first aired on TV, and it's fun now to be able to revisit it.	4.0	DysFUNction	2014-04-10	1	1	0
B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1B4PWJ90ENYM1	Sonnet29	"Who could have foreseen that, even in the 21st Century, a sitcom would seem edgy and radical if it dares to go on the air without a laugh track?  Into this land of the formulaic comes a show which not only spurns the laugh track convention, but opens up the form to new narrative possibilities, weaves complex layers of satirical meaning, creates a whole stable of unforgettable characters... in short, reinvents a form that has been in desperate need of reinventing.Arrested Development is even better on DVD; the interviews and extended pilot give a greater insight into the show's ambitious intent, it stands up wonderfully to repeated viewings-- plus-- who knew?  Turns out a great TV show is even better without the commercials!At this point I have seen every episode on these DVDs at least once and perhaps six or seven times, and I could go into great detail about why I believe this is the most inventive and important sitcom since ""All In The Family"".  I will say this: with repeated showings, the Bluthe family becomes increasingly complex and sympathetic. Character and pathos provide the viewer with fresh insights and surprises, long after you already know all the jokes. Every Bluthe, however vain, self-absorbed or deluded, is allowed to a moment of thoughtfulness and nobility without violating the intergrity of the character.  And damn it, this is certainly a disfunctional family, but it is a family-- and you really start to get a feel for the ties that bind them.  Sometimes, the Bluths are unkind with each other, but they forgive each other-- and I think that forgiveness is as important to being in a family as all the togetherness you see in the Mormons public service ads."	5.0	More than just the funniest show on TV!	2004-12-27	3	3	0

If you're a fan of smart comedy, sight gags, clever writing, great delivery, and unforgettably hysterical characters, then you will not be disappointed with this DVD. Here's the thing: if you borrow this DVD from someone else, you'll want to own your own copy after you view it, because you can watch these episodes over and over and still discover funny bits you missed before.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A8BXZ41NMDLFL	S. Rapp	I generally like smart comedy, black comedy, etc., and came to Arrested Development expecting to love it. It is something of a poor man's Royal Tannenbaums (which I loved), but it is NOT the Royal Tannenbaums. It offered a fair number of clever bits and characterizations. However, I could never fully enjoy the show for two reasons:  1) Ron Howard was the wrong choice for narrator. When the narrator is just right, you know it immediately (quite literally, after the narrtor spoke her first ten words on the opening episode of Desparate Housewives, it seemed THE perfect voice and that the show could not prosper or even exist without exactly THAT voice as narrator); and 2) Jeffery Tambor is greatly overrated (his comic style is that worn out, 1950's shtick). He is also, somehow, an extremely unlikeable actor. I can't put my finger on why that is so, but others who thought they would like the show and didn't often mentioned this to me BEFORE I brought it up. I watched one episode of his recent flop with John Lithgow. Admittedly the premise was weak and the writing predictable. Still, Lithgow was decent in his over-the-top (acting!) way but Tamboor was terrible--he dragged down every scene.	3.0	Tamboor, Howard mis-cast but  some love it	2007-01-08	21	3	18

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1RIF1ZKGS3P7R	"STFmaryville ""Needs More Money"""	Fox got it right again and has renewed the one show that deserves all the support it can get. Arrested Development can be considered an acquired taste initially, but one could say the same for other classic shows such as Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The pacing and narrative are different from what is typically served up on TV, so it may take some time to adjust to the quirkiness of the show ... let it sneak up on you as the episodes progress, and you will be genuinely surprised at how clever and laugh-out-loud funny this show truly is. Jason Bateman's work is surprisingly excellent and crucial towards grounding the rest of the loopy family members (all of them great as well) in something resembling reality, unlike much of the slapstick nonsense in other sitcoms today. Arrested Development is great stuff! Take a cue from Fox and give it a chance today!

Arrested Development is consistently funnier and more innovative than any show I can remember--including Seinfeld, Friends, Frasier, Soap, and MASH. Even shows like Seinfeld, which was darn funny, would veer into ""stupid"" territory--the old situation comedy dilemma of ""here's our horrible situation, let's see what funny way the characters can get out of it."" It becomes painful to watch because the behavior of the characters turns into stupidity. By some miracle of God (or Ron Howard and Mitchell Hurwitz), AD transcends that stupidity and goes for silly absurdity. I realize this sounds like the same thing, but it's not. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the show isn't done before a live audience and is frequently played straight that makes the the comedy work so well.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3HBS622QD27CV	"T.A. ""washingmachinemouth"""	"NUMBER 1:  There are currently 270 reviews on Amazon concerning this show/DVD collection.  Only 5 of them gave it less than 4 stars...5!!!!!  That's it!  The other 265 gave it 4 or 5 stars.  So let me tell you what I think.This family is completely screwed up.  One of the funniest thing about the show is it's daytime ""Soap Opera"" format:  it quickly switches situational scenes almost violently between way too many characters, but their stories all seemingly fit together in a most unusual, coincidental way.  It satirizes the whole daytime drama genre.  The addition of the flashback scenes breaks up the monotonous, linear order of events, though, that tend to put most accidental daytime soap viewers to sleep, or vomit.  If you live in a big city, especially NY, Miami or LA, you've met, know, or are related to people like this....just not all of them at once!  The characters are very believeable, which only adds to the comedy, in a similar way the Seinfeld characters grew on us.  Coniving, selfish, lazy people--normally you'd hate at first meet--but for some reason, you can't get enough, watching them get themselves in to rediculous situations...usually because of their coniving, selfish, lazy ways!I love night time sitcoms.  This is my favorite of all time.  It's better than Seinfeld, better than Family Guy, and if it stays on the air as long, it'll be better than the Simpsons as well.  I am so ticked off at the few negative reviews I read here on Amazon.  The 5 out of 270 that don't like the show say it's horrible.  It has no ""rewatchability"" as one reviewer put it.  ""Who are these people?"" writes another.  ""They are shallow and one-dimensional,"" insists another.  ""The plot line goes nowhere, and the characters are losers, played by washed-up actors, or actors no one has heard of.""  All of these quotes are made by ignorant idiots.  I don't know if it's even a word, but the show does have ""rewatchability.""  In fact, the plot line moves so fast sometimes (the ONLY thing I can imagine would bother someone...someone who is trying to talk on the phone, or cook dinner while they are watching) that second and third viewings reveal other, funnier situations and one-liners.  And actors?  Just look at the cast--they are all well known actors that we've all seen before, except for George-Micheal and Mae's characters, and hey--they're kids.  Another quote: ""if the father ever gets out of jail, the show is over.""  Guess what--he doesn't spend the second season in jail, and the second season is even better than the first!I can only tell you this:  each character is well crafted, the plot is thicker and juicier than a NY Strip, and each is funnier than hell.  Almost like a David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino film, the story isn't chronological...THIS IS THE REASON I THINK THAT STUPID PEOPLE CAN'T ENJOY IT.  There are constant flashbacks and cut scenes where the narrator explains the background behind a story, situation or one-liner that just took place...like when we are told the whole story behind how Buster lost his hand.  We don't learn this until we see Buster strolling around the house breaking things with his ""hook.""  Another funny sub plot:  what each family member uses Buster's fake hand for (usually when Buster is sleeping)--the uncle uses it as a roach clip, and the mother and father use it in the sack...completely crazy!  It's so funny...laughing at a spoiled, rich, dysfunctional family!Having the DVD is the best way to view...when you miss something funny (which does happen...you'll be laughing so hard, you'll miss entire scenes), you can pause and rewind...it's the best way to do it.  get these DVD's...this show won't be on forever.Don't even look at the price...just buy it.  Buy all their seasons.  #2 just came out, and it's better than 1!!!"	5.0	Nevermind the nay-sayers...	2005-11-09	5	5	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2NO38XVH3CYQK	T. Bock	"A.D. is absolutely the most hilarious show my wife and I have seen since as far back as I can remember.  Honestly, I can't think of a single TV show that had me laughing hysterically for a full 22 minutes (not counting commercials) in my entire life.Owning the DVDs has been a blessing because we easily missed 3-5 minutes worth of each episode when it aired because we were simply laughing too hard.  Now that we have Tivo, that doesn't happen any more, but the show takes longer to watch because we keep rewinding every few minutes to laugh again. :)When A.D. first aired, it took a few episodes for us to really get into it because it's absolutely unlike any other comedy show I can think of.  This is perhaps why it's ratings aren't very good and why Fox has decided to cancel the show.  Instead of the standard ""set up the joke, deliver punchline"" template that most comedies follow, A.D.'s humour is almost entirely character-based.  While there are tons of hilarious visual jokes, the dialogue is delivered completely dead-pan as if it's really just something one would say to their brother/mother/father/girlfriend if their family was as messed up as the Bluths'.  As a result, it's not always what the person is saying that's funny, but the context in which they're saying it.  My guess is that a lot of this intelligent humour sails over most people's heads and they turn to ""Stacked"" to get more obvious (read: boring) jokes.  Quite often, some of the funniest lines come from the narrator (Ron Howard) who gets to reveal what's really going on in a character's head or recount a memory from the character's past.Characters include Michael (the lead played by Jason Bateman who is the only one with a (mostly) clear head on his shoulders), his father (who's in prison for treason), his alcoholic and overbearing mother, his older narcissitic magician brother, his younger ""momma's boy"" brother, his perfectionist son, his spoiled twin sister and her family (a husband who doesn't know he's gay and their rebellious daughter), a LOUSY family lawyer (played fantastically by Henry Winkler) and a cast of cameos too long to list.The commentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes on the DVDs are excellent.

""Dead""I skimmed through 60 of the 117 reviews at the time of this writing, including someone that rated 1 star because they received the musical group Arrested Development when they wanted this fox show.And I'm really at a loss... how can 116 people be so wrong about a television show?  It becomes obvious to me that mass hysteria has an equally disturbing and opposite force, namely amassed brain dead zombies that have this love of dead - deadpan.I've forced myself through the first four shows, I never laughed, found the entire 3rd person narration to get on my nerves worse than the feelings of wasted time, I see the ""highlight"" clips that are supposed to entice people to watch the show and even still find myself angered that ANYONE could honestly say they find the show funny.You want something funny.. go for Brain Donors, or Family Guy, or even the practicality of the funny shows like, The Simpsons, Malcolm in the Middle, or the outrageousness of Soap, anything but this show... I mean even the Brady Bunch had more punch line than arrested development.But obviously, 116 of you would sell your soul for this type of program so have at it.  Just stop wasting space on the Amazon servers for your constant dirge of love for the show.. please.. and go write for something better on DVD.. you've got skills.. use them for the greater good.. and that's not Arrested Development!If there were a zero star rating Arrested Development should find itself in the slammer with it."	1.0	"the phrase ""Dead pan comedy"" has only 1 truthful word in it"	2005-01-26	376	23	353

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2PKDUGZN55OEM	"""theoriginalvitaminj"""	I don't really watch TV anymore. Between American Idol, reality shows, and bland, new, unoriginal sitcoms, television just doesn't have much to offer anymore. The Simpsons was really what used to hold it together, and now that the writers have completely given up on the show, so have I. Seinfeld reruns are nice, but something new was needed to revive this glowing box that once dominated my childhood.Arrested Development is exactly the boost that television (and the genre of sitcoms in particular) needed. How good is it? Well, I've watched the entire season about 4 times over since I bought it 5 months ago. It's original, it's unpredictable, and best of all, it's funny!As opposed to most shows on TV, where you can start watching at any point and you probably haven't missed much, Arrested Development has a story that is constantly evolving. If you miss one episode, you could possibly be lost in the next one. Even minor events can have repercussions that last the length of the season.The characters are lovable and hilarious. Tobias and GOB are my favorite and everyone seems perfectly cast.Just like any show, it has the occasional episode that isn't quite as good as the others, but I can't hold that against it. It raises the bar on what television should be in so many ways, that a couple of dragging episodes that help further the story can't hold it back. The second season is released in October and I have no doubt that I will pick it up the moment I have the cash.Watch a couple episodes on TV, and although you may have no idea what's going on in the story, you should be able to get a general feel for if this is a show you want to get into. If you find yourself laughing, then pick up the first season and fill yourself in on what's going on. You shouldn't be disappointed.	5.0	Probably the best show to come out in years	2005-09-01	4	3	1

In fact, my friends and I usually gather at one's house to enjoy the delight of the show together. The plot is always a mystery, and hilarity always ensues. i adore this show and highly HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. the characters are flawless, and each has such a developed personality. ?Watch very closely for all the snide remarks the Bluth mother makes to her daughter Lindsay (they are here and there, but when caught, beautifully hilarious).The best episode is when there are flashbacks to theBluth children being taught a lesson by their father (Jeffery Tambor). Let's say this--someone loses an arm because one of the children forgot to leave a note about needing more milk. it is truly priceless laughter that is rarely obtained from shows in today's Friends/Sex in the City obsessed world.

It's edgy and bold and was the first show to use a &#34;home video&#34; style of recording...now everybody does it.  So many of the characters are show-stealers. I just introduced my boyfriend to it and he's hooked too. We watched the new 2013 documentary (video on demand) as an intro to how innovative and gutsy this show was and as an introduction to all the characters. Jason Bateman's character &#34;Michael&#34; and his son George-Michael are the only two sane ones in the large pool of weak integrity and strong dysfunction.	5.0	The Episodes are Addictive	2013-06-11	0	0	0

I haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the deleted scenes, which on so many DVDs are just a waste of space, are really hysterical here.  With the new season still a month away, it's great to get a little ""new"" AD to tide us over.  I also enjoyed the behind the scenes stuff and cast interviews.

In terms of comedy television, I think this show has a very real chance of being the next Seinfeld (if Fox sticks with it long enough). Seinfeld revolutionized the sitcom. Arrested Development is taking it even farther. How far, who knows? Truth is, the first year of Arrested Development is far better than the first year of Seinfeld. The only recent TV comedy that even comes close to Arrested Development is HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm. Both are sublime. You have to get this DVD.	5.0	Best show on TV. In years.	2004-10-10	6	6	0

Not only would I watch it religiously on Sunday nights but I would videotape it and re-watch the episodes on tape 3-4 times and it seemed like everytime I watched it again, I would catch onto something new that I didn't see before.Arrested Development is a well thought out comedy with many quirky characters, and plotlines. I can proudly say that this is my favourite show because I can watch every episode over and over again without getting tired of it. I've already pre-ordered my dvd set and I can't wait to get it.Just because some people don't get the humour, doesn't make it a bad show. It just shows their lack of attentiveness. This show does keep you on the edge of your seats and when you rewatch it, you'll notice things that you didn't catch before. Like in the episode where Michael said that the workers had to be watched because they're like sheep that needed to be herded. Then later on in the episode, you see the workers getting lost and they're being herded into the back of a truck by two dogs.

I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here, and I'm not trying to be a know-it-all, but I think people are so absorbed by shows with direct punchlines (Everybody Loves Raymond) that when a show like AD comes along, they are confused. They ask, where's the joke? Listen, the reason I love this show is the same reason Ilove family guy, because it's different from other shows, and it's completely crazy at times. Most people are more interested in American Idol and Survivor and Marmaduke, and they, like the majority of viewers, like shows with more traditional styles like somebody saying one thing and the cliche cool dude or old man giving the punchline. They just ""don't get it"" is what they often say. I am not trying to glorify this show into being another Seinfeld, but look what the guy from NBC first said to Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld when the show started out.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A4FNNZVYQUIAK	Tony	I was not a fan of Arrested Development when it first ran on TV.  The characters were a little too quirky and I didn't appreciate some of the humor.  But having watched episode after episode in &#34;binge mode&#34;, I now realize what a great show it is!  The humor is much more subtle than I ever suspected and Jason Bateman is the perfect foil for his crazy family members.  And he's not the dull straight-man I originally thought....his sarcastic lines are one of the best things about the show.

I have literally become evangelical about AD, attempting to convert the masses with my little DVD copy of the first season.My success rate is quite high too-people who just haven't gotten around to watching it are hooked by episode three of this set.The writing is insanely clever and the actors who inhabit the characters are like an ensemble cast made in heaven. Gob and Buster literally make me double over, Jason Bateman gives the best deadpan deliveries, Jeffrey TAmbor is a genius.....and the story lines! Just so fresh and crazy yet so meticulously framed so as to use a lot of call backs from previous episodes-the running gags are great, and yet they still work on their own if you haven't seen previous installments.I tend to not get that excited about TV shows in general cause I actually don't have shows that I watch habitually, but I promise you-this show is a keeper.

Every character is original and humourous, each establishing a unique identity and style. This show is capable of making you laugh out loud when you're home alone. The show is reminiscent of Seinfeld, with characters causing each other problems due to Seinfeld-ian misunderstandings. The show has a great heart, as family is a central theme, and source of comedy, of the series.This show has a firm commitment to consistency. The show presents subtle jokes that only a devoted viewer will comprehend.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A24YVJWNLBU314	Trevor Seigler	"Very rarely does a great TV show come along. I mean, sure, there's Hee-Haw, Matlock, and The Cosby Mysteries. But what idiot would say those are truly great?Anyway: This is the first season of what will hopefully be a ""Full House""-like phenomenon among the American viewing public. But they're too fickle to appreciate this brilliant work of modern art. There should be ten stars available, because this is a ten-star review show.You know the story: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the one sensible son from a family of lunatics and greedy Guses. This includes his father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), magician older brother Gob (Will ""Funniest Bastard Alive"" Arnett), his twin sis (Portia De Rossi), and his smothered younger brother Buster (Tony Hale). Throw into the mix his brother-in-law Tobias (the always excellent David Cross) and his son (Michael Cera) who has a crush on his own cousin Maeybe (Alia Shawkat), and you've got ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on speed.The first season captures George Senior's imprisonment on unclear charges (you have to watch the season to know...no peeking) and Michael's attempts to save the family business...mostly from his family. There's way too much going on in each episode to even attempt a summary here.The casting is stellar: Jason Bateman has risen from career death to emerge as a star again, while relative unknowns like Arnett and Hale will not be forgotten anytime soon. De Rossi and Cross are wonderfully off-kilter as the troubled couple, and the matriarch (whose name I forget right now) is brilliantly cold and yet concerned at the same time.If you love smart, innovative comedies that take risks, this is the show for you. I knew I was a fan when I first saw the episode in which Gob tries in vain to make a dramatic gesture of throwing a letter into the ocean. And I've enjoyed the ride since.A lot of critically acclaimed sitcoms are usually crap, but this is the exception. ""Arrested Development"" may just be the best sitcom of the last ten years, so this first season will be required viewing at any ""television-writing"" course of the future if there's any justice in this world. Trust me, no matter how messed-up your family is, the Bluths put the fun in dysfunctional..."	5.0	Utterly Fantastic Television Show	2005-01-01	3	2	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A96K1ZGW56S2I	"tvtv3 ""tvtv3"""	"I was introduced to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT through a good friend. From watching the first episode I was hooked.  Unfortunately, I was one of many people who didn't discover the show until after it had been canceled at Fox.  The show is filmed in veritae style (like a documentary) and though much of the acting seems to be improved, it is not.  The writing on the show is full of wit and humor and is funny on numerous different levels, not to mention that a small side joke might have significance a few episodes or even a season later.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is a character oriented show and every character has a very important role to play in the situations and development of the overarching storyline of the series.The show stars Jason Bateman as widower Michael Bluth, the only semi-normal and average person in one of the most dysfunctional families ever seen on television.  Bateman had some success as a kid and young adult in television (a reoccurring guest role on SILVER SPOONS and on VALERIE/HOGAN'S FAMILY), but the role of Michael Bluth was perfect for Bateman.  It gave him an opportunity to put into practice all of his talent and experience and actually carry a show of misfits as the straight man.  Though Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth is the person who keeps his family together, the rest of the cast offers superb performances too.  There's the lovely Porita de Rossi as Michael's twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke, Will Arnett Michael's older brother ""Gob"" who works as a magician, Michael Cera as Michael's son George-Michael Bluth, Alia Shawkat as Lindsay's daughter Maeby Funke whom George-Michael has a major crush on, Jeffery Tambor as the father of the Bluth clan who gets sent to prison in the first episode because of a major development deal that might have included minor treason, Jessica Walter as Lucille Bluth the mother of the Bluth children who, David Cross as Lindsay's husband Tobias Funke who is a never nude, Tony Hale as Michael's childlike younger brother Buster, and Ron Howard as the narrator of this ""story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.""  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT also boasted an impressive list of guest stars including Henry Winkler, Liza Minnelli, Ed Begley Jr, Charlize Theron, Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Scott Baio, Carl Weathers, Justine Bateman, Andy Richter, Zach Braff, and Jamie Kennedy.The general plot-line of Season One follows the Bluth family as George Bluth is arrested in the pilot episode at his retirement party aboard the company yacht because of some major bad land development deals (get it, arrested development).  His son Michael is prepared to leave with his own son George-Michael to Arizona after his mother Lucille is named President of the Bluth Company instead of himself.  However, for the love of his son and the neediness of his family, Michael stays behind and attempts to get the family business back on track while trying to get dear old dad out of jail.Some of my favorite episodes include:""The Extended Pilot""--flows better than the cut pilot that aired on television and includes several scenes that help extend the characterization.""Bringing Up Buster""--Buster is kicked out of Lucille's penthouse and moves into the model home.  Meanwhile George-Michael takes a role in the school play (being directed by his uncle Tobias) hoping that he will get to kiss Maebe, but after Maebe drops out, George-Michael is supposed to kiss the male lead.""My Mother, The Car""--Michael has partial amnesia after being involved in a car accident that Lucille was responsible for.""In God We Trust""--the family attorney announces that George Sr. can be released on $20,000 bail for the annual `Living Classics Pageant'.  This episode is hilarious, especially towards the end as George Sr. bolts down the street wearing a God costume.""Beef Consomme""--Michael, Gob, and Buster all fight over who gets to go out with Marta.  The fight between the brothers at the end of the episode is particularly funny.""Missing Kitty""--George Sr.'s former secretary goes missing after Gob performs a huge magic trick during a spring break stunt.""Whistler's Mother""--the reveal that George Sr. has a twin brother, Uncle Oscar.  Oscar tries to get some free cash from Michael by selling him a piece of land that is literally full of lemons.""Let Them Eat Cake""--the family learns that the reason George Sr. is in prison is because he was illegally building homes in the old Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Pay attention to the hilarious ""Big Bear"" speech that Gob delivers after believing his father has died in the hospital after a heart attack.Though it is true that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT doesn't appeal to a typical sitcom-sense-of-humor, the show is incredibly intelligent, witty, and funny.  It won't appeal to everyone, but many will at least find it intriguing, and some (like myself) will become fans.The DVD includes several extras including commentaries of the episodes ""Extended Pilot"", ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake""; deleted and extend scenes, original music and songs by David Schwartz composed for the show; three featurettes; a segment of the cast panel discussion at The Museum of Television & Radio; a promo; and an inside look at the series with Ron Howard."	5.0	I Wish I Would Have Discovered This Show Sooner.	2006-10-03	6	5	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2V15K9YDG3KMK	Usama Ahmad	"If you're not sure you wish to purchase this DVD then don't. BORROW the DVD from your local library or a friend or co-worker who is a fan. Give the show your undivided attention and I promise it will all be worth it. After going through the first two seasons (the only 2 seasons on DVD at the time this was written) you'll want to buy yourself a copy.I am a big fan of the show, and I believe it is on the same level if not better than Seinfeld. Most would argue this is an insult to Seinfeld, but I like to think that it's a comment on how great this show really is.Some have said that this show has ""zero re-watchability,"" but this is entirely inaccurate. I've gone through seasons 1 and 2, and some of season 3, and went back and started over and many who have done so will notice so many more jokes they may have missed before simply because this show is layered with jokes, some of which cannot be understood until you've seen more episodes. Perhaps some may feel this is where the show's weakpoint lies: instead of episodic one-time jokes the show sets up these long joke-arcs -- but if the audience is patient they'll be rewarded with a much bigger payoff (also this style is conducive to loyalty to the show, as you'd have to watch more episodes to understand it all).I find the show to be unbelievably funny, every minute something funny is going on. Sometimes I don't catch onto it but I usually watch the episodes two or three times, not because I want to but because I have to simply to catch things I missed.Some argue the cast is ""no-name"" and has no talent, and as a result the show is forced to bring on guest stars. Although most of the cast is new there are some regular cast members who are well known (Tambor, Cross, Rossi). The new actors are every bit as talented in their roles -- anyone who has seen the show must admit the young Michael Cera (playing George Michael) is a delight, his comic timing and acting are superb. My guess is the guest stars were brought on as tools to bring more viewers into the fold. Yet these guest stars each played a memorable role, not some 1-episode stint (except season 3's Andy Richter, well at least so far). Will Arnet's character, GOB, was briefly married and the woman was played by Will Arnet's real-life wife Amy Poehler. There are a couple of jokes which make reference to this and of course they're funny.There are many jokes on the show which may not seem obvious at first but with a little research you'll be surprised by how much you might've missed. (example: Tony Hale, as Buster, doing the 'Robot' in his car in season 3, which was a throwback to the actor's Mr. Roboto dance in the VW commercials).Please don't think this show is too much work, not worth the effort -- you WILL get the jokes, and you'll get them better if you re-watch the episodes.I'm sorry to hear the show's been cancelled but in my opinion this is one of the best comedy show's ever made. If any of the show's crew or staff read this, all your efforts were not in vain , you've made many laugh and fall in love with The Bluths."	5.0	it takes time	2006-01-09	7	6	1

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2UPG94JUAKC51	Vuzzbox	This show has not one, but *three* foolish and narcissistic fathers. Most of the best sitcoms have only one (Simpsons, All in the Family, Malcolm in the Middle, to name a few...)And, as on many great, long running sitcoms (Seinfeld, Gilligan's Island, the Honeymooners, for example) the entire cast of men, women and children are incapable of learning from their own mistakes, completely resistant to personal growth and trapped forever on their own desert islands of self-consumed childhood, their own one bedroom apartments of comic onanism.It's not the situations and limitless well of immaturity from which the characters spring eternal that make the show, of course; that's just the setup. It's the brilliant writing and clever manipulations of the plot and characters that make it.  The storylines, the introduction of new characters based (apparently) on chaos theory and the non sequiturs that drive the logic of the plot defy all expectations. There's something in the brains of these writers that causes synapses to fire and connections to be made that should otherwise remain disconnected. I suspect drug use. To good effect.I love it. But I hate that I love it because too often in the chaos, in the stupidity and dysfunction, in the narcissism and childishness I think I have spied my own worst moments.	5.0	I love it, but I hate that I love it.	2013-06-25	0	0	0

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A3N5XIM9R2OQH0	Wheelchair Assassin	"As reality TV continues rearing its ugly head on every major network, Arrested Development has arrived at just the right time for those of us itching for something intelligent to come over the airwaves.  With corporate malfeasance (rightly or wrongly) assuming so much of the public spotlight over the past several years, Arrested Development casts a light on the people behind such shady goings on, and in this case the picture is not pretty.  It's loosely classifiable as a sitcom, but Arrested Development is shot with more of a documentary/reality show style, giving it a distinctive look and feel that you just won't find in most of network TV's decidedly formulaic fare.  Not since The Simpsons was in its prime about a decade or so has a show so effortlessly balanced wit, randomness, and unapologetic vulgarity (as of this writing, rumors that The Simpsons is still on have yet to be substantiated).At the center of everything is Jason Bateman as genial widower Michael Bluth, the one sane member of a wealthy but deeply dysfunctional family, charged with holding it together after his corrupt father's incarceration.  It's not easy, as Michael is surrounded by a collection of screwballs the likes of which you can scarcely imagine.  Fortunately, the characters on Arrested Development are far more than just zany caricatures; they're all brilliantly drawn and distinctive, aided by some masterful performances from the show's cast.  Yes, they're all isolated from reality and toxically self-absorbed, but the Bluth family still manages to come across as sympathetic.  Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi, who rarely fails to make my eyeballs bulge) is a pretentious ""liberal activist"" whose advocacy of fashionable causes is in sharp contrast to her vanity and terrible parenting.  Her husband Tobias (David Cross, whose fake mustache is a hysterical running joke in itself) is an utterly oblivious husband and father who's just left his psychiatry practice to pursue his pipe dream of becoming an actor.  Michael's older brother George Oscar (Gob) Bluth II (Will Arnett) is a smarmy, womanizing magician who never fails to take advantage of Michael's decency.  The youngest brother, perpetual student Buster (Tony Hale), is prone to outlandish panic attacks and hasn't managed to separate himself from his mother quite yet.Speaking of the family matriarch, Jessica Walter turns in arguably the best performance of them all as Lucille Bluth, easily one of the most delightfully evil characters in TV history.  Domineering, manipulative, and occasionally downright cruel, Lucille is the most narcissistic member of a family full of narcissists.  She plays her children against each other, shows questionable loyalty to her husband, grubs money relentlessly, and constantly makes cutting remarks about Lindsay's weight in spite of her awe-inspiring gorgeousness. For his part, George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), in addition to his amoral business practices, isn't exactly the best father in the world.  In one especially hilarious series of flashbacks, we see his way of imparting everyday lessons to his children, which always involved some horrible simulated tragedy befalling a one-armed friend of his.  And while the relationship between Michael and his awkward son George-Michael does provide a bastion of tenderness amidst all the screwiness, it's also worth noting that George-Michael has a forbidden crush on his rebellious cousin Maeby.But wait, there's more!  We're also treated to some hilarious and out-of-left-field special guest appearances, including Henry Winkler as the family's incompetent attorney Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as the ""blind"" prosecutor on the Bluths' case; Liza Minelli as Lucille's vertigo-plagued best friend/social rival who briefly becomes Buster's girlfriend in one of TV's all-time great mismatches; and Carl Weathers as, well, Carl Weathers.  I feel I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention ""Annyong,"" Lucille's adopted Korean son who gets his name from the Korean word for ""hello,"" which happens to be all he says for his first five episodes or so.There isn't one episode on this season that's not up to par, not one.  All are brilliant in their own way, juggling plot strands in a Seinfeld-esque manner, but with non-linear plot structures more akin to the shamefully neglected classic Andy Richter Controls the Universe.  With numerous flashbacks and the deadpan narration of Ron Howard filling in any gaps, Arrested Development is able to truly go where network comedy has rarely gone before.  While many episodes do end with important life lessons, generally centering around the importance of family togetherness, the morals don't come until after various plot strands have come together in an all-hell-breaks-loose climax.  Some of the more outlandish climactic set pieces include a phony drug bust involving a bunch of male strippers in phony cop outfits; George Sr. attempting to escape from a Christmas pageant while dressed as a character in a painting; Michael and Gob wrestling ineptly over a woman while Buster desperately tries to get himself punched in the face; and Gob's failed attempts to trick the family's accountant into thinking he's killed a stripper.Accompanying the twenty-two episodes of this first season are a bevy of extras, almost all of which are worth watching.  Most notably, we get an extended version of the pilot (complete with dirty words), commentaries that consist largely of the cast members ripping on each other and making off-color remarks, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and some loving tributes from TV Land.  On the whole, the special features provide a great deal of insight into how the show's unique look and feel were created, how the cast was selected and how they interact, how reams of material are cut down to one 20-minute-or-so episode, and scads of other random information.  Suffice to say that Mitchell Hurwitz, the show's creator, is clearly one very smart man.With the Simpsons still in decline and Family Guy yet to return, I think I can safely go out on a limb and proclaim Arrested Development the best show on network TV right now.  By defying virtually every television convention known to man, Hurwitz & Co. have created something truly innovative and warped, which is no small task with cable channels relentlessly pushing the envelope.  Unfortunately, shows this original and challenging to the viewer don't typically last too long, but here's hoping this one proves to be an exception.  So far the second season has been almost as good as this one, so if there's any justice Arrested Development will succeed in catching on where previous excellent Fox series like Andy Richter Controls the Universe and Undeclared failed."	5.0	Life among the rich and stupid	2005-01-03	36	33	3

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A28GH50N72KW7E	"William A. Schooling ""Al Schooling"""	In Nov., Fox cut the episode order for season three from 22 to 13 episodes.  This means that the show will likely be cancled.  The only 2 hopes for the show now are 1) another network will pick it up.  There is some rumour that NBC are interested to pair with The Office.  My hope is that HBO will pick it up to pair with Curb Your Enthusiasm or Extras.  2)Like Family Guy, dvd sales are enough to justify ordering more episodes.  With that in mind, here's what I propose, if you love this show, make the Season 1 & Season 2 dvd sets the only gifts you give your friends (who would enjoy the show, but may or may not watch it already) this christmas.  For the unnitiated, give season one, or if you can afford it, give both.  The sets are both reasonably priced & stand up to multiple viewings.  A fine dvd set indeed.So save this show.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A2DB6HD06L4M84	"William Daniels III ""D"""	Arrested Development is not for everyone.  If you're the type that thinks 2 1/2 men is hilarious, you probably will not like this show.  This show is often described as a &#34;smart&#34; show, which on the surface is kind of ironic referring to a show that jokes about homosexuality, drug use, and incest, but it is true.If you're going to watch and enjoy this show, you have to watch.  I mean really watch.  You can't post on Facebook, play Angry Birds, and read a book at the same time.  This is a show that requires a commitment to each episode, but you will be rewarded.  There's no laugh track, no (completely) obvious plots, and that's a good thing.The writing is the strength of Arrested Development.  The dialogue is what makes it so wonderful.  It moves quickly, and is very self-referential.The acting is also very strong.  Basically every actor has continued to be successful.  It's really quite amazing that they were able to get the cast together for a 4th season.You will also not be able to get all the jokes on the first viewing.  You truly need to watch the entire series, give it a little time, and then watch it again.  You'll be amazed at things that were foreshadowed months ahead of time.This is truly one of my top 5 favorite (comedy) shows of all time (for the record, I would include The Simpsons, MASH, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Community to round out my top 5), and may be the best.  It also stands up with the great non-comedies, like The Wire, The Sopranos, and others.  Watch it already!	5.0	Possibly the greatest show of all time	2013-02-19	1	0	1

If you find it and could not get with it right away you have to stay with it 'cos the running jokes and characterisations will come back to you with a vengeance: the thing that helps with the humor is the editing. You never are quite sure what's next in line as far as the plot goes, but a few dialog riffs lets you know whats happening. Bateman plays straightman to almost everyone... from his Mother and Dad to his kid George Michael. The series is a sum of all the parts of original comedic performances that is destined to become as important as some of the best sitcoms in the history of TV.

B0002PYS7Y	Arrested Development: Season 1	A1MDJN25C9AUFF	"Zach ""Zach"""	"(...)ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT begins at George Bluth Sr.'s retirement party that takes place on a yacht. He is set to announce the heir to his company. His middle son, Michael, whole-heartedly believes he will be picked by his father. He even acts as if he knows he will be picked. When George Bluth Sr. is about to announce his predecessor, he decides to start off with a description of them. The description begins with the norm, and Michael grows more anxious with every word. Suddenly, George Sr.'s words to describe his predecessor become ""the sexiest person I know."" Confused by his father's choice of words to describe him with, Michael witnesses as the job is passed on to George Sr.'s wife, Lucille.Michael is torn inside. Then the police come to arrest his father, for using the company's money as ""his own personal piggy bank.""Part of why ARRESTED is so great is the brilliant characters, all played to perfection by their actors. Leading off the cast is Michael Bluth, played by Jason Batman, he seems to be the only sane one in the family. In fact he IS the only sane one in the family. When the Bluth family assets are frozen, he is the only one that can recognize the seriousness of the problem. Everyone else in the family can't seem to be able to stop spending money, even when it isn't theirs.His father, George Sr., is head of the Bluth Company, and besides doing the crimes that he was charged with during the initial arrest, he might have committed some ""light"" treason. Look for scenes where Michael notices similarities with model houses in Iraq and his, and also look for when George Sr. regards a box marked ""H. Maddas."" It won't seem like anything important at the time, in fact it's made to look so unimportant at the time you may miss it completely, but the truth will unveil itself in the last episode of season 1.Michael's mother, Lucille, is best described as what Michael and his siblings playfully call her: ""a horrible mother"" and ""old thing."" She has a bad habit of pampering her youngest son, Buster, except for when she gets angry with him, and she'll take that anger so far as to adopt a child from Korea just to show Buster up (she even enlists Buster in the army in season 2).Michael's older brother, George Oscar Bluth, who is referred to as ""GOB"" (jobe) is a charming though messed up magician, who started a group called the ""Magician's Alliance"" that punishes magicians for revealing their secret. He is kicked out of the Alliance that he started when it is reported on the news that he tried to hide his father in one of his magic show props in which people are supposed to disappear. The newscaster proceeds to reveal the secret behind the trick.Michael's twin sister, Lindsay, used to be a major demonstrator, but now just buys things with money that's not hers and pretends to care so not to look bad. She's a bit over-confident about her looks.Michael's younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth is perhaps the most sheltered child in history, and has no idea what the real world is like-and now he's over twenty. He's a momma's boy, to the end. In one scene, when Michael and GOB are talking about how evil their mom Lucille is, Buster adds his opinion in the conversation with ""Yeah, isn't mom great?"" He's a warning sign for all parents not willing to let go of their child.Michael's twin sister Lindsay's husband, Tobias, is also a major demonstrator which is the reason why he and Lindsay met and why she fell in love with him. Now she's not really in love with him. And methinks Tobias is somewhat gay. He always seems to get involved with the gay crowed, like when he writes a book called ""The Man inside Me"" in which, in order to ""avoid confusion"" he makes all the gender pronouns masculine. He and Lindsay have indeed had some marital problems, and have agreed to see other people, while still seeing each other when they crawl in bed (and that even comes to a stop). Tobias is also a ""never-nude."" Which is exactly what it sounds like-he's never nude.Michael's son, George-Michael, isn't exactly sheltered, but something like it. To avoid having the Bluth family add another disgrace to the world, Michael tries his best not to corrupt George-Michael's heart. This goes to such an extent that George-Michael, now in his teens, is pretty much a light-hearted moron with a crush on his cousin (that subsides in season 2 when he starts to date the notoriously dull ""Ann"").Who is George-Michael's cousin? That would be Lindsay and Tobias' rebel daughter Maeby, whose goal in life is to do exactly the opposite of whatever her parents do. She provides a pretty good contrast to the do-gooder George-Michael.The writing in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is some of, if not THE, best writing in a sitcom. The characters are more twisted and vibrant than in pretty much every other show on Earth. The humorous narration by the former ANDY GRIFFITH and HAPPY DAYS star Ron Howard provides passages from scene to scene, often so funny that he steals the spotlight from the actors, especially in the ""On the next ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"" bits.Overall, I'd have to say ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT may be the greatest sitcom of all time, at least top five. The small amount of viewers in no way relates to the amount of laughs, and if you haven't started watching yet, I urge you to start!
